		<shortDescription>Brilliant from alarm bell to chopsticks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made. An example of the directing: When Candy (Jean Peters) starts going through her purse and notices her wallet is missing, an alarm goes off in the background in the building she's in -- as if it's an alarm going off in her head. It's not cartoon-like -- it's subtly woven into the background in a way that strikes you on a subconscious level until you've seen the film a few times and it just "clicks" that there's an alarm bell going off when she starts frantically going through her bag.Richard Widmark is way on top of his game as a smart-alec -- he's really great -- but the highlight performance of the film was the first scene for "Moe," the street peddler/informer, played by Thelma Ritter. Later, in her apartment, you are not seeing a movie -- you're seeing a real person. I've never seen anyone "act" so real I felt like I was looking into a real room until Ritter's performance -- right down to the way her hair stuck out a bit when she removed her hat. About a million other things just *worked,* from the way Lightning Louie picks up money with his chopsticks to the way Candy's jewelry clicks when she flicks Moe's hand away from her brooch, to the way Moe gets the dollars and change from the police captain across the FBI guy's chest -- and even the way the captain opens his filing cabinet, like he's been doing it in that way in that room for many years. "Pickup On South Street" is detailed moves (directing) with consummate performances (acting) and superb now-nostalgic visuals of the day, such as the panel truck, the boards leading to the shack out on the water, the dumbwaiter, -- and the unforgettable place Skip stashes his pocket pickings. Wonderful stuff."Pickup On South Street" is also one of the few movies where, even though the characters aren't perfect, you do care about them -- perhaps because they have been somewhat branded by their pasts in ways that are hard to escape: Skip as a "three-time loser" and Candy as a youngish woman who has "knocked around" a lot. When these people behave a little more badly than you'd expect, it's in sort of novel ways that make it seem you're looking in at people you'd never otherwise imagine -- and yet you know that they are possible because the actors make them so recognizably human.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Everyone Has A Price"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this excellent Twentieth-Century Fox film-noir, the metropolis is a labyrinth of despair in which scavengers and predators survive by living off one another. Brooding cityscapes lower over puny humanity in bleak expressionist symbolism.A prostitute has her purse snatched on the subway. It contains a microfilm, and a communist spy ring will go to any lengths to recover it. Two parallel investigations unfold as both spies and cops hunt down the precious information.Anti-hero pickpocket Skip McCoy is played with scornful assurance by Richard Widmark. He knows the cops to be his moral equals and intellectual inferiors, so he taunts them: "Go on," he says to captain Dan Tiger (Murvyn Vye), "drum up a charge. Throw me in. You've done it before." In this pitiless world, the cops are just one more gang on the streets. Just as Candy the hooker bribes Lightning Louie to get a lead, so the police are busy paying stool pigeons for information.It is hard to believe that when Widmark made this film he was already in early middle age. The 39-year-old star, coming to the end of his contract with Fox, plays the upstart Skip McCoy with the irreverent brashness of a teenager. Today it may not be acceptable for the romantic lead to punch his love interest into unconsciousness then revive her by sloshing beer in her face, but by the mores of the period it signified toughness - and Candy, after all, is a fallen woman.Jean Peters is radiant as Candy. Here, right in the middle of her five-year burst of B-movie fame, she is beautiful and engaging as the whore with the golden heart. She is the story's victim, a martyr to her beauty as much as anything else. She means well, but is constantly being manipulated by cynical men - Joey, Skip and the cops.The real star of this movie is New York. Haunting urban panoramas and snidering subway stations offer a claustrophobic evocation of the city as a living, malevolent force. Like maggots in a rotting cheese, human figures scurry through the city's byways. Elevators, subway turnstiles, sidewalks - even a dumb waiter act as conduits for the flow of corrupt humanity. People cling to any niche that affords safety: Moe has her grimy rented room, Skip his tenebrous shack on the Hudson River. As the characters move and interact, they are framed by bridge architecture, or lattices of girders, or are divided by hanging winch tackle. The personality of the city is constantly imposing itself. The angles and crossbeams of the wharf timbers are an echo of the gridiron street plan, and the card-index cabinets in the squadroom mimic the Manhattan skyline. When Joey's exit from the subway is barred, it is as if the steel sinews of the city are ensnaring him.A surprising proportion of this film is shot in extreme close-up. Character drives the plot, as it should, and the close-ups are used to augment character. When Skip interrogates Candy, the close-up captures the sexual energy between them, belying the hostility of Skip's words. Jean Peters' beauty is painted in light, in exquisite soft focus close-ups. The device is also employed to heighten the tension. The opening sequence, the purse snatch, contains no dialogue: the drama relies entirely on close-up for its powerful effect.Snoopers, and snoopers upon snoopers, populate the film. Moe (Thelma Ritter) makes a living as an informant, and her place in the hierarchy is accepted, even by her victims. When Skip observes, "she's gotta eat", he is chanting a recurring refrain. Just as 'straight' New Yorkers peddle lamb chops or lumber, the Underworld traffics in the commodity of information.And yet even the stool pigeons are superior to Joey and his communist friends. Joey's feet on Moe's bed symbolise a transgression of the most basic moral code. Joey is beyond the pale. Moe will not trade with Joey, even to preserve her life: " ... even in our crummy business, you gotta draw the line somewhere.""Pick-Up" was made in the depths of the Cold War. Richard Nixon had just been chosen as the Republican vice-presidential candidate, having made his name with his phoney Alger Hiss expose - bogus communist microfilm and all. The McCarthy show trials were a daily reality. We see the cops in the movie inveigh against "the traitors who gave Stalin the A-bomb".New York can be seen as a giant receptacle in which human offal cheats, squeals and murders. Containers form a leitmotif throughout the film. Moe carries her trade mark box of ties, and candy's purse, container of the microfilm, is the engine of the plot. Skip keeps his only possessions in a submerged crate, symbolising his secretive street-wisdom. The paupers' coffins, moving down the Hudson on a barge, are containers of just one more cargo being shifted around the pitiless metropolis.The film is a masterpiece of composition. Candy is shown above the skulking Skip on the rickety gangway of the shack, signifying her moral ascendancy. When the gun is placed on the table, the extreme perspective makes it look bigger than Candy - violence is beginning to dwarf compassion. The lovers are eclipsed by the shadow of a stevedore's hook, reminding us that their love is neither pure nor absolute, but contingent upon the whims of the sinister city. Enyard the communist is a shadow on a wall, or a disembodied puff of cigarette smoke. He is like the lone alley cat amongst the garbage - a predatory phantom of the night. Camera shots from under taxi hoods, inside newspaper kiosks and through the bars of hospital beds constantly reinforce in us the awareness that we are all trapped in the metropolis. We are civilisation's mulch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe Fuller's best film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best of the seven Sam Fuller movies that I've seen (including Park Row, Run of the Arrow, Verboten!, Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, The Big Red One, and this film), Pickup on South Street counts as one of the best film noirs. It represents Fuller at his most controlled. I like him when he's out of control, of course, but nearly everything in Pickup is perfect. The film is absolutely beautiful. Richard Widmark stars as a pickpocket who steals some microfilm that was meant to go to communist spies. Jean Peters plays the woman who was carrying the film for her boyfriend, played by Richard Kiley. Peters is forced to find Widmark and get it back. She finds him through a stool pigeon played by Thelma Ritter. Widmark and Peters are attracted to each other, which changes Peters loyalties (that, and the fact that she learns she's working for communists; the Cold War stuff is really interesting). The love story is done a little quickly and not entirely believable, but it's not so bad that it harms the film (unlike Fuller's previous film, Park Row). Richard Widmark is great. This must be one of his best roles, but I'm not so familiar with his career that I can say that for sure. Thelma Ritter gives the most memorable performance. Her role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance, and her final scene in this film is as touching as any you will find in the cinema. I will never forget that. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grifters, B-girls, secret microfilm: great ingredients for film noir...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Samuel Fuller concocts a brilliant visual set-up to this gritty story: cocky pickpocket unwittingly lifts some microfilm from a woman's purse; it turns out she's a courier for the Communists, and now they are both being watched by the police. The noir formula in all its 1950s glory--before the ingredients became clichés--including waterfront locales, floozies, saxophones on the soundtrack, and one hell of a climactic fistfight. Performances by Richard Widmark and Jean Peters are right on target, and the smart, sharp script is quite colorful. Fabulous Thelma Ritter received an Oscar nomination for knockout supporting role as a "professional stoolie". Exciting, atmospheric, tough as nails. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thelma Ritter kicks butt in Pickup on South Street</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the screenplay, Pickup on South Street is a tough, brutal, well made film about a pickpocket (Richard Widmark) who inadvertently aquires top-secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents. Also involved are Jean Peters as a tough broad who is used as a courier by her evil ex-lover Richard Kiley. It's film-noir at its best and although the performances are very good its grand character actress Thelma Ritter who steals the movie. As Moe a weary street peddler selling neck ties (and who also sells information) she is terrific in a role that brought her another Oscar nomination. Its amazing that Miss Ritter was nominated six times for an Academy Award and she never won. This should have been the role that copped it for her!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this last night on TV (HBO). I have to admit, that the tension in this movie was unsurpassed by most other FN era movies. I loved the way Chip would be all calm one moment and then VIOLENT the very next moment. It was classic. Ahh yes. The dames, the villians, the cigars and thuggish cops! It has it all. This movie delivered all the goods to me. I especially loved the way they mixed communism into the plot, very common for this era of movie. Very daring also since blacklisting was popular in those days. I rate this movie one of the best I have seen in the FN genre!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is quite the special little gem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and then there gets released this movie no one has ever heard of and got shot in a very short time with very little money and resource but everybody goes crazy about and turns out to be a surprisingly great one. This also happened in the '50's with quite a few little movies, that not a lot of people have ever heard of. There are really some unknown great surprising little jewels from the '50's that are worth digging out. "Panic in the Streets" is another movie like that that springs to the mind. Both are movies that aren't really like the usual genre flicks from their time and are also made with limited resources.I was really surprised at how much I ended up liking this movie. It was truly a movie that got better and better as it progressed. Like all 'old' movies it tends to begin sort of slow but once you get into the story and it's characters you're in for a real treat with this movie.The movie has a really great story that involves espionage, though the movie doesn't start of like that. It begins as this typical crime-thriller with a touch of film-noir to it. But "Pickup on South Street" just isn't really a movie by the numbers so it starts to take its own directions pretty soon on. It ensures that the movie remains a surprising but above all also really refreshing one to watch.I also really liked the characters within this movie. None of them are really good guys and they all of their flaws and weaknesses. Really humane. It also especially features a great performance from Thelma Ritter, who even received a well deserved Oscar nomination for. It has really got to be one of the greatest female roles I have ever seen.Even despite its somewhat obvious low budget this is simply one great, original, special little movie that deserves to be seen by more!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific film-noir political thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film. All aspects of the film were top notch including the most important, for me anyway, the screenplay and the acting. This is definitely one of Richard Widmark's strongest roles. He is totally convincing in his performance. Just out of curiosity, imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum might have tackled this role. This is my first exposure to Jean Peter's work that I can remember. She impressed so much here that I will definitely be on the lookout for her other work. Thelma Ritter, in an unglamourous role, deserved the Oscar nomination she received for playing the informant. This film works on every level. The black and white photography is perfectly appropriate and the story hooks the viewer right from the beginning. Widmark and Peters have great chemistry in their difficult romance. Strongly recommended, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Skip McCoy is a three time loser pick pocket, unable to curb his instincts back on the street, he picks the purse of Candy on a subway train. What he doesn't realise is that Candy is carrying top secret microfilm, microfilm that is of high interest to many many organisations.Director Samuel Fuller has crafted an exceptional drama set amongst the seedy underworld of New York City. Communist spies and shady government operatives all blend together to make Pickup On South Street a riveting viewing from first minute to the last. Based around a Dwight Taylor story called Blaze Of Glory, Fuller enthused this adaptation with heavy set political agenda, something that many at the time felt was over done, but to only focus on its anti communist leanings is doing it a big disservice.Digging a little deeper and you find characters as intriguing as any that Fuller has directed, the main protagonist for one is the hero of the piece, a crook and a shallow human being, his heroics are not born out of love for his country, they are born out of his sheer stubborn streak. It's quite an achievement that Fuller has crafted one of the best anti heroes of the 50s, and i'm sure he was most grateful to the performance of Richard Widmark as McCoy, all grin and icy cold heart, his interplay with the wonderful Jean Peters as Candy is excellent, and is the films heart. However it is the Oscar nominated Thelma Ritter who takes the acting honours, her Moe is strong and as seedy as the surrounding characters, but there is a tired warmth to her that Ritter conveys majestically.It's a B movie in texture but an A film in execution, Pickup On South Street is a real classy and entertaining film that is the best of its most intriguing director. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS. Sam Fuller, as someone pointed out, was usually a better interview subject than a director. What a life he led. There's an early photo of him as a newspaperman, feet on his desk, hat tilted back on his head, smoking a cigarette -- straight out of "The Front Page." Then, column two: the U.S. Army's First Division, the Big Red One, and World War II with experiences that he could never forget. For years afterward he could not hear a car backfire, or a knock on a door, without jumping out of his chair. Column three: movie director.The French adored him. His style was called "primitive" by some, and in fact it was down to earth and unsophisticated, rather like an article in, well, not the New York Times but maybe the New York Daily News. Or the Post. Well, not the Post. All of his movies moved fast, the way Fuller himself spoke. Everything seemed to tumble over itself trying to get on screen with little time left for contemplation.I haven't seen all of his movies, but I believe he produced two unusually good ones: "Merrill's Marauders" and "Pick Up on South Street." Too many of the others come out like comic books. This one ha several excellent things going for it. First, a fine cast. Richard Widmark as Skip McCoy, the cannon, is good in a way that combines his insouciant charm and the brutality he showed in his early work. Jean Peters too is convincing in the tarty part of Candy. (Great name.) She's more animated here than in any other of her films. (In "Apache," I believe you could add up all of her lines AND her expressions on the fingers of one hand.) Fuller got a good performance out of her here. "What's the matter, Joey? You're talking' like it's HOT." She wears very heavy makeup. Her black eyelashes are the size of window awnings, even when she's bundled up in a hospital bed. She even trounces around in a sluttish way. Richard Kiley is an actor I've always admired. He's quite handsome in a blandly dark and sensitive-looking way, and his range was considerable: a villain here, a humanist there, a narrator of poetry on PBS. And then there is Thelma Ritter, who is sui generis, at the top of her form as the cynical wisecracking urbanite, perhaps more subdued here, and given a more complex part. She didn't make that many movies but she was a beacon in each one.The plot? Let me see. Widmark, the expert pickpocket, boosts a roll of film from the innocent Jean Peters' pocketbook. Neither of them know it, but the film is a MacGuffin containing some kind of secret microfilm to be passed on to the Commies. Widmark's response when he learns this, as the cops try to pressure him into cooperating: a smile of disbelief and, "You wavin' the flag at ME?" (He's great.) Most of the movie is concerned with Kiley's attempts to retrieve the film before his bosses off him, and before the cops find out what's going on. People routinely betray one another, then forgive. They also casually brutalize one another. Jean Peters especially gets knocked around. First she's clipped on the jaw and is knocked out at her first meeting with Skip. (The movie follows the usual short-cuts: one bop and the recipient is out cold for as long as the plot requires.) The first thing Widmark does is grin widely and go through her purse, then he takes a swig of beer out of the bottle before pouring some on her face to wake her up. (As I said, all the conventions are followed because it just saves time.) But she really gets bashed by Joey, the Commie who is trying to squeeze some intel out of her. She is so vulnerable. Just out of the tub, still wet, wrapped in a white robe with a hood covering her hair. Fuller holds on the beating with a single shot and a shaky camera as the two of them reel around the room and Peters is bounced off walls and caromes into bookcases, and is finally shot and wounded. It's one of the few moments when the viewer is gripped, because the drama is not undercut by irony. The other scene involves Thelma Ritter. Jean Peters falls much too quickly for Widmark, though. You can't help noticing it because by their second meeting she is hopelessly devoted to him. It's all the more odd because Widmark can't seem to keep himself from belting her around and ridiculing her at every opportunity. Of course this sort of masculine behavior may appeal to some women. It's always worked for me. A couple of unprovoked clips on the jaw and they worship you.How does Fuller handle all this? With aplomb. The production values don't shoot out the lights. The non-electrified shack that Widmark lives in could have been given some real atmosphere, but as it is it's nothing more than a perfunctory set, with a "Bait and Tackle" sign on the outside. What appears to be the Brooklyn Bridge can be glimpsed through the window (an obvious photo), which means that the owner of the shack used to sell fishing gear on the East River, from which nobody could pull anything but porgy with cholera sauce. Fuller ignores all this and zips through the movie headlong, the way a reporter might try to bang out an article under a deadline. Sometimes the approach works, and sometimes it doesn't. Here, it does. See it if you get the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated Film-Noir with a Espionage Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New York, the pickpocket Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) steals a wallet in the purse of a woman named Candy (Jean Peters) in the subway. His action is witnessed by FBI Agent Zara (Willis B. Bouchey) but Skip escapes from the wagon with the wallet. When Candy discovers that she was stolen, she returns to the house of her former lover Joey (Richard Kiley) that is worried about the incident. Meanwhile Zara goes to the police station and asks Captain Dan Tiger (Williams Murvyn Vye) to identify the pickpockets in that area. He explains that he was following Candy that would deliver a microfilm to the chief of a communist spy ring. Captain Tiger summons the old informer Moe (Thelma Ritter) that sells the identity and address of Skip. Candy also seeks out Moe trying to find the pickpocket that stole her wallet. Meanwhile Skip finds the microfilm and learns how valuable it is to the communists. Candy also discovers that Joey is communist and is using her in a treason act and she falls in love with Skip. Soon a cat and mouse game among Skip, the police department and the spies begins. "Pickup on South Street" is a dated film-noir with a espionage story directed by Samuel Fuller. Richard Widmark is perfect in the role of a scum and shows a wonderful chemistry with Jean Peters. The choreography of the fight between Skip and Joey is amazing. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Anjo do Mal" ("Evil Angel")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dense and sharp but far too contrived.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Samuel Fuller is one of those directors who's rough around the edges but always has a great drive to the story, even if it can sometimes lack a certain satisfying point. Here, in his film-noir, Pickup On South Street, it's a sharp, small scale and dense film, drenched in the noir atmosphere but with an even darker smirk than the classic Bogart noirs. It's highlight is the great network of characters, each very developed and dimensional, with suitably radiant performances, especially from the deservedly Oscar nominated Thelma Ritter. Each character has their flaws and qualities in equal measure and it's a joy to watch them interact. However, it does abuse its MacGuffin (a Communist film strip) for political purposes rather than using it to scale the small story into something wider and contrivances, annoyances and lack of relatable characters as well as an anti-climax after plenty of potential for something sophisticated knock it down a notch. It's still a great film that's worth watching.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Secrets In The Subway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pickup On South Street" is a high speed drama about a small time criminal who suddenly finds himself embroiled in the activities of a group of communists. The action is presented in a very direct and dynamic style and the momentum is kept up by means of some brilliant editing. The use of a wide variety of different camera angles and effective close-ups also contribute to the overall impression of constant motion and vitality. Samuel Fuller's style of directing and the cinematography by Joseph MacDonald are excellent and there are many scenes which through their composition and lighting produce a strong sense of mood and atmosphere.Ace pickpocket and repeat offender Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) gets into deep water when he steals a wallet from a young woman named Candy (Jean Peters) on the New York subway. She was being used by her ex-boyfriend Joey (Richard Kiley) to make a delivery to one of his contacts in a communist organisation and unknown to her, she was carrying US Government secrets recorded on microfilm. Two FBI agents had been following Candy and witnessed the theft. One of the agents continues to tail her back to Joey's apartment and the other, Zara (Willis Bouchey), visits Police Captain Dan Tiger (Murvyn Vye). Zara explains that the FBI has been following Candy for some months as part of their pursuit of the ringleader of a communist group.In order to identify the pickpocket, Tiger calls in a "stoolie" called Moe (Thelma Ritter) who after being given a precise description of the "cannon's" method of working makes a list of eight possible suspects. Once Tiger sees Skip's name on the list he's immediately convinced that he's the man that they need to track down and he sends two detectives to arrest him. When Skip is brought into Tiger's office, Zara tells him about the microfilm and Tiger offers to drop any charges if he'll co-operate with the investigation. Skip is flippant and arrogant. He clearly doesn't trust Tiger and denies all knowledge of the theft on the subway.Joey orders Candy to find out who stole the microfilm and then retrieve it. Candy pays Moe for Skip's address and when Skip returns from being questioned by Tiger, he finds Candy searching his home and knocks her unconscious before stealing her money. When she recovers, Skip demands payment of $25,000 for the microfilm. She tells Joey about Skip's demand and Joey's boss gives him a gun and orders him to recover the microfilm by the following evening.Skip and Candy are attracted to each other and it's because of their uneasy, developing relationship that a means evolves by which they are able to shake off the attentions of the police. It soon becomes apparent, however, that resolving matters with the communist gang will only be achieved by more direct action.The depictions of Skip, Candy and Moe as characters that inhabit a seedy world in which they are forced to face considerable risks on a daily basis are powerful and compelling.Moe's work as a police informer is dependent on her knowledge of the people in her community but also those people know what she does and any one of them could seek their revenge at any time. She appears to be cunning and streetwise but also has her vulnerable side as she describes herself as "an old clock running down" and saves money to be able to have a decent burial in an exclusive cemetery in Long Island. Her belief that "every buck has a meaning of its own" leads her to sell any information regardless of danger, friendships or principles and yet there is one occasion where she refuses and this proves fatal. Thelma Ritter's performance certainly merited the Oscar nomination she earned for her role.Skip is a violent criminal with no concern for his victims and having already been convicted three times in the past, lives under the constant threat of being jailed for life if convicted again. Despite this, he still continues with his criminal activities and strangely, is merely philosophical when Moe betrays his whereabouts and then later, he even ensures that Moe receives the type of burial she valued so highly. Candy is an ex-hooker and someone whose activities constantly put her in peril but behind her hardened exterior a warmer side gradually becomes more evident. Widmark and Peters are both perfect for their roles and like Ritter portray the different facets of their personalities with great style and conviction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tough and compelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is yet another gritty and compelling film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s. This minimalist and fast-working director has something unusual for his earlier films--a cast with some stars. Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Richard Kiley star in this film about a group of Communist agents who are trying to sneak secrets out of America--and they'll stop at nothing to succeed.The film starts with Peters on a subway car being watched by federal agents. They know she is a link in a long espionage chain. Unknown to everyone is the wild card in the equation--a small-time pickpocket (Widmark) is also on the train and he manages to steal the secrets that Peters is carrying. Widmark thinks it's just another purse he's ransacked--only later does he realize the seriousness of what he's stolen. Now it's Widmark on his own--with Commies and the FBI hot on his trail.Widmark and the rest are exceptional and the film is gripping from start to finish. Although she didn't get top billing, a special mention should be made of Thelma Ritter. This supporting actress had perhaps the performance of her lifetime as a stool pigeon. Seldom was she given this much of a chance to act and I was impressed by her ability to play a broken down and sad old lady.As far as the script and directing go, they are very good--but with one small exception. At first, I loved the way Widmark and Peters interacted. It's one of the few times on film you'll see a woman punched square in the mouth! Now THAT'S tough. Later, inexplicably, they become amazingly close--too close to be believable. Still, with so much great drama and such an effective Noir-like film, this can be overlooked. See this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last film noir I saw was Pickup on South Street (1953), directed by cult figure (and idolised by the likes of Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut) Samuel Fuller, this is a biting, hard film noir, starring Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter.The story is thus: Skip McCoy (Widmark), a pickpocket who steals a wallet belonging to Candy (Peters) in the subway and contains on microfilm, government secrets (an excellent "MacGuffin" as Hitchcock would call it). She was given it by her ex-boyfriend, a communist, Joey (Richard Kiley). This sets off a chain of events and both the spies and the police want McCoy.The photography is a real highlight in this film. The Academy Award Nominated cinematographer Joseph MacDonald shoots in atmospheric black and white and Fuller loads the motion picture with his trademark long takes. The acting too, especially Widmark and Ritter as Moe, a woman who sells information, is lean and tough. The only letdown is the Communist-bashing heavy script, which holds more than a few lines of bombastic dialogue (Moe: "What do I know about commies? Nothing; I just know I don't like them", I recalled this from memory, so it may not be exactly right) that makes it a product of its time. But the skillful direction helps to make up for it. It is still a very fine film that would have been even better if it had not been for the screenplay that is well worth anyone's time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pickup on South Street (Samuel Fuller, 1953) ? Former tabloid reporter Samuel Fuller knew his way around a grabby intro and Pickup starts with a classic: a wordless subway sequence that chucks us right into the story. Three-time loser and two-bit pickpocket Richard Widmark lifts a purse from unwitting commie mule Jean Peters, unaware he's nabbed a strip of microfiche containing state secrets. The commies want him. The feds want him. And him? Well, he wants 25 grand. But as the net tightens, Widmark finds Peters is sticking ? and sticking her neck out ? causing him to rethink his nihilistic worldview.From his explosive arrival as a giggling psycho in the tepid noir Kiss of Death, through Yellow Sky and Night in the City, to this slab of murky cool, Widmark was the archetypal anti-hero. An obnoxious smart-alec. A bilious hothead. A real lowlife. In Pickup, Fuller periodically subverts that image, allowing us to see the central 'cannon' as the women in his life do. "He got under your skin too?" aged information peddler Mo (the peerless Thelma Ritter) asks Peters. Indeed, the relationship between Widmark's cocky, pathetic outsider and Peters' smitten dupe is one of the most affecting on celluloid. Their early exchanges fairly sizzle, crackling with noirish badinage. That heady, hazy, sweaty lust ? articulated in some memorable close-ups ? then turns to tenderness, as Widmark realises the girl isn't playing any angles, she just loves him.Great as the leads are, though, it's Ritter who walks off with the film, delivering an unforgettable characterisation as a police informer whose sole ambition is to avoid a pauper's grave. Her heartbreaking monologue to the commie hood who's come to bump her off is as good a piece of screen acting as you'll ever see.Fuller fans continue to bicker over his greatest work, but for me, this is the one, an untouchable fusion of humanist romance and Cold War thriller that provides a vivid evocation of New York City, depicted here as a festering hellhole. The director's screenplay seems to have been fashioned in the gutter, with wall-to-wall slang (you'll pick it up) that casts the viewer into this foul, fascinating, fully-realised world. That goes for the direction, too, as Fuller's camera swoons into kisses and lingers on telling details, the whole movie slipping into the shadowy palette of film noir as we visit Widmark's waterside hole.The anti-commie rhetoric is admittedly one-dimensional, but that's hardly unique for the period, and it's employed in a way that works dramatically. Less satisfying is the slightly abrupt action climax, ending with a spot of face-pummelling that recalls Dick Powell's meltdown in the 1945 noir Cornered. The sequence isn't bad, but it's a little uninspired and not very well executed. Perhaps it merely pales beside the film's real calling cards: a pair of unbearably tense set pieces that see Widmark going about his daily business.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pickup on South Street</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I had finished this film, I do admit I asked myself why it featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I can see good reasons to place it. Basically recently released crook Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) is back to his old habits when he pickpockets the purse of Candy (Jean Peters) in a crowded subway. Amongst the stuff inside the purse is a top secret microfilm containing US government documents about a new chemical formula, that Candy would have delivered to Communists for her ex-boyfriend Joey (Richard Kiley). Candy finds the location of the microfilm through police informer Moe Williams (Oscar nominated Thelma Ritter), and to get it back Candy tries to seduce Skip. She fails to get the microfilm back, instead falling in love with Skip, who is being chased on two sides, the federal agents and police on one, and Candy (before) and Joey and their associates on the other. The desperate agents find Moe and kill her for helping out the enemies, and they savagely beat Candy, so Skip gets his own back on the agent responsible in a brutal subway fight. In the end, Skip makes what is really the right decision by giving the microfilm to the right people instead of selling it for money, some kind of loyalty thing. Also starring Murvyn Vye as Captain Dan Tiger, Willis B. Bouchey as Zara and Milburn Stone as Detective Winoki. The performances are all good, especially Oscar nominated Ritter who is most excellent in her scene before being killed, the fight scenes are actually more convincing than many classic films I have seen before, it is certainly a film noir you should see. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pickup on South Street" is an unremarkable film noir, director Sam Fuller's material now too well worn to be of much interest.Like most noirs, the film begins with a great scene. We watch as pickpocket Skip McCoy lifts an envelope off a woman on a subway train. She's supposed to give the envelope (which contains a microfilm) to a couple of Russian spies, but what she doesn't know is that The FBI knows this and have been tailing her for some time. The rest of the film is one big chase, as the FBI, McCoy and the Russians try to outsmart one another.The movie exists entirely within the criminal underworld. There are no good guys or bad guys, Fuller prefering to paint in uniform shades of grey. Informants and criminals are relied upon by the police, and the cops don't walk about moralising or spouting gimmicky cop speak. The character's all emit a nice sense of professionalism.But despite its attempts at realism, "Pickup on South Street" is ultimately too far-fetched to be taken seriously. Rather than give us an honest look at a Pickpocket's life, Fuller gives us a silly thriller, complete with Hitchcockian MacGuffin.6/10 - What was shocking back in the 50s now looks quite tame. What jolted audiences back in 1953 was McCoy's cavalier attitude. When the NYPD and FBI attempt to talk him into returning the microfilm, they appeal to his patriotism. "Do it for your country," they say. But McCoy replies with scorn: "Don't wave the flag at me!" Gasp! In 1953, this was quite shocking. Real life director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, personally found the moment very offensive. He called Fuller up on this very scene, and Fuller responded by saying that he was dealing with criminals, and wasn't going to avoid the truth. Of course nowadays this stuff is quite commonplace. Audiences are used to nasty criminals, and Skip McCoy is now hardly memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Day, Another Pocket Picked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You just never know what you're going to find when you surreptitiously reach into a man's pocket or a woman's purse. You might find microfilm containing valuable secrets. That's the premise of this 1953 espionage film noir, starring Richard Widmark as the sly pickpocket, Skip McCoy, who unknowingly interrupts an impending transfer of American military secrets, as he picks the purse of a beautiful courier (Jean Peters) standing in a crowded New York subway. The cops are on hand to nab the commie to whom the microfilm is directed. But McCoy fouls everything up, and the rest of the film has the courier, her boyfriend, the commies, and the cops trying to get the microfilm that McCoy has stolen.It's an interesting premise, but dated. Although microfilm still exists, its value as a transfer devise for military secrets has been greatly reduced by computer technology. But in its time, the film had a credible story that I am sure resonated with audiences in post WWII America.Espionage is the cover story, but the real heart of "Pickup On South Street" is its gritty portrayal of the grubby people who live on the underbelly of society. Except for the cops, everyone in this film is seedy and desperate, yet they have their peculiar charm and their own self defined morality. The cops' informant is an old lady named Moe (Thelma Ritter), street-savvy, but pitiful, poignant, and tired, trying to save up enough money to buy herself a decent burial plot.The film's B&amp;W lighting is delightfully noir. The acting is good, especially the performance of Thelma Ritter. And, as the film moves along, most of the characters change in ways that are not predictable. The film's background jazz score is appropriately tawdry and nondescript."Pickup On South Street" is a good choice for viewers who like moody 1940's film noir, and for fans of Widmark and Ritter. Though the story's premise is dated, the cinematic quality is quite high, and therefore the film justifies attention from serious movie buffs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great movie, but campy entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pickup on South Street is about a petty thief, Skip McCoy, who gets caught up in a spy ring desperately trying to recover two strips of microfilm that the thief stole. The movie is set in New York City and includes exterior location shots. The cinematography creates a somber and sinister mood, with many scenes filmed using dim light. The urban landscape is generally seedy, which corresponds with the kind of characters that populate the story. The principal character, Skip McCoy, is a cross between Slip Mahoney from The Bowery Boys and Charles Tatum, the flamboyant newspaperman, except that Skip is neither funny nor particularly bright. The idea of a petty thief and three-time loser trying to shake down a Communist spy ring stretches plausibility to the limit. Trying to appeal to his sense of patriotism is a waste of time. The character is simply too shallow to be taken seriously. All he wants is money. He is a nobody existing in a shack under a bridge, away from society. The only reason why anybody wants anything to do with him is because he has something that somebody wants, and even after he realizes that what he stole is something serious, his thinking remains incredibly myopic. Then there is Candy, the woman who falls in love with Skip. She is unbelievable. First, she falls in love with Skip, the man who victimizes her, and then tries to use her as go-between with the "Commies." Later she clobbers Skip over the head with a bottle, leaving him sprawled on the floor. Then Candy insists that she is not a Communist, even though she is a courier for a Communist spy ring, has in her possession stolen documents, and her boyfriend is a Communist. Finally, she is physically abused, not by one man, but by two, yet remains loyal to both. Given her nasty, conniving nature, she would have been more believable as someone who shakes down the spies. Regarding the boyfriend, Joey, his behavior is hysterical. A spy by necessity has to keep a low profile and maintain self-control but not in this movie. Here the spy is running around with a gun shooting people and attracting a lot of attention. Also, he seems too apolitical to be a communist. Is he really a spy? Then there is Moe, the woman informant who fronts as a street vendor selling ties. To believe that this woman, who makes Skip McCoy look mainstream, would have any information worth paying for is a stretch. At first, it seems that Moe is in the story for comic relief, but then she goes from being brash and cynical to maudlin and melodramatic, and she is not the lead character. Why should anyone care what she thinks? Moe would have been more believable as a pickpocket. Despite these anomalies, what makes the movie watchable is the terrific acting. Richard Widmark, Jean Peters, Thelma Ritter and Richard Kiley deliver strong performances. Thelma Ritter is especially impressive. The stunt doubles are impressive too. The movie too has a campy quality, especially in its exaggerated theatrics that seem to parody more serious works in the crime and spy genres, such as The Maltese Falcon in which the lead character also possesses a valuable object, or Sunset Boulevard in which the lead character also craves money. But in those movies, these characters have depth, which adds richness to the plot and makes the stories compelling works of drama. Although entertaining, Pickup on South Street does not rise up to that level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"How many times you been caught with your hand where it doesn't belong?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's a picture that epitomizes the noir genre, this one has to be one of the top contenders. It's got everything you need - seedy atmosphere, a stunning femme fatale, good guys, bad guys and ones you can't tell until they get into a jam, and Thelma Ritter as the icing on the cake with a street smart credibility that puts even the cops to shame. Throw in a Commie angle and you have a fairly stunning potboiler here, courtesy of Richard Widmark, Jean Peters, Richard Kiley and the aforementioned Ms. Ritter.Virtually every reviewer on this board goes into a description of the main plot, so I don't think it's necessary to go there. I'd just want to mention a couple of scenes that managed to blow me completely away. How about Skip McCoy (Widmark) belting the unsuspecting Candy (Peters) square in the jaw and putting her lights out? Followed up by that beer chaser. I believe that's what they used to call hardboiled back in the day. Then there's Moe Williams (Ritter) never giving an inch when Joey makes it known it's curtains. Classic. But the wildest was when Joey shoved Candy into the lamp and she bounced off into the bookcase. That looked a little too real to me and I had to wonder how they managed to pull that off.The film's not entirely perfect, like other viewers I found the romantic angle to come on too quickly and lack a semblance of credibility. As hustlers and con artists, it didn't make sense to me that McCoy and Candy would have been immediately attracted to each other romantically. In other ways, no doubt about it. But take the good with the bad and this is a pretty taut film that's a must for your noir library. You'll also marvel at a time when you could get a 'handsome men's suit' for only $14.50, a bargain that doesn't come along every day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty Noir from Fuller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pickup on South Street (1953) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Three time loser Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) picks the pocket of a woman (Jean Peters) and ends up with some film that contains information meant for some Communist. McCoy must try to avoid not only the police but the bad guys who are willing to stop at nothing to get the information back in their hands. This is an extremely well-made, intelligent and very gritty little gem that manages to contain some nice suspense, great performances and some excellent direction. The opening sequence as we get to see many of the principle characters for the first time is handles extremely well and really sets up the entire pacing and style that's going to follow. The showing of the pickpocket was handled very well and Widmark's coolness is certainly on display even though he doesn't say a single word. Fuller's great direction is also highlighted during this sequence as we really get a terrific atmosphere with the crowded subway and this feeling is something running through the entire film. You can also feel the seedy nature of the streets and especially everything around Widmark's house by the river. As for Widmark, he's terrific here and really manages to be charming, cool and collective. He certainly has no trouble getting into this role as it's clearly a character he was born to play. Most importantly is Widmark is smart enough to carry on everything that's happening in the film and this is a major plus in making us believe what we're seeing. Peters never gets enough credit but she too is excellent here and really sinks her teeth into the tough and loyal character. Richard Kiley turns in wonderful support as her nervous ex-husband and Murvyn Vye is terrific as the Captain. Thelma Ritter steals the film each time she's on-screen as the professional informant who will sell just about anything except for one thing. Fuller has remained somewhat of a legend due to his gritty films and this one here is certainly one of his best. It's certainly got enough action, drama and all around suspense for two movies and the excellent performances are just icing on the cake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) pick-pockets Candy's (Jean Peters) wallet which contains an important microfiche that is intended for the Communist cause. She is being followed by 2 federal agents that are waiting to pounce once she hands the microfiche over to her contact. However, Skip steals the purse on the subway under everyone's noses and so starts a hunt for him by both the police and Joey (Richard Kiley) and Candy who want the microfiche back. Skip can only be traced through Moe (Thelma Ritter) who sells information on criminals. It is made clear to Skip that what he has stolen is important and both sides want the film, but he intends to hold out for a high price. This leads to Joey hunting after him and a conflict between Joey and Jean, who has fallen in love with Skip. Joey has a deadline to deliver the microfiche to his boss. Its a well-acted film and it has a good beginning that gets you involved straight away. Its a bit unrealistic how Jean Peters immediately falls in love with Widmark, but this point is necessary as otherwise why would she later hold out from Joey. Its a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Few better openings than in that sweaty subway car, with Skip's fingers sliding into Candy's open purse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Samuel Fuller is hardly one of America's great directors. I'm not sure he qualifies as one of Hollywood's great craftsmen. But he certainly ranks up there with the best of Hollywood's true professionals who were willing to march to their own music. During the time he worked for Hollywood studios, he knew how to take an assignment, shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its parts...on time and on budget. Pickup on South Street is a case in point. On the surface it's one more of Hollywood's early Fifties' anti-Commie movies, complete with appeals to patriotism, a hard-boiled hero and a slimy (and copiously perspiring) bad guy. Fuller turns this bag of Hollywood clichés into a taut, exciting drama with any number of off-kilter twists. The hero, Skip McCoy, is a three-time loser, a petty crook with soft fingers who doesn't change his stripes until the very end. The girl in the caper, Candy, has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if you're so inclined. One of the most appealing characters, Moe Williams, is a stoolie. And in an unusual approach to Hollywood's battle against Commies, the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears; the hero isn't motivated by anything so ennobling. He just wants payback for a personal reason, and winds up becoming...at least for now...a good guy. Plus, all the actors were mostly assigned to Fuller by the studio. He had to make do. Richard Widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star, but Jean Peters is a surprise. She gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb, and no better than her boy friends...or her clients...want her to be. And Richard Kiley, who later would become a two- time Tony award winning star on Broadway, is convincingly slippery and cowardly. It's hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us, I mean introduced to us, "The Impossible Dream" from Man of La Mancha, More than anything else, this tale of a pickpocket who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash, pursued by the Feds and the Commies, moves straight ahead with great economy. The whole enterprise, with a classic noir look, only takes 80 minutes to tell. The dialogue, with Fuller as screenwriter, has that party corny, partly pungent hard-boiled pulp fiction style. "That muffin you grifted...she's okay," one character says to Skip about Candy. Fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next. Then Fuller throws in the character of Moe Williams. All of a sudden the story ratchets up to a whole new level of interest, part comedy relief and part sad inevitability. The thing I like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies Fuller's talents and strengths. In 2 minutes and 15 seconds, starting right after the credits, Fuller is able to instantly power up the movie, to establish for us what the story is about, and to show us what kind of characters -- Skip and Candy -- we're going to be involved with. And he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot, packed subway car that we can just about feel Fuller setting the hook to catch us. Says Glenn Erickson, in my opinion one of the best of movie critics, "In what should be an inconsequential story, Sam Fuller defines his peculiar view of Americanism from the bottom up: stiff-necked, aggressive self-interest that when fully expressed recognizes what's wrong and what's right and isn't afraid to fight for it. As always in his work, the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort." He's right, and it makes for a movie still vivid after 55 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak film, worth seeing because of Thelma Ritter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It almost got there in being a great movie. It almost made me want to really enjoy it. But it got lost somewhere in between, with little great moments, a different story with almost nothing to be fully enjoyed. Samuel Fuller's "Pickup on South Street" (awfully translated here as "The Angel of Evil") could be more fun if it was more thrilling, and use less dialogs in that theater filmed way that was distractive in some points.Richard Widmark plays a thief who simply had to steal the wallet of a beautiful woman (Jean Peters) that was followed by the FBI in a case of espionage involving Communists who are looking for a secret film that was in the wallet (nature of it it's not revealed through the whole thing, what a mess!). Now everybody's after the film and someone's gotta give up of something and reveal what lies behind all these secrets, thefts and all. Helping all the characters, except the villain, there's Moe (Thelma Ritter, wonderful) an informant of the underground and criminal world who works for the police giving informations on burglar's in trade of money and sell some ties.The plot goes well until it slowed it down during the ending, very boring and with no excitement at all; and the most difficult task of all is to get really like the main characters, the tough thief and the girl who wants the film back trying to seduce this man, I couldn't care for both of them, both annoying and mean to each other. Now, on the other hand Thelma Ritter has the most brilliant role in the film, a very thankful and dignifying character that has the best lines and scenes (my favorite is her speech to the villain about how difficult is her life and how she's not gonna open her mouth and give up her friend, the thief). She was nominated for a Oscar for this role, and I really wish she should have won it, because she made this film watchable and cool.Fuller's "The Big Red One" said more, made more for his director and it was a better film than this one that doesn't have anything relevant to show and say. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Stylized as to be Silly, But Has Its Worshipful Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard that "Pickup on South Street" was An Important Work of Art and so I went out of my way to see it. I was disappointed. I found it so silly as to be laughable. If you gave a bunch of smarty-pants, hardcore film geeks a box of spare film noir parts -- a hardboiled tough guy, a fallen woman, a stripped-down plot with lots of implied sex and violence -- and the assignment to come up with a paradigmatic film noir, they might come up with this movie. There are worshipful film fans out there who think "Pickup" is the greatest thing since "Citizen Kane." They like its pace, its editing, the baby oil daubed on characters' faces to make it look like they are sweating. These fans occupy a level of film nirvana denied to regular folk, and so "Pickup"'s audience is limited. "Pickup on South Street" is the quick and dirty story of Skip, a pickpocket, (Richard Widmark) and Candy (Jean Peters) a mule for commie spies. There are lots of gunshots and rough kisses.Everything -- and I mean everything -- is stylized and utterly implausible. Just one example: Candy rolls around, or is knocked around, the floor of a filthy shack and her white dress remains as blinding as if it had been bleached and retains its knife-edge pleats. The dialogue sounds like a Coen brothers parody of film noir; underworld slang like "twist," "grifter," and "cannon" fly through the air. Action takes place, largely, at night -- so much so that this would have had to have been filmed in an Arctic winter for the supply of nighttime needed.Classic film noirs like "Double Indemnity" and "Laura" also are stylized, but they offer actually moving scenes. The greed and betrayal in "Double Indemnity," the twisted loves explored in "Laura," mirror experiences any human heart might experience."Pickup on South Street" is so not in that category. It's not a comic book, it's a comic book parody of a comic book. In its heavy-handed stylization, "Pickup" is utterly divorced from anything human, and becomes a joke.Whereas the murder in "Double Indemnity" is genuinely frightening and disturbing, Richard Widmark, here, is just never believable as a bad guy. You look at him and never forget for a minute that you are watching Richard Widmark, famous Hollywood noir actor.Jean Peters is the best thing about the movie. She has a hardness, a vulnerability, a raw sexiness, and a desperation that break through the film's brittle artificiality.Even as brief as the film is, I was ready for it to be over before it finally offered up its utterly implausible ending, one that moved me not at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Widmark,Peters and Ritter at their best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pickup on South Street is directed by Samuel Fuller, is written by Fuller and Dwight Taylor and is based on Taylor's novel. The film stars Richard Widmark, Jean Peters, Richard Kiley and Thelma Ritter.This is one of my favourite Noir films. Widmark and Peters sizzle together and deliver superb performances as two tough characters realising they're falling for one another.On a crowded train, skilled pickpocket Skip McCoy(Richard Widmark)rummages through the handbag of Candy(Jean Peters), he steals some microfilm. Unbeknown to Skip the film contains top secret US government documents that Candy is delivering to a communist agent. Skip also doesn't know that he was seen taking the film by two agents who were following Candy.Skip hides the film but then finds himself questioned by the Police. He's soon wanted by Candy's boyfriend Joey(Richard Kiley), who wants the film back so he can deliver it to his fellow communists. Candy is sent to get the film back, she tries to charm him but Skip sees right through her, her admires her courage though and as time goes on the pair begin to fall for one another. Candy's association with Skip puts her in danger when Joey no longer trusts her.Widmark gives one of his best performances, he makes Skip clever, tough, cynical and a real survivor. You know this is a man you don't want to cross and although he's a thief he's not a bad man, he'll do the right thing in the end. Skip has seen and done plenty of bad things but he is still a good man, he hasn't crossed a moral line and become a bad guy.Jean Peters is an actress who I think should have become a much bigger star. She is at her best here as the tough, streetwise woman who falls for Skip and tries to do the right thing, even if that means risking her own life.Thelma Ritter is superb as stoolpigeon Moe. This lady is smart and doesn't miss anything. Moe's greatest fear is being buried in an unmarked grave. Throughout the film she is shown trying to collect money to put aside to ensure she can have a decent funeral, that is incredibly sad and Ritter makes your heart break for this woman and her situation.The three main characters in this are all down on their luck and all deserve to be happy. They all do things that they might not be proud of in order to survive, far from making us hate them this only humanises them, they aren't perfect and their characters are more developed than in some films like this and that all helps make the film as good as it is.In my opinion this is one of the best Noir films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Noir Meets Cold War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pickpocket (Richard Widmark) unwittingly lifts a message destined for enemy agents and becomes a target for a Communist spy ring.In August 1952, the script was deemed unacceptable by the Production Code, by reasons of "excessive brutality and sadistic beatings, of both men and women." The committee also expressed disdain for the vicious beating of the character "Candy", on the part of "Joey." Apparently we had slid backwards in the 1950s, as such things would have been fine a decade earlier.The French release of the movie removed any reference to spies and microfilm in the translation. They called the movie "Le Port de la Drogue" (Carrying Drugs). The managers of 20th Century Fox thought that the theme of communist spies was too controversial in a country where the Communist Party was an influential and legitimate part of public life. This is fascinating.The whole concept is clever because it blends film noir and spy thriller. The two do not seem to overlap, but in this world they go together just fine. I prefer noir over spies, and I think that was executed well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Xenophobic Espionage In A Gritty NYC Setting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due to its excessive brutality and sadistic beatings (especially the rough slapping around of pretty Candy), this rough'n'tough Crime/Thriller from 1953 ran into a lot of serious flak from the censors prior to its initial release.In order to appease the picky censor board's pointless grumblings, several violent scenes were quickly re-shot and even a "cutesy-pie", little happy ending was tacked onto the story for good measure.And because this film's theme dealt directly with Communist espionage on American turf, FBI agent, J. Edgar Hoover, even got into the act and complained to Darryl F. Zanuck (then head of 20th Century Fox) about the unpatriotic attitude of Richard Widmark's lippy character and his "Are you waving the flag at me?" line.Of course (as you can well-imagine), the whole controversy that all of this silly attention stirred up prior to "Pickup's" initial release did absolute wonders as a means of advertising and, thus, selling it to the curious movie-going public, and generating big box-office bucks.Pickup's story deals with the serious events that are set into motion after the brazen pickpocket, Skip McCoy, steals a wallet being carried by pretty, little Candy.Unknown to both Skip and Candy, this innocent-looking wallet actually contains a strip of microfilm of top-secret information that was being delivered to a group of ruthless Communist spies operating within the seedy underworld of NYC.Filmed in stark b&amp;w, this hard-edged Crime/Drama had a running time of only 80 minutes. It was directed by Samuel Fuller whose other films from the 1950s included Forty Guns, Hell and High Water, and Underworld USA.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not groundbreaking and it will not change you in any fundamental way. But it is deeply noir, and that is something always worth seeing.We have a story centered on a character who is, among every character, the one who knows less about what's going on. He is the only one totally outside the juicy plot he gets sucked into, and yet the only one that everybody (police and communists) believe to be in control of everything. Everything happens to him, he fights to control the events, but ends up being swept by them. Notice this: he literally gets into the story by randomly picking a girls' pocket, and steeling some very important film. He doesn't have a clue about the importance and value of what he has, and acts accordingly. In the meanwhile he tries to outplay both the police and the communists, using the girl as his arrow girl, as a shield. He ends up loosing control both of the story (but not quite), as he falls in love with the girl. So here we have a cute sense of chaos in the story, agitated narrative where we find ourselves lost, as much as our surrogate detective, in this case the pickpocket. Fuller has a great sense of pace and mood, and this film has a very special extra thing: the floating shack where many of the fundamental twists in the narrative happen. That is one great set that I will have with me for a long time. As an explored space it is good enough, in studio context. As a metaphor for the unstable mood of the whole narrative it works fine. In the end, this space becomes the odd center of the bizarre noir world of the film, and to root a film so strongly in a place is something I always appreciate.My opinion: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Old Clock Runnin' Down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Thanks to The Dallas Film Society and movie critic Chris Vognar, we were lucky enough to watch this on the big screen from a 35mm print! If you enjoy the pulp thrillers from the 1950's, this is one you must track down. It provides so much to discuss for a little 80 minute B-movie! Directed by Samuel Fuller, we get a real taste of his man's man background. Not only was Fuller a well-known war correspondent, he also served in WWII, including Omaha Beach on D-Day. This movie provided him with a stellar cast: Richard Widmark as Skip, Jean Peters as Candy, Thelma Ritter as Moe, and Richard Kiley as Joey. It is a story of the times as small-time pickpocket Skip, works his magic fingers on Candy's purse while they are facing each other on the subway.The real fun begins as we watch the police, the feds and the communists all trying to hunt him down. The reason? He unknowingly stole top secret US information that was being passed to the commies. This film noir has some really tough elements. Heck, Skip even punches Candy right in the jaw! The lighting, score and fight scenes are all no-nonsense and direct. It's really fun to watch the eye movements of the key players. It's obvious none of the characters are comfortable in the situation, no matter how smooth they try to be.The great Thelma Ritter runs off with each of her scenes. She plays Moe, the local stool pigeon who plays everyone for a buck. Ms. Ritter was nominated for an Oscar for her role (one of four in a row for her), but it was another in her long line of 6 nominations and no wins. This may be her best work. Another of my all time favorite character actors makes a brief appearance as one of the commies: Willis Bouchey. And don't miss Milburn Stone as a detective. Mr. Stone would go on to star as Doc on "Gunsmoke" for twenty years.The film features some terrific lines. One of my favorites is "Everybody likes everybody when they're kissing." Another is "I would rather have a live pickpocket than a dead traitor." Fun stuff. Should also mention that Jean Peters went on to become the wife of Howard Hughes and her acting days abruptly ended. After their divorce, she made a couple of TV appearances, but was unable to recapture the magic of these early years. Should also note that this film was re-made (weakly) in 1969 as The Cape Town Affair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pickpocket</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A New York subway car serves as the setting as the story begins. A low life, Skip McCoy, picks a young woman's wallet out of her purse. Little does he know some Feds are following her because of what she is carrying on the purse. Skip, having come out of prison recently, is easily identified by a police snitch, Moe Williams, who knows a lot about the criminal element working in the city.Skip has no idea of what he has stolen until he has a good look at what appears to be an encrypted film. Little does he know he has gotten into deep water because of what is encoded. Some Communist spies are trying to capitalize in the information on the missing celluloid. Candy, the girl whose bag was picked, is involved with Joey, but does not suspect how the police and the Feds want to trap the group. In the process, Candy falls hard for Skip.The film is interesting to watch because it offers a slice of life in the New York of the 1950s and the crisp black and white cinematography by Joe McDonald who captures in vivid detail the New York of those years. Samuel Fuller wrote and directed. The screenplay was probably an excuse for the action because, at times, it makes no sense. The film running time is a short eighty minutes, but it is packed with action.Richard Widmark made a good contribution to the film with his Skip McCoy. He was an actor who was effective in those pictures that showed him as a criminal. Jean Peters's Candy is an excuse to add a sexual diversion to the drama. The excellent Thelma Ritter appears in key scenes of the film. She was a joy to watch whenever she graced the screen. Richard Kiley, Murvin Vye, Milburn Stone and Willis Bouchey are seen in supporting roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The great Richard Widmark plays a pickpocket who accidentally ends up with a strip of top secret government microfilm that he grabbed from a gal (Peters) on the subway. Needless to say, both the commies and our government would like to get their hands on the film. Widmark's cynical and brazen character plays hard to get, until the people around him start getting hurt and dying. Tnen it's time to stop playing Mr. Nioe Wise Guy. Shot in New York City. A very young Richard Kiley plays one of the bad guys and Thelma Ritter practically steals the movie as a police informant. While I didn't buy the sudden love angle between Widmark and Peters, their smoochy scenes are pretty steamy for a 1953 film. Enjoy Widmark at his best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cold War Noir With Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enjoyed this movie a great deal. I thought the story was good and Director Fuller captured the noir feel very well. This picture was a noir but the best acting was done by females - Jean Peters as a stereotypical slut-with-a-heart-of-gold and Thelma Ritter as a bag woman but called a 'stoolie' for identification purposes in the film. I always thought a stoolie was a weaselly little guy like Elisha Cook,Jr., but no matter. The picture is basically Ms. Peters' and she is better here than in any of her other films.Having said all that, I had a couple of problems with this picture. First and foremost, Widmark is a pickpocket living in a waterfront shack, but is dressed immaculately in suit and tie and snappy fedora? And reads the NY Times on the subway? Please. It just kicks a hole in the movie which is tough to reconcile with reality. Also, there is chemistry in the love scenes between Widmark and Peters but it begs the question; how could she fall for such a cold, unrepentant creep who picks her purse and slaps her around? I just couldn't buy these two colossal plot inconsistencies and they affected my rating. Nevertheless, it is well worth seeing but not as good a noir as, for instance, " Out Of The Past", which is really in a class by itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly Directed Fifties Crime Classic Of Blackmail And Underworld Remorse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Skip McCoy is a pickpocket with a long rap sheet. When by chance he picks a purse containing some secret microfilm, he sees the opportunity for a big score as both the cops and the spies want it back. Can he capitalise on this find ?Scripted by Fuller, from a story by Dwight Taylor, this is a terrific, hard-edged crime drama with a great narrative, crackerjack dialogue ("You'll always be a two-bit cannon. And when they pick you up in the gutter dead, your hand'll be in a drunk's pocket.") and a trio of fascinating leading characters. The four stars are all excellent. Widmark was made for this part; a punk street-thief with a callous streak who finally starts to wake up to the world he lives in when others start paying for his crimes. Lesser cult-star Peters shines as the trampy bad girl, Ritter was at the peak of her career (her next movie was Rear Window) and prolific TV/Broadway star Kiley is memorable in an early film role as the Cowardly Commie. As with almost all the pictures from his prolific fifties period, Fuller directs with a great invisible style - his shots are straightforward and completely lacking in pretension, yet at the same time the action is cleverly blocked and the characters seem to seep out of the screen. The shocking moments, such as Ritter's death or the brutal fight in the hotel room, pack a punch because of the violence of the characters, rather than the on-screen dynamics. I'm constantly amazed at Fuller's ability to get past the Hays Code of the time; here his "hero" is a recidivist petty crook with no respect for anyone and who reserves his best sneers for the authorities. These are great characters, manipulated by a puppet master of a director. Expertly shot by Joe MacDonald (Panic In The Streets, The List Of Adrian Messenger) and remade in 1967 as an obscure South African film called The Cape Town Affair. Superb hard-boiled film-noir entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fuller does an outstanding job on a gritty little film noir gem...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening scene aboard a crowded train where a ruthless pickpocket is at work (RICHARD WIDMARK) stealing from a woman's purse (JEAN PETERS), PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is relentlessly fascinating to watch. Partly it's because the acting is uniformly strong from the entire cast, the B&amp;W photography is crisp and adds to the starkness of the story and characters, and because Samuel Fuller's direction puts him in the same league with the biggies like John (ASPHALT JUNGLE) Huston. In fact, it has the same urgency as the Huston film about a heist that goes wrong--but the payoff is not quite as strong.JEAN PETERS is excellent as the hard-edged girl whom Widmark describes as being "knocked around a lot". She gives a lot of raw energy and sex appeal to her role of the not too bright woman carrying a micro-film in her purse for her boyfriend (RICHARD KILEY), something the FBI already knows about. They're on her trail when the theft occurs.THELMA RITTER adds realism to her portrait of a woman called "Moe" who buys and sells anything to make a profit and ends up paying for it with her life. She's particularly touching in her final scene with Kiley.This one is guaranteed to hold your attention through its one hour and twenty minute running time. Good noir from Fox and notable for the performances of Widmark, Peters and Ritter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Espionage: The Difference between a Pickpocket and a Traitor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At film's beginning we see a NY subway so crowded that the neurosis of claustrophobia oppresses us. Folks keep piling on, but no one disembarks. A pickpocket (we soon learn is Skip McCoy = Richard Widmark), a three-time loser, skillfully removes a woman's wallet from her purse. The pickpocket is seen by FBI agent Zara (Willis B. Bouchery), but McCoy nevertheless gets away. It seems that the woman, Candy (Jean Peters), was being tailed by Zara all along. Her wallet contains a valuable microfilm (describing a chemical formula) wanted by the Communists. Candy was passing it on to her sleazy boyfriend Joey (Richard Kiley), a Communist sympathizer. Candy does not know final destination of the microfilm. McCoy knows nothing about the microfilm; he just wants to make a quick buck.Zara consults with Captain Dan Tiger (Murvyn Vye), who in turn relies on Moe Williams (Thelma Ritter), a street peddler who sells ties. Moe is a police paid informer who has a price for keeping keeps tabs on underworld figures in the neighborhood. She lives in a shabby tenement, but is saving enough cash for a fancy funeral. She tells Capt. Tiger, "I've got almost enough to buy both the stone and the plot." With new information the lawmen go to McCoy's bare-bones waterfront shack without electricity (but note how he stores stuff) on the East River. One of cops is Detective Winoki, played by Milburn Stone, later to star as Doc Adams in the very long-running and successful TV series, "Gunsmoke." The cops demand the microfilm. As Skip balks, he is summarily taken down to the precinct. Tiger tells McCoy, "If you refuse to co-operate, you will be just as guilty as the traitors who gave Stalin the A-bomb!" McCoy boldly retorts, "Are you waving the flag at me?" Candy eventually helps the authorities, and even Moe hinders the bad Commies. Likewise, McCoy changes his tune, but for a reason different than that of the feds. There is a climax involving a terrific fist fight between two antagonists on the subway tracks. Richard Widmark as the cocky hood is good as always. The line of the movie is delivered by Thelma Ritter, in a marvelous performance as Moe. "If I was to be buried in Potter's Field, it'd just about kill me." Ritter lost out to Donna Reed ("From Here to Eternity") for the Oscar as Best Supporting Actress. Joe MacDonald shoots this one in tight close-up, especially the wallet snatch. Watch how Lightning Louie (Vic Perry) gobbles his noodles from the bowl close to his mouth and how he fetches Candy's $20 bills. The contiguous shot effect (often without extraneous dialog) brings out the tension sustained by each character: note the furrows, the sweat, and the quivering lips. See how well MacDonald captures the overcrowded subway, the shots of New York City, Moe's tenement, the bait shop along the waterfront. Cigar-smoking director Sam Fuller has at least three films elected to the American National Film Registry, "Shock Corridor," "The Big Red One" (the nickname for the 1st infantry division where he served in World War II) and "VE + 1." The latter is a short about the liberation of Falkenau concentration camp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tough tone, performances, dialogue and direction make it more than the genre anti-commie piece it could easily have merely been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a pick-pocket on his final strike steals from a woman in the subway, he quickly gets dragged into something much bigger than he expected. For some reason the police were watching his mark very closely so they saw him make his move ? not to mention that the contents of the purse must have been very valuable since the mark (Candy) is very keen to get it back for the people she was carrying something for.On the face of it this film is a bit of a sop for those at the time looking to blacklist potential communists ? and one way to avoid such accusations was to make sure and be in a film where commies are the bad guys. This could have meant a terribly simplistic film but here we have something that does rise above that, even if it is perhaps not as brilliant as people tend to say. The plot is good throughout but it is the tough tone, dialogue and performances that make it more than the sum of its parts. The narrative sees Candy trying to recover something from pickpocket Skip by using her feminine charms while other pressures start to build on both of them; this aspects of the film is probably the weakest since we do not have much time for anything genuine to start to come from her flirting ? but yet the narrative demands that it does, so it does. The performances cover this up the best they can, but at times it doesn't convince even though it works when the "relationship" is a bit more exploitative or sexual in nature.The tough tone is what makes it, with some brutal moments combined with consistently tough and sharp dialogue. Ultimately it comes down to Commie beating, which is understandable, but up till then it is more than it could have been. Of course the cast helps since Widmark is always good and he is so here; he never really becomes a hero and even though he turns on the Commies, he never lets us think he is doing it with a flag draped around him so much as his own personal motives. Peters is very good as Candy, selling her very good looks and sexuality while also performing well in some more brutal scenes. Ritter is the standout though in what could have been an incidental character needed to move the plot along. Here Fuller's script gives her more to work with and she really makes the most of it, bringing a lot to her character and performance. As director and writer Fuller gets the tough edge right and I particularly liked the camera movement ? incredibly close to the characters at times, unafraid to shoot a scene with one character blocking the other, and with good urgent movement in the action sequences.Pickup is not a perfect film but it is a very strong one ? and for sure much stronger than an anti-communist genre piece could have been. The tough tone, performances, dialogue and direction all make it work very well, with pace and brutality adding to the value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great Film Noir. Love the scene where McCoy (Widmark) punches Candy (Jean Peters) in the jaw and knocks her out cold, and then gently rubs her jaw as he tries to bring her to and she kisses him. Now that's film noir. She falls for him hard but soon finds he's a tough nut to crack. Widmark at his best, and unfortunately Peters' career was cut short after she married Howard Hughes. Thelma Ritter also lends great support as the wise cracking Moe, an informer who sells ties on side. She cares about McCoy too, enough to only sell him out as long as she doesn't think he'll get hurt. She also picked up an Oscar for her efforts. Classic picture, from the opening subway train shot, where Peter's attraction for Widmark sets the screen on fire, to the last suspenseful scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Shock Corridor (1963)' was my first film from Samuel Fuller, and there I was impressed with the director's astute blending of B-movie and big-budget aesthetics, even if the story itself was pure schlock. 'Pickup on South Street (1953)' was released a decade earlier in Fuller's career, obviously produced on a larger budget from a big-name studio, Twentieth Century-Fox. Nevertheless, the visuals are still notable in that there's a somewhat raw, naturalistic element to the photography, not unlike Dassin's 'The Night and the City (1950)' and Kazan's 'Panic in the Streets (1950)' {the latter was also shot by cinematographer Joe McDonald}. In some scenes, Fuller shoves the camera so close to his actors' faces that they're out of focus, bluntly registering the intimate thoughts, emotions and brief inflections that are communicated through that most revealing of facial features, the eye. Though (unexpectedly) prone to melodrama, and with just a hint of anti-Communist propaganda, 'Pickup on South Street' is a strong film noir that succeeds most outstandingly in its evocation of setting ? the underground of New York City.When just-out-of-prison pickpocket Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) snags the purse of a woman on the subway (Jean Peters), he pockets more than he'd originally bargained for. The woman, Candy, and her cowardly ex-boyfriend Joey (Richard Kiley) had been smuggling top-secret information to the Communists, and McKoy has unexpectedly retrieved an important roll of micro-film. Will he turn in the MacGuffin to the proper authorities, or sell it to the highest bidder? If 'Pickup on South Street' has a flaw, it's that the story seems designed solely to bolster an anti-Communist agenda, reeking of propaganda like nothing since WWII {Dwight Taylor, who supplied the story, also notably wrote 'The Thin Man Goes Home (1944),' the only propagandistic movie of the series}. For no apparent reason, every identifiable character ? even the smugly self-serving Skip McCoy ? eventually becomes a self-sacrificing patriot, the transformation predictable from the outset. In traditional film noir, the unapologetic criminal always gets his comeuppance, the rational punishment for his sins, but apparently not when they've served their country; patriotism wipes the slate clean.Richard Widmark, an actor who I'm really beginning to like, plays the haughty pickpocket with composure, though always with that hint of ill-ease that suggests he's biting off more than he can chew. The opening scene on the train is the film's finest, as McCoy breathlessly and silently fishes around in his victim's hand bag, recalling Bresson's 'Pickpocket (1959).' Thelma Ritter is terrific as a tired street-woman who'll peddle information to anybody willing to pay for it (though, of course, she draws the line at Commies). Jean Peters is well-cast as the trashy dame passing information to the other side, playing the role almost completely devoid of glamour; Fuller reportedly cast the actress on the observation that she had the slightly bow-legged strut of a prostitute. Nevertheless, Peters must suffer a contrived love affair with Widmark that really brings down the film's attempts at realism. Fascinatingly, upon its release, 'Pickup on South Street' was promptly condemned as Communist propaganda by the FBI, and the Communist Party condemned it for being the exact opposite. Go figure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honor among thieves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Noir drama starts off brilliantly in a crowded subway car. The camera focus is on four characters, each oblivious to the others intent, but all actors in the same drama. Three men are watching an attractive girl in a white dress, somewhat provocatively, when one of them steps forward moving directly in front, practically in physical contact. The other two men look particularly miffed at this gesture, but the girl seems to be enjoying herself. The assertive gentleman now pretends to be reading a newspaper as he checks out the girl who pretends not to notice him pretending. They are in the same zone as his hand gently explores her purse, reaches in and retrieves a small envelope. When the train stops, the man immediately leaves and the girl, looking like she just had some good sex, remains unaware that she's been duped. (**Potential Spoilers ahead**) As it turns out, Candy was being used as a courier for her ex boyfriend Joey, a traitor exchanging U.S. secrets to the Commies for pay. Candy is unaware of the details, but remembers the pickpocket for obvious reasons. She locates him through Mo, an older women that knows all the little criminals, and peddles information in exchange for pay. This leads her to Skip, a 3-strike loser who seems addicted to his art. When he discovers Candy searching his little bungalow on the docks, he thinks she's a knockout and proves it. After this little exchange, Candy's in love, but Skip still wants to exchange the film for pay, even after becoming aware of the communist plot. Mo warns that even crooks must draw a line somewhere and this line will resonate with him only after tragedy. With PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET Sam Fuller has put together an "in your face" noir thriller that is extremely gripping and contains an amazing performance by Thelma Ritter as "Mo". The scene where she is confronted by Joey is heartbreaking and frightfully real.</fullReview>

Richard Widmark is incredibly slimy and believable as the "three-time loser" Skip McCoy who gets more than he bargained for when he "lifts" a wallet from a subway passenger's handbag. The result is that cops and "reds" are after him, but he plays them all along as far as he can, with one or two casualties on the way. Sma Fuller's direction grips like a vice, and the production design, lighting, music and dialogue are all superb. Each character is believable and sympathetic in their own way, especially Mo, the tie-seller. Yes indeed, this is film noir at its finest, with some brilliant details, as other IMDB-ers have mentioned (the chopsticks, the alarm). Each shot could be used as a perfect representation of all that film noir stood for. The film as a whole paints a vivid picture of life at the margins of society, with desperate people doing increasingly desperate things. If you get the chance, see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stealing a girl's wallet can get you into a lot of trouble, especially when it has micro-film the commies want. That's what newly released jail bird Richard Widmark finds out when he's called in for questioning after being fingered by your friendly neighborhood stoolie (Thelma Ritter), a Tugboat Annie/Apple Annie type character who only prays for a clean death and enough money left behind to pay for a proper headstone, not being lymed away in Potter's Field on Ward's Island.Jean Peters is the dame, doing one last favor for her ex, and ironically falls for the man who pick pocketed her but a game with him results in a lot of trouble. While they are excellent in this film, it will be Ritter whom you remember, the best role she ever got and the one most deserving of praise. Five Oscar Nominations, mostly for scene-stealing walk-ons, but this is a true acting challenge (along with her nasty mother in "Bird Man of Alcatraz") that gives her a real character who will break your heart when she's confronted by her destiny. That scene alone was worthy of an Academy Award.Directed by the magnificent Sam Fuller, this is a "street" film where the rawness of the naked city is covered in slime through organized crime, espionage and cheap crooks. Even the cops are a bit shady, one admitting he lost six months of pay for beating up Widmark on previous encounters. Made during the height of the cold war and McCarthy era, this is a film that doesn't take sides except to show that the spy game is an ugly sport.</fullReview>

Subway rider Candy (Susan Peters) collides with pickpocket Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark dipped in shades of Sinatra cool). She's unaware that she carries valuable microfilm; McCoy is unaware of grifting it. Both are unaware of being observed by two federal agents. Thus the grift sets in motion a degree of knowledges. Candy is doubly watched (Skip and the police) and therefore doubly naive; Skip, the overconfident petty thief, is singularly unaware, trailed by federal agents; the feds, all knowing, are ultimately helpless. They can't stop the "passing" of government secrets or the spread of communism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two major factors seem to have boasted this film's stature: The direction by Samuel Fuller and yet another great performance by Thelma Ritter, which earned her an Oscar-nomination, quite unusual for a small role in a B-movie. Besides these two facts, this is pretty decent film-making but certainly not a great movie. Richard Wildmark is Skip McCoy, a small-time pickpocket who inadvertently comes in possession of a top-secret micro-film and becomes the target of all kinds of gangsters and espionage agents. If the wisecracking antics of Richard Wildmark are your thing, it's probably a lot easier to get through this, but his performance just didn't do it for me, so perhaps this film just isn't for me. Besides this, I found it rather dreary with all the black-and-white anti-communism clichés being chewed over once again. It starts well enough with a simple but effective premise and a reasonably tense storyline but most of the characters are so clichéd and unbelievable that I soon lost all interest.I didn't really pick-up the supposed anti-communist message in the film. They painfully tried to avoid making a clear-cut "anti-communist" film but it's all about good Americans versus communism. If the central item, the lost piece of micro-film, would have been something else, it probably wouldn't have bothered me that much. Couldn't they have made this into an ordinary gangster story? It might have worked a lot better. The stellar direction by Fuller and Thelma Ritter's impressive performance, who easily walks away with the movie, make it watchable, but otherwise, quite an ordinary film-noir with a muddled and clichéd storyline and a political message that's mostly distracting and hardly interesting or intriguing.Camera Obscura --- 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Samuel Fuller's richest, most accomplished film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street is anomalous: A "Red Scare" movie devoid of hysteria, in which the Communist threat is nothing more than the McGuffin that ignites the plot. Pickpocket Richard Widmark relieves loose woman Jean Peters of her wallet containing a strip of microfilm; unbeknownst to either of them, it harbors secrets vital to the Cold War. Peters, as it happens, was under surveillance by FBI agents who are as nonplussed by the theft as the man who's running her, cowardly comsymp Richard Kiley. In trying to retrieve the precious film, both sides enlist the help of Thelma Ritter, a streetwise old jane who's always on the earie and willing to sell what she hears.Fuller draws from an opulent palette of tempos and tonalities in telling the story, which becomes a race against the clock of escalating brutality. From the subways to the waterfront, his midsummer Manhattan takes on a sweaty sheen that's almost pungent. The love scenes between Peters and Widmark become an unstable mixture of the tumultuous and the tender, and they're scored to "Again," a song introduced by Ida Lupino in Road House, also starring Widmark. The pace slackens for Ritter's beautifully written and played death scene -- among the most poignant vignettes in all noir, and a kind of mirage-oasis in a film parched of sentimentality. This is writer/director Fuller's only work in the strictest confines of the noir cycle; his later explorations of American pathology (The Crimson Kimono, The Naked Kiss, Underworld U.S.A.) never resulted in a synthesis as satisfying as Pickup on South Street.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pulp novel transferred to the screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, the story is an original screenplay written by the film's director. But it's still pulp. The plot is UNcredible. The romance - if that's what it is - between Skip and Candy is UNbelievable. But neither one of these "faults" detracts one iota from enjoying this film to the max.I'm amazed that all the scenes and sets were built and filmed inside the Fox studio. It has the look and feel of having been filmed on location, in the actual streets and waterfront of NYC, in July. And the actors, especially Joey, are sweating. Realism is achieved under the hot studio lights. The film benefits from not casting Marilyn Monroe - who was deemed to be too sweet and innocent to play Candy - and instead, the director cast Peters. Her performance is stellar. And that goes double for Widmark. It's a plus for the film that the lead actors are not 50s mega stars. The actors in the 3 other substantial roles, are also superb.The communist storyline didn't bother me, nor did it negatively date the film. 1953, after all, was a time of fear - fear of juvenile delinquents, dope fiends, aliens from outer space, polio, and the Cold War. The story moves at a fast clip, fast enough to keep the viewer involved in turning the pages, so to speak. And the climactic scene at the end where Skip and Joey slug it out in the subway station is knuckle-chewing excitement. I had no preconceived ideas about what to expect when I checked out the DVD from the library. Total involvement, which rarely happens for me when watching films made later than the 20s and 30s, is what happened. I hit the jackpot with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On a crowded New York City subway, petty pickpocket Richard Widmark (as Skip McCoy) sneaks his fingers into the purse of pretty part-time prostitute Jean Peters (as Candy). He thinks he's got Ms. Peters' wallet, but Mr. Widmark has unknowingly stolen some top-secret microfilm Peters was delivering to her pimp-like ex-boyfriend Richard Kiley (as Joey). The police employ street-wise peddler Thelma Ritter (as Moe Williams) to help find Widmark and the microfilm, before it falls into the hands of Communists plotting against the USA. Fresh out of prison, Widmark wants to stay ahead of the law while committing his crimes. He also notices Peters is pretty enough to kiss, albeit with roughness. With the fate of the entire free world hanging in the balance, various and sundry characters must retrieve the microfilm before it falls into Communist hands...Samuel Fuller's weird mix of Damon Runyon characters in a Mickey Spillane setting almost works ? the weakest part is the "Red Scare" element, involving Communists plotting something presumably earth-shattering in New York City. Secondarily, the occasional cuteness of the characters, who seem to operate in a cozy circle in New York City, doesn't always jive with their violent outbursts. Nevertheless, the role played by Ms. Ritter ? peddling ties instead of apples ? comes across the screen exceptionally well. Ritter breathes great life into Mr. Fuller's nicely developed character. As the sweaty spy, Mr. Kiley also impresses. Widmark is reliable and Peters vulnerable ? but their parts are less appealing. Murvyn Vye and the others seem real, despite being directed to randomly pull and leaf through suspects' photos. Joe MacDonald's photography is stylish.******* Pickup on South Street (5/29/53) Samuel Fuller ~ Richard Widmark, Jean Peters, Thelma Ritter, Richard Kiley</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tightly-wound Noir Thriller With Boffo Performance by Thelma Ritter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it about Thelma Ritter? She has enriched so many films and in almost every one becomes a sort of Greek Chorus; it's Bette Davis we watch in All About Eve, but it's Thelma that backgrounds the commentary--whether it's an acidic riposte to Eve's sad story of theatrical neglect or the plethora of furs on the bed--"looks like a dead animal act." Ritter was nominated many times for an Oscar, and should have won in this film for her worn-out informer who is "just doing her job" in this tightly-knit film noir.It's Jean Peters who is perhaps the titular star, surprisingly rich as a rather confused femme fatale who falls for Richard Widmark's hard-edged, nervous pickpocket, living on the water in a strange little coop where he keeps his treasures on a rope in the water. This is deservedly a noir classic, with all the hallmarks of the genre, and Sam Fuller's dynamic direction guiding his three main characters through a labyrinth of crime: each has a code that has very little to do with ethics of the FBI, but are oddly admirable in their sense of self.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful film with Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Oscar nominee Thelma Ritter really shine. When a pickpocket lifts information bound for a Communist spy ring, things really heat up in this 1953 thriller.Thelma Ritter earned her 4th nomination in a row for best supporting actress, and as usual, she lost this time to Donna Reid in "From Here to Eternity." Poor Thelma, she would nominated twice more and lose both times again. Ritter's role as Mo, a police informant is interesting to watch. Disgusted with life, she leaves her frustrations out on her eventual killer, and she does this in a remarkable on screen performance before she is literally blown away. She literally asks to be killed and her killer unfortunately complies.This film was quite apt for 1953 with the McCarthy era simmering and the Big Red Scare evolving throughout the United States.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a pretty decent example of film noir. The setting is the early 50's with the Communists trying to steal weapon secrets from the US Government.Richard Widmark is the suave pickpocket without scruples. He gives a pretty decent performance but there is nothing A-List about him. The interesting thing was that he was not only an anti-hero but through most of the film, an unlikeable anti-hero. That is not very normal. Jean Peters gave a so-so performance as the hooker with the heart of gold. That great character actress Thelma Ritter shines as the stool-pigeon.The plot had its fair share of twists and turns, wisecracks and tough talk. There is a fight scene near the end of the movie (in the subway station) that was pretty gritty and exciting.I think noir fans (like myself) will enjoy this film. For non-noir viewers, it may seem a little dated and the whole Commie thing a tad overdone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Films Noirs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pickup on South Street" opens with a pickpocket named Skip McCoy stealing a wallet from a young woman on the New York subway. Unfortunately for him, he has chosen the wrong wallet to steal. The wallet contains a microfilm of top-secret government information and the woman, Candy, is under police surveillance. It transpires, however, that she is herself unaware of what her wallet contains. All she knows is that she has been asked to deliver an envelope as a favour to her ex-boyfriend, Joey, who turns out to be part of a Communist spy-ring. The film then follows the efforts of the police and FBI to recover the microfilm from Skip.Some have criticised this film for being "too right-wing", although it is only right-wing insofar as it takes a strongly anti-Communist stance, something common in the American film industry during the Cold War. In the fifties this stance was highly controversial, although it should be less so nowadays, given that it seems to be generally agreed, even on the political left, that Stalin's regime, far from being the workers' paradise which its defenders at the time claimed it to be, was in fact a brutal dictatorship. Interestingly, when the film was released in France it was retitled "Le Port de la Drogue" ("Port of Drugs") and was dubbed so as to make Joey a drug-dealer rather than a spy, something done for commercial reasons in a country with an influential Communist Party. The studio bosses at 20th Century Fox may have been right-wing, but it would appear that they lacked the courage of their right-wing convictions.In other respects, however, the film is the very opposite of right-wing. It is a film which takes the side of the downtrodden, of the underprivileged and of life's losers. Some crime dramas from this period, such as "White Heat" from a few years earlier, draw a clear line between vicious, psychopathic criminals and heroic, clean-cut law enforcement officers. Here, the moral boundaries are much more blurred. (A common characteristic of film noir).The police officers we see are not idealised heroes but flawed characters with little compunction about bullying suspects or bribing informers to get information. This is a film with real villains- Joey and his Communist associates- but no real heroes.It is, in fact, the people on the wrong side of the law- Skip the pickpocket, Moe the paid informer and Candy the promiscuous good-time girl- who come closer to being heroes than any of the policemen or Government agents. Certainly, none of these characters are idealised either. Skip is a "three-time loser" meaning that he has three previous convictions for theft, with a violent side to his nature. When he discovers what Candy's wallet contains, his initial instinct is to sell the information to the highest bidder. Moe will sell out anyone for money, even Skip who is supposed to be her friend. Candy is possibly a former prostitute, although the Production Code meant that writer-director Samuel Fuller could not be too explicit on this point. And yet all of these people are capable of finding reserves of courage and decency within themselves when needed. There are excellent performances in all three roles from Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter, who received a well-deserved "Best Supporting Actress" Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Moe. It seems strange that Fuller turned down Ava Gardner for Candy on the grounds that she "looked too glamorous", as Peters looks absolutely stunning. I have always thought it a pity that she made so few films, retiring after her marriage to Howard Hughes.In a sense, the real star of this film is neither Widmark, nor Peters, nor Ritter, but the city of New York itself. The city that we see is not the loving vision of, say, Woody Allen's "Manhattan" or the glossy tourist destination of "On the Town". As in a number of films noirs, we get to see the city's dirty underside, a city of crowded subway trains, of sordid apartments, of wooden shacks like the one where Skip lives by the river. The dialogue is appropriately earthy and demotic, with much use of a vivid period slang which, to British ears at least, is initially difficult to understand. (Fortunately, it didn't take me long to realise that "cannon" means pickpocket, "grift" to steal and "muffin" woman; "stoolpigeon", meaning informer, I already knew from other films).This is, apart from his much later (and in my view overrated)"The Big Red One", the only one of Fuller's films I have seen, but it is a fine one, and I will be keeping a look-out for his work in future. With a fast-moving, gripping plot, snappy dialogue and characters who manage to engage our sympathies for all their flaws, "Pickup on South Street" must rate as one of the greatest films noirs. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty Fuller film noir packs a real punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Fuller's excellent PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is the pick of the bunch from a number of early 50's Cold War-influenced low-budget noir vehicles. With a running length of under 80 minutes, PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is tough, gritty, explosive and endlessly entertaining.Widmark stars as pickpocket Skip McCoy, who has already been picked up three times. Yet McCoy can't keep his wandering fingers out of trouble- and trouble is exactly what he slides into when he grifts the wallet of gangster's moll Candy (Jean Peters). Candy's wallet contains a roll of microfilm invaluable to the Communist movement, and it's her last job for ex-boyfriend Richard Kiley to make the delivery. However, when Widmark lifts it, Peters must do whatever it takes to re-claim the film she (initially) knows nothing about.It's a tasty set-up, with Widmark's character, while not the psycho of KISS OF DEATH, a real live-wire, unpredictable and tough, yet curiously charming.When Bogart or Mitchum stepped into a film noir role you knew what you were going to get: a lone anti-hero maintaining his moral integrity and winning out in the end (Bogart), or an overly-laconic guy who allows himself to be drawn into a trap (Mitchum). With Widmark you just don't know what you are going to get, and with his incredibly modern acting style (his films always hold up well) he is amazing to watch. Here he is torn between making a big score for himself by selling the film, or handing it over to the police and fighting the "Commies" on the right side of the law. And he still has to pretend he never pickpocketed Peters to avoid the fatal fourth rap on his sheet.Peters gets her best role as the moll-with-a-heart-of-gold Candy. Widmark's unpredictability is perhaps best expressed in his scenes with Peters; the gorgeous tramp quickly (and rather unbelievably- the romance angle is rather rushed)falls under Widmark's spell, yet Widmark alternates between kissing her or slapping her around. Peters hard-edged beauty, yet lack of over-lacquered Hollywood glamour (Lana Turner would never have worked well in this role), is a major asset to the film. Candy is not innocent, yet she's very vulnerable, constantly being passed between and slapped around by men. Widmark knocks her cold on first meeting and wakes her by pouring beer over her face, yet by the final act he's a lot more tender to her (after she cops one hell of a going-over from Kiley). The scene in the hospital with Peters and Widmark shouldn't work, but it does.Thelma Ritter is brilliant as stoolie Moe, well-deserving of her Oscar nomination. Ritter's performance, like everything else in the film, is gritty, real and heartbreakingly honest. Her death scene is stunning. Fuller's camera movements and location settings are particularly interesting. Fuller loved a good close-up, and PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is full of uncomfortable, cloistering tight shots that only enhance the tension of the plot. Fuller isn't afraid to let the camera linger on a shot for longer than standard Old-Hollywood really allowed, yet stunningly pulls away from Ritter's death scene to give the audience maximum impact. The urban locales and unusual, confronting camera angles give PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET, a bold, uncompromisingly modern look.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly tough noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Sam Fuller has something of a cult following, particularly in Europe. Yet the bulk of his films are more than forgettable. He did however direct one really terrific movie in "Pickup on South Street". Made pretty early on in his career, the movies that followed were vastly inferior.From the first to the last frame, "Pickup" works on all levels. It's filmed with flawless fluidity, boasting fine performances all round. Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter both players with a fine record of top notch performances, are at their peak. Widmark, who was no stranger at playing villains, while truly mean to the core, still manages to reveal just the slightest humanity which makes his character fascinating as well as making Jean Peters character's falling for him all the more credible.Fuller holds no punches in this genuinely tough movie. There is a scene in which Jean Peters get roughed up by Widmark. It's truly shocking in its reality. This is not a case of carefully choreographed photography.Less self conscious than many film noir's of the period this remains a great example of the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Skip McCoy" (Richard Widmark), is a common pickpocket who robs a woman named "Candy" (Jean Peters) and seizes a valuable microfilm containing state secrets. But "Candy" was under surveillance by government agents, so that "Skip" will become suspicious."Pickup on South Street" was one of the few films of Fuller financed by a studio (Fox). Written and directed by the author, was shot in NYC in 20 days with a low budget. He earned two nominations: Oscar for Best Supporting Actress (Thelma Ritter) and the Golden Lion at Venice.The film moves in dark environments and underground metro, wooden house suspended over the sea, apartment of Joel .... Speaking of murders, thieves, spies, FBI agents and, especially, of the Cold War that pitted the U.S. and the USSR. The action takes place in the context of this war, whose greatest exponents were the conventional and nuclear arms race and the actions of espionage and counterespionage. The theft of the portfolio "Candy" who takes one last favor to her former boyfriend who is a spy for the Soviet Union, a fact that "Candy" ignored, causing an incident involving Soviet spies and FBI agents against a thief driven by financial claims and indifferent to appeals to patriotism. The film speaks eloquently of criminal violence as an integral part of society and sincere love, inspiring generous actions.Its excellent music makes a decisive contribution to the creation of the climate of tension in which the action takes place. The photography is superb. Includes long sequences, a constant movement of the camera, limited space scenarios, and close-ups very expressive of the feelings of the protagonists. The opening scene of the robbery in the subway, is told in an extraordinary way. Interpretations of Widmark, Thelma Ritter and Peters are splendid. The script is made with a keen sense of synthesis and is based on a story by Dwight Taylor. The direction creates a work exciting, vibrant and intense, that once achieved great success of pubic and criticism.Classic Noir Film, located in a historic moment passed. It is the most accessible and most commercial film of the author and, at the same time, one of the best films of Noir American cinema of the 50s of the last century.</fullReview>

Unfortunately it's a microfilm that contains information that the Communists want to destroy America. Soon Skip has the police AND the communists after him for the film.Sparse, tough film noir. This movie is always moving and full of amoral characters. The direction is quick and excellent. The actors give the script their all. Widmark is superb as McCoy. He's tough and vicious (he purposely knocks Peters out at one point) but you see the vulnerability there too. Peters plays a ex-prostitute (no it's NOT spelled out for you--this was 1953 after all--but you can figure it out) and is superb. She's pushed around, threatened and brutally beaten at one point. She also has her loyalty to Skip and her violent boyfriend Joey (a young Richard Kiley) tested and she doesn't know WHO to trust! This is a tough role but she pulls it off. Also excellent is Thelma Ritter in an Oscar-nominated role as Moe Williams. She seems to know everything that's going on and has to figure who to tell...and who not too. Be warned--this is pretty violent for a 1953 film but it's still excellent and well worth seeing. I didn't quite believe the ending which is why I'm only giving it 9 stars instead of 10.</fullReview>

Everyone wants the pickpocket now -- the cops, the commies and our lady who's wallet was stolen in the first place.A taut noir crime thriller filled with great acting, smart dialog and a tense pace with very few dead spots. Unlike some noirs, no one seems cartoonishly tough or clever, everyone is just a bit vulnerable and gets their nose pushed in the dirt before long. The one thing that comes off as badly out of date now is the "better dead than red" sentiment expressed by most of the characters, especially the criminals. However, one aspect that does hold up well into the 21st century is the violence and cynicism, something the film was ironically knocked for by some critics back when it released. The best performance probably comes from "sassy old broad" Thelma Ritter, whom most people would know better as Jimmy Stewart's maid in Rear Window.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This crime thriller is sort of like a film noir, though changes the context from post-war to Cold War and has something relatively decent to say about humanity. In "Pickup on South Street", policemen are good guys, criminals are genuine guys, and the only enemies are "The Commies", who are ultimately differentiated from the good-guys in that they are emotionally personable, driven by an actual care for their own worth, as shown in the constant tracked-in close-ups that speckle the movie.This movie revolves around characters. The personalities in this film are rather unique and detailed: Skip the pick-pocket who is able to stare down any danger, and sometimes while going through their personal possessions; Moe the informer who is just trying to save up for a spectacular funeral, but who manages to capture the hearts and respect of nearly all the other characters (and the audience); Candy, the ill-named innocent girl who only thinks she's doing government work and doesn't fully comprehend the conspiracy she's involved with; and Joey, the ex-boyfriend evil Commie baddie who is trying to hide everything from everybody and, ironically, is the worst person at doing it. Throw in a bunch of very colorful supporting characters (such as the guy with the chopsticks and the policemen) and "Pickup on South Street" treats you to a splendor of personalities as they hunt down the mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilm frames.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally satisfying film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a spicy little piece of film-making from Sam Fuller which gives Richard Widmark the chance to show of some of his best, most edgy acting in the role of Skip McCoy, a small-time thief who stumbles onto a military secret while picking beautiful Candy's (Jean Peters) pocket on a crowded bus. It turns out Candy was doing a favor for her (ex?)boyfriend, who's working for the "commies".Superficially, there's a mystery here regarding Candy's motives and Skip spends much of the film determining her motives?. Actually he seems to just initially assume that she's a "commie", going so far as to pour beer in her face in a callous gesture. But the real question is ? what's going on with Skip? What are his motives, and why does Candy like him so much? Why do we (the audience) want to like him so much? Basically what the film-makers have done here is create a very striking "male fatale" in Widmark's character and his performance. Just as the male audience tends to ponder through the length of a film like "The Big Sleep" or "The Glass Key" along with the main characters whether the female character is trustworthy or just a pretty face, the film-makers have here created a similar quandary for female viewers. Widmark is handsome, and there's also a charm in his boyish insouciance ? but the first two times he meets our leading lady, he robs her and then punches her in the face. Eventually the question becomes ? would Skip sink so low as to sell out his country for a buck (his comments to the police, like "you're waving a flag at ME?" make us suspect he would) or is he simply out for revenge for the murder of his friend Moe (Thelma Ritter)? I'm not sure that the film gives us a conclusive answer either way.Thelma Ritter's character work deserves special mention ? she has created a truly indelible character here. Fuller isn't afraid to give her plenty of "business" ? in the form of physical objects that she uses to draw the audience into her world, particularly her used ties. Another example of Fuller's "business" would be the scene with Victor Perry (an actor I've seen elsewhere used to less effect) using the chopsticks to intimidate Candy.The emphasis on Moe's relationship with Skip provides one of cinema's most revealing "honor among thieves" themes. In fact Skip has the same kind of ease and the same kind of casual relationship with the police, with the notable exception of Capt. Tiger (Murvyn Vye) who has a grudge against him. I loved the scene where he invited the cops in by name and offered them a beer when they came to pick him up at his shack. Those are the kind of details that make this film feel real ? whether or not it really is "realistic" or whether that would matter are entirely separate questions.All told, I would say this is an essential crime film which displays a lot of the best and most durable attributes of the "film noir" school of film-making. A predictable plot is off-set by a host of colorful characters (uniformly well-performed), cheap sets are disguised by the film's unrelenting pace, and the final product feels a lot more substantial than it probably is. This is the best film I've seen so far by Sam Fuller and helps me to see better why he's regarded as a master director ? here he accomplished some things that I think he tried but ultimately failed to do in other films like "The Crimson Kimono" and "Shock Corridor" as far as very emphatic acting styles and really gripping suspense. This is one of my favorite performances from Widmark that I've seen so far ? and Widmark was a talent that I'm tempted to say (based on the few extraordinary films I've seen with him) was comparable to that of Alan Ladd or Humphrey Bogart, although arguably he didn't make as many classic films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Crown Jewel of 1950s Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Samuel Fuller brings his customary playful and stylish direction to this seedy, pulpy story and manages to create one of the undiscovered gems of 1950s cinema.Richard Widmark plays a petty thief tough guy (a role he perfected over the course of many movies), who snatches a young lady's (Jean Peters) wallet on a New York subway and with it a piece of much-wanted microfilm. This is 1953, so of course the microfilm is property of Commie spies who will stop at nothing to get it back. When the girl shows up at Widmark's waterfront shack, sent by an abusive boyfriend to reclaim the film, Widmark senses the opportunity to shake her and her "comrades" down for big money. The plot thickens, people start dying, and Widmark and Peters fall in love.Fuller handles the love story clumsily, but more from a sense of indifference than bad writing or direction. It's as if he included a love story under duress, and so made it intentionally unbelievable, as love stories so frequently were and still are in Hollywood films. Peters gives a remarkable performance as a tough New Yawk cookie, part gangster moll and part damsel in distress. When violence occurs against her, we genuinely care about her well being, and it's typical of Fuller's renegade, ahead-of-his-time style that a happy ending is not necessarily a foregone conclusion.But the ultimate success of "Pickup on South Street" rests squarely on the world-weary shoulders of Thelma Ritter, who plays Moe, a feisty lady who makes money any way she can, whether that be selling neckties or acting as a police informant. Ritter gives the performance of her career; in a breathtaking monologue, she conveys without ever directly addressing it the entire sad trajectory of her character's life, and the hopelessness she feels waking up every morning to a world of struggle, crime and hardship. It's as if every character Ritter ever played converges for one brief instant to give vent to all of the emotions they weren't given a chance to vent in those other movies. The scene is the highlight of Fuller's film, and a highlight of 50s cinema, period.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've reviewed many Noir films from the 40's and 50's, "Maltese Falcon" to the B film "Detour," and loved them all, and don't get me wrong, POSS held me all the way through; the problem with this film is it's ugly misogamy, which unfortunately lives on to some extent in the film industry.Sure, Noir films demand hardboiled punks and bimbo's of loose morals, but how many times is poor Jean Peter's, an okay doll, get punched in the face or shot in the belly. Come on, that's over-female-kill. That last scene after all the mayhem is just laughable.Okay, I know, the story in "Detour" didn't make any sense either. These films are vehicles for an American mythology. The men are tough, able to take a punch and give it back too. Yeah, that's an urban John Wayne for you. The women are essentially ladies of the evening in a cocktail dress with a heart of gold, not marriage material, so you can er, kiss 'em or beat 'em up if ya want depending on the hour. Can't lay a hand on mother material I guess.Richard Widmark is ludicrously cocky in his role of the pickpocket with brains. If his old man hadn't beat him to a pulp every day after reform school, things would have been different; he's smart enough to go to Harvard, but as it is, he enjoys cracking wise in the cop house. Ya got ta love a lug like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fuller, in his prime, was one of the most direct, bold-typed storytellers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what will probably find itself on my list of Fuller's best movies (that is, once I see more of them that just this and Shock Corridor), Pickup on South Street is a film noir where the femme fatale, as well as the male protagonist, are not the stereotypical ones in the genre. Like most of his other works, Fuller injects his own experiences and the sense of New York style that is usually absent in the Hollywood noirs. On a small budget- at least for the likes of Darryl F. Zanuck- Fuller and his actors create personas that are likable even in such a dark atmosphere. The good guys are basically the ones who won't get violent with you even as they're looking for an extra buck. Richard Widmark, Jean Peters, and Thelma Ritter are all terrific in the lead parts. Widmark is one only a few actors I can think of who could've really pulled off this character. He's a little like Bugs Bunny, as he can be a wise-ass who is a little sneaky. On the other hand, the character of Skip McCoy does have a set of values in his life. He doesn't go into other people's affairs, and doesn't try and care about much of the working world outside of his little shack on the river, after being sent away for three years. He slips up, unbeknownst to him, when he pickpockets a woman (Peters) on the train, and lifts an item that's under the eye of the Government. It may have some secrets that could make him a lot of money. But at what cost is the centerpiece of the film, as it involves stoolie Moe (Ritter is one of the finest, and most believable, character actors from the period), the woman's ex (a volatile Kiley), and the police department.Aside from the thematic elements, which are told with a keen dramatic, journalistic style (as was Fuller's previous position, along with boxer), the dialog is fresh and involving. There's a spontaneity in many of Fuller's camera moves. And what a third act. This is a lean, tight film-noir that is worth checking out even if you're not familiar with Fuller (it's comparatively less bizarre than some of his later works).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1953 Sam Fuller movie contains some of his best work, and its sad that he couldn't continue to get the backing of major Hollywood studios to do his stuff. The story line goes something like this. A tough hard broad (read prostitute) is riding the subway one hot summer day, and gets her pocketbook picked by Skip McCoy. What Skip (and the dame) don't realize is that she is also carrying some microfilm to be passed to commie spies. This opening shot without dialogue, and mostly in tight close-ups is a beaut,one of the many that Fuller uses throughout the movie. Playing the babe known as Candy is Jean Peters, who was never better nor better looking. One forgets how beautiful she was, and she handles this role very well. The Pickpocket is played by Richard Widmark, who had already made his mark, and set his style with 1947's Kiss Of Death as the crazy creep with the creepy laugh, and although he's a little "softer" here, he's still scary. These hard edged characters do have soft spots here and there, but its noir and nasty all the way. The standout performance belongs to the wonderful Thelma Ritter,who plays Moe the stoolie saving up her dough to pay for her own funeral. Ritter received a well deserved Oscar nomination for her performance, but lost out to the boring but popular performance of Donna Reed as the B girl (read prostitute) in "From Here To Eternity." Hollywood loves it when a good girl goes bad, and loves to Oscar them even though their performance is usually awful. See for instance Shirley Jones in "Elmer Gantry. Set among the docks and dives of New York City, with crisp black and white photography by the great Joe MacDonald,and some very good art direction. Especially good is the set representing the New York City subways and Widmark's shack near the river. Made at the height of the cold war and red scare, the villian of the piece is the ordinary looking commie, played by Richard Kiley who is much more dangerous than the pickpocket who is a criminal but is just trying to make a living and above all is a loyal American.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thelma Ritter did steal the picture. I just finished watching it again. I couldn't help becoming emotional in her final scene. She didn't get the Oscar. That's why you shouldn't put too much faith in Oscars. Richard Widmark never had a better part and was perfect casting as a 3-D, flawed human being. Jean Peters was great as the streetwise, tough girl in her best role ever. And Richard Kiley must have been very good; why else would I have hated him so. Yes, it was heavy handed on the patriotism; but, without it, you don't have much of a film. Watch their faces! The top three stars didn't really need much script. I would like to have seen them do this film without dialogue. If you've ever seen Ray Milland and Rita Gam in "The Thief", maybe you know what I mean. When I was a kid in 1956 on my first trip to NYC, I made my Bronx uncle drive us to the foot of South Street looking for No. 66. That's when I knew that Hollywood couldn't be trusted. But I did find the river.I'm not giving away much of the story because I hate it when I know what happens before I see it for myself. If you have seen it, no elucidation is necessary. Just maybe, someone who is reading these comments hasn't seen "Pickup On South Street". You will like it; just don't go looking for 66 South Street in New York City.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and anyone who watches this film will agree. This film was directed in the days when plot, character believability and theme actually mattered.Jean Peters, Widmark, and Thelma Ritter steal the spotlight. Ritter is in top form as informer "Moe" she survives in the Bowery section of NY, acting as a stool pigeon for NYC police.The only other film in which I have seen Peters is "Niagara", and she certainly proves her acting ability here, complete with Brooklyn accent. Widmark is appropriately menacing, as the anti-hero who must discern what the right thing is, despite his need for cash.The photography is brilliant. The neon, the subway station (though it looks cleaner than the real thing!) the harbor shack where Widmark lives as a transient. Excellent use is made of the city, with "Lightning Louie" in Chinatown; the many flavors and appetites of the city are addressed here; the political climate of the time is a haunting backdrop. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Widmark is a tainted character in this movie. He is a professional pickpocket. He's been in prison three times, yet at the beginning of the film, he tries to make it four. Thelma Ritter is a busy body selling information to almost everybody. Jean Peters is amazing as the girl flamed by Widmark.This is a period piece during the McCarthy era where the Red Scare ruled the politics and is worked into this plot quite nicely. What is unusual about this film is that Peters &amp; Ritter are both victims of violent beatings in an era where women were seldom more than sex objects in films. This is what makes this film noir as women often got different roles in this type of film.The film is only 87 minutes long and was obviously made by Fox as the under card for double features in the theater. The sets show it is a limited budget film. The script made J Edgar Hoover mad because patriotism is given short shrift. Hoover wanted it changed.Instead, it became a B under card picture that was a sleeper hit in 1953. The script &amp; acting in it are better than other big features were that year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the dated themes, the film-making style is remarkably ahead of its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Samuel Fuller is an interesting filmmaker, mainly because he had some very inconsistent politics in his films. While "Shock Corridor" and "The Naked Kiss" represented the hypocrisies and lunacy of America and "The Big Red One" was an effective portrait of the horrors of war, "Merrill's Marauders" painted war as necessary hell and "Pickup on South Street" is about the dangers of communist spies. All of his films make for very entertaining viewing, and even though he was often pigeonholed as a b-filmmaker, Fuller was just as good as any of the major studio contractors. "Pickup on South Street" is no exception, and despite the dated themes, the film-making style is remarkably ahead of its time. Its also a very quickly-pace, tight, and occasionally brutal film noir.The acting across the board is fantastic. Richard Widmark makes for a great anti-hero and Jean Peters is quite sexy as a girl who works for her communist spy boyfriend. The show stealer is Thlema Ritter however, in an absolutely delightful performance as a police stoolie. The angles Fuller employs are great, making the acting sequences all the more exciting and brutal (this is very violent for its time). The camera continuously moves around just as Tarantino and his school would do forty years later. "Pickup on South Street" is a great action-paced noir thriller. "Shock Corridor" remains my favorite Fuller film, but this is a very close second. (8/10)</fullReview>

Pickup on South Street(1953) gets a hard bitten but sensitive performance from Richard Widmark. His portrayal of a pickpocker foreshadows the life of a pickpocket criminal in Robert Bresson's Pickpocket(1959). Thelma Ritter gives a gentle and tragic performance in the role of Moe.

		<fullReview>Another title that improves more and more with repeated viewings. Fuller with the cinematography of Joseph MacDonald (Niagara, Call Northside 777, Panic in the Streets, My Darling Clementine, Viva Zapata!, Yellow Sky, The Street with No Name, The Dark Corner) combines the great 20th Century Fox studio set design seamlessly with stock NYC location footage to depict a very believe-able 3 layered Manhattan. From vaulting suspension bridges overhead, against a backdrop of Brooklyn waterfront warehouses across to a lower East Side, East River, pier- scape, with a catwalk to a crumbling bait shack, butted up to the border of Chinatown with its grifters, flophouses, cigarette machines, B-girls, and tattoo parlors perched above the labyrinthine passages of the subways with their human drain ways from the surface.After a station stop where various riders both exit and enter the car as the train starts and sways we watch as patches of Widmark, a hat brim, a corer of his eye, come into view as he jostles his way through the car of commuters... until he stands opposite floozie "I've "kissed" a lot of guys" Peters.All of the major actors are great in their roles. Ritter in probably her best performance as Moe, she is sly, shrewd, and funny in her scenes with G Man Bouchey and cop Vye, woman to woman matter of fact with Peters, motherly with Widmark, fearless with Kiley. Fuller did an outstanding job on the screenplay and was spot on in the dialogs.Other highlights, watch for Peters dickering with Vic Perry (Lightning Louie) in a Chinese restaurant ( Perry I've read was a real pick-pocket and was a technical adviser on that aspect of the movie.), and the brutal fight Peters has with Kiley.Widmark is most excellent in the culmination of all his three time looser wise ass roles, and there is real chemistry in the on screen relationship between Widmark and Peters that sparks once they quit playing each other while jockeying for the microfilm . Some question the transition to romance, but it's meant to be a little off the wall. Moe points out how Skip is some kind of chick magnate. Moe she can't figure how women seem to fall for him, I'd say it is probably the most successful depiction of a relationship in a noir, and Fuller gives it plenty of time to marinate and stew. If it survives past the end credits is anybody's guess, but the deck is stacked against them. Peters is a real cutie in this, its a shame she cut her career way too short.Great score by Leigh Harline, Another 10/10 for me. The demise of the studio system really is apparent in Fullers later noirs</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice little crime flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pickup on South Street stands out from a lot of other 1950's crime flicks in my opinion because of the fact that it's so simple. Too many films of this ilk get bogged down in too many characters or a convoluted plot line; but Samuel Fuller's film keeps it simple throughout and this does it no end of favours. Instead of dishing out a detailed plot, this film gives the details by way of it's characters. The menagerie of personalities and their various quirks are what make this film great. It's just little things such as the way the main character lives in a boathouse, or the way that 'Lightning Louie' picks his money up with chopsticks. Little things like that make the movie cool, and these are the things that I will best remember it for. The plot follows the tribulations surrounding a piece of film. The Commies want it, but the police know; and when master pickpocket Skip McCoy takes it upon himself to pinch the purse holding the film, things become more complicated as the pickpocket himself is drawn into the plot. The police want the film, and the Commies want it back...Skip finds himself caught in the middle.The simple plot allows the director more time to implement suspense into the movie without being caught up in plot details, and that once again shows the beauty of the simple plotting. About half way through, the film veers off into something of a capitalist vs. communist war, which adequately reflects the time in which the film was made. Normally, things like this would get on my nerves as capitalist ideals tend to be tightly wrapped in sentimental American values, which annoys me; but this film takes it's Cold War theme and merely uses it, rather than trying to provoke a response from the audience. In this way, the theme is a help rather than a hindrance, and while the whole 'Commies vs. Capitalists' thing is rather out of date these days; it provides the film with a nice backbone. One criticism that could be made of the film is that it gets a bit silly at times, with some events being totally unrealistic. However, you've got to expect some scenes like that in a film like this, and the fact that the ensemble cast comes together brilliantly ensures that the film stays on an even keel for most of it's running time. Overall, this isn't genre redefining or a masterpiece; but it's a nice little crime flick and fans of this sort of film will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quintessential film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film takes the noir genre just about to its limits. For its time, it was about as brutal and violent as a film could be and not violate the code. Richard Widmark, who had already made his mark playing giggling psychopaths, at first appears to be continuing with that type. However, the character he plays appears to have a code after all, but don't all the noir antiheroes? The Jean Peters character has a code as well; she can tolerate thieves and scumbags, but not traitors (read Communists). The Widmark character doesn't even care about that, but he draws the line when an essentially good hearted person is brutally murdered.In addition to being a film noir, this is also a relic of the cold war, although that is essentially a subplot. The assumption, of course, is that all Communists are spies as well, which is probably what a majority of Americans believed at the time. Well worth seeing. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Other reviewers have gone in depth about this film and did it beautifully. I would like to add that blond, chiseled Richard Widmark's straight-forward delivery and darting eyes make him one of the most overlooked actors in the history of film. Sexy, tough, and vulnerable with a nervous intensity shooting through him in every role; his pickpocket here is as memorable as Bogart's Sam Spade.  Thelma Ritter's remarkably timeless performance is a lesson on how actors can fill small scenes with so much information you feel as though you know them. Her tired eyes and seasoned voice stay with you long after the movie has ended and she did it all without a trace of sentimentality or pleading. WARNING!!! Slight spoiler ahead!!! While Fuller gets his story told effectively with dark lighting and tense close ups, it's one scene that stands out. When Richard Kiley roughs up Jean Seberg (also stunning) around her apartment it's done in a take where the camera never moves. We just watch two actors go at it (if you will) and the effect is gritty and thrilling. If that scene were done today, it would be presented from cloying camera angles with a thousand cuts.  A great movie that also serves as a reminder about filmmaking and acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Widmark is a pickpocket who picks the wrong pocket in "Pickup on South Street," also starring Jean Peters, Richard Kiley, and Thelma Ritter. It's a sleazy drama set in New York City's grimiest spots - the subway, the docks, and cheap apartments. Widmark is an expert pickpocket who steals Jean Peters' wallet on the subway while she's delivering film for her ex-boyfriend, Richard Kiley. She doesn't know it, but Kiley is giving information to the Communists, and she's being watched by the police. With the help of a street woman named Moe, who knows the technique of all the big "snitches," Widmark is quickly identified, and soon Peters and the police are separately after the film he's hiding."Pickup on South Street" captures the crowded, dingy subways of New York and its dark piers beautifully, and the performances are terrific. In this, Jean Peters is not the virginal peasant girl of "The Captain from Castile" or the housewife in "Niagara," but a tough, sexy, streetwise woman. Not knowing much about her history with 20th Century Fox, it's amazing that she really didn't become a major star with the studio. Richard Widmark is perfect as the sly pickpocket, and a very young Richard Kiley is excellent as a Peters' frightened ex.The film was made in the midst of the Communist scare that had taken hold of the U.S. in the '50s but it's not the bad commies against the good citizens. In the amazing world painted by Fuller of dark corners, shadows, and violence, there remains humanity. There are still some things that cannot be bought at any price, and in the worst of us, the sacrifices of others can spark some goodness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Post WWII Film-Noir spy drama set in New York City with three-time loser and just released pick-pocket artist Skip McCoy, Richard Widmark, lifting a purse that contained an important piece of microfilm off Candy, Jean Peters, on the New York City Subway. Candy thinks that the microfilm is from a rival corporation of her boyfriends employer. What Candy doesn't know is that her boyfriend Joey, Richard Kiley, is a commie spy and that the film is top secret US government information that he's passing off to his commie contacts in the Soviet Union! Neither does Skip. Superior cold war espionage suspense drama from the 1950's by director Samuel Fuller without the over-the-top super patriotism that was so common in spy movies back in those days. Both Skip and Candy and later police tipster "Moe" Williams, Thelma Ritter, act like normal people caught up with something thats far more dangerous that they at first thought. Candy trying to get the film back from Skip after she's told where he lives, off a pier on the East River, by Moe later realizes that she's helping the communists not her boyfriends corporation and tries to get Skip to return the film to the local police and F.B.I. Skip at first doesn't believe Candy and a he same time is too smart to keep it all in one place which makes it impossible for Candy or anyone else, like Joey &amp; Co, to get all the microfilm at one time. Later Candy, who now realized what she was involved with, after not getting anywhere with Skip in having him return the film to the police knocks him out and returns it to Joey. Candy is helping to set him up with the police by getting Joey to expose his commie contacts. It turns that the most important frame of the microfilm was missing and with that Joey realized that he was being set by Candy and at first brutally beat and then shoots her leaving her for dead. It's then that he made his escape via a dumbwaiter in her apartment killing one of the policemen who was in on the raid. Skip going to the hospital where Candy was recovering realizes that she risked her life by giving Joey his wrong address when he later went to murder Skip and grab the microfilm.Joey after he found that the address that Candy gave him was a lie found out where Moe lived and after not being able to get her to tell him Skip's whereabouts blew her brains out. Moe who was slated to be buried in 'Potter's Field' ended up getting a proper burial for giving her life in protecting Skip as well as keeping Joey from getting the film to his commie cohorts.Exciting final sequence in the subway with Skip and Joey slugging it out after Joey's gun was lifted by Skip making the fight between the two even. Both Skip and Candy, as well as the doomed Moe, who were at odds with each other at the beginning of the movie realized later that they were all working for the same. Together they put an end to the commie spy ring that Joey was involved with.I really liked the theme song "Again" that Samuel Fuller used that was very effective as well as moving in the romantic scenes in the film between Skip and Candy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Was a Pickpocket For the FBI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pickup On South Street is yet another of cult director Sam Fuller's takes on the Cold War, as pickpocket Richard Widmark steals some microfilm that contains information vital to the Communists (who are, naturally, everywhere), who, along with the FBI, are looking for Widmark, who is not, as one might imagine, a very patriotic fellow. This is a strangely intense, violent film, done on a medium budget, featuring fine acting by Widmark, leading lady Jean Peters, and especially character actress Thelma Ritter, who has never been better than she is here. As usual, Fuller plunges into the center of the action in what must have been a tight shoot, as everything seems to happen in small rooms, cabins and police stations. As this was a studio picture, the movie never really breaks out into the kind of mad romp Fuller movies tend to become, and is rather sedate by his standards. However, sedate Fuller is still Fuller, and there are some wild scenes in this one; and the encounters between Peters and Widmark seethe with tension. For fans of the offbeat, this poker-faced parody of fifties paranoia is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Widmark routs the Commies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very good way of avoiding the blacklist was for liberal leaning actors like Richard Widmark to make anti-Communist films. Some of the films of this nature were pretty laughable, but not Pickup On South Street, which maybe could have been better if someone like Alfred Hitchcock directed it. Nevertheless Samuel Fuller did quite all right.Widmark is a pickpocket, if you believe stoolie Thelma Ritter, one of the best in his trade. One fine day on the subway he lifts Jean Peters purse and screws up everything for the Reds and for the FBI. Peters was duped into being a courier by Richard Kiley who was having her deliver a piece of microfilm. Peters thinks this is industrial espionage. And the FBI was already on to Kiley and Peters, they just wanted to catch their contact. Widmark made one holy mess of it.As the NYPD, the FBI, and the Reds start their hunt for Widmark, everyone starts going off on their own tangents. During the course of things, Peters and Widmark fall for each other. Sounds pretty improbable, but they actually make it work.Pickup on South Street is memorable for the performance of Thelma Ritter who lives on what she earns as a stoolie to whomever pays, underworld or cops. It's a comic/tragic performance of a poor soul just scratching for what she can live on. Her death scene is very haunting. Ritter got the film's sole Academy Award nomination in the Best Supporting Actress category, but lost to Donna Reed for From Here to Eternity.Murvyn Vye is very good as the cop who's made the apprehension of Richard Widmark his life's crusade. Willis Bouchey is as always the voice of moral authority as the FBI man. You'll like the ending as Widmark uses his professional skills on the side of the red, white, and blue. We all each serve in our different ways.</fullReview>

At a a time of MacCarthyism run rampant, pickup on south street shows the Communists to be clumsy bunglers just as clumsy as the cops. Richard Widmark and peters were just great but that fine actress Thelma Ritter stole the show as a police informer. Fuller's message seemed to be: the Commies are as human as the rest of us and just as capable of making fools of themselves. They are not 10 feet tall.I thought the violence at the end the weakest part of the movie. The fight scene between Richard Widmark and Richard Kiley was too drawn out. It failed to add anything to the drama. A Hollywood ending with Peters and Widmark going off together was a little too slick and emblematic of its time. Still. the dramatic points the film makes were well done and at times brilliantly acted. Particularly the scenes with Thelma Ritter and Jean Peters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece - but masterpiece of what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Fuller's greatest. But people who are looking for some preconceived notion of veracity should just forget it - don't even bother. Please, spend the rest of your film noir life with Double Indemnity or Out of the Past. They will fulfill your genre expectations. This is a work from the same world of American Experimentalism that produced such composers as Harry Partch or Conlon Nancarrow. This is a film about kineticism - pure and simple. Fuller keeps the reins on the form from beginning to end and it flows like a trash symphony. The rhythm of the film is its greatest quality, from the first shot of the subway to the fight on the subway platform. And Fuller's understanding of his characters is awesome. Grifters and pickpockets are seen as members of a subterranean economy. Judgement is not Fuller's MO. And the sympathy for Thelma Ritter's character Moe, tinged with beautiful Fullerian irony ("If I had to be buried in Potter's Field it would just about kill me") is classic, as is Ritter's performance - possibly the best in a Fuller film. The links between sex and brutality in the Widmark/Peters relationship are amazing - when he pours that bottle of beer over her face while she's lying on the floor unconscious, a cigar is not only a cigar. The compositions and angles are classic noir-isms but this film is not overly concerned with pictorialism. The images serve the philosophy of this movie, such as it is. And that's what I'd like to elucidate - if I could. There's something abstract in Fuller's work - the musical flow. And yet, he also has key narrative elements which occur in each of his movies. Perhaps Andrew Sarris said it best: "Fuller belongs to the cinema, and not to literature and sociology."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much red-baiting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director and cast have got the noir style down. But...what ruined the movie for me, really ruined it, is the fact that the film ends up playing like an anti-communist propaganda piece. The communist boyfriend starts off as just a coward--he sends his naive ex-girlfriend to do /everything/, because it's too risky for him to do it. And he ends up as a monster, only good at bullying women and even then only with a gun. And the ending? We are supposed to believe that for the love of a woman, the pickpocket becomes a moral example compared to the red commie? For film students and the red-state-of-mind only (who must call it a crime drama, not "noir", which is a French word after all).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, But Not Worth The Price</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing about this film that bums me out is that the DVD is so expensive. It's too much for my budget at the moment, or I would purchase it, because the film is a good example of film noir...and I enjoy watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter.Criterion produces great DVDs but sometimes the asking price is just a bit much. That's the case here for an 80-minute black-and-white, mono sound film that is good but nothing extraordinary, cinematography-wise.The story is the story here (as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a pickpocket (Widmark) inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering Peters' purse. (say that three times!). Everyone but Peters is a believable character in this movie: Widmark, the cops, the U.S. agents and the Communists and, especially Ritter as "Moe," an informant. She and Widmark are the stars of this film.Peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by "falling in love" with Widmark on the first meeting even though he's nasty to her. Only in world of film!! Too bad, because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it.This an average film noir which means good, but not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of $25-$35. For that price, one could do a lot better in the film noir market.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flagwaving pickpocket helps in the war on communism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Widmark comes through again doing his hardass routine. After what he thought was a routine purse robbing on a train, a well known thief finds he has taken more than a wad of change. Caught between the law and a desperate traitor he must figure out where his loyalties lie - money or country. Good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolutely awful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot believe a film this awful has received so many positive comments from people. 1950's were not years during which Hollywood could not have produced a more reasonable film. a gangster who is supposedly an agent as well, gets his gun taken out of his inner pocket and does not feel it? The woman is punched by the man who's picked her bag and she kisses him passionately and falls in love with him right after the punch? i think the only reason why this film has received the attention it got would have been due to its anti communist story and absolutely nothing else. Thelma Ritter got an Oscar nomination for her minuscule part when you can clearly see her looking into the camera whilst she is talking to the officers. what on earth could have been happening to Hollywood during 1953 only heavens knows. The performances are very wooden, the plot is terrible and the direction is one of the worst ever seen when you compare this film with others in the period in particular Fuller's own other works. there are so many holes in the plot that you just want to get up and throw the TV out of the window. Just because it's Fuller's or it's a film noir does not mean it's any good. in my opinion it is one of the worst i have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What were they thinking?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was such a disaster - how does Fuller sleep at night??? A dull and predictable plot mingled with appalling acting and choreography worthy of a Carry On skit!! Such a shame when actresses are chosen purely for looks rather than acting talent. I have never yet been truly bored by a film but this one takes the cake - shot in 20 days...and it shows!!! ( I have just mailed a list of continuity errors which I picked up while watching the film - goodness knows how many there'd be if I'd actually been looking!!! Be warned though, they DO contain spoilers.) Please do, however, watch this film yourself and make up your own mind - if you make it through to the end you have my admiration, I only just made it myself, but I will not be watching another Fuller film based on what I saw yesterday. Enjoy!</fullReview>
