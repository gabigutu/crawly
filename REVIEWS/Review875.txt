		<shortDescription>Michael Moore Scores a perfect 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always enjoy watching Michael's movies. But I think this my be his best work to date. Don't be fooled by the tittle. This is a thought provoking movie that really opens your eyes to a lot of things and makes you think long and hard about our priorities. In true Michael fashion we get lots of laughs and a lot of smart humor. Everybody should see this movie and judge it for themselves. Don't watch it with any preconceived notions and based on your political view point. Non partisanship is mandatory if you want to get the most from this film. And no matter on your point of view I assure you that you will learn something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like Mr. Moore's previous works, brilliant, raw and based on the truth and statistics. The contrast was overwhelming and sickening but he finished it on a positive note. That if only we realize we, the people, realize we have all that it takes, we can bring the wall down, one hammer and chisel at a time. But as one of the guys in the movie said we have "a long way to go". He covered all the relevant issues of our today's society, from women's equal pay to nutrition, from student loans to bankers getting away with murder, from criminalization of drugs and its connection to race to police brutality, from an overworked and underpaid society to disappearance of middle class, from capital punishment to mistreatment of the incarcerated, and more....It is eye-opening and educational, to say the least and makes you wonder why we we "go home and are okay" with all of this. Because "nobody should be".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant and Counter-intuitive Strategies for Success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What if the United States invaded other countries not in order to control people, but to learn from them?! Moore, in a mostly positive yet still humorous, sarcastic and witty bent, leads the charge into other countries. He liberates many brilliant and counter-intuitive strategies for success. It is shocking, even to people who think they know these strategies already.The invasion of Italy comes first. Here we see that the clash between the company and the well-being of its employees, in pay, vacation, family health and more, is a total fallacy. Kids in Finland have no standardized tests, no private schools and even no homework. Kids are treated with respect, like adults really, and have more time to play and be kids. And yet Finland is no slouch when it comes to education and in fact they lead the world here. In France kids are provided with healthy school lunches that we consider gourmet, yet for the French it is just a decent meal. Germany and its companies support a strong middle class by providing all workers with great pay and lots of vacation time. This is so even with less hours worked per week. Companies even encourage unions and furnish employees with spas. "If you give workers power," says a company leader "it is better for everyone."Slovenia, among other countries, provides free college to everyone, even foreigners. Slovenian officials were at the theater handing out applications. No one is penalized for using drugs in Portugal, and the country is not drowning in anarchy or crime. Women have equal rights in Tunisia. Prisoners in Norway have their own cabins and lawn chairs in the sunlight. They cook their own meals and are free to roam around with barely any security personnel present. Even in the country's maximum security prison there are open rooms. Moore contrasted this with videos of U.S. prison beatings and other harsh treatments. What if the Lehman Brothers were the Lehman Sisters?! Iceland shows us how this might play out.Moore offered little to counter his ideas, yet we hear too much about such counter points already. The mainstream media, said Moore, is adept at showing us how bad the world is. He thinks this can be fixed. These ideas from other countries are not just good, they are already in use. And they are not just in use, they allow other countries to excel and lead the world. Many of these ideas are American ideas, but out of fear or ignorance they are not used in America. All Americans should see this. Four and a half of five stars. World premiere seen at the Toronto International Film Festival 2015.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your enjoyment will be in 100% accordance with your appreciation of Michael Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was worth waiting nearly three hours in a rush line to catch a screening of this film at TIFF. Mike was there, and when he mentioned before the screening that he made this movie entirely with his own money because he wanted 100% control of it, my expectations were immediately elevated.And definitely rewarded. Whatever your favorite Moore outing is, I can tell you that this film compares favorably to it. But what really made this a memorable experience for me was that after the movie, Moore invited the entire audience to a ticket-holders Q &amp; A with drinks and refreshments at a pub close by. I had to skip the next movie on my docket in order to attend, but I sure wasn't going to miss this! The movie might be called "Non-American Exceptionalism." In it, he "invades" a host of (mostly European) countries to "capture" their best ideas. These ideas turn out to be systems ? be they economic, institutional, educational, penal, etc. ? where desirable ends that could never be realized in America are par for the course. It can be a prosperous factory in Italy where the workers are well-paid and get fantastic benefits ? it can be the cost-effective school lunch program in France where kids get chef-made gourmet meals every day ? it can be the free college in Slovenia ... you get the gist. While Moore doesn't pretend that these countries have no problems (watch the right-wing media say otherwise), his examples certainly seem to be "winners" that he invites scrutiny of.What's likely to be most controversial about this movie is one of the conclusions he draws: that systems seem to work better when women are involved in the decision-making process. When I asked him at the Q &amp; A how he thought Fox was going to spin this film, he said that with the female-friendly theme, they'll probably say that it's a campaign commercial for Hillary. (For the record, his hero female politician is Elizabeth Warren).Obviously, your potential enjoyment of this film is completely Moore-dependent. If you've ever enjoyed one of his provocateur films, you can put this one down as a sure thing; if you're one of his detractors, this will make you resent him all the more. Seeing this as a member of the former group and getting to attend a one-of-a-kind Q &amp; A afterward definitely made this one of my all-time TIFF outings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Docu of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing is with this Michael Moore's latest docu, I'm a liberal, so he's basically preaching to the converted. So the best way for this film to have the most impact is for it to screen in regions of the U.S.A. where there's big demographics that want status quo, that blame the minorities for the economy, that are still gung-ho about endless wars.From "Roger &amp; Me," to "Bowling For Columbine," to "Sicko" to "Fahrenheit 911" and now "Where To Invade Next," Michael Moore knows which buttons to push to tick off the right wingers. Don't get me wrong, I love this country, this good ol' US of A but let's not be ignorant, let's not be in denial, let's not forget the fact that we are also responsible for lots of atrocities, many of which are currently happening, including our idea of going to one war after another after another, toppling one dictator after another dictator after another. We invaded Iraq. which didn't attack us on 9/11 by the way, with the plan of stealing their oil and look what happens now, we're still paying the consequences of the lives and expense we've lost there, and terrorism fill the political vacuum and wages war on us. WHERE TO INVADE NEXT is basically Michael Moore invading major modern nations and playfully stealing their ideas that work, ideas that improve the lives of their citizens.It's sad really when you think about it. It's sad that we are supposed to be the richest most powerful country in the world and yet many of our middle-class are disappearing and the poor don't have a leg up to get themselves out of poverty. Italy gives their newly mothers five months of paid maternity leave. The education system in Norway get rid of standardized testing and instead they improve on poetry, art, and music, basically stuff on which Americas education system often cuts funding. Portugal has done away with death penalty. Even a moslem country in Tunisia can have their conservative and liberal parties work together to pass laws that would improve the lives of their citizens. Germany has free college tuition and universal health care.Watching WHERE TO INVADE NEXT makes you envy these other neighboring countries, they get to live the American dream while we here cannot. The government should be by the people, of the people and for the people, NOT for the greedy few but that is unfortunately what's happening in our country. In the U.S., the greedy few on top gamble with our money and they fail or when the bubble burst, like in 2008, it's our taxpayers money that bailed them out. The CEOs responsible were never convicted of their crime. Speaking of taxes, most of our taxes go to military, and yet the politicians make it seem like we cannot afford such things as universal health care and universal college.Another thing that WHERE TO INVADE NEXT points out is that we Americans have become arrogant. We think that we are the good guys so much so that everything we do cannot be wrong. We have bought into our own exceptionalism that we choose to not learn from other countries anymore. We forget to learn from our own history. WHERE TO INVADE NEXT goes straight for the truth, it's Michael Moore's funniest yet, but it's funny in a way that leaves a feeling a self-retrospect in you. It's eye-opening. I hope my fellow millennials get to see WHERE TO INVADE NEXT, and then do their research, learn from history and then take a stand and do something about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We Americans have a lot to learn from other cultures. Most Americans think they are "the best" in the world - IN EVERYTHING - AND THAT'S UTTER NONSENSE! It's a form of social control used by various elites to keep the average American from knowing what is possible with the great wealth and power our country has accumulated. We have been brainwashed into taking crumbs and believing that's all we deserve from our society.We are also deliberately kept ignorant about the rest of the world and how much better many countries treat their citizens - since our school systems pretend that most of the world outside of Mexico, Canada and a few large countries in Europe and Asia - simply doesn't exist. It outrageous. We are such fools! I'm an extremely well-informed person and I didn't even know about half of what Michael Moore mentioned in his film! I can only imagine all the dunderheads out there who have never even heard the names of some of the countries mentioned in Where To Invade Next! Be curious about the rest of the world.

		<shortDescription>Hilariously Fun to Watch with Unexpected Twists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't just a great documentary, it's a great film, with jaw dropping reveals and unexpected twists. By about 5 minutes into the film I was hooked and at the edge of my seat as the rest of the two hours flew by; I didn't want it to end, which is always a good sign. To be clear, this film is not about U.S. military interventions like Fahrenheit 9/11, as I suspected, but rather an ironic look into the discordance between American values and American actions; not abroad but at home. It takes us outside our world only to look back at ourselves as if we were strangers. We get to see our values around health, education, incarceration, violence, and fairness in a new light. And, without giving too much away, the film culminates with a big twist that is marvelously compelling. As a result, this film has stuck with me. It has been months since I first saw the film at the Chicago International Film Festival, where it won the Founder's Award, and I find myself thinking about the film at least weekly, which finally prompted me to write this short review. I'm telling everyone I meet to see this film, and to bring their friends, kids, neighbors. Plan some time to talk afterward! I can't wait to see it again myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny Michael Moore is Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many words one might use to describe filmmaker/documentarian Michael Moore and 'preachy' might just be one of them. His films, Fahrenheit 9/11, Bowling for Columbine, Sicko?were all highly entertaining and even educational for the peripherally blind. But Moore had lost his fun side. There were moments of levity in each of his films but the humor on display in his first feature Roger &amp; Me had been replaced with a political or prejudice view Moore hoped to express.Moore's latest documentary, Where To Invade Next takes us back to the fun and wit that made his earlier work so refreshingly entertaining. In this his eighth feature documentary (but first in six years), Moore travels to Europe where he visits countries that seem to have captured the American dream of a work/life balance. We travel with Moore to Germany where we find small companies who pay big wages, to Italy where employees are given more weeks annual vacation than an American can hope for over a five year period and to Slovenia which offers free university tuition. Moore then presents a mock 'invasion' of the country which is presented in a hilarious tongue-in-cheek style of filmmaking.The presentation does not feel preachy nor does it appear anti-American. Instead, Moore is able to casually walk the line of presenting lifestyles, politics and privileges in other countries that American's dream of or have tied up in political limbo. That's not to suggest that Moore doesn't show the underbelly of the giant. The European way of life may not be sustainable in the long term due to the expense of the support. And Europe is still not without its issues to which Moore is quick to point out to rousing audiences.A tad overlong at 2 hours, Where to Invade Next is arguably Michael Moore's most enjoyable film. We are not looking at the ravages of the auto industry on Flint Michigan or how sick individuals are denied health care. Here, we take a jovial look at the things that look like a shopping bag of perfect put into a soggy paper bag about to collapse. Moore has an energy and an enthusiasm here that he hasn't shown in years and the results had the audience at the Toronto International Film Festival up off their seats in lauding applause at the conclusion of the screening.http://theintestinalfortitude.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American exceptionalism may not be as exceptional as people think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are at all interested in six weeks of paid vacation, an extra month's salary and a two-hour lunch break, you just might have to go to Italy to find it. Filmmaker Michael Moore ("Capitalism: A Love Story," "Sicko"), a welcome voice for sanity, returns to the big screen in his first film in seven years to tell us that perks like this exist, just not in the United States. His latest documentary, Where to Invade Next, is a satiric look at what much of the world has to offer that is not available here. Underneath all the wit, however, the film has a serious purpose, calling our attention to what works and what doesn't work in society, regardless of what may be considered the "right" thing to do and the label you might put on it. In simple terms, so-called American exceptionalism is often not as exceptional as most people think.Though the title of the film may suggest an exposé of the government's penchant for endless war, Moore has something else in mind. His intention is to show how other nations treat their citizens in the workplace, schools, and prisons, including their attitudes towards women and sex, leaving it to the viewer to make comparisons. In the opening scene, a tongue-in-cheek Moore is summoned to appear before the Joint Chiefs of Staff to offer his advice on how to stop losing wars. His suggestion is to allow him to conduct the invasions from now on, pledging to do better. Taking his camera crew to Italy, France, Finland, Slovenia, Tunisia, Portugal, Iceland, and Germany, he interviews workers, teachers, students, CEOs, government officials, and ordinary folks who tell him about the advantages they have.When he departs the country, he makes sure to plant the American flag to signal his success in stealing its ideas. Though Moore's bewildered, "are you kidding me?" shtick becomes a bit tiresome by the end, it mostly suits the "wow" nature of what he uncovers. In Italy, the wide-eyed director can only shrug his shoulders when he hears from young workers that they have thirty to thirty-five paid vacation days a year, not including holidays, paid maternity leave, or a paid honeymoon. Seeking an explanation for this, he turns to the CEO of a motorcycle company who tells him that the happier the workers are, the more production they achieve and hence the more profits for the company, though Moore does not discuss the overall economic problems of the country.In France, Moore teases us by taking us to what he calls a gourmet five-star restaurant in Normandy only to reveal, much to our calculated astonishment, that we are in a typical school cafeteria that serves five-course meals, planned each month by the school and city representatives. Eating with the students, he offers one girl a can of coke but is summarily rebuffed. In looking at Finland's school system, Moore discovers that students have no homework and more free time to socialize and enjoy time with their families. He learns that Finland has no private schools so that the community is dedicated to making the public schools work.According to Moore, Finland's school system has risen from the depths to become number one in the world.From there we travel to Slovenia (not to be confused with Slovakia) which has a free university system, especially inviting for foreign students, to Germany where factory workers toil 36 hours a week while being paid for 40 hours. Oh, yes ? if they get too stressed, they can go to a spa at company expense to work it all out. Pausing for a serious look at how one country deals with its unpleasant past, Moore explores how educators and students confront the Holocaust in Germany, even though it is uncomfortable to face.In Norway, we see how prisoners are treated as human beings, even mass murderers like Anders Breivik, even though Breivik has threatened to go on a hunger strike because of what he claims are "deteriorating" living conditions ? isolation from the other inmates and allowing only contact being with health care workers and guards. While the energy sags a bit in the last two segments in Portugal and Iceland, Where to Invade Next delivers a sharp, meaningful message though not as impactful as Moore's earlier work. Contrary to his critics, however, it does not disparage America, but suggests that a great people can be even greater if they are willing to learn from others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore's newest film is revealing and myth-busting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may be MM's best film to date and that's saying a lot because in my book, Bowling for Columbine was a masterpiece and Fahrenheit 911 not far behind. The segment reflecting on how Germany remembers its terrible past shines powerfully on a major deficiency in how the USA handles its own past; the segment on law enforcement in Portugal and incarceration in Norway challenges the failures of US practices of the same, and their insidious instigation of a new version of Jim Crow in southern states. As well, Moore adroitly punctures the myth of higher taxes in Western Europe. A large cheer erupted in the theater where I saw the film when Moore explained how Iceland convicted and sentenced the bankers whose malfeasance wreaked their nation's economy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shows what the US could be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very entertaining look at the good ideas in place in a range of other countries, mostly in Europe. Moore is even better than "Sicko," where he looked at only four other countries. This movie looks at more countries to show the good programs they have that the US does not. Everything he shows is possible in the US, with improved federal policies. Some have criticized the movie by saying it's simplistic, but that misses the mark. That criticism only works if you assume that the economic constraints in place here need to stay in place. As Moore shows, political participation over time makes things change for the better, and it makes the economic system change. Because our economic system has changed and can change more, what he depicts is possible here. He shows a few examples of ideas that started here, were adopted there, and were dropped here. The movie is a refreshing look at what we could be if we put our will to it. In the process, he shows where and why the quality of life is better in other places for all but the richest Americans. Moore's best movie yet. See it for the entertainment, for ideas on where to vacation, and for ideas on how to vote in the next election. If you like Bernie Sanders, you will find parallels in the ideas presented.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore takes America to task for our own good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to hide the fact that I'm extremely biased when it comes to Michael Moore. I love all his documentaries, and his liberal views closely align with mine, so I just want to say Where To Invade Next is amazing, emotionally moving, and Moore's most positively infectious film. For the doc, he covers a wide range of issues that is plaguing the US, including paid time off for work (or lack thereof), school lunches, women's rights, abortion, not being able to acknowledge our dark history by sugarcoating things in classes, college debt and rising tuition, the education system as a whole, the prison system, the incarceration of black men, the death penalty, the war on drugs, among others I'm sure I missed. And if it seems that Moore is taking a dump on America, he isn't. Despite taking the US to task, Moore believes we have the power to change things if we care enough to (like the countries he visits in the film), and that's the positive takeaway of Where to Invade Next. Overall, I think it's an important documentary, and if any of these issues relate to you (which of course they do), I urge you to go seek it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Moore's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Michael Moore's best documentaries. It tackles many of the issues that are relevant in America's current socio-political climate (healthcare, paid leave, education, mass incarceration, drugs) but without the usual flashy, confrontational gimmicks that we have come to associate with Michael Moore. Instead, he simply takes us on a learning tour to other countries that have come up with wildly successful solutions to these issues. We have all these prime examples of programs that actually work, yet somehow, here in America, socialism is still a dirty word, so we insist on more of the same failed policies despite all the data proving otherwise because we refuse to accept that somebody other than America got it right. If you're like me (brimming with cynicism in the abyss of absolute hopelessness for this country), it's at least nice to be reminded of what is possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it's safe at this point to say that Michael Moore's career as a maker and performer in feature documentary films is a success. There is no one like him out there, though others have tried to imitate his style of nonfiction political entertainments and flat out failed (sit on it and rotate, James O'Keefe.) His films are as engaging and warm as a Garrison Keillor monologue and nail his subjects as smartly as a Charlie Pierce essay. This film is no exception, and I think there's an argument to be made that it's his best film to date. Like "Capitalism: A Love Story," it's a persuasive call for a return to the humanistic values of the New Deal and Great Society. If you're the sort of person who'd consider voting for Bernie Sanders, you'll love it. If not, you might want to see it anyway, in case there's an idea or two in it that's worth stealing for the platform of your own favorite candidate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At a time when politics is at its most intense, with both sides of the isle claiming they can do things better, or there's a better more efficient way to do things, "Where to Invade Next" has become one of Michael Moore's most relevant productions to date. In this, his eight film, Moore (with American flag in hand) takes the audience to Europe to learn their secrets about guaranteed vacation leave, parental leave, quality school meals, free college, prison reform, drug incarceration and more. With idea in hand, Moore plants the American flag (invading their land and idea), steals their procedures/policies, and brings what he's learned back to the US for incorporation. The joke, however, in a manner that on Moore can produce, is on us (the US citizenry), as we are learn these ideas didn't fall all that far from tree. Regardless of what side of the isle you are on, "Where to Invade Next" is an easy and enjoyable film to watch, and a nice wake up call that as a society we need to look no further than our own front door to resolve some of our most basic issues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My husband and l saw this film yesterday in a wonderful old time theater in Royal Oak, MI that had to seat at least 400 people. With over half the seats filled for the matinée, l was struck by the age, gender, and race diversity of the attendees! What a lovely mix of people coming to watch the truth about the amazing quality of life enjoyed by residents of other western industrialized countries. I know so many people l would love to see this film! Lots of laughter was heard throughout the film, and something l hadn't heard since l was a child. At the end of the film, EVERYONE CLAPPED! If we could capture that populous solidarity on Election Day, l believe the quality of life enjoyed by other countries shown in Michael's film, could be actually realized in the U.S., which is clearly no longer #1.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore has made another great documentary. He has an uncanny ability to point out the flaws and makeup of our society. I hope in the near future he will produce a documentary showing the Austerity Measures that are being put into place across the rest of the world, and how the USA could benefit from those as well. We should be doing more to promote arts and social values in our education system. Why can't we have universal health care? We spend so much money on the military, perhaps if we cut back on that and let the other countries pay for their own defense we' be able to. Everyone should take the time to enlighten themselves to what's really going on in the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie shows how concepts that are antithetical to America's "rugged individualism" culture are working beautifully abroad. The movie ends with "American Dream is alive outside America". This movie should be must-watch for all Americans. They should discuss about it. Bernie Sanders' presidency bid is directly relevant here. When you show compassion for the people in need, everybody wins. America's brutal inhumane drug war failed, for example. Time for new approaches. The movie also pointed out that the European had to fight to get their rights. Americans need to open their minds and stop believing in "American Exceptionalism" which made America a laughing stock. The movie made me for weep for the sad American way of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bernie Sanders should use this documentary in his campaign because nearly everything Moore shows ,Bernie wants to realize in this country.Michael Moore has no problem convincing me. I lived in Europe, I had 6 weeks paid vacation, I had thirteen salaries, I had good health care, I had short work weeks, I had free public education and I did not know one person who ended up in jail because of drugs. I am also against death penalty , rehabilitation of prisoners and punishment of bankers and hedge fund managers who destroy lives by playing with our money. Moore points out that he cherry-picked the best things. There are plenty of problems in other countries too. But the reality is that people in other countries care more about us than me. The US have become a cruel country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where To Invade Next is one of Moore's best because it is funny, has a lighter touch, but still hits the mark on raising questions about why America can't adopt some of the great things other countries are doing. Business does it all the time. It is called adopting "best practices." If we can steal good ideas from other companies, why not from other countries? That is the premise of the film and he takes us on a very photogenic tour around the world to countries that have much they could offer us here at home. Moore has a good eye and good wit in choosing citizens of these countries to get his point across. Much of the power of his film is in how he uses children to get across some of these ideas, like actually having good food to eat in the school cafeteria instead of junk. Children are again used to show how Germany teaches the lessons of the holocaust to their children to make sure it never happens again. Of all the moments in the film, that was the most powerful for me. It was totally unexpected and an emotional high point. I also enjoyed the discussion of the education system in Finland, where the focus is on learning and not on test taking, and not pushing tons of homework on the kids. Finland has also created an education model that stresses uniform equality of education. There is no such thing as shopping around for the best schools like we have in the U.S. All of the schools are equally good. That is a conversation we should be having here. Ideas that are more well known are also covered such as the high number of vacation days given in European countries, and time off for honeymoons, and having a baby. Labor unions are still powerful in Europe so the workers still have strong middle class wages and an actual voice on company boards. It was amazing to listen to CEO's from these companies talk about their employee concerns, something rarely heard here in the U.S. Moore is upfront about the cost of some of these services and yes, these countries have a higher tax burdens but when you consider what they get in return, it is well worth the money as Moore explains in the movie. The huge kicker for us is that so much of our tax dollars go into our military that other countries just don't have. In one European countries, the taxes taken out of worker paychecks are itemized in detail to explain what services they pay for. Here, as we all know, there is no breakout of how are tax money is used. The movies closes on how women can shape world events for the better and it is a very powerful message. In his subject interviews, they remind us that the practices employed in these countries are not new; most of them started in the U.S., such as the concept that executives could be put in jail for fraudulent practices as they did in Iceland. The Iceland prosecutor that put multiple banking executives in jail for the 2008 financial meltdown, got his ideas from what we did in the savings and loan scandal, where we put executives in jail. There is no doubt some of the practices in other countries may not work out all that great here given the scale of the United States and our cultural and ethnic diversity, but we aren't even trying. In this review I have only covered about half of the examples shown by Moore. We saw Where To Invade Next at the Palm Springs Film Festival and at the end of the movie, it got the greatest round of applause. Probably because non Michael Moore fans were not in attendance, but this is a well made movie and it shows the sophistication Moore has reached in his documentary making. I gave the movie 8/10 because about midway through I thought it lagged a little, but then picked up strongly at the end. This is an ideal movie to watch in a group and then discuss the concepts afterward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Toto we're not in Kansas anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore has once more taken up the pilgrim's stick...nay, the America flag to conquer the soft power of European countries, and bring fresh ideas to an America down at the heels, save the coupon clippers, finance capitalists and super rich, among the decadent class that buys power in today's US. And wherever he goes, he marvels at the unions, good schools, no college tuition, bankers sent to prison for malfeasance and downright fraud and high crimes; he sees the wisdom of decriminalizing drugs, soft or hard; prison reform that has the goal of rehabilitating the most hardened criminals so that they may join society after purging sentences, as useful members of society. And the positive role women play as equals in society And as he in false country boy innocence marvels at what he sees, it suddenly hits him that the very flag he planted say in Finland or France or Portugal or Norway or Italy and yes in Tunisia and Iceland and Germany or Slovenia, that all these countries he invaded and conquered found ideas and inspiration in America of it seems eons ago. And he closes his peregrinations with a scene from 'The Wizard of Oz': Dorothy frets over how will she get back to Kansas, and the Wizard tells her to click her ruby slippers...and presto she's back home. The moral of Moore's 'gentle' film is that we in the US have the power to remake our society with the tools of good social programs, only if we have the will in this age of angry old men and stingy young men. And there lies the question and the challenge -- can we? will we?</fullReview>

'Murrica is great for a lot of things, like its beautiful, vast geography and its large, varied population, but it's not "the greatest country in the history of the Universe forever" as many cretins like to repeat for their political platforms or due to gleeful ignorance ? like almost any other nation, it has its ugly truths, deep issues and serious responsibilities, which actually prevent it from being potentially the greatest; it's a work in progress. Moore shows, in a simple point-camera report, that the USA should go back to its founding principles and offer all its people a truly accessible American Dream, rather than wrapping itself in a flag and calcifying around the Almighty Dollar. Better ideas make for a better society, not just better GDP.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I dare conservatives watch it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We watched this delightful movie yesterday and we both enjoyed it hugely. Yes, it had elements of typical Moore films in that it took major swipes at American society not so much in an anti-American diatribe but simply to present them with life alternatives so they might begin the long climb down from their red state arrogance.As other commentators have pointed out, Moore is at pains to show segments of American society that, in my opinion, do not live up to segments of other greater or lesser socialistic models in other countries. Of course conservatives probably would not be caught dead watching a Moore film because they have their own preconceived notions of how America is to be operated and those notions have nothing to do with governmental interference with any aspect of capitalistic life. The one or two-star reviews write at length about Moore's misconceptions regarding American society but they never come to grips with the substance of the reality of the situation in Europe. One commentator wrote at length about the troubles caused by foreign immigration into their heretofore uni-nationality homelands and they took advantage of freedoms that they had not known before.If you are not already a closed minded conservative then view this film by all means; if you are a Red State conservative then continue pulling your shell over and dumb-down your mind until America dies from internal disease of its own making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to Make America GREAT AGAIN!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprisingly NON-partisan, refreshing, educational, insightful, touching and definitely entertaining and humorous. Moore's trademark sarcasm is mostly replaced by sincere, thoughtful interview style, and key morals are gracefully delivered with minimum preaching. Candid funny moments sprinkled throughout, very nice. Possibly Mike Moore's best work so far.The gist: America crossed many significant social progress hurdles 50 years ago, and these countries have learned from American lessons and fought their good fights to enjoy the social benefit fruits today. Thing is, what happened with America? Why is USA at 29th place in 2015 global school ranking when Poland is at 11th and Vietnam is at 12th place? This is not a story for Americans only but something to chew on long after for every human beings: what is it we strive for as a citizen of our country, no matter how small or how powerful?I thought I know enough about Europe social welfare yet I continued to be surprised by what this docu has revealed and in such expertly directed pacing too. This docu will challenge non-Europeans on the meaning of this elusive thing called Quality of Life.Particularly poignant moments...Finland teachers seem to like using one particular word, not because they have vocabulary range issue (Scandinavians in general speak near-perfect English), but like this word is already part of their biological being: the word is, 'Happy'. Just watching their faces make me happy.The Swedish father - and his simple message on the value of revenge - the most used trope in all popular American movies, TV, comic books, gaming media. Goosebump stuff.The Tunisian women, and the truly enlightened clerical leader. So eye- opening. And heart opening too.The vision of German children escootering and skating before a monolithic tomb of the ancestor's sins, and because they have faced their collective demon, their spirit are now light and free and joyous and it shows on their happy faces... What the honest, fearless, tell it like it is Icelandic woman said about Being a Good Neighbor: the meaning of basic decency, what makes an individual great as a human being. Not his 60% budget spending on weapons of instant kill, not her 60% preoccupation with her self-centered indulgences, but genuine concern, love and curiosity for the wonderful world and people beyond one's own front yard. That one is going to stick for a long long time...This is the kind of movie worth making. I only wish it was longer and delve deeper in every country he invaded. Recommended to everyone young and old.</fullReview>

Moore recounts how Racists such as U.S. President Milhouse Nixon plotted in the 1960s to permanently keep White Supremicists and his Rich People's Party in control of the American South as Black Leaders such as Martin Luther King and Malcom X were organizing Black Voters to take control of these states on behalf of Average Americans. After having the most effective leaders assassinated, Nixon and his Henchpeople started a phony baloney "War on Drugs" with the sole purpose of criminalizing the American Black Man and permanently barring enough of them from voting to keep the Confederate States Confederate. This has tipped the scales, Moore notes in his film WHERE TO INVADE NEXT, to keep the Racist Greedheads in perpetual control of the "Red States," leaving the world's other 200 countries free to live our "American Dream" that we have not been able to since the days of FDR's "Fireside Chats." Moore is urging us to remember the legions of Disenfranchised Black Men Slaving with Needles the next time we see a "Victoria's Angel" on a runway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genius Documentary of Worldwide Importance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>9.5 of 10. Michael Moore has gotten back to amusing/satirical pure documentary as opposed to trying to create some unnecessary melodrama and focus a film around a specific person or 2. No emotional exploitations to complain about. This is just filled with facts and perceptions from around the world few if any people get exposed to.Also contrary to Moore films, this is optimistic. It may be critical, but it's extraordinarily upbeat and hopeful.The angle of the film, while it lightly touches on war, is really not about invading any place other than America's own political/economic establishment. It's critiques and insights are thorough and well documented within the film while providing plenty of laughs and unusual, unexpected sexy surprises.While it may need a few small edits to be considered acceptable for under-18 school classes, it should be seen by everyone, in school or not, for the next 50 years. This is too educational to be lost to petty politics over whether Moore is American/patriotic enough for some extremists.Highly recommended to all, including Presidential and other government libraries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a call to expand America's consciousness - with some laughs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was angry for many parts of Where to Invade Next. It wasn't at Michael Moore, though I'm sure that if people come in who already have a predisposition or strong feelings about the man then it will come out that way, and this certainly won't change that. If anything, on paper, this premise is the kind that would likely make US conservatives froth at the mouth: Michael Moore goes around to various European countries (and Tunisia, in North Africa) to "invade" their lands so he can find really, really good ideas and bring them back to the United States so we can claim them as our own. It's not really a spoiler to say that, ultimately, what Moore finds is that it's like a Wizard of Oz thing: we could go home all along; that is to say, we as Americans *could* have a lot of these nifty things like good education for young people (and healthy/nutritious meals for lunch), sensible drug policy and treatment in place of automatic imprisonment (and better prisons that), fair and equal treatment for women in the workplace, paid (!) vacation and maternity leave, and so on and so on and on. The point is, Moore is challenging that America is (gasp) not great right now; it's a critical analysis, and yet...It's not to say every single idea that Moore comes across here America came up with first, but one of the surprising things, and what made me angry for good chunks of it, is that America came up with things like strong unions and worker rights in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and it's in our own 8th amendment to not have cruel and unusual punishment for prisoners. There's so much here that one can find that it probably merits a second viewing, but the first impression is something like full-blown consciousness expansion: like, THIS is what we COULD have? Moore seems as surprised as his audience might be, despite the fact that he probably (no, quite likely) knows this stuff before going in to interviews. Then again that president from Slovakia, sorry, no it's Slovenia...One of the things that Mark Twain once said, which has been a lot of Moore's mantra through his 25-plus film career, is, "I love America more than any other country in this world, and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually." No fiercer has Moore been critical than in this film - or, I should say, in such a package that has so many ideas. If there's something I would criticize the movie for it's that it could have done with being longer, as a mini-series for example. But Moore gets a lot done in 119 minutes and it doesn't feel long or drawn out - just when you think Germany and how it presents itself as an example of, say, teaching its young about the holocaust and with constant, blistering reminders (unlike the US, by and large, with slavery and Native American decimations), then we get to Norway and it takes on a whole other dimension with the prison system.Moore may be optimistic ultimately, taking from all of these citizens and workers and businessmen and lawyers and, yes, women who run major companies in places like Iceland, that there has to be another way to find some good with the American system. I do wish that Moore had pointed out a little more distinctly the underlying difference (or a major one) between America and Europe being religious fervor with politicians and (some of) the public - at best we get a glimpse via the abstinence portion with a Rick Perry clip - but that will be something some may see and some won't. Of course Moore pick and chooses his targets, and he says up front that he knows these countries have their not-so-good qualities; I'm sure you can look up all the problems these countries have (i.e. France with its turmoil with Muslim immigrants), not to mention it's just slightly dated now due to this being made before the (as of now current) crisis with Syrian refugees. That's what a filmmaker does, and he does his picking and choosing with a skill that shows a lifetime of work as a filmmaker and entertainer.I don't know how many people will see the move in its initial run - it has some buzz but nowhere near Moore at his height with Fahrenheit 9/11 (it's easier to catch the zeitgeist when you make films about notorious school shootings and the worst president in a hundred years), and yet it may be his magnum opus, the work that encapsulates a lot of what this man has put together through his films and television shows. And it's not all some slog of a lecture; Where to Invade Next is loaded with great bursts of humor and jokes, sometimes spur of the moment, other times with Moore's knack for montage and juxtaposition of clips, or just text like when he introduces certain countries. I do hope it gets a wide audience as it is a movie meant for everybody - it's criticism in the great Twain tradition of loving a country so much you can't help but yell, with cinematic grammar, how wrong it's strayed in economy, education, health, justice, equality and unions and so on.</fullReview>

Something that is nice is that it seems also that Moore tries to show as many countries as possible, even countries that some people might feel are "forgetable", etc.The reason why I do give a lower mark is that it is a film that is really made for a US audience. Having spent a good deal of time in North America I can completely understand why he tries to make it so that the ideas shown and expressed in the film are as "American" or "American born" as possible, but when you're from someplace else, and when you know more about history or such things in general, it seems just a bit annoying that they try to make some ideas that are pretty much universal, or just not American, as American as possible. The ending is also quite cliché, but it just reflects and intensifies the previous comment. it's actually because of the very-patriotic-to-get-republicans-to-listen ending that i decided to give this movie a7 instead of an 8.for non us viewers I would say that you can just skip the last 15 minutes, but that the rest is great</fullReview>

Moore brings up things that need to be noticed and changed and left me questioning quite a few things. I am interested to hear more feedback from others! The United States has plenty to change and once seeing the truth there is a lot of our original laws and implements being used else where that we may have forgotten. Moore concludes these truths and takes them back into our own and claims what has already been ours for renewing our country and bringing it back to what once was and for changing some other things.</fullReview>

First-rate food, and they spend less per lunch than we do.France pays slightly more in income and social security taxes than the U.S. does. France gets: free healthcare, free college, daycare, paid sick leave, paid maternity leave, 4 weeks paid vacation, prescriptions, nursing care, great schools, bullet trains, huge funds for arts.People in the U.S. pay college tuition + day care fees + nursing home bills + copays + deductibles + . . . . We pay much more than the French, much of it privately-imposed taxes to enrich profiteering owners of hospitals, schools, pharmaceutical corporations.French paychecks show itemization of where the taxes go. For U.S. (not disclosed on paychecks), the numbers are: 01.18% food and agriculture 02.36% transportation 02.60% science 03.51% energy and environment 03.67% international affairs 06.28% education 59.57% militaryFrance teaches true sex ed in high school. Many U.S. states "teach abstinence". U.S. has far higher rates of sexually-transmitted diseases, and of teen pregnancy, than in France, Germany, and Switzerland.FINLAND:#1 in education, without sacrificing kids' childhoods. No teaching to the test. Music, art, cooking, woodshop, sewing, nature walks. Teaching is based on what the kids want for their future.It is illegal in Finland to set up a school and charge tuition. Rich parents have to make sure the public schools are great. And by making the rich kids go to school with everyone else, they grow up with those other kids as friends. And when they become wealthy adults they have to think twice before they screw them over. All schools in Finland are equally good. No one has to shop for a school.Many Finnish education ideas were initially American ideas.SLOVENIA:Essentially free college, as it is in Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Mexico, Morocco, Norway, Panama, Sweden, Tunisia, Uruguay, Venezuela.Even Americans can come to Slovenia and get free college educations (100 classes taught in English). Americans who couldn't afford community college in the U.S., who would be crushed by debt in a U.S. college.European plans to charge college tuition were met with massive protests: college remains essentially free.Germany:Still has a thriving middle class. Still has factories. Factories have windows. Corporations are run by a supervisory board, 50% of which is workers. "Give people a say, they help the company to win." Workers don't have second or third jobs.In the German universal healthcare system, a stressed-out German can get a prescription for a free 3-week stay at a spa. "It's cheaper to prevent worse sickness."Germany teaches its high school students about the holocaust. U.S. education downplays the genocide inflicted on Native Americans, and the horrors of slavery.Portugal: Decriminalized drugs; universal free healthcare provides treatment for addictions. Drug use has gone down.In the U.S. the "war on drugs" is an excuse to imprison millions of blacks, who work in prison for 23 cents an hour for corporations. Modern slavery. And they permanently lose their voting rights. In Portugal, prisoners vote. No capital punishment.NORWAY: Rehabilitative prisons. No capital punishment. Maximum sentence 21 years. Prison guards don't carry guns. Nor do police. 4 guards, 115 prisoners, in a minimum-security prison, including murderers, rapists, robbers. In the U.S., 80% of ex-prisoners are rearrested within 5 years.

Women rallied, won women's rights protections in constitution. Islamists acceded, stepped down.ICELAND:Oct. 24, 1975 women's strike: 90% of women did no work. No schools, banks, buses that day. When women don't work, nothing works. Ideas of women's value changed that day. 1980, Iceland first country to elect a woman president. Women have same opportunities as men. Corporate boards must be 40% to 60% women, 40% to 60% men.In Iceland, there's a law, you can't say, "this brand is the best."Bankers were prosecuted and imprisoned after causing the meltdown of the economy. The banks were not bailed out. The economy has recovered and is better than ever.UNITED STATES:Although it appears that the American dream is alive everywhere except in America, the ideas these other countries are living, many of them originated in the U.S. The labor movement, women's movement, no cruel and unusual punishment, no death penalty (Michigan first government to abolish), free education: all these ideas were already ours. We've always had the power to do for ourselves what these other countries have done for themselves.We just have to stop being such stingy bastards and realize that my prosperity and well-being depends on yours too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore has done some interesting investigative work in the past (often unpopular) and I was apprehensive about how this would turn out given the title, but, unexpectedly, the facts presented jibe with commonly known statistics (at least known outside the US) about us (US). He visits Italy, France, Germany, Iceland, Norway, Finland, Slovenia (where's that?; kidding Slovenians), Tunisia, Portugal. Did I miss one? Concepts once promoted in the US such as equality for all (women, ethnics, etc.); free education &amp; health care for all; incarceration, recidivism, rehabilitation of criminals; workers having a say in their futures; high wages &amp; health oriented working conditions w/paid leave, all seem to be thriving everywhere else. So he's off to steal them back to the US. Of course the very wealthy along w/ corporate interests lobby and donate to defeat such immoral (in the sense that it's a little smidgen off of their obsession to posses as much as possible.)Interestingly he did not invade Cuba because, and surprising to many, are the well known (at least outside the US) facts that Cubans have free education at all levels; free health care; live longer than in the US; are happier; provide more medical personal to serve parts of the world that need it the most than we do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore Is Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore travels around the world to bring back some good ideas to America. He begins in Italy, spending a day with a young married couple who tell him about the extensive vacation and holiday time required by Italian law. He visits the Ducati factory and interviews the CEO who explains that his happy workers are more productive because of the two hour lunches and shorter hours with more time for rest and relaxation. In France, we are shown the school lunch program, which include a variety of cheeses and desserts which are mind boggling when compared with the crap we serve here in America. Moore travels to a German pencil factory where the workers are paid for a forty hour week while actually working thirty six. They have a higher productivity level than America. They also have mandatory classes teaching about the Holocaust; the most riveting scene in the film. Moore makes the comparison with slavery and the treatment of Native Americans here and our lack of contrition. The prison system of Norway, with a strong emphasis on rehabilitation, is compared with our "cruel and unusual" style. Moore speaks with a police chief in Portugal to discuss the decriminalization of drugs with great success. The "war on drugs" here has been such a good idea. The educational system of Finland: ranked first in the world, is a result of an excellent public system which teaches students to think and not to pass a test. They do not have charter schools there. In Slovenia, all education is free, including college. Moore interviews students and the president of the country. Iceland is last and Moore explains that they elected a female leader back in the 1970's and that the boards of corporations must have women. He finishes at the Berlin wall to make the point that anything is possible, using the example of the wall being torn down by the Germans; an event which shocked the world. Michael Moore has done it once again; creating a film which might actually cause some discussion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael tells it like it is! America can still do it, but why are we letting others do it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter what your political take or point of view whether or not you like Michael Moore or embrace socialism or not you must agree that America has serious problems. True the U.S. may be one of the better places to live due to freedom, still when you look on the scale of how they rank with other countries on things their is a downgrade and drop off. And the king preacher of the hard social left the one and only Michael Moore tells the truth and makes a bold statement with this documentary called "Where to Invade Next".As with any Moore film it uses parody and montage footage shots to show his points with graphs and data to show his points and comparisons so it's vintage Michael at his best here. The plot of the film has Moore traveling to other countries to showcase how much better that they have it than the good old United States of America. As Moore makes the point from the start of the film America's biggest problem is they are always ready to go to war and fight as it's never revealed to people as Moore stated that much of the taxes cut out of their paychecks goes to the military budget.So as Michael travels around the globe with his travels the footage and meeting of people shows just how good foreign countries have it, from paid vacation for many weeks, to better and great school lunches, and the educational system is better. And the justice system of foreign countries treats inmates more humane and higher taxes lead to better jobs, and health care for everyone with better attitudes leading to less stress and longer lives for international citizens. Plus democracy is better in many countries with labor unions and the lowing of voter age and women's right are much better as the economic system runs smoother.Need I say more see Moore tell the truth with this documentary and ask yourself why can't America use it's own ideals that many countries are winning and being happy with. My guess is America is still to greedy and corrupt with ego, power struggle and a money hungry society, well watch this documentary and be the judge for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore: America's Working Class Voltaire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Michael Moore's best film simply because it has such a simple message: America needs to do more for its people. If as an American you aren't completely embarrassed when you travel to other countries that do a much better job in taking care of their citizens then you just need to open your eyes. I recently traveled from my hotel in Madrid, Spain back to my home in Valencia. I walked out of the hotel and a block later I came to a station of Madrid's incredible underground. From there I had to switch to another line and arrived at Madrid's awe-inspiring Atocha rail station. I boarded the high-speed line to Valencia which reaches a top speed of 300KPH. Outside of Valencia's rail station I grabbed a bike-share bike and pedaled home in a remarkable display of modern mass transit. Why don't we have this in most of America? "I've turned into this crazy optimist," Moore confesses at the end of the film. I think this is the only attitude to have these days unless you want to lose your mind as Donald Trump slimes closer to the presidency. We can do better, folks. I don't remember many people saying that we couldn't afford to invade Iraq in 2003 yet many dimwits scream that we can't afford universal health care, free university education, good public transportation, and many other things that we see as pipe dreams while most European nations view them as necessities.When asked to tell the American people something in two minutes or less the woman from Iceland told us that we need to be better to each other, sort of like "love thy neighbor." Where have I heard that before? We have such an empathy crisis in America today that it will probably take at least a generation for us to be human beings again?but it will have to be a generation without Fox News as they more or less destroyed any sense of empathy many people may have had.</fullReview>

Although that I watched a pirated version of it - just as you guessed right in the middle of the movie - because I live in a country where there's nothing original - not even people's dreams and thoughts - but I am willing to pay you the full price of the Blu-ray ripped 1080p version that I watched tonight.And, to my friends, contacts and enemies: if you like this movie, then do watch "Sicko" and "Fahrenheit 9/11" by Michael Moore too.

		<fullReview>I have been a fan of Michael Moore's projects for quite some time. I'll get that out first and foremost. I don't claim a political party or ideology. I just live with the "Do Unto Others" philosophy. As an American, Moore's Films have opened my eyes to just how "Awesome" of a country America isn't anymore and things we could/need to fix in order to become what we have potential to be. "Where to Invade Next?" is a Documentary not as much about our short falls but, rather highlight our neighboring countries that have a leg up on common issues we face. From Norway to Germany and even Slovenia Invading and Claiming the Great Ideas for ourselves. Presidents, Police, Prison Officials, Military Officers, to regular citizens describe their thoughts, feelings, impressions on their lives as well as their views on ours. Showcasing solutions to Heath Care, Laws and Crimes, Drugs and Abusers as well as a better personal life for all. Regardless of your income, social status, political affiliation, or way of thinking, EVERYONE should watch this film!! If America wants to TRULY change the way the citizens and the rest of the world think about us, we should all take a look at our competition and catch up. As Will McAvoy said "We're seventh in literacy, twenty-seventh in math, twenty-second in science, forty-ninth in life expectancy, 178th in infant mortality, third in median household income, number four in labor force, and number four in exports. We lead the world in only three categories: number of incarcerated citizens per capita, number of adults who believe angels are real, and defense spending, where we spend more than the next twenty-six countries combined, twenty-five of whom are allies. None of this is the fault of a 20-year-old college student, but you, nonetheless, are without a doubt, a member of the WORST-period-GENERATION-period-EVER-period, so when you ask what makes us the greatest country in the world, I don't know what the f@%k you're talking about?" We can change. "Where to Invade Next" has a decent plan of were to start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funniest Moore film yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always liked Michael's films. To refer to them is "biased" is silly as that's what Moore does. Indeed, I watched two movies which were a reaction to his over the last couple of years, and the idiots who did the film used essentially the very same style that Moore uses. In other words, like spoiled kids, they said, "Moore does such and such," and did exactly the same thing, but Michael had done it first.And most of his films have a comic element, if not also mixed with at least a touch of ego. That's okay. He made the movie, and I didn't. Heaven knows lots more of my ego might be in it if I'd made it...But I did anticipate a "comedy" with this film. That's the way it's advertised. It started very cleverly, thought I don't want to spoil anything by saying how. And I laughed from the beginning. He travels from one country to another and finds: Well, it seems their citizens mean more to the government of those countries than ours do to our government! Even one Muslim country--the name of which I won't mention here. But the women of that land took a stand against the Conservative Muslim government, and won! A highlight: Micheal was able to talk with that Muslim president of that country who said, I think in these words, "Power isn't everything." Bravo!Then, at the end, after a couple hours of reflecting on the great elements of these countries, Micheal reminds us that, AS EVEN THE OFFICIALS IN THOSE COUNTRIES ASSERT, WHAT THEY PRACTICE AND PREACH THEY GOT FROM America!So, those who are inclined, like some of my extended family to contend that Moore is "anti-American," that's nonsense. He reminds us of what were were, and CAN BE.Then why only 8 stars? The only problem I had with it was that it was slightly "post-modern." For example, of all the banks in Iceland, the only one that didn't collapse was run by women. He deduces that, therefore, if the world were run more by women, it would be more just. One of the woman Iceland officials said, "It's in our DNA." With that I disagree. First, doubtless, the worst boss I ever had was a woman. And arguably the second worst was a black woman. The issue is that of POWER, not sex, not race, not just breaking what's been typical, i.e., male, Caucasian, heterosexual. Aside from that, it's another classic I'll purchase and add to my Michael Moore library once it's released on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to Invade Next is an important movie. Believe in the near-impossible like the Germans did, once back in Nov. 89...

I felt choked up with sadness for three-fourths of the movie. No, no easy, cheap demagoguery here! A real, good, and must see movie from Michael Moore. WHERE TO INVADE NEXT gets my deepest gratitude, THX, and hope for our own "Berlin wall of ignorance" to fall, break, and put us all back in the equation of our own politico-social system and future, right here, in the US of A where it (most all) started...

		<fullReview>Being a Mexican-French with family living in the USA (and after having discussions with them about the way of living and doing things), I can say that this shows the differences of doing things depending on where you live. In the film it shows all the good stuff in the other countries, and the problem is that it's really close to the reality. After watching the film, you get the impression that many things are wrong, that they could be changed, but it's going to be hard. I liked that the film touched many aspects, took a look at different countries, and that it didn't focus on only one (like sicko). And then are the opinions of the people, and the interviews to people that lived moments of change which are really interesting, and that make you wanna change things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore's great international odyssey, "Where to Invade Next"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard that Michael Moore was doing a new movie - his last, "Capitalism: A Love Story," came out in 2009 and focused on the 2007-2008 financial meltdown - to be titled "Where to Invade Next," I thought it was going to be a critique of U.S. foreign policy; the film's not-so-subtle name certainly made it sound like it.We were all wrong.Moore's basic premise with this film - that the U.S. has seriously fallen behind in the world despite being A-#1 - goes abroad to Europe and North Africa to seek out new ideas to Make America Great Again. He journeys to Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, and Tunisia and finds some great ideas to bring back to the United States and make our own. But as Moore soon finds out, many of the great ideas put into play in these countries, were originally from the U.S.Yes, the ideas of paid vacation and maternity leave, universal health-care, equal opportunities for women, treating prison inmates with dignity and respect, treatment for drug users instead of incarceration, workers' rights, no standardized testing, and free college - all concepts used to great effect by foreign nations - were originally ideas conceived here in the United States, for us, by us. So what happened? Moore doesn't dwell on why these ideas of free college or equal opportunities for women were first thought up by Americans but were never fully implemented, or were abolished completely. No, he's singularly concerned with re-appropriating these ideas, reclaiming them as our own, and putting them to work in the U.S.I suspect personally that a combination of decades upon decades of propaganda, politics, the wealthy elite's control of the U.S. government, the media, and the arrogance, ignorance, and blind complacency amongst the American citizenry prevented these ideas from ever gaining any real traction here in the United States - even though our society can do much better with them. Many of the foreign citizens (and American expatriates) that Moore interviews in "Where to Invade Next" express dismay, bewilderment, disappointment, and - in one instance - out-right anger at the way America treats its citizens (and our acceptance of it without question), while they have it so much better in their countries. (Moore is quick to point out early on that these countries are not paradises on Earth and have their own problems, but in general the people are much happier and complacent with their lives.)There are parts of "Where to Invade Next" that are down-right hilarious, but there are other segments that are also heartbreaking. For instance, when Moore stops over in Germany, he sees that the country's tumultuous World War II history - the rise of the Third Reich, the Holocaust - are not whitewashed, and that all German schoolchildren are aware of their history as to "Never Forget." (The United States, by comparison, barely ever mentions slavery and, I suspect, even deliberately tries to gloss over the less glamorous parts of our country's history - for whatever reason.) When Moore makes his way to Norway - which in 2011 had experienced the worst instance of mass murder in the country's history when white nationalist Anders Breivik killed 77 people, most of them children, in two separate acts of domestic terrorism - and interviews a man who lost his 17-year-old son in the massacre. The man is clearly grief-stricken and angry, but wishes no ill will upon Breivik, because he doesn't want to "lower himself down to his level."In general, this movie was all-around brilliant. I was a little disappointed that Moore didn't go to other countries in South America or Asia, but I suppose this was done because he was unable to get the U.S. aircraft carrier he was reportedly hitching a ride on to get him to those countries. Either way, I'm sure we could have learned a lot, if not more, from countries in Asia and South America, too, just as well as Europe. Like many of Moore's past films, I was absorbed into his journey, and I honestly did not want it to end - especially "Where to Invade Next," which I enjoyed immensely. I thought there was so much more that he could acquire from other countries and bring them back to the United States for us to use. But I guess from a movie-making standpoint, that would have been too superfluous, which I understand, but still...With "Where to Invade Next," Michael Moore has probably crafted his most mainstream feature to date - more so than "Capitalism: A Love Story" or "Fahrenheit 9/11" (2004) - and that's a good thing. (In fact, it's very, very good.) As I commented regarding "Capitalism: A Love Story," it shows that Moore is choosing subjects that affect everyone, rather than what equates to roughly half the American population (and his most ardent supporters). Moore is on-camera a lot in this picture - his past films beginning with "Fahrenheit 9/11" all the way up to "Capitalism: A Love Story" often had him off-camera and he let his subjects do most of the talking. Here, although he's on-camera more, he still lets his interviewees do most of the talking and having them express their thoughts about what's so great about their countries and how they could be of great use in the United States.And one thing that's noticeably absent from this film are Moore's trademark stunts (i.e., driving around the Capitol in an ice cream truck reading the Patriot Act like in "Fahrenheit 9/11," or taping off Wall Street and branding it a crime scene like in "Capitalism: A Love Story"). Here, I guess the closest thing that comes to a "stunt" is Moore convincing a French elementary school girl to drink a cup of Coca-Cola."Where to Invade Next" was a brilliant, hilarious, and occasionally tear-jerking journey to reclaim what's ours - our "real" American Dream(s).10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We Gave Up All Of This?! For What?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beginning with 1989's ROGER &amp; ME, which took on the destruction of the auto industry in his hometown of Flint, Michigan, Michael Moore garnered a well-earned, and unapologetic, reputation as a cinematic provocateur with his semi-satirical documentaries about the basic corruption of American politics. He took on the NRA and the gun lobby with BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE (referring to what Dylan Kleibold and Eric Harris were doing before they turned Columbine High School into a shooting gallery in 1999). He went off on the Bush/Cheney cabal for using the September 11, 2001 attacks as a pretext, one based on a never-ending series of blatant lies, for the Iraqi invasion in 2004's FAHRENHEIT 9/11. He took on the health insurance complex in 2007's SICKO. And in 2009, he took on the whole idea of capitalism with CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY.And then, after a six-year break, the muckraker from Flint took up the subject of what American could learn (or maybe re-learn) from its allies in 2015's WHERE TO INVADE NEXT.Moore's pretext for WHERE TO INVADE NEXT, like the other films he has done, is bold and controversial; and his approach is totally his alone, nobody else's. He goes abroad to "invade" countries to see what we could learn from our allies, since, from the moment the Twin Towers fell on 9/11, America's standing around the world has been in tatters. And unsurprisingly, a lot of what he finds in places like Italy, Slovenia, Portugal, Germany, France, Iceland, Norway, Finland, and even Muslim-dominated Tunisia, are the kinds of things we here in America seemed to take for granted?before the Reagan revolution and the obsession with billionaires making money hand over fist, while the wages of most Americans either rose only slightly or basically flat lined altogether. Their ideas used to be ours, and yet we sold out all those things to the idea of greed and unchecked power.Most troubling is the fact that in Germany, they are willing to acknowledge the horrible history they had with respect to the Holocaust, while we here in the United States are still unwilling to acknowledge our history of racism (against Blacks) and genocide (against Native Americans). And whereas Iceland, the first country to suffer from the collapse of the economy in 2008, managed to convict and put in jail the banksters that caused that collapse, none of those who caused America's economy to crash have even been prosecuted, let alone convicted and jailed, as of 2015.As with so much of what Moore has done over his career, he is both a provocateur and, in the minds of macho males and the self-righteous Right in America, a propagandist as well. The thing is, however, that he had visited these other countries many times before, and not always for the purposes of making films (though he did so for SICKO and CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY). A generation of Americans are still around to remember what it was like to have relatively inexpensive education and health care funded by their taxes, before the corporatocracy took over our government and made virtually everything a mere commodity, something to be bought and sold on the open market.For all of the bombast spewed from the Right about him, Moore is as much of a populist as there has ever existed. But his is not populism of the sort the Right has fueled for anger since 1948, and which has been crystallized in the form of a Donald Trump. It is a populism rooted in what we saw in Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy, a genuine idealism about the best of America, and which during the 2016 campaign was embodied in Vermont senator Bernie Sanders. Moore ends this film in Berlin at what remains of the Berlin Wall, which, thanks to a long simmering popular uprising in Eastern Europe, came down on November 9, 1989 and effectively ended the Cold War. That kind of idealism is what Moore argues we can have again here in America, not more invasions, bombings, and bloodbaths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Moore, but a refreshing return after so long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning It would seem the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff invited Michael Moore in for a discussion, after a series of failed invasions around the Middle East, to try and decide what would be best to do next. Moore, it appears, suggested a round trip through Europe, doing his own particular invasions and pilfering the best ideas from them. And so, he visits Italy and learns of their generous worker holiday system, then France who recognise the link between a great school dinner and a good education, Norway's rehabilitative prison system and many more, including places as far afield and unlikely as Tunisia.In the early noughties, after the most horrific terrorist attack in history, the atmosphere around the globe was one of hostility and vengeance. And so it was a brave soul, who, in this climate, opted for an air of left wing reflection and resonance, and that person was one Michael Moore, who would develop his own dedicated following throughout this time with a series of films that explored societal issues along these lines. While this made him a bit of a household name for a while, in a short period after some negative publicity and widespread condemnation for some of his views and methods, his last film from six years ago, Capitalism: A Love Story, didn't seem to enjoy quite as much exposure and since then, he's suffered a bit of a hiatus.With Where to Invade Next, which has popped up out of nowhere after some time, the formula is surprisingly similar to his last widely distributed film, 2007's Sicko, where he explores various places around the globe and tries to use policies of theirs of how America could better function as a nation. As usual, Moore's pushing his own agenda, and it's typically one sided, but no less informative and, or, entertaining, such as learning of Norwegian prisoners being subjected to a prison guard rendition of Michael Jackson's We Are the World (We Are the Children) upon entering jail, whilst sobering reflection is encouraged, when we learn of how German students remember their dark history.One chief complaint is probably the length, a little overlong at nearly two hours, which has a slight smack of self indulgence about it. All the same, it's nice to see Moore leaving his mark on the cultural landscape again, after keeping us waiting for so long. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and enlightening, although misleading</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was excited to see Moore, from the beginning, aggressively tackling the corrupted American system. Even when The United States were colonized by European people with little scrupulous and a lot of bloodlust and greed, the founding fathers had some good ideas about how to do things properly, and it'd be great to have them back instead of having this travesty of political and social system that is North America nowadays.Unfortunately, not far into his "invasion", Moore disappoints extremely with his praise of the menu served in the French school. How in the world can a meal containing dairy, and in such ridiculous high amounts, be something to admire?? I'm just not talking here about what the dairy industry does to non-human animals, not even what it does to the environment, but how unhealthy is in any diet. Giving that amount of cheese and other dairy products systematically, in a daily basis, to children should be a crime. But, hey, it is not only the American FDA that is corrupted to the core, but also your average officially approved nutritionist anywhere in the world. After all, the dairy industry is powerful everywhere. Their propaganda doesn't know of cultural barriers or languages. Perhaps Moore should get his hands dirty with that issue, affecting millions all over the world, instead of saying that the menu of that French school is brilliant. Hm, maybe it doesn't suit him to do that, for personal reasons.Anyway, I'm not one of those haters from Hollywood who wants Moore dead. I'm also not one of those trendy revolutionaries who think that Moore is the saviour of the world. I'm only an informed citizen as far as certain issues go (nutrition and health, in this instance).Alas, after that incident, I watched the rest of the 2 hours documentary with a bit of suspicion, and opinion I read years ago about Moore manipulating facts came to mind.In any case, the film is interesting and, somehow, inspiring, even when it only takes the real good stuff into account (Moore confesses this at the beginning), and doesn't really look at the big picture.Anyhow, it'd be indeed great to have some (or all) of the ideas implemented in most countries, not only U.S.A. Without the lactose, please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a non-fan....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like it. After his fine debut "Roger &amp; Me", Michael Moore became too much of a self- righteous truther, naming political names in his following ambitious, sometimes well intended, half-truth feature docs. If you think about it, his 25 years of movies DID NOT change a thing or make anyone's life better, or put crooks behind bars, in fact people only got angrier, more fearful which is not a good trend. It was appearing Moore was a paid shill, stage act himself, as he has become very wealthy. Just as I think he is not growing as a filmmaker, along comes "Invade", which is a "flower picked" (not weeds) travelogue showing political and socio-economic structures that work very well in many parts of the world, and how far we have fallen. Compare the US to others with 8 hr work days, no second job and 6 weeks vacation a year, have time and community for friends, no college debt, educated, etc etc. Didn't need to see the movie to figure that out as I have asked 1/2 the exact same questions to people in my recent travels abroad over the years. People are amazed too many Americans have 2 jobs, no vacation time or travel money, but already knew how unhealthy and uneducated we are. Was glad to see Moore's invasion despite wanting to bang my head on the wall over rethinking the American apathy epidemic, which is not an opinion. We don't need stronger wealth, but a stronger sense of community to survive. Nobody learns, so It's not a matter of IF, but WHEN the collapse will happen. This film paints a more optimistic picture of the possibilities. I support it, but it's just a movie. Nothing will change, the consequences of apathy are too great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore gives you the whole enchilada of which places according to his perception can make you feel bad, about being a US citizen. Then again by the end he patches things up by clearing out the good ideas (worth being stolen), started in the USA anyways? So far Moore's documentaries have brought light to crucial topics that need improvement for the sake of humanity. WHERE TO INVADE NEXT is no exception, especially its harsh words on US citizens from certain personalities interviewed by the director. Nothing new under the sun, all countries have flaws. And some countries have enough money to even distribute anti-propaganda.How about a film Mr. Moore, where you put your wit and eye south of the Rio Grande?</fullReview>

This movie isn't about putting America down or anything of that sort, it's more to point out some of the benefits other countries have that we should strive to have as well. Michael gets a little too excited toward the end of the film and starts to lose focus, but overall the message remains intact. The film is certainly thought provoking, especially in an election year. America may not be the best country in the world like we've always been told, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have the potential to be the best.

		<shortDescription>Europe is for lovers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts with an interesting premise -- What could the Land Of The Free Etc. actually learn from small, iffy countries like Italy, Tunisia, Slovenia, or even -- horribile dictu -- France? Michael Moore tries to tie in this notion of "let's steal their good ideas" with the the overall concept of "let's find a proper place where we could invade next". Unsuccessfully, because he also puts forward the idea that the United States hasn't managed to actually win a war since WWII and that he wants to help out the US military with a few pointers. What, so would Finland's wonderful education system make it an easy target? Or has the US invaded countries for their good ideas in the past? What has one got to do with the other? Moore visits a few (well, a lot) of showcase institutions around the world, but mostly in Europe. In the end it often comes down to the respective ministers bragging about what a wonderful job they're doing. Moore effectively doesn't ask questions, he wants to advertise, and this is inherently boring. He's much better when he's being inquisitive and scratching to reveal what's beneath the surface rather than standing by in admiration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Returning To Our Own Ideas Through The Lens Of Other Nations Is Thought Provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore can make a mean documentary. He can make the viewer uneasy while entertaining with a chuckle. The synopsis of this film, "Where To Invade Next", was kind of polarizing at first glance. It seemed to indicate Moore was going to tear down us down calling our collective population a kind of imperialists. Well, nothing could be further from the reality. This isn't about our country going into some far flung foreign piece of real estate to assert our will. It was about how some far flung lands have learned to live better than we are and Moore wants to invade these countries to just bring back a kind of new way of approaching our own problems at home. In this way one might wish these good ideas invade us causing us to slowly learn something valuable about ourselves and how to make the U.S. better for all.I think Michael Moore is on to something. We need to move away from a war economy to one that actually improves human dignity. I like holding up a mirror to different cultures quest to do that so we see something besides our way can be very right. Sure, this is an entertaining travelogue, but we shouldn't bury our heads to the larger truth. We've succeeded as a great country but we've put band-aids on our equally massive failures. We've been creating an ever widening gap in our society between the rich and poor. It's creating staggering poverty which along with that creates myriad social problems. One could watch this film and think "bunk", you could think I better move to, say, Germany, before this gets worse here, or you could demand we start putting our own humanity first. Much would have to be torn down, but much good is still underpinning even the bad. We should choose to admit we're failing as much, or more, at this late date and in that we should demand positive change. Are we at a crossroads to reinvent the greatest country on the planet. I'd say yes and in it's humble way this film asks that question. In closing, there's lots of things to ponder after watching this film. Many quite morally important to which there is sure to be varied opinions regarding. One thing, maybe not a moral issue, but a telling important one has stuck in my mind. I can see it quite literally in my town which has had a big growth in the automotive support industrial segment in the last fifteen years. I referring to out of a dozen new factories not a one has the windows the Germans consider as an important way to improve the worker's mental health. We don't build windowless houses, or schools, so how could we be so blind as to think it's the best way to keep workers happily toiling away? Start with this and ruminate over the many more ways we've failed our own selves. And know this isn't a Michael Moore hate film?.it's a love letter to his country to do better. We can and must.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Social Progress Is Possible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest Moore feature doesn't have the searing anger that fueled Roger &amp; Me or Bowling for Columbine, so it feels like a slightly lesser achievement than those great documentaries. But it's still an eye- opener, even for non-Americans. Moore reminds us that the USA once led the world in developing and implementing progressive social policies. These policies include treating all human beings as equally worthy of respect, ensuring all children are properly nurtured, viewing education as a social good accessible to all, imposing no cruel and unusual punishments on criminals, and making sure women are fully represented at all levels of practical governance.But in recent years the USA has turned its back on such policies, and Moore crosses the Atlantic to show how other countries (including such unlikely ones as Slovenia and Tunisia), have taken up the progressive torch with remarkable results. Moore's trope of "invading" other countries in order to plant the Stars and Stripes and steal their policies is overdone, but there are plenty of "A-ha!" moments in the film. And Moore doesn't shirk awkward issues: he movingly shows the effort that modern Germany makes to come to terms with its Nazi past, and how against all odds Norway manages to treat its homegrown mass murderer as a human being. His film is also full of good humour. Perhaps being off American soil has liberated his curiosity at the expense of his anger.So why in Moore's view has America lost its progressive soul? There are several clues in the documentary. One is a chart that shows that the USA actually has by far the highest taxes in the developed world to pay for the massive proportion of its budget that goes on military spending. It's just that these taxes are disguised as something else: tuition fees, for example. One should probably go back to Moore's earlier documentaries for fuller answers. Meanwhile, watch this heartening film and learn that social change for the better is not a Utopian dream--it can actually be achieved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Where to Invade Next" is a great documentary. It was so uplifting to watch the kids eating lunch in Paris. The only disheartening part about the lunches was watching Moore strive to be the buffoon (perhaps he does this to serve as a representation of the USA at its worst) by pushing coke on the kids. Then, at the prison, I feared he'd stick his mouth under the catsup dispenser since he was so giddy about these gadgets. The prisons were so humane. Everything about the film gave me a sense of hope that America could be a more civilized place. When we learn about Finland, the highest rated education system in the world, and discover the students go to school the fewest hours, don't even take multiple-choice tests, rarely get homework, and if they do it takes them less than 20 minutes to complete, as an educator, I question my role in this madness. The ending of the film sagged a bit, but viewers can remember Portugal, and the police officers (who don't convict people for using drugs) urging Americans to give up the death penalty and be humane. Maybe Moore will take himself out of the movies, or, at least portray himself as being less gluttonous.</fullReview>

The idea that in today's globalized world you can claim that you "know it best" or any other form of exceptionalism is ridiculous to the extreme.

In other words, "Be the Best We Can Be", to Borrow a Phrase.Of course, this doesn't mean He is Anti-American, every well meaning Citizen of the USA strives for a "More Perfect Union", and is Mindful of Our Triumphs as well as Our Faults. Constructive Criticism is not only Expected but is Essential in a Free Society such as America and the reason why the "Founding Fathers" made it Absolutely Clear that for the Country to Survive and Flourish there must be Citizen Watchdogs that Point Out the Injustices and Failures of Our Leaders and King Makers.A Constructive Critic is Michael Moore and His new Film, admittedly by the Filmmaker Himself, Cherry Picks the Flowering of other Countries and Points Out the Possibilities. The Movie makes a Point that a number of these Admirable Tendencies and Ideas were Seeds Planted on His Home Turf. American Ideals that have been Lost, Abandoned, Relinquished, or otherwise given up on for a Variety of Reasons and it's Time to Rediscover, Embrace, and Employ the Things that Work and Eliminate the ones that don't. The Film is not an Attack on America, it's a Cry for Common-Sense Capitalism that Works for Everyone and a Need for Less Divisiveness and More Inclusion. We can always be Better and to Apathetically Succumb to a Mindset Manipulated by Media Masters, Politicians, and Corporate Overlords that this is the Best that the Country has to Offer is not Only Dangerously False but Genuinely Un-American and the Founding Fathers would be Ashamed. That's Michael Moore's Thesis in all His Films and is as American as any Flag Lapel Pin. Moore wears the American Flag on His Conscience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore Serious than Usual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to Invade Next marks something of a change for Michael Moore. Although it features his usual snark and left wing views, it takes a more serious approach to its subject than previous Moore outings. Moore visits various countries, mostly in Europe, to show government policies he thinks the United States should adopt. Among the countries he visits are Italy, France, Slovenia, Iceland, Finland, and Tunisia.Rather than examining every aspect of the countries he visits, he focuses on one or two policies he thinks are especially important. For example, in Italy, he looks at the amount of vacation time allotted to workers and the strength of Italian unions. Conservative critics will inevitably complain that he fails to give consideration to the flaws of these countries. However, Moore himself admits in the film that none of the countries profiled are perfect.Moreover, Moore at times goes out of his way to explore the most challenging aspects of the other countries' policies, including aspects most Americans wouldn't be comfortable with. For example, when discussing the Norwegian criminal justice system, he considers the light twenty-one year sentence given to Anders Brevik, the white supremacist terrorist who killed over seventy people. As Moore makes clear, even policies he supports have downsides.Over all, the film is well worth watching and shows a more serious side of Moore as a filmmaker. That said, towards the end it starts to suffer from pacing issues, and the film could easily have been ten to fifteen minutes shorter. I personally would have ended the movie with the interview with the Icelandic banker who describes why she wouldn't have wanted to live in the United States. What she said summed up the film as a whole and would have made a perfect conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This isn't an anti-war movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to Invade Next (2015) was directed by Michael Moore who is also the star of the film. This movie should win an Oscar for most misleading title. It's not about previous, present, or future invasions of other countries by the U.S. (That would make for an even longer film.)Moore "invades" several countries in Europe (also Tunisia in North Africa) to find out what they do better than we do. In his own shambling, disordered way, he get access to people and places that are truly interesting. A high-security prison in Norway, a factory in Italy, the Finnish Minister of Education, etc.In each case, he finds something really positive about the country, and then considers how we could apply it to the U.S. For example, in Portugal, using "illicit" drugs isn't against the law. No one is in prison in Portugal because he or she is a user. Moore contrasts thatto our situation in the U.S., where hundreds of thousands of people are incarcerated for non-violent drug offenses.The list goes on and on--free college education in Slovenia, gourmet school lunches in France, no school homework in Germany, etc.In many cases, people point out to Moore that they derived their progressive ideas from the United States. They are using these progressive ideas, but we have forgotten them.Moore sidesteps actual military invasion. (He touches on U.S. military spending for just a few seconds in a two-hour movie.) And, as he himself admits in the film, he has cherry-picked the best practices from each of the countries. Moore makes the important argument that in these progressive country, taxes are "higher." Then he makes the serious counter-argument: taxes are more than income taxes. Yes, income taxes are higher in other countries, but in the U.S. we are "taxed" by having to pay for higher education, having to pay for health insurance, having to pay for childcare, and so forth. Good point.I don't think this is a great Michael Moore movie. However, once you can get past the misleading title, you can learn quite a bit from the film. For example, when drug use was decriminalized in Portugal, drug use went down!We saw the movie at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It will work well on the small screen. It's worth seeking out if you're a Moore fan, or a progressive who could conceive of a prison where knives are freely available. Otherwise, you probably won't like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel like weather you agree or disagree with what Micheal Moore is doing, Where to Invade Next does make you think about things, and is the type of doc that starts a conversation. Although, is it a doc when the filmmaker gets so personally involved? Moore sets up Where to Invade Next with a humorous narrative suggesting he was asked by all the heads of the U.S Military to travel to all White countries, see what they can offer America, and take it over for their resources. The main concept is that there are countries out their who are living at least part of the American dream better than America, and I do mean parts. Moore is not saying these countries are perfect only noting one aspect that they are doing better than America, aspects that these countries actually got from the United States in the first place, aspects we ourselves are not doing as a whole anymore.You could punch holes in what Moore is trying to do, cause it's easy enough to do, but that would be very pigheaded when the man is just trying to show us (in a very funny way) how America has fallen off the path and how it's possible to get back on track.It's not an easy path to get back on, in fact its More complicated than what Moore is explaining, but the doc does get you asking "Why doesn't America work that way?"

		<fullReview>Frankly, maybe his worst movie.I generally love most of Michael Moore's films. Bowling for Columbine is the template most modern documentaries use today. Fahrenheit 911 wasn't bold enough but it was pretty darn entertaining and very watchable, a great documentary. Sicko was such a powerful piece of work that both Democrats and Republicans tried to suppress it from our discussion about national health care. Capitalism a love story was a heart breaking slap in the face letting Americans know that they officially lost their country. So when I heard about Where to Invade Next, I thought it was going to be another great hard- hitting documentary from Michael Moore but this time about the military industrial complex. After the first 3 minutes I realized the title was meant to describe what Michael is doing in the documentary, taking what he believes to be good ideas from other places and bring them over to America. And that's why this film doesn't work. He covers a gamut of ideas and topics and because of that, he never really explores them as much as he should. There is no central idea to the movie. Sure, you can argue that the theme is to make America awesome but all the ideas are never explored as much as they should to sell you on them. The very first topic he covers is from Italy and it is about workers getting a ton of vacation time and etc. That sound great but he uses 2 high-end Italian companies as examples for this; and it isn't a realistic argument. Just for the hell of it I googled Italy's unemployment rate and it is twice as high as ours here in the US. I also found out Italy's economy is hurting bad. Maybe I'm wrong but we'll never know for sure because Moore don't explore the idea as much as he should. It is almost funny, somewhere in the documentary he points out that almost 50% of taxes Americans pay goes to the military and I'm thinking to myself, "Why didn't you make a documentary just about that??" I forget how many topics he covers as he hopped around the world but I wish he just made a documentary about each topic instead of just slamming them all together into this near mess of a film. Am I being hard on this movie? You beat your a$$ I am! I expect more from Moore and I'm not going to give this movie a free-pass just because I agree with 80% of his opinions. If you've read this far into the review then you must want to know if the movie is worth watching or not. I'm just going to tell you this, this is the first time I ever walked away from a Michael Moore movie and forgot most of it the next day. Whenever I end up posting this review on IMDb, chances are the only thing I'll remember about the documentary is the title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore and the limitations of liberalism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Where To Invade Next" contrasts U.S. social backwardness with more humane policies in some other capitalist countries: good, civilized school lunches, ample vacations and downtime for workers, free college tuition, rehabilitation and no death penalty for prisoners, free abortions (in a Muslim country!), prosecution of corporate criminals and numerically appropriate representation of women in business and government. The film is important, well made and perceptive in many ways. Moore shows how various progressive ideas originated in the U.S. but have been implemented elsewhere due to workers', womens' and students' collective struggle, long absent here. He laments the unconfronted living legacy of slavery and lynch rule, vividly depicting the racist brutality of police and the profitable U.S. prison slave-labor system. He notes also that 59% of the U.S. budget goes to the military. He does so in passing, however. It's a telling indication of his limited perspective. The filmmaker doesn't comment on how U.S. military triumphalism infects public thought. On the other hand he's inspired by German "national" accountability which holds the masses, rather than the rulers, guilty for Nazi racial and war crimes. U.S. capitalism's military and financial reach set in motion global waves of speculative frenzy and austerity. Pushback and more humane policies ensued in some places but massive unemployment and marginal labor remain widespread. The benefits Moore profiles are possible because they're unequally distributed. At the same time the immigrant and marginal underclass provides a lower wage ceiling and the political tinder by which the ruling class justifies ever increasing state repression. Moore's focus on good versus bad policy "choices" takes no notice of any of this. It's an inherently moralistic and superficial view, not grounded in any consideration of the capitalist system, ideology and class relations in which such "choices" are made. His proposals may persuade a liberal audience to press for more than the ever lesser evil they've been swallowing. But events seem to be overtaking Moore's too-gentle persuasion. Some other director will yet have to address the burning questions of class power.Rita Freed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the premise is Michael Moore "invading" other countries (mostly European) to highlight what they do better than America ,whether it's healthcare, education, prisons, drug enforcement, or all of the above. He then proposes that we "steal" these things to make our country better.We can agree with Moore that there many things Europe does better than us, but the problem is he doesn't offer any in-depth analysis or solutions to these issues. He argues we can fix our problems by doing what the Euros are doing - and in some cases I wholeheartedly agree - but he makes no effort to present the other side of the coin or to explain why these changes haven't occurred yet. if you're well-versed in worldly affairs this movie may affirm many things you already know, but it doesn't offer any new insights and doesn't really tell you anything you don't already know.thematically, this picture's a bit uneven. it lacks the focused compelling vision that Bowling for Columbine had. But it's also lightheartedly entertaining and there are amusing and funny scenes, with an examination of the perks of Norway's prisons being a highlight.as Moore often does, this feels more like propaganda than an impartial documentary. it's clear there's an agenda here and stuff is often taken out of context or manipulated to support his case. For example, he touts Scandinavian schooling as the pinnacle of education, yet conspicuously fails to mention any Asian countries, who also have superior education, because it doesn't support his case for more liberal and unstructured schooling.at it's best, this can be a fun and entertaining look at the questions American society faces. just don't expect any thought-provoking results or actual answers to these questions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I thought that the premise of the movie was a solid and interesting one, I also thought that this was the least satisfying and effective movie from Michael Moore. While everyone almost always thinks about "Bowling For Columbine" and "Fahrenheit 911", personally I think that "Sicko" and "Capitalism: A Love Story" are his most relevant, besides "Roger And Me".The movie takes a rather na?ve and dimwitted view of Europe. While many of the ideas, concepts and practices shown in the movie indeed exist in Europe, the continent also has a dark underbelly and many disturbing aspects, which the movie does briefly acknowledge, but by enlarge glosses over. Things that have been seen in the news recently, like xenophobia, an increase or even backslide into authoritarianism, corruption, conflict, strife of all kinds and tribalism...yep even that.I lived in Germany and my experience there was completely different from that depicted in the movie. While in broad strokes the social safety net, progressive policies and other aspects of Germany are true, the undercurrent of everything the made Germany the country of World War 1 and 2 is still there smouldering beneath the surface and waiting to be reignited.Basically Germany is great if you are a German. Same goes for Sweden, Denmark and all others. If you are an outsider...well let's just say that all changes.While I know that this is not the focus of the movie and I don't expect Mr. Moore to explain all that, glossing over those troubling facts and realities diminishes the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The infant terrible of American documentaries, Michael Moore, has regularly savaged American industry and culture from General Motors to McDonald's for their excesses. His newest diatribe, Where to Invade Next, is his best, clearest, and least strident of all.Moore takes exception to American exceptionalism as he visits countries that have adopted our cultural values and actually implemented them when we have seemed to forsake them. For instance, in education, Finland has reduced homework, adopted shorter school days, and has no private schools?all to allow for the fuller development of the child's personality in areas such as sports and the arts, or good old socializing with family and friends.In politics, Moore judiciously chooses popular uprisings (not Syria, for instance) that have succeeded to oust tyrants and establish democracies or at least regimes that attend to the people's needs. For Slovenia, he points out the student uprising that blocked a decision to impose tuition rates.More interestingly is the rise of women to influence those new worlds. It's in this gender universe that Moore does his best work. He features the one bank in Iceland run by women that survived Iceland's devastating recession. The other two failures could be ascribed to male testosterone-fueled risk taking. BTW, Iceland also elected the first female president in the world.In the end, Moore himself is flawed with his own case of cinematic testosterone excess, this time going after America's lack of moral certitude and especially its self-defeating penchant for individualism over communalism. At the same time he paints those virtuous countries with Technicolor fields and houses (Nuremburg looks like a movie set from the air with red roofs and immaculate streets) central-casting beautiful people, and no negative vibes. In Norway he doesn't challenge a prisoner's plush life despite the prisoner's murder conviction. No flaws are apparent, but then Moore never claimed the whole truth and nothing but the truth.Per usual, Moore is as unbalanced as his wardrobe, adorned with his signature army jacket, scruffy hair, and obesity. Yet this time, he seems less self-aggrandizing and more interested in America's reclaiming its principles. He still stacks the deck in favor of his thesis, no matter how benign he seems to be.He's heavy-handed and biased, just a bad-boy having fun with his camera. Ending with The Wizard of Oz advice that Dorothy always had the power to return to Kansas, Moore reminds me how really tied to Hollywood fantasy he reluctantly is. The European fiscal crisis? Mon Dieu, it never appears in this doc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's ours is theirs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. We haven't heard much from director Michael Moore since his 2009 film Capitalism: A Love Story ? and not many people have complained. While Mr. Moore's eagerness to ask tough questions and confront the system has always been appreciated (or at least thought-provoking), his style and manner have often seemed somewhat dubious, one-sided and self-serving. And now comes the new and improved Michael Moore. Many say he has mellowed in temperament; however, a better description might be that he has achieved a level of wisdom that allows for an approach that makes us more receptive to his points.This latest begins with a note that the U.S. has not won a war since WWII, and the farcical hook is that the Joint Chiefs of Staff have summoned Moore for advice. See, America has lost its way and is on the wrong track when it comes to such basics as personal happiness, equality and overall priorities. Moore's solution is to "invade" other countries and stake a claim on the things they do better than us (us being the United States).To drive home the contrast of how other nations focus on crucial topics that the U.S. seems to have forgotten, Moore cherry-picks the best parts of other societies. These include: Italy (extended vacations for less stress), France (superior school nutrition and straight-forward sex education), Finland (top rated education despite no homework, short school days, and no standardized testing), Slovenia (free college education which means no debt for graduates), Germany (strong middle class, national healthcare, high wages at small companies), Portugal (decriminalization of drugs resulting in less crime and lower drug usage), Norway (prison rehabilitation), Tunisia (women's rights), and Iceland (gender equality).To convince us of his kinder, gentler self, Moore obsessively flaunts the American flag throughout. It does help to distract from his trademark disheveled and bedraggled personal appearance ? his usual method in attempting to convince he's just "one of the guys" rather than the multi-millionaire he is. Still, despite his gimmicky approach, it's impossible not to notice the obvious lack of in-your-face negativity. In fact, it could be stated that optimism exists as he tromps his way through the good news in each stop. Optimism with a bite ? the comparisons aren't favorable for the U.S. in any of these scenarios.What Moore does best is generate debate and inspire passionate discussion on topics. His point here is that most of the ideals he is claiming from other countries actually have a foundation in America. Yes, these are ideals that America has forsaken, yet are working in other places. Of course, the cherry-picking gives the impression of idyllic societies, when in fact, each of these nations face many of their own unnamed challenges ? some on the specific topics addressed by Moore.Moore's goal seems to be to re-focus our attention on core American values - the topics Americans care about in our daily lives. He wants us to be annoyed with the way things are ? crime-fed bankers still lining their pockets, a stressed-out workforce, and an education system that is quite simply stated, a mess. Maybe this kinder, gentler (but still manipulative) contrarian is on to something, and he ends by asking us how we feel about all of this. Moore has again succeeded in getting us thinking about things, and this time it comes with quite a surreal movie moment ? Moore telling a disinterested Portugal police officer that he has "cocaine in my pocket right now."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this latest Michael Moore documentary he heads overseas to investigate the quality of life in other countries and compares them to The united States . He checks out things such as prison systems, health-care and education and sugar coats them , making them out to be wonderful . This is without doubt the worst thing Michael Moore has done. Basically it's a jolly abroad where he kisses everyone's arse by being shocked at how wonderful they are and I expect much more from him. I prefer a Michael Moore that confronts injustice instead of pointing out the bleeding obvious. He looks old and tired in this film and I wonder if it's time he put his feet up?

		<fullReview>No context, no hard questions, just showing some benefits of the social system in Europe and interviewing far left people. We know America has less social protection and a lot of things can be said about it, but listening to Moore won't help. If he thinks America should not invest so much in the military, then he should go ask the Europeans if they want to invest in the military, because the social system in Europe exists under an American umbrella. That's a talk that could give some insight. He also singles out exceptional cases that are not representative. He could find most of the things in the US of A as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ham-Fisted and Light on Details</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore has long been considered a liberal firebrand and polemic ever since he first dawned a dirty baseball cap and started taking a certain CEO to task. His most popular and critically acclaimed film Bowling for Columbine (2002) is a masters course in social documentary that has since been replicated by both the right and left. Regardless of what you think of the man and his politics, two things remain clear while watching all his documentaries; he has a strong point of view and he loves his country and his countrymen. In that regard, Where to Invade Next is more of the same only with less actual information.The conceit of Where to Invade Next involves Michael Moore (again the subject of his own doc) traipsing from country to country in travelogue fashion while looking like a frog lost a fight to a dust bunny. His goal: to find new ideas from overseas that may be of use to Americans. He makes stops in mostly European countries including: Italy, Portugal, France, Norway, Iceland, Slovenia and Germany but lest you think his mentality is wholly euro-centric, he does make a stop in Tunisia to talk to participants of the Arab Spring. The audience is meant to share his shock when various participants tell Mr. Moore of their shorter work hours, healthy school lunches, lengthy vacation times, progressive treatment of women, criminals and drug abusers.Moore has a gift for argumentum ad passiones choosing, among others a Tunisian revolutionary, a female Icelandic bank CEO and a bereaved Norwegian father to a mass shooting victim as his subjects. These moments are almost always juxtaposed with the American response to the similar problems these people have faced either to provide humor or to provide a woeful sense of embarrassment among American viewers. The most stunning juxtaposition was the treatment of American criminals in prison being tied down, beaten and mauled by dogs while Norwegian maximum security prisoners enjoy the creature comforts of a college dorm. Admittedly I was dumbfounded.Yet anecdotal approach to his documentary is a novelty that wears thin the more the film swerves and bends to match Mr. Moore's thesis. He has a knack for advertising and cheerleading his world view but he seems unwilling or unable to defend it, choosing instead to ignore and/or misrepresent those who would take him to task. In one stunningly misguided infographic, Moore compares the average taxes a French person would pay versus an average American with a roll of coins. I assume the coins represent the average since there are no actual numbers. Moore then stacks coins to represent payment of medical care, college tuition and other social programs Americans pay out of pocket while the French enjoy them as basic social services via the slightly higher taxes they pay. Why not add more detail to this infographic? Could it be the facts don't support his argument?What's more likely the case is Moore has leaned so fully into his leftist persona that he doesn't feel the need to clarify, defend or expound on certain social complexities. Near the end of the film, Moore and a friend walk the length of a section of the Berlin Wall and compare the social ills that could be cured with left-leaning ideas with the chiseling of the Wall. "People keep saying it's not that simple; but it is, it is that simple," he says while confusing his nonsense with horse sense. In another scene, Moore evokes Germany's dark past with clips of Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (1935) and preaches about learning and embracing all your history, even the ugly parts. He again juxtaposes with images of our own ugly history not realizing that the information he is presenting is so skewed it risks being in the same ballpark as badly written history textbooks.The most poignant part of the movie was provided by a Portuguese police officer who explained Portugal's policy of decriminalizing all illicit drugs preferring treatment to incarceration. While parting, Moore asks him what he would like to say to the American people. He responds by saying "a good society believes in human dignity." It's those words that ultimately make me believe Moore, despite his ham-fisted attention grabbing, has his heart in the right place. Yet it is possible to further the cause of human dignity and social responsibility without resorting to obfuscation, misrepresentation and hyperbole. It seems Michael Moore may have forgotten that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Humorful Travelogue, Nothing More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember Roger and Me? I know, I know. It is unfair to use a directors first and arguably best work to define a criteria, but the differences illustrate so perfectly why Where to Invade Next is strictly mediocre. The core character still exist. Michael Moore is a man on a mission, humorous and irreverent. The setting has sure changed. Here he is, Flint long gone and on a grand European tour. The doors are not being shut in his face either. CEOs and presidents are just ecstatic to see this man and although he makes efforts to look slightly less disheveled while meeting heads of state, the baseball cap remains. What has been lost is the brutal honesty and deviousness, replaced by razzle and dazzle. Other countries are presented as exotic paradises. Old Michael Moore was smart enough to ask the how, the why not us, and what am I missing. Instead we get agreeable squishy sentiments presented as corroborating evidence. And pandering. Where to Invade Next is an amusing tour of Europe, and that's all. It provides no insight for the informed, has no chance of convincing naysayers, and will never ever be an incendiary for change. The premise is amusing enough. Michael Moore abandons conventional war for profit, acting as a one man army planting American flags and laying claim to international ideas. These philosophies are interrogated out of a smorgasbord of individuals. Presidents, cops, teachers, factory workers, prisoners, all are confronted by the marauding Moore. These interviews try to prove that seemingly radical ideas in America are everyday realties elsewhere. This approach certainly leads to humorous and shocking moments, but this method alone is unambitious. Without any understanding of the cultural background and political consequences, highlighting these differences is simply exploiting exoticism. Any one of the explored topics could have easily been a documentary on its own. I am not calling for a new movie, just the same with a tad more substance. I believe Moore is a skilled enough documentarian that he could have accomplished this without diminishing the charm and snap. A simple political travelogue alone could have been an excellent movie, but Moore imposes higher standards on himself. When he makes such bold claims, some critical pondering is a must. All of the answers for our problems are out there, ours for the taking, come together and we have revolution, paradise. Audience erupts, standing ovation. I sit alone looking for another skeptic. Moore is pretending to peddle a rational argument while simultaneously intellectually disarming his audiences. Where to Invade Next is basic entertainment masqueraded as a message. That diatribe came out too serious. If you enjoy other Moore films you will like this one. If you despise Moore, who cares about the quality of this movie, you're just searching the bottom of the IMDb reviews for someone who agrees with you. In either case, you know who you are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>He does it quite well, with a humorous twist. But his message is wrong on so many levels. I do not agree with him at all but I give it five anyway, because he is good at this type of disinformation.Among many things he goes on about paid vacation. OK, sounds great. But if you think about the following example.A person in France earns 3000 EUR per month after taxes. He/she takes four weeks vacation and gets paid during this time. Great. That is then a yearly salary of 36 000 EUR after taxes.A person in the US earns the equivalent of 4000 EUR per month after taxes. He/she take four weeks of unpaid vacation. That is then a yearly salary of 44 000 EUR after taxes.Who earns more? Well, you are right - the person in the US. Paid vacation sounds great but the main thing here is what you get to keep after the taxes is paid. And let me tell you: Here in Europe it is not much.Michael Moore "forgets" to mention such things throughout the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never really liked Michael Moore's films, they are too simplistic and you'll leave with a more ignorant view about the world. I've seen a lot of American or Canadian reviews but not so much from people actually living in Europe. Michael Moore really sets this movie up as if America is functioning without any intelligence and that Europe is some magical unicorn land where everything is amazing, and all we do is laugh and make love. Sure there are some things that are nice about Europe and European culture, but there is also a whole lot that is bad. Depression rates and suicide rates are really high in Europe. Since the migrant crisis Sweden,- the O'so praised liberal and socialist country has become the rape capital of Europe. In Germany the far right is gaining power, this is due to a lot of violence from foreigners on native German people. Greece is collapsed, I am sure Italy has enough problems. Spain has high unemployment rates. The dutch prisoners are full of foreigners, and there is a divide in the schooling system, you end up with things like "black schools",- it's a thing. One can also make a list of all the good things and bad things in America, but why nitpick and cater to a dumb audience? Life is messy everywhere. We're all still trying to figure it out. Anyway, the portrayal of Europe is very false, and therefore makes it a bad documentary. Michael Moore once again tries to paint a picture of European greatness,--this is all a total lie.</fullReview>

He doesn't like revenge in the justice system and supported Norways sentencing of mass murder Anders Breivik to just 10 years in prison even though he murdered 77 people. But he was very happy about the revenge in sentencing bankers to prison.He also drew conclusions based on loosely connected ideas, like the reason we had stiff drug penalties was to enslave black people to work for pennies in prison.He had a few good points like having employees on the boards of companies. But overall, I think Moore is failing to see shades of gray!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shameful pamphlet for Hillary, at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore has produced some really good stuff (Columbine, F911), with the usual load of left-wing propaganda, sometimes excessive, but often within acceptable limits. This time, after a 6-year long drought, he rushed to generate this collection of proposals based on policies that he seems to discover in his travels. Most proposals are good: universal health care, free college tuition, healthy school menus, paid maternity leave, etc. When in Italy (13th monthly salary or bonus, 1-month paid vacation every year) he claims that this was the result of a history of workers' struggle. The fact is those "conquests" were promulgated by Mussolini 90 years ago. Paid maternity leave was instituted by Hitler and other right-wing dictators (Franco, Oliveira Salazar, Pavelic), as well as by all the socialist rulers in Scandinavia. Moore wants us to believe that the Berlin wall was torn down by common people armed with chisels, when everybody knows that it happened because of the collapse of the GDR, thanks to the actions of "little guys" such as Reagan, Jaruzelski, John Paul II, Gorbachov... In Norway Moore celebrates the light 21-year jail sentence imposed on Anders Breivik for his massacres, he even suggest that this monster may be free after 10 years in prison! It seems to Moore that the only purpose of American prisons is to control its African-American population. All of the above seems enough to repudiate his "documentary", but the last 20 minutes or so show what I think is the real intent of this pamphlet, as he seems to find that most calamities and fraud happen when males are in power. He discovers wisdom in Iceland's female bankers and politicians, ignoring the damage inflicted by ladies like Margaret Thatcher, Dilma Rousseff and Cristina Kirchner. I don't think that is is by chance that this grotesque has gone public right before the 2016 presidential election...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never have I taken to Michael Moore's work. People seem to think that he's some kind of genius. Well I have news for you -- except that he is very skilled at separating people from their money, he isn't any kind of genius at all. I long ago tired of his simplistic "America bad, Europe good" narrative, but there seems to be a never-ending appetite for it in the hearts of liberal America, in Europe, and in Canada. And when I saw inappropriately angry women he was interviewing in Tunisia and in Iceland spew out nonsense betraying the fact that neither of them have the slightest clue about the United States beyond the tired clichés and the largely incorrect nonsense they have been spoon fed abroad by other people who don't know much about America, almost certainly people who dislike the United States, does he rise to the defence of his country? No, he doesn't. He lets them rant on, assassinating America and her people, because it suits his story. This guy is a tool. I hope he gets well soon, but I don't much care for his agenda. Unless you're a Moore fan, I'd take a pass on this flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore has officially gone insane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The admitted Communist, Michael Moore, has reached new levels of insanity with his latest Anti- American propaganda piece "Where to Invade Next". It's amazing, and very scary, this man actually has people taking him seriously. Moore takes viewers on a trip around the world to try and convince them that all communist and socialist nations are paradise, while America is the only terrible place to live. I'm not joking...this is the goal of his film. He actually tries to convince us that all nearly everything should be free and government is our savior. Like his pat films, what Moore continuously ignores is reality. America is the most prosperous nation in the world BY FAR. No other nation even comes close. In fact, those in The U.S considered to be "in poverty" would be considered RICH in 95% of the nations Moore is attempting to sell as some kind of liberal utopia. In America, those considered "poor" not only have food, clothing and shelter, but also have cell phones, air conditioning, flat screen TV's and most (80%) own cars. This is what is considered to be the "poverty level" in the United States. Contrast that to socialist/communist nations, many that actually have bread lines as well as rationed toilet paper (yes folks, RATIONED TP), even the harshest critic is forced to admit no other country even comes close to America's success. The poorest American is better off than the upper middle class in other nations. Most people Moore's age actually mature past their blissful youth. Unfortunately, he's still stuck with the hippie idea of "why can't everything just be free man"? Sounds great, right? Moore reminds me how true this old phrase is, "If you're not a socialist when you're young, you have no heart. If you're not a Capitalist by the time you're 30, you have no brain." Unfortunately, Mr. Moore is long past 30. He either knows he's completely full of it and just trying to profit off youthful ignorance, or he truly is a few cards short of a full deck.</fullReview>
