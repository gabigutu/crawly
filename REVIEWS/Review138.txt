		<shortDescription>A thought provoking masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a type of movie that provides any viewer a type of material that promotes hard thinking and even harder re-thinking. After the film ends, it's almost impossible to keep yourself from thinking of all the possible way to interpret such a film. It's not quite surreal or full of quirky nonsense, it's more like a set of events, which seem to make sense on one level, no sense on another level, and finally perfect sense on another level. The movie acts as an illusion to what's really going on, its almost pleasantly distracting.Our main character, Donnie Darko, is a boy suffering from sleep walking, and now what appears to be delusions. He manages to avoid a certain death with the aid of a man in a bunny suit. This twisted bunny also informs Donnie that the world will come to an end within the month. This sparked curiosity and dread in Donnie, who also has every other aspect of a teenager's life to worry about. The film proceeds with the feel of a teen flick, the style of a horror, and a plot suited for a fantasy.The end of the movie is the part which will make you want to watch it again. You'll think you've discovered what's really going on after the first time, prove yourself wrong on the second time, and will sit and watch every possible detail the third time. Richard Kelly has created an instant cult classic, and perhaps something more than that. Extremely well written with believable characters speaking believable dialogue.I'll be the first to admit, this film is not for everyone. People will either love it, or despise it with all their heart. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone who has a taste for dark humor and a desire to put the pieces of the puzzle together over and over, long after the film has ended. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the main theme of this film was summed up somewhere in the middle, where Donnie is speaking to a not-so-helpful self-help guru and says something to the following effect:"Yes, I am scared and I am confused. But I think you are the f**king antichrist!!!"In the end, _Donnie Darko_ is a film about people who feel life and all the emotions within it very deeply. Donnie himself is a basically sweet-tempered (often courageous) young man who is pathologically terrified of loneliness and the thought of spiritual isolation. His quest for meaning and self-discovery drives him to the fringes of our reality, which only serves to isolate him more from the world he loves. The few who understand what Donnie is going through go largely unnoticed (such as his girlfriend Gretchen or a tragically overweight yet remarkable sensitive little girl) or unappreciated (such as Karen, the English teacher whose only sin is trying to show her students that there is no such thing as a true end.)Of course, this movie far from polarizes its characters (indeed, polarization is the last thing this film wants to accomplish) and the majority are just a mishmash of the beautiful and the grotesque: Donnie's parents, who are at the same time loving and perpetually confused; the aforementioned self-helper Jim Cunningham, who is desperate to spread the lie that keeps him sane to everybody else; and Donnie's sister, struggling between her identity as an adult and her identity as a child. And then there's Frank. All I can say here is that nothing can prepare you for or adequately describe Frank.Probably the best thing about this movie, though, is its incredible emotional range. It manages to inspire hope, love, dread, laughter, and tears at different points throughout the movie without making you feel least bit like there is a contradiction between those states. The scenes with Frank (especially the one that takes place in the therapist's office against the backdrop of a conversation about the end of the world) are quite frankly some of the scariest things I've ever seen in a movie, as they literally made my skin crawl.Finally, the performances in this film are exquisite. The talent in this film is top notch and even Gyllenhall is just amazing. That said, though, this film has a dismal future. Combine the fact that the large majority of the moviegoing public is just going to find it unbearably weird with the fact that the movie begins with part of an airplane crashing into a building (this has got to be the very definition of bad timing) and it's pretty clear that this film is going to stay underground. However, if you are looking for a beautiful experience with a unique film, _Donnie Darko_ is just about as good as it gets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this on cable tv. Thumbing through the channels I stopped just as Donnie Darko was beginning. I thought the title was weird, and readied my thumb on the remote channel selector...pointed it at the TV...and it stayed there for the rest of the movie! I couldn't stop watching! I've never seen a movie like this. The movie has a beautiful aspect (especially the end). And there are a few chuckles as well. Contrary to the more critical commentary, there is depth and complexity to the story that kind of requires you to see it more than once. I'm no genius, but what I gathered the basis of Donnie Darko to be is about our part in the deliberate DESIGN of our destiny, and I catch more each time I watch it. Regardless of anything, sincere thought and expression went in to the making of Donnie Darko. Mixed with skill and technical ability = Art.A WORK OF ART! In the top 100 movies of all time in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that this is the Directors first film is amazing to me. The scenes dripped with style, yet that style never seemed distracting. None of it was self congratulatory or gluttonous. The visuals were supported by a truly emotional score and its hard to find fault in the 80's pop tunes that found their way into some of the more impressive scenes.The story is very much thought provoking. Its the type that leaves you pondering the possibilities voiced by the characters. There is nothing condescending about this film. Answers arent simply handed out, rather the viewer is left to draw many conclusions instead. The acting is also top notch. If i hadnt known beforehand that Patrick Swayze was in this film I would have been shocked. His character is amusing and interesting all at the same time. A great cameo for him. Drew Barrymore is forgetable, though that in no way detracts from the film. Of course the star is Jake Gyllenhaal. There is nothing that can be said to properly praise his performance. The rest of the cast chosen fit their roles perfectly. All of these things combine to create a stunning film. One can only hope that filmgoers will give this little gem a shot and support a true wonder. This is the only film I have awarded a 10/10 on the IMDB.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brevity cannot possibly do this justice...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In recent years, Hollywood has specialised in churning out mainstream trash; generic trash not even fit for the cutting room floor. Yet despite these movies' shortcomings, they continue to enjoy success at the box office. Sequel upon sequel, photo fit remake upon photo fit remake, frequently taking the box office by storm whilst simultaneously relegating smaller independent projects to the now relatively unheard-of arthouse cinemas. The tragedy is that the independent filmmakers are often those with the most talent; the most creativity; the most flair. One such filmmaker is director Richard Kelly, who saw the release of his scifi-drama-horror-tragedy-comedy-romance-thriller Donnie Darko last year. After reading a few rave reviews for the movie, I decided to check it out to find out what all the fuss was about.Donnie is a seventeen year-old boy with major emotional problems. He suffers from a psychological condition not dissimilar to schizophrenia, and lives most of his life in a medication-induced daze. We watch as Donnie meets Frank, a six foot tall rabbit which predicts the end of the world. Returning to his house, Donnie finds a jet engine jutting out from the side of his bedroom. The remainder of the movie follows Donnie's coming to terms with the ghostly presence of Frank in his life, the purpose of his existence, and the fact that the world will end unless he intervenes.Without giving too much away, I can safely say that Donnie Darko is a mind-blowing experience. And I use the word `experience' in its truest sense. From the opening shots of Donnie's suburban hometown, through to the satirical take on Middle American high schools, the movie is incredibly involving on many levels. In fact, each frame speaks to us on more profound terms than the majority of arthouse films would claim to do. This is, in part, due to the impeccable performances by each and every member of the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal, a relative unknown, delivers a subtle yet emotionally charged performance as Donnie himself - the scene in which he tells his psychologist of his various childhood traumas is made both funny and moving by the haunting way in which Jake delivers each line, contrasted with the almost childish qualities of his movements on the couch. Most incredible of all, however, is his terrifying screen presence as he trudges slowly through a deserted corridor or along a dark street, head tilted slightly forward, face fixed in a confused, bewildered expression. Drew Barrymore is also superb as the liberal high school teacher rejected and scorned in a Conservative education system, while Patrick Swayze is excellent in his extended cameo, a smartly observed satire of a self-help guru with a few skeletons in the closet.Where the movie comes into its own, however, is in its ability to incorporate and deal with a variety of genres. Every movie genre seems to make an appearance, so much so that to categorise the movie as simply a `psychological horror' or a `supernatural thriller' would be an unforgivable insult. Even the movie's portrayal of a high school, whilst unique and original, even bears a slight resemblance to the teen movies of yesteryear, what with school bullies, the new kid in town and an annoying gym teacher. Yet, Kelly never lets his movie sink to the depths of clichéd teen drama. Instead, he paints a startlingly realistic portrait of suburban America, interspersed with flashes of sci-fi surreality. The movie never descends into total Lynchian weirdness, yet nothing ever seems quite real.Donnie Darko may conjure up images of oversized bunnies and watery projections protruding from people's midriffs, yet on an emotional level it is very much human. Donnie Darko is as much a drama as it is a thriller, and a superb character study at that. We are often led to question whether Donnie's visions and actions are the consequence of a paranoid, twisted, drug-polluted mind, or whether he really is experiencing such things. His gradual disillusionment as he realises that there is no hope and that he may have to go through eternity alone is beautifully portrayed, while the sense of peace and inner fulfilment he ultimately achieves is a truly inspirational message.Without meaning to sound overtly soppy and without meaning to spoil the ending for anyone unfortunate enough not to have seen the movie, Donnie Darko concludes in one of the most mind bending, emotionally affecting ways possible. On a scientific level it will fuel debates for years to come (I have already read numerous different interpretations of the ending on the internet) but emotionally it transcends the conventions of modern movie making. In fact, it soars. The last few minutes, where Tears For Fears' Mad World is played over shots of various characters breaking into fits of hyper-emotion or contemplating their actions, are tremendously moving, while the lyrics (`I find it kinda funny/I find it kinda sad/the dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had') perfectly summarise Donnie's state of mind. Furthermore, the last few lines of the movie, without telling you what they are, are meaningful on so many levels, and mark the end to a film steeped in emotion, surrealism and subtle beauty.I implore you to watch this movie. It most certainly is not for everyone, and will probably be cast off by a lot of the movie going public as pretentious, artsy nonsense. Donnie Darko only saw a very short, unsuccessful US run and was accompanied with very little hype. Hilarious, heart-rendingly sad, terrifying, profound, intellectually stimulating, emotionally absorbing and thematically relevant, this is by far the best movie of 2002. And for all those wishing to know if there's any American Pie-style crudity, sadly not - although at one point we are treated to a rather interesting discussion regarding the sex lives of smurfs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being an angst-ridden teenager has never been easy, especially when you can see what's down the road, and it looks a lot like the end of your world.Writer and Director Richard Kelly is an artist whose films I will anticipate and Jake Gyllenhaal is truly remarkable among a very rich cast. He plays a troubled young man with a brilliant intellect and a vast imagination, struggling with the boredom of standard education, and a society afraid of its own shadow (e.g. contemporary America). An imaginary friend, Frank - a seven foot tall metal-headed skull-faced demon-rabbit saves his life by removing him from the the scene of a catastrophe just before it occurs, only to lead him down an alternative path to an even more terrible oblivion complete with forecasts of doom, psychiatrists, and self-help charlatans.This film feels as creepy as any well-made ghost story I have ever seen, yet redefines the genre of supernatural storytelling in a very unique and original way.Donnie Darko is a film about heroism and sacrifice, decorated with disturbing imagery, the horror of everyday life, and a soundtrack reminiscent of Lynch's best. It is also a film worthy of several viewings and at least as many varied interpretations. I can not honestly recommend this to anybody who attends films for the pure sake of entertainment. Nor can I recommend it to people who need straight answers or have limited attention spans. It's art, and does not need to provide pat explanations for itself. As entertaining as this film may be, it has an unrelenting and merciless dark side, and might disturb even the most veteran indy film carmudgeon.This is a great film. See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Harvey" meets "The Mothman Prophecies," as a troubled teen starts hallucinating a horrific 6-foot-tall bunny rabbit that brings him dark forebodings about death and disaster in the very near future. A streak of "Heathers" is mixed in as well, with trenchant satirical observations of high-school life in the late '80s (story set in Oct. 1988), involving a priggish teacher, a self-help guru (Patrick Swayze!), and a put-upon fat girl at the fringes of the herd. Finally, a whiff of "Back to the Future," in the form of a local eccentric who just may have discovered the secret of time travel, but a secret that has more to do with spirituality than technology. A lot goes on here. There's a meditation on the possible overlap between madness and the ability to perceive the divine. There's a demonstration of why, in the Bible, angelic messengers (if that's what "Frank" can be taken to be) are often so terrifying that they have to start by saying "Fear not." There's an enlistment of what martial artists refer to as the "ki" (or personal energy, emanating from a person's midsection) in the type of time travel depicted here (the term "ki" is never used in the flick, but the term "path," another word for Tao or "Way," is). Quantum physics theory about wormholes is tied to the Fortean phenomenon of things falling unexplained from the sky, in a way that's more pivotal, and therefore more interesting, than the gratuitous rain of frogs in "Magnolia."  Time travel paradoxes and ironies enter the picture as well. One character (no spoiler!), whose life is saved by Donnie's ultimate trip back in time, wouldn't have died in the first place if he hadn't dragged her along to the opening of the wormhole. Another character (again, no spoiler!), whose truly terrible secret comes to light in the wake of an arson investigation, must go unexposed as a result of that same time reversal, since the arson now won't happen. Surely that's no oversight on the part of the screenwriter; it must be an acknowledgment of the choices and trade-offs in life, as well as of a confidence that no such terrible secret can remain hidden forever.  Somehow this pastiche works, largely on the strength of good performances. Jake Gyllenhaal is appropriately moody and, also appropriately, not always likeable in the title role. Drew Barrymore, who executive produced, appears as a frustrated first-year teacher. The movie's often dreamlike atmosphere is enhanced by the cinematography, the subdued but effective special effects, and the choice of the music on the soundtrack, which includes '80's pop tunes, of course, and a haunting original song (over the end credits) titled "Mad World." Not for all tastes, but better, stranger, and more complex than I expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko was a great and thought provoking movie. Most people will probably not understand the movie the first time they watch it, because they don't know what to watch for, but the 2nd time you watch the movie most will consider it a great and profound movie. Another way to understand Donnie Darko is to have someone that has already seen the movie to watch it with you and tell you which parts of the movie to remember towards the end of the movie. This is not a movie to watch if one does not like to think during movies. Donnie Darko is also not a movie for the lazy movie watcher to watch. I normally like the easy brained movies that require no thought-process but this is one thought provoking movie that I give a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as impressive as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*This is a review of the Directors Cut*I've already reviewed the originally released cut of 'Donnie Darko' so I am not going to review the film again. Instead, I'll comment on the differences between the two versions; unfortunately most of the differences took away from the original film, which I think is truly excellent. I traveled two hours round-trip with several friends to see the Directors Cut since it was not playing in Milwaukee at the time, and while I am glad that I saw it, I feel that the original is the superior version. There were many superfluous scenes in the new cut which did not add to the film; rather I almost felt that they made the pacing falter a bit. For example, the new scene between Donnie's parents in the café ? a completely unnecessary scene which did not add anything relevant to the story. There were a handful of scenes like this, as well as some added dialogue that indeed added to the development of some characters, (Drew Barrymore's character, the teacher 'Karen' was enhanced a bit) for some it just seemed silly (One of Donnie's bus stop friends telling Cherita that he 'hopes she gets molested' turned him from just being an incidental character into being an incidental character who is a jackass.) Another major difference between the two films was the addition of several special effects to the new cut. There were a lot of dream-like sequences (the file cabinets floating among the clouds ala Rene Magritte) and all of the stuff focusing on Donnie's eyeball, computer-ish codes, etc, that just did not work in my opinion. Also, some of the most subtle changes, soundtrack for example, were disarming. The opening song was 'The Killing Moon' by Echo and the Bunnymen in the original, which provided a great backdrop in the introduction to Donnie, his environment and his family. Kelly used 'Never Tear Us Apart' by INXS in his directors cut. Certainly, a good song, but after using a perfect song originally, it is hard to get used to an inferior replacement.Which is how I sum up my feelings about Kelly's directors cut in general? Why mess with (near) perfection? 'Donnie Darko' is a fantastic film that was so thought-provoking it made some people run the other way. Only those who were interested in something beyond the ordinary stayed to ponder and theorize its meaning, and still are to this day. Kelly's new cut does not enhance the film, rather, it made it plodding and a little dumbed-down ? two adjectives I never thought I would ascribe to this film. See the directors cut to play 'spot the new stuff', but stick with the original.--Shel</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My theory of what actually happened in this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko. My Theory.At the beginning of the film, there is a dinner table scene in which Donnie's sister mentions Donnie's medication. This scene lets us know that he is mentally unstable in some way. This is later described as paranoid schizophrenia.The night the plane crashes into Donnie's house is the 2nd Oct 1988.That night, Donnie gets out of bed and takes a walk. This is where he meets Frank, the giant bunny rabbit.This Frank, the one we see in this scene is in fact a ghost of the Frank we later see shot by Donnie. This ghost has come back through time to give Donnie a choice. He shows Donnie the future, right up until the moment he is sitting at the top of the cliff, watching the tornado (or portal).Everything you see, from the point of Donnie meeting Frank on October 2nd, to the day after halloween (the cliff scene) is in fact a vision that the ghost of Frank is showing him.At one point in the future (in this vision) Donnie is speaking to his science teacher about 'God's channel' and how you can not change the future events, no matter what you do. Donnie realises on the night of 2nd October, whilst Frank is showing him this vision, that what he is seeing (and what we assumed actually happens during the rest of the movie) is 'God's channel'. The ghost of Frank shows him the plane crashing into his house, which in fact happens roughly 6 hours after Donnie has taken his stroll to meet Frank; Donnie meeting Gretchin, the school flooding, Donnie burning Jim Cunnigham's house down, the halloween party, Gretchin being run over and Donnie killing Frank in revenge. Donnie knows that he has 2 choices. He can go back to bed and prevent all the above from happening (as he knows that there is no way to change what the future holds, as it is a pre-decided event), or he can take the path shown to him by Frank (the ghostly apparition).Frank is the only character in this film who engages in any type of 'time travel'. What is shown in the movie, from the moment Donnie first meets Frank, to the cliff scene is something that actually happened in reality, however what we are seeing as the viewers is in fact the vision Donnie is seeing that night (2nd October).Frank has gone back in time to prevent his own death. He knows, that by going back in time (as a ghost) he can let Donnie know what will happen had he gone 'sleep golfing' that night (thus preventing him from being in the house the night of the crash - thus taking the path Frank is showing him).The scene at the end of the film, where Donnie is lying in bed is a replacement to where he goes 'sleep golfing', like an alternate ending.The night he dies in the film (at the end), the 2nd October, is in fact the very same night you see him meet Frank(at the beginning) There is no time travel involved to take Donnie back to that night. The film leads us to believe that Donnie in fact followed 'God's channel' and flooded the school, burnt the house down, etc etc.Let's say that this is what happened before the film we saw started, a kind of prologue.* Donnie meets Frank (the "person", as the film leads you to believe) *Donnie floods school, burns house down, has a halloween party, Gretchin gets killed and Donnie shoots Frank. *Frank as a ghost goes back in time Lets say that all the above happened in a part of the movie we did not see.(the prologue - not included in the film) This is where we see the film starting: *Frank (the "ghost") lures Donnie to the place they first "meet". He tells Donnie all about the things that have happened(as above). Donnie see's it as the future. These were the scenes we saw as actually happening. Donnie in fact, does not go sleep-golfing that night. He goes back to bed.The scene we see at the end of the film, with Donnie in bed, laughing and being killed by the plane is in fact, only 6 hours after we first see him meet Frank.This is what I think actually happened: *Donnie goes sleep walking and meets Frank. Frank shows him the future (the flooding of the school, etc etc) *Donnie prevents this all from happening by going back to bed, thus preventing all the following events.(The following events being the 'vision that Frank's ghost showed him that night, right up until he's back in bed laughing) The whole movie was set in one day. The dates flashing up on the screen, lead us to believe that the movie was progressing in time.However, these dates were just a reference point given to Donnie by Frank, on the 2nd October.If any of this is unclear, please let me know and I will do my best to clarify. Sorry for how long winded this theory is, but it's a pretty hard movie to make sense of.Discuss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the most relevant social commentary on U.S society ever put on screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Above all, this film has a kind of flow to it like nothing I've ever experienced in any other film before. The magic sets in from the very first moment, when we see Donnie waking up (and the song 'The Demon Moon' starts), and you just go with that flow and let yourself be drawn into that world. The story unfolds like a dream and the ambiguity (at least in the theatrical cut) as well as the fantastic songs help create an absolutely unique and strangely compelling atmosphere.Fantastic script and fantastic performances: this film has a richness in its characters that amazes me every time I watch it. Forget the director's cut - here for once the theatrical version is the masterpiece. Probably the best social commentary on American society I've ever seen but beautifully woven into an ambiguous, slightly surreal fantasy tale with a haunting soundtrack.My vote: 10 out of 10Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko (2001) - 9.5 / 10There are very few movies that hit at such a level 'Donnie Darko' does. It weaves in everything about a movie you've come to love; and it has something different to offer everyone.'Donnie Darko' tells the story of a young Middlesex guy, Donnie Darko. He's a fairly troubled teenager, who awakes one night to confront the shocking news that the world will end in 28 days time. Over the course of these 28 days we watch as Donnie turns everyone's lives upside down, and witness things only possible in your darkest dreams. Jake Gyllenhaal (The Day After Tomorrow, October Sky) plays a brilliant troubled teenager. Giving us the best performance of his career. Mary McDonnell (Independence Day) plays Donnie's mother with the same dedication and brilliance any mother would.If you haven't yet seen 'Donnie Darko', place it at the top of your to see list! If you've seen it, place it at the top of your to buy list! Easily one of the top ten movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is painful to watch, the directing is bad, the cinematography is bad, the plot is full of holes. Some people suggest that you need to read a book to understand it, some can even write an essay to explain the theory behind, however the movie itself is so lame that it does not show you any of that unless you deliberately do so. Don't get me wrong, I like movies of similar genre like "Mulholland Drive", but Richard Kelly is light-year away from David Lynch in terms of talent, vision and capability in making a thought-provoking movie. Well, there is a bunch of bad movies out there but they get what they deserve: bad rating. However, this movie is ridiculously overrated and it is absolutely nonsense that it makes the top 500 of Moviemeter's table.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is one of the most overrated films i've ever seen in my life and that is not hyperbole. when i express this opinion it is often met with responses like, "man, you just didn't get it" or "what are you talking about? this is maybe the best movie ever made." trying to show restraint i switch topics most of the time, but seeing as IMDb has been rated #94 on the list of greatest films ever made i just felt like i needed to say something.this movie is awful. it is pretentious, convoluted, and sophomoric. it's art film for people who don't like art film but like to think they do. it clunks along slowly in a world of frivolous angst; for heaven's sake, donnie is being led on by a big apocalyptic stuffed animal... how is that not laughable? each performance is overdone, the special effects are offensively bad, the pacing is miserable, the cinematography overly showy, and worst of all the ending is... i am not even going to touch that with a forty foot pole for the sake of you "darko" obsessives who are probably foaming at the mouth after reading this much.simply put, "donnie darko" (the film or the character) is unbearably self-important.if this is number #94, ron howard's "willow" should be #78, lucas's "howard the duck" should be #64, costner's "the postman" #25, and "shrek 2" the greatest film of all-time.</fullReview>

Interestingly enough most of the rave reviews of DONNIE DARKO came via this very website which goes against the grain of other reviewers . Roger Ebert only gave the movie two and a half stars while many other websites dedicated to film reviews claim this movie is confused and overrated . It should also be mentioned that if it's such a great , thought provoking piece of cinema then why did it miss out on so many nominations at the more prestigious film award ceremonies ? And don't say politics , an independent feature like IN THE BEDROOM didn't pick up any Oscars but that didn't stop it being nominated for severalDONNIE DARKO is by no means terrible but it is overrated . Dare I say it's a case of the emperors new clothes ? That is people are somewhat embarrassed upon seeing this film and not understanding it that they feel they must praise it in order to spare their supposed ignorance . Let me ask you this - What genre of film is this ? Everyone will give a slightly different answer I'm sure and if an audience is undecided about the genre then how can they decide what the ending is about ? And there is a quite serious plot hole involved in the story . Donnie sees a demonic rabbit called Frank throughout the movie who tells him at exactly what moment the world will end . Wormholes , time warps etc may actually exist in scientific reality as may the ending but the central plot does not since the whole movie rests on Frank or Donnie being able to see into the future and no scientist will claim there's any scientific basis for fortune telling . So you see it's not really about time travel , it's about mysticism , predestination and other superstitious mumbo jumbo which Richard Kelly is using to fool the audience . In effect this movie is one big cheat and most people have failed to notice this Having said that Richard Kelly does deserve some credit for making a movie that's not about car chases and explosions , this is a movie dealing with teen angst and the dark side of middle American small town values but Kelly has missed an opportunity to make the most of the potential . I know the film was released before the war on terror so there'd be little need to see news broadcasts on the fall out of the original Gulf war but from a pop culture point of view wouldn't this have been better set in the early 1990s when grunge culture was the rage instead of 1988 ? I mean what music best suits this movie's atmosphere ? Echo And The Bunnymen or Nirvana ? In fact if it had have set in the presidential elections of early 1990s this would have coincidentally tied in with what's going on in the world today with Saddam and Iraq getting a mention ! And wouldn't this movie be held up in superstitious awe now ? As it stands it's nowhere as clever as it thinks it is for the reasons outlined . Perhaps Mr Kelly started out on with two movies , one a high concept science fiction thriller and the other a low concept drama about a mentally ill teenager and decided to merge the two with not too successful results . Watching DOnnie Darko this was the gut feeling I got</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whats all the shouting about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I doubt this is going to help anyone make up their mind about this film. To be honest this isn't really a review but more a commentary on a film that several friends have insisted is one of the great movies of all time. I've tried to come up with something to say about the film, other than its not very good, but have had trouble since I saw it in doing so. To that end I've decided to write about that, about not being able to find the words and why.I finally sat down to watch this film after several years of people grabbing me and insisting I see this film. Some wanted to share the dark "wondrous" experience others wanted me to take a crack at explaining the film to them. Some where along the way I picked up the directors cut and put it away until recently when I popped it and gave it ago.Its been a week or so since I've seen this film and I'm still wondering what it was I saw. To be certain its a unique vision of strangeness concerning the odd visions of a young man who is haunted by person in a twisted bunny suit urging him to do things in order to save the world. But outside of the strangeness I don't see this as the be all and end all or even the very good movie that some people seem to think the film is. For me this is way way way too long film thats weird for the sake of weird. For me its an angsty young kid trying to deal with change by creating a "fantasy world" of doom and gloom. What so different about that from real life? Forgive me I just don't care for the film. Its not that I don't get it, but the two plus hour march to the downbeat conclusion was almost too much for me to take. I kept wanting to scream at the film "get on with it" until I'd realize that I had the DVD controller next to me and I'd scan to the next scene.What is it about this film that draws people in? I can't say. Perhaps I'm the wrong audience for this film, having been raised on the films of David Lynch, Jodorowsky and Bunuel where strange is a way of life not a means of getting your film noticed. Even the ending, which has echoes of other films didn't strike me as anything special.Perhaps if I had stumbled upon this unaware I might have liked it, but mostly I'm left wondering if thats all there is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I have seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no doubt in my mind that the director of this film is an idiot.Absolute garbage: the whole film. Drew Barrymore's performance was nothing short of the worst thing I'd seen. I finished watching the film with horror. It was that awful.Let me be frank, I think it's totally the director's fault. The film's premise is interesting and the plot twists had the potential to be fun, but the entire endeavor was marred by an inherent lack of intelligence.The director, I have no doubt, saw Donnie Darko as a superheroic, Christ-like figure who was doomed to sacrifice himself for the good of humanity. The film attempts to use magical realism to make its point. Your thinking: Never Ending Story, Star Wars, Willow... If only. I didn't like those films much either, but at least they weren't trying as hard as Donnie Darko to be internally consistent. Donnie Darko is very American, very Christian, and entirely too self-righteous in its portrayal of "truth". What's worse, it's plot has holes large enough to pass elephants through, so the filmmakers don't even have a right to act that way. In a nutshell, the plot has NO LOGICAL CONSISTENCY. The characters are undeveloped and the acting is reminiscent of a high school play. Not to mention the whole premise of the movie centers around an acceptance of "time travel" that is entirely pedestrian. Yes, modern physics speaks about time travel. No, it looks NOTHING LIKE what is presented in Donnie Darko. I wouldn't care, but they are attempting to actually present it like they are saying something along those lines. Like a B-Movie Science Fiction Flick from the 50s, the movie throws scientific and deductive ideas around without actually having researched them or patiently thinking about the consequences. I don't in principle mind when people get things wrong, but this movie comes across as a self-righteous attempt to be right. When you're trying to be right and the stuff you include can immediately be identified as eyerollingly incorrect, that's when I begin to get stomach aches. Wolfgang Pauli summed up their premise well, "That's not right. That's not even wrong." Instead the filmmaker has spent research on figuring out what the smurfs were all about. Excuse me for rolling my eyes.The director could have gone with struggling with Darko's mental instability. No, instead he tries to paint a hero in a world that's full of idiots who can't save themselves.It's a painful movie to watch. On more than one occasion I simply wanted to throttle everyone involved in the production. If you want to be annoyed, then watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director's Cut: Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My comments here pertain only to the recently-released Director's Cut of this film. I am among those who found the original release to be an amazing film, one that was original, beautiful and thought-provoking. I am sorry to say that the new version falls well short of the original.Most of the deleted scenes that are available on the original DVD have been added into the new version. One of these-Donnie's last scene with his father-works very well, but others fall flat and are not well-integrated into the narrative. While these additions are minor missteps, the addition of a repeated close up of an eye with computer data scrolling by and superimposed on the image is a major error. The images add nothing except cheese and are an anachronistic design element for a movie set in 1988. The movie has nothing to do with computers; computers don't even appear as props, except possibly in the background of a scene in the school office. These images have no place in the film's visual grammar.Kelly has also added in shots of pages from the Philosophy of Time Travel, the book that guides Donnie through his journey. The audience is invited to read about 'the manipulated dead,' 'the living receiver' and the like. Presumably the intent in adding these was to explain more of the theory of the events of the film. Some things, though, are better left unexplained. Putting in the equivalent of Cliff Notes deprives the moviegoer of the joy of trying to figure out the movie. The Director's Cut also shuffles the movie's great 80's soundtrack. Most of the time, these changes are innocuous. *SPOILER ALERT*However, by removing Under the Milky Way from the scene where, on his last night on earth, Donnie descends the stairs with Gretchen after they have make love for the first and last time, Kelly has marred one of the most beautiful moments in the film. I maintain that the original version of this movie is one of the two or three best movies of the last five years. The Director's Cut, however, is proof that sometimes stuff is left on the cutting-room floor for good reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was instantly put off by the tired and worn clichés - the neurotic teacher, the nasty school bully, the fat Chinese chick who says "Shut up!", the sleazy mr. motivator, the "Mr &amp; Mrs Average" parents, the eccentric old lady - all done to death by countless teenage flicks. And then the time travel and the convoluted, confused plot - laughable that the director is trying to (mis)use Stephen Hawking's "Brief History of Time" to lend some scientific credibility to this sorry concoction. It feels as if the film can't decide if it has anything to say but insists on plodding on regardless - with a vengeance... Redeeming quality for me was perhaps the soundtrack and some of the special effects. I wish it hadn't been so widely hyped - I would have spared myself the time.I too am surprised at the many positive reviews but the most telling was one along the lines of "I don't usually like deep movies but this one is different" - made me laugh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko? Should have been called Donnie Dumbo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie on the strength of the ratings and glowing reviews at this site. "Brilliant", they said. "Dark and beautiful", they wrote. 8.4 stars. Well, all I can say is, these people must have been on some serious drugs when saw this totally inane movie. The cinematography has the look of a student film. The plot (and I use the term for lack of a better word) is disjointed and meandering, not really sure where it wants to go, and that leaves the viewer not really caring. The ending, I suppose, is meant to be a twist, but ends up making little sense and falling flat. Donnie Darko, by the way, is actually his real name (ie, the Darko family), not an intriguing nickname. I give this movie 1 black hole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" is the end result of 47 Weekly World News headlines strewn together in random order. Over one hour and 45 minutes, it rams together time travel, a 6-foot imaginary rabbit, a Tony Robbins-esque motivational speaker with a secret (Patrick Swayze?!?), hypnotism, an elementary school dance troupe and a stray jet engine.What does it all mean? Not much. Ham-fisted, nail-on-the-head symbolism practically smashes you in the face. A creepy fat girl dressed as an angel. A statue with a dog's head and a human body. An old woman nicknamed "Grandma Death" who keeps checking her mailbox. An eye wound. The creepy fat girl's earmuffs. Heck, one of the ending shots is an M.C. Escher drawing. The filmmakers would also like you to marvel at their camera techniques. Look, it's tilted! Now it's going fast. Now, slow. Wait, now it's turning upside down! Aren't we creative?And be sure to spot the zillion story lines, characters and scenes ripped from other (read: better) films. The courageous English teacher ("Dead Poets Society"). The watery tentacles ("The Abyss"). An imaginary rabbit ("Harvey"). The lead character, wearing a gray, hooded sweatshirt, and his Halloween-costumed friends riding bikes ("E.T."). Meditation on the sex lives of cartoon characters ("Mallrats").So basically, you're left with a sullen Jake Gyllenhaal moping his way through someone's bad LSD-trip. By the end, you're supposed to have some great understanding of your place in the universe. But you're more likely to have a great understanding of why overwrought student films are a dime a dozen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A waste of time, film and effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I do not recommend this film, neither do I recommend reading this review without first seeing the movie. Though I have not given away the ending, or most of the plot twists, this movie would be best viewed without any prior information. It's hard to pinpoint the chief problem with the film Donnie Darko, as there are many to deal with. Richard Kelly, in his first feature film, seems to have collected enough scenes of adolescent rage, late-night stoner diatribes, self-righteous justifications and inoffensive, banal philosophy to inspire twenty teen-angst dramas; then mashed them into a single two hour package with a sci-fi twist. The result is deeply distressing-- for all the wrong reasons. The film attempts to lead the audience down convoluted paths without any sense of symbolism or meaning, to make them sympathize with one-dimensional characters, and above all hopes that they will ignore the underdeveloped plot, full of unreconciled loose ends, by hiding it under a veneer of CGI effects and neo-surrealism. The main character, Donnie Darko, is a young man, committed to therapy, misunderstood by his friends, and rendered hostile and disaffected by his suburban life. We are meant to feel that he is more intelligent than his schoolmates, although sometimes that is a difficult assumption to make. For example, when one of his friends comes up with an absurd theory about the Smurfs, and Donnie counters with a theory of his own, his friend complains about Donnie acting "all smart." Donnie's speech, however, is no smarter than that of his friend-- just angrier. The only clear evidence of his intelligence is his principal's description of his standardized test scores as `intimidating;' but given the director's slant against simple categorization of human elements (as shown in the FEAR-LOVE sequence), this is a poor substitute for character development. Donnie takes prescribed drugs to combat mental problems, which are not addressed directly in this film. In fact, the entire issue of the drugs is understated, and one of the first chances the director has to redeem the film is lost. The ambiguity of Donnie's strange destiny, the possibility that all of this may be a product of his imagination, is pushed into the background, making the film 100 percent science fiction. This would not be a bad thing in itself, except that the "science" behind the "fiction" is very shaky. The explanations of time travel are weak, at best sounding like detached, uninformed rambling. We get the idea that the film's writer once read a book about time travel or a few chapters, and can't quite remember how it worked, but was sure that it was really interesting and wanted to work it into the film. The scientific portion, as a result, depends more heavily on expensive computer animations than actual development of the theories involved (at one point, a teacher discussing time travel states that if he continues to speak on the subject, he'd be fired. Apparently no further explanation is needed). Donnie's dealings with a visitor from the future lead him to commit several vicious actions. The justification for these actions is a tricky business. He damages his school, but it's okay, because his school doesn't treat him like a person. His punishment of a creepy self-esteem advocate (somewhat similar to Tom Cruise's character in Magnolia) results in the man's public humiliation. But should the audience believe that Donnie is some sort of avenging angel, striking out against ignorance and debauchery? He himself seems ignorant of the effects of these actions until after the fact. Aside from these flaws, the film is riddled with flat, uninteresting generalizations of humanity. The story is set in 1988, just before the Bush/Dukakis election, and the director touches on this point during the film. The focus, however, extends exactly this far: Donnie's gruff, blue collar father is voting for Bush, while his free-spirited, rebellious daughter plans to vote for Dukakis. There is nothing even remotely resembling a political statement here; simply a statement of the obvious. The former are not necessary to make a good film, but the latter should be left out. Likewise, Donnie's heartfelt speech about not being able to lump all human emotions into the bland categories of "fear and "love;" this doesn't ask the audience to make any great leaps of understanding. Everybody knows that there are more that two human emotions, and particular emphasis on this fact is worthless. Mr. Kelly gives homage to several symbols of 80's pop culture in his film: E.T., Stephen King, the Smurfs, Back to the Future. At it's heart, this film feels like the director's homage to himself, a collection of his own experiences, interests, personal heroes and adversaries, affirmations and disenchantments, roughly stitched together by untrained hands. Entire songs are played in music video format to the characters actions, seemingly because the director likes the songs. Characters who have little to no bearing on the plot (including the archetypal bully, fat girl, and right-wing idiot teacher) are given unnecessary focus, because the director really wanted to pack them in somehow. The awkward mess that is Donnie Darko leaves us wondering if Mr. Kelly has enough ideas left in his head to make another film, or if he has wasted all his creativity in one pointless, cluttered, meandering effort.My rating: 1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky film that's wide open to interpretation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon awakening, Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) finds that he's been asleep in the middle of a secluded mountain road. It seems that Donnie regularly wanders out at night and sleeps in strange places. The night that he ends up on the neighborhood golf course, a stray jet engine crashes through Donnie's bedroom. He's saved by his odd behavior. Shortly after, we witness him hearing voices and having visions of an odd, evil-looking, bipedal, man-sized bunny. The voice begins giving him unusual suggestions, and Donnie slowly finds himself as the key player in a grand scheme.Donnie Darko is an unusual film. It spans a number of genres and leaves itself wide open to interpretation. Quite a cult of hardcore fans has developed around it, and for those folks, the film is essentially immune to criticism and reinterpretation.The biggest surprise to me was that the bulk of Donnie Darko is a realist drama. I had long heard about how strange the film was, and heard it described as being partially sci-fi (which it is) and horror (which it isn't if you ask me). It was supposedly a "reality-bender". I'm much more of a "genre" fan, and I much prefer fantasy, surrealism and absurdism to realism. My preconceptions were throwing me off of the film initially. The realist drama stuff seemed to drag on, and it made much of the film a hard sell. I loved the touches of weirdness, but they were too little, too far between--at least until I reached my personal interpretation of the film around the halfway mark.The film is also odd in that it's so retro. At one point I double-checked the DVD box, thinking that Donnie Darko had to be a late 1980s film. Nope, 2001. Then I started thinking that writer/director Richard Kelly must have had the script in storage for 15 years. But that can't be the case, either, as his bio says he was born in 1975, and it's unlikely that he would have written Donnie Darko when he was 10 or 11. The film is mired in late 1980s pop-culture references, style and music. Realizing that Kelly was born in 1975 still makes this weird. He says on the new DVD commentary that he was following the clichéd advice to write what you know, and he knew school in the late 1980s. He wouldn't have even entered high school until 1989, so it seems odd that he would only know school in the late 1980s. The retro feel of the film was a bit artificial to me, although I enjoyed the way the pop music was integrated.There were also some questionable performances for my tastes, including Drew Barrymore's, and some bizarre (but not bizarre enough) scenarios that I never quite figured out, such as why a gym teacher was showing motivational videos to a class sitting in desks.But most fans of Donnie Darko tend to overlook the minutiae, even though it takes up most of the screen time. The hinge tends to be on the overall arc and the meaning of the film. If minutiae are dwelt on, it's usually concerning the "Philosophy of Time Travel" book, or some bit of dialogue that is thought to be clever, such as the Smurf discussion. The theme of the film is often said to be something like "possibilities", and the film is routinely interpreted as having a messianic subtext, as well as often being interpreted more literally, as a kind of sci-fi story. After I watched the film and it didn't quite pay off as I had been hoping, I was anxious to listen to the commentary and watch the documentaries. Kelly seemed to intend more of the literal, sci-fi interpretation of the film. That was disappointing, because interpreted that way, the most fascinating thing to me is that Kelly believes it even approaches coherency. The Philosophy of Time Travel material, which is a core of this interpretation, is arbitrary sounding gobbledy gook. It has nothing to do with time travel, and even less to do with philosophy. It's more a na?ve attempt at something like a parallel universe, ala the multiverse interpretation of quantum mechanics (which tends to be nonsensical anyway).To make matters worse, there is little attempt to integrate most of this material into the actual meat of the film--the sci-fi interpretation seems very "grafted on". Many of the actual scenes we witness aren't there to service the eventual interpretation of the film as a sci-fi story, but are there because it's some snippet of actual life that Kelly remembers or has thought about or had conversations similar to in the past, and he thinks it's clever or character developing. For me, this material was neither.But my personal interpretation of the film made much more sense to me, and under it, I enjoyed it more. To me, Donnie Darko is just a depiction of a kid with schizophrenia (and this is even explicitly suggested, although Kelly seems to be overlooking or not mentioning the interpretation). Even the smallest details of the film make sense in this context. Schizophrenics hear voices. They can have visual, tactile and other sensory hallucinations. Some have delusions of grandeur, such as messiah/superhero complexes. They often feel alienated. Donnie mopes around, mumbling, fairly expressionless much of the time and has periodic emotional outbursts. He acts out in anti-social ways. He goes into semi-catatonic states. Even the end of the film makes more sense under this interpretation, as it can be seen as an intentional delusion that Donnie has created due to the relationship-oriented tragedy. He's fantasizing about things being different than they turned out. To me, the film has much more depth under this interpretation.If you haven't seen Donnie Darko yet, you owe it to yourself to check it out. No matter your final verdict, it's an interesting, quirky film, and one that's sure to be talked about for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm writing the 1889th comment on Donnie Darko here. When it hits 1988th comment, the world will come to an end; as Frank told me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The dreams which I'm dying are the best I've ever had..." Most of the authorities reviewed Donnie Darko as a psychological thriller. Though, the look of this angle straitens the true understanding of this epic movie. Donnie Darko is a sci-fi classic and is mainly a superhero movie. "If only I could go back in time and take all those hours of pain and darkness; and replace them with something better..." was Gretchen's wish. Donald died in his dream to prevent Gretchen getting killed in the real life. Although he believes that the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind is antiseptics(!), Donald had a vision. He gave whatever Gretchen wanted from life; and when she got all of her desired, the destiny was rewritten putting effect the fact that she has actually never met with Donald. Gretchen had been killed accidentally by Frank. In order to make Donald save Gretchen's life; a restless supernatural spirit,that wore Frank's Halloween night dress, sacrificed Donald and saved Frank's life.Donnie Darko brought out who rule the destiny of the world. The answer is neither God or humankind. It is angels(and/or daemons) that forms the fate and represents the balance of the nature. It is also clarified that only angels(and/or daemons) can travel in time.Jake Gyllenhaal performed Donald(Donnie Darko) and totally took on the tough responsibility of playing a schizophrenic superhero. Maggie Gyllenhaal, his sister both in the movie and in the real life, looked as the cutest of all her performances ever. Jena Malone was surely the right choice to perform as Gretchen, although she didn't give any extra effort to catch viewers' attention. Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze couldn't hold onto the blood-freezing atmosphere of the film. Best of all, Richard Kelly has done a great work of cinema. His style of holding the tension at the highest, and hiding clues of the storyboard all over the script were extra-ordinary. Cinematography was so brilliant and unique. Donnie Darko totally deserves to be one of the best sci-fi movies of all time for every aspect.Editing and theatrical cut was also a good job. There were deleted scenes that I got the chance to view from the DVD, just good to know. The film has been edited in a smooth and clever style. I got people all the time telling that Donnie Darko is a schizophrenic film, which is not fair. That would straiten the wide implications we can get. Those implications may include not just scientific thesis of quantum mechanics but also very important social criticisms. It is a mad world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSThe people who are twisting themselves in knots trying to analyse the 'philosophy' of this movie belong in the same group as those who try to divine the meaning behind the Matrix films. Read some actual philosophy, for Christ's sake, or watch classic Art movies which engage with ideas in a coherant manner, instead of getting excited soley because a movie was made recently, marketed to your age group, and is associated with a hit single. The reality is that this is the best recent example of a pop-cultural product which is popular ONLY because it's pitched as arty and difficult to understand. There's nothing to understand. None of the sub-plots (the infomercial guy, the *beep* about Grahame Greene, or wormholes, or the other stuff about censorship) have anything to do with the central plot about Frank, Donnie and his girlfriend. They are included to create the illusion that this movie has a message, when there is really nothing there. All of the anti-censorship arguments have been made far more effectively before, in movies dedicated to that theme; none of the other stuff links together or goes anywhere. The plot twists in the sub-plots are all tediously obvious, as are the character's attitudes to them (like Donnie immediately seeing that Jim Cunningham is the antichrist - and look, he's found to be a pederast! Or the whole thing about Drew Barrymore's character being a saint crushed by a repressive system, or the street thug dudes, who walk into the film, gurn a bit, threaten Don with a knife, then walk out again until they're needed later). The plot twists in the main plot all come totally out of the blue by using the supernatural cop-out clause as permission for the story to go in any direction it likes. When movies like Godsend do that, everyone rightly points out how stupid it is. But then, Godsend isn't regarded as Art.Idiots. The worst part is the way this film wastes it's one original idea - the concept of a disturbed teenager who can see a 6' apocalyptic bunny rabbit. Wouldn't it have been great if Frank had been kept mysterious, or turned out to be some kind of demon with a direct, properly explained role in the plot? No, he takes his bunny head off halfway through, and is shown to be merely a guy in a suit who drives a car over someone at a key moment.You need to watch more movies, people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this flick because a couple different reviews and reviewers pointed me in that direction. I'm not a critic, I don't waste a lot of time disecting the bad, I prefer to spend time praising the good.So I'll be brief.This movie will probably appeal to the same segment who thought Blair Witch was original and good. And like Blair Witch this movie is neither. If you've opened a sci-fi book in the last fifty years, the concepts touched on are less than revolutionary, and even the mixing of disparite genres handled far better elsewhere, one movie that comes to mind is SIGNS. Or even the films of David Fincher, this idea of pieces coming together, of everything having meaning is a capable idea, in the hands of acapable script and director.An idea that kept running through my head, triggered by certain scenes in the film, is how derivitive DONNIE DARKO is of better movies. Sometimes an ambiguous story isn't the mark of a brilliant director, and a witty script, sometimes it's just uneven filmmaking. It's just an inability to put on the stage, the ideas on the page. Many reviewers have said, well get the DVD, because the notes from the book really explain it, and I have to chuckle softly, because I realize that perhaps a movie that requires crib notes... isn't really that cohesive of a movie.People are quick to slam hollywood movies, and praise indie movies, often simply because they are labeled "indie" movie.Some hollywood movies are bad, some are brillant. Some Indie movies are brilliant, and some are... empty. DD is an empty movie. People argue about Tangent Universes, and Premonitional Dreams, and ultimately if a movie lacks heart, if you don't care about the characters, who cares what happens to them? Whether their world ends? And ultimately that's the failing of Donnie Darko, Drew Barrymore mentions apathy, and that descibes the failings of this flick as well as any.You don't learn to care for the characters, so why worry about their world coming to the end? While the director shows capabiity moving the camera, the glaring/cynical looks of the lead [his distuberd/homicidal look maybe?] after the fourth or fifth glare left me hoping 10 or 12 jets fell on his head.Condemn Hollywood movies if you choose, but like most prejudice, you condemn the good with the bad, because Hollywood at its best, its LAWRENCE OF ARABIAs, its LION IN WINTERS, its UNTOUCHABLES, its BRAVEHEARTS gives us works that speak to the heart, and I will take that any day over this new self-indulgent indie cinema that speaks only to the hubris[That said there are directors doing great things in the Indie Field, THE SWEET HEREAFTER popping immediately to mind, a movie that has all the heartrending emotional energy and interest, that this film lacks].Donnie Darko like Blair Witch is an exercise, a preamble to a film, that would make a decent short flick on the Indie Film circuit, but blown up to feature length, the cracks shown... and the holes become... apparent.** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating but ultimately frustrating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Putting together a jigsaw puzzle can be fun. And make no mistake, Donnie Darko is a puzzle of a film which asks the viewer to put the pieces together. But in the end there is frustration as you realize you were never going to be able to put it all together. There are pieces missing. So while the film, which is certainly captivating and thought-provoking, is often fascinating it ultimately is setting you up for a bit of disappointment. It's nice to have a film which makes you think, which makes you work to understand it. It's also fine to have a film which is open to interpretation. But if in the end you don't have all the information necessary to make a reasonable interpretation that is a problem. And that is the case here. What just happened here? Hard to say. The untidy ending doesn't completely ruin the film, this is still a film well worth seeing. But there's no denying that the ending is a bit of a letdown.So who is Donnie Darko? He's a high school kid, a really smart guy. But he's got issues. Paranoid schizophrenia maybe, at least that's what his therapist thinks. He suffers from hallucinations, he sees things. And right now he's seeing a giant bunny rabbit named Frank. One night a jet engine crashes into Donnie's bedroom. But Donnie's not there because Frank has summoned him to a golf course where he tells Donnie that the world is going to end in 28 days. What is Donnie meant to do with this information? Is this schizophrenic teen supposed to somehow save the world? Oh by the way, that jet engine? The one that would have killed Donnie had a giant bunny rabbit not summoned him to a golf course in the middle of the night? Nobody knows where that engine came from. No airplane lost an engine. Well that's weird. Things are only going to get weirder but then again you probably already guessed that since the plot revolves around a giant bunny rabbit.So the clock ticks down toward the bunny-prophesied doomsday. Among other events Donnie gets himself a girlfriend, rebels against life lessons taught by a ludicrous self-help guru and discusses time travel with one of his teachers. Time travel? Is that what this film is actually about? Who knows. The film never comes close to fully explaining itself. But the film certainly holds your attention. You can't help but be intrigued. You expect that all the weirdness will ultimately pay itself off with some sort of brilliant finish. Sadly that is not the case. The ending, while admittedly powerful, only adds to the confusion. There is a director's cut which makes things a little clearer but in the original version you're left to figure everything out for yourself. And you don't have near enough information to be able to do that. Donnie Darko is a very compelling film. And it is performed wonderfully. Jake Gyllenhaal hits all the right notes in his portrayal of Donnie, a character who is just as confused as we are. And the supporting cast is by and large excellent as well. Whether it be big stars like Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze, or lesser-known performers who you've never heard of, everyone fits their role very well, contributing their solid piece to the puzzle. But that puzzle never does fully come together. And that ultimately makes Donnie Darko a somewhat frustrating film. There's so much good stuff here to recommend it. But there's also that little tinge of regret, a wish that perhaps the giant bunny rabbit could have told Donnie, and us, what the heck was going on.</fullReview>

I don't understand why this movie was even made- Poor use special effects in showing the rabbit- No script and story : I beg people to let me know what this movie was all about? I believe even the writer is clueless of what he wanted to portray- Terrible acting---------------------------- Final Verdict:This Plot isn't intelligent. Creating a movie nobody would ever understand (unless its explained in a book) is not hard to do. This film is the dullest, most over-rated rubbish I've watched!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing more than tricks... but, god, how they work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sweets. They are not nourishing, but they're delicious.This is how I feel about this film. If I make a conscious attempt at explaining why I like "Donnie Darko", I can see no real meat in it. I got no lessons from the flick, I hardly got a story... Forget what others say about this movie as "philosophical", "clever" or "trascendent". It's not. But, my!, how such a young director almost manages to make you believe it is... I don't know about you, but I call that talent.Yes, the movie is empty. The story goes nowhere, there is no message, no moral, but the way it's all wrapped up keeps you salivating throughout. Don't think it's mere flashy fireworks, though. This is not a case of style over substance. It's something more complex, and that's where "Donnie Darko" distances from the rest. This movie is freaking special, is full of personality. I wish more films had this character. The charm of this film relies on a lot of pieces that fit like a giant puzzle: -Chosen time (1988) is strangely proper (you'll have to see this movie to understand it, sorry).-The movie is BLUE. Its photography is blue, its characters are blue, its story is blue. Everything is blue.-Music is great.-Emotions are overwhelming. They come from everywhere and at the same time. You don't know what's happening, but what might be happening actually affects you.-I can see some Lynch influences. The scene where the gym teacher talks to Donnie's mother at the doorstep is 100% Lynch.-Some scenes are, almost, scary.-This is one of the movies that present the idea of "beyond" in a most seductive way. You feel there's something more than this world. It never gets explained, but heck, I don't care.-Finally, and most important, the main appeal of the movie is that it throws together unrelated concepts in such a way that they feel ghostly linked. The movie is a melting pot of vague ideas, that, thanks to a great direction, get connected in the subconscious.Exactly because of this, I understand this movie has so much appeal for some people, and so little for others. If you fall in the trap, it will touch you, and this movie could mean the world to you. If you don't, it won't, and you won't see more than a bag of tricks. Whatever the category you fall in, you have to recognize the skill of Richard Kelly. The execution of "Donnie Darko" is more than remarkable.I like to think of "Donnie Darko" not as a movie, but as a niche some people feel comfortably unsafe inside, that people being 25-30 year olds with an affection for sci-fi and darkness. The more you fit in this role, the more you'll get into this.RATING: 8.3</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the Darko side</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie instantly became one of my favorites.I think the director assumes that people will perceive his intentions and infer plot meanings more than they do. After the movie ends, it's clear that Donnie Darko is profoundly a tragic hero, but mining the movie for plot points doesn't clear up whether he is a martyr to a plot by Frank; and is Frank his alter-ego, an "angel", or an alien? It seems that Donnie knows he has to die, and though one might look for Donnie to survive in some fashion (after his immense sacrifice), we don't see any way he could survive. So we grieve for his sacrifice, in that he sacrifices himself with eyes open and out of love, with no hope for himself.For some time we don't know if what Donnie's led to do is right, or meant to injure people - is he a good guy or not? But as it becomes clear that his acts are in concert with synchronized that aids his path, we get off the fence and start rooting for him, whatever may come.I sympathized with Donnie's psychological "problems", having used my share of drugs and been in mental places, where anyone with such experiences knows how much there is to be known that a person can't easily communicate to "normal" people. So as soon as it becomes clear that Donnie is wrestling with his experiences, I identify with him. Then it becomes a cheer for whatever mayhem Donnie will perform next, eliciting maniacal chuckles when the little electronic-music theme signals that something nefarious is about to happen.What makes the movie is that process of seeing that Donnie really is a hero and then watching him pursue his course. I wish the movie had been fleshed out more - the editing leaves one to wonder whether the incident toward the end, where Donnie goes to see Grandma Death but is interrupted by the evil high school punks, is a betrayal of Donnie's desired path. We never see him discuss the Time Travel 'problem' with her - events appear to have precluded that important meeting and sealed Donnie's fate in some sense. His taking Gretchen with him at the end seals her fate and his, inasmuch as had he left her at the party, Frank could not have killed her - necessitating Donnie's death to remedy things. Or was he obliged to cooperate with the time line (things cannot be otherwise)? So the plot is somewhat incoherent. One naively wants the hero to triumph and survive, the question is how could he use his knowledge to achieve that end? So, is the story that of his betrayal by circumstance, or by an agent of some kind? Or is the story that of a hero waking to himself with events foreordained? This leaves the movie with no specific resolution.It's just a story, but the characters are so compelling that I want to resolve that - the true intentions. I'm here on a tangent looking for the book the movie was based on, to understand what the author intended.All the complaining I've seen in comments here about the movie means nothing as to whether the movie is a good movie. The movie could certainly be "repaired" or improved to clean up the plot - it leaves too many central questions unresolved, dissolving any closure one might expect from an epic. As an exploration of archetypal themes though, this film kicks ass - we are left grieving for the hero who makes the ultimate sacrifice to save the one he loves, and I mean grieving - the Mad World theme playing following Donnie's death in review of those people who knew Donnie hits the heartstrings hard; I can't think of many film scenes that cause me to cry for someone's loss in the way this one does. Donnie deserved better and the people around Donnie deserved Donnie, and that's so clear, and that's why it's so sad.Jake Gyllenhaal was great in this film. I certainly hope to see more of him in future films. Also, the music really makes the movie throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is about one basic premise: if you could go back in time you would try to go back and prevent bad things from happening. There is nothing more to it, and you could throw most of the film out and just come out and say it, it would take you less than one minute.In this story, somehow, there is time travel. But it is not like in a sci fi movie with futuristic machines or alien visitors and technology, but rather some extremely vague, clouded and ill defined reference to wormholes and speed of light travel, none of which anyone of the characters either witnesses or possesses.Sadly, the main premise of time travel is obscured behind the main character's schizophrenia, mental instability, medications, sleep walking and daylight hallucinations. We go through the whole film imagining that the character is mad, that everything is in his head.There is no twist, eg like Shutter Island, there is nothing that binds it all together. It is all hints and inferences, but there is no commitment to anything. The viewer can imagine what they like, fill in the gaps, give their own explanation. That is how vague and incomplete and non committal this movie is.I am not sure I have all the gaps filled in, but it does not matter because an 8 year old can make a film with lots of gaps and thousands of possible explanations. I had thought that the continuous lack of clarity would eventually lead to some super intelligent and twisted revelation worth waiting for, but sadly, no.Do not bother watching it, it's trash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mad World Of Donnie Darko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Donnie's SPOILERS* Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal, 'Brokeback Mountain') is a 16 year old boy with some mental problems who lives with his sisters Elizabeth (Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jake's real-life sister) and Samantha (Daveigh Chase, 'The Ring') and his parents, Eddie (Holmes Osborne) and Rose (Mary McDonnell) in Middlesex, Virginia, in 1988.The night of October 2, he narrowly avoids dying in a bizarre incident, in which a 747's engine falls right into his room.From then on, Donnie begins to see a mysterious bunny called Frank (James Duval) who tells him the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds, and some mysterious things begin to happen, things that involve also his family, the new girl in school Gretchen (Jena Malone), some teachers, like the uptight (and stupid) Kitty Farmer (Beth Grant), the intelligent Karen Pomeroy (Drew Barrymore) and the calm Kenneth Monitoff (Noah Wyle), and a way-too-cheery preacher, Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze).I won't say anything more, because this is a movie that has to be watched and internalized, a personal experience everyone should have.I whole heartedly recommend it.Donnie Darko: 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Wave Darko lives in a mad world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*Donnie Darko is a sullen, anti-social teenager. He's in therapy and on medication. He is plagued with visions of death, doomsday predictions and giant talking rabbits. Just like most kids from the 80's. As the New Wave soundtrack blasts in our ears, Darko tries to make sense of it all. Is he a paranoid schizophrenic? Is he a visionary? Will he build a Delorean and go back to the future? Is he just plain nuts?"Donnie Darko" is very interesting. I think you would have to be a child of the 80's, (which I am), to fully appreciate it. Was the director Donnie Darko back in his teenage years? Did he know a Donnie Darko? This story feels immensely personal. Was he a confused teenager too? It's got Tears for Fears on the soundtrack and "Evil Dead" showing in the movie theater. Time Travel is an important element of this flick. I felt like I had tripped through a wormhole back to private school with Darko."Donnie Darko" is, for the most part, a mystery. Why is Darko being sent all these orders from the Fuzzy Bunny man? Who is Scary Cottontail? What the heck does it all mean? Well, here are my thoughts:*SPOILER ON ENDING* *DO NOT READ ANY MORE IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE**LAST CHANCE TO STOP READING*Still with me? OK. Darko is a screwed up teenager. A bright teenager but screwed up. The smart ones know too much for their own good. They get sad pretty easily since they can't see the world as simply as others. "Fear or Love"? So throughout the flick, Darko sees a guy in a rabbit suit telling him to do violently anti-social things. So we start to write these visions off as delusions from a warped mind. But then the concept of time travel is introduced. Could the rabbit be from Darko's future? Is he trying to help him or hurt him? This is (obviously) the mystery to solve.Darko thinks he knows the exact time he is going to die. The rabbit told him so. Darko is either insane or knows a smart bunny. When Darko has a life or death choice to make, he chooses life. Not his life but everyone else's. When he makes his final choice and jumps through his wormhole, he lands back in his bedroom. He's seen smiling and laughing in his bed. This was the first sign of happiness (relief?) Darko had shown during the entire movie. Maybe Darko wasn't so dark after all. He did some bad bunny things but at the end of his road, he made the right decision.I can't recall a movie in which a song so perfectly conveyed the meaning of a scene. The song "Mad World" plays over the end of the movie. It explains it all. It's Darko's theme song:"And I find it kind of funny,I find it kind of sad,The dreams in which I'm dyingare the best I've ever had."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obscure and pretentious sci-fi semi-thriller; the box office was bad, but a loyal cult grossly overrates it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The satire is strained and self-satisfied. The scene where the title character berates his teacher for having too simplistic a philosophy sounds like adolescent score-settling.The plotting is dreary. Just when things are about to get exciting, the pace slackens and we have to wait several minutes for things to pick up again.The realistic touches are unbearable. The dinner table banter between brother and sister? The boorish friends' conversation about Smurfs? The dialogue for these scenes is listed on IMDb's "memorable quotes" page. Why? We have this half-formed idea that lame insults, or over-serious debates about pop culture refuse, are somehow "ironic." And that anything realistic is worth inserting into a movie.Yet, by the end of "Donnie Darko" I was somewhat won over. I enjoyed the complicated plot twists, some of the strange images and Michael Andrews's splendid electronic score. But the small cult that champions this film grossly overrates it.Jake Gyllenhaal plays a paranoid schizophrenic named Donnie Darko, who gets along badly with his family, with his teachers and with his classmates; but he does manage to find a sympathetic friend in Gretchen (Jena Malone), who agrees to date him; and he has a compassionate psychiatrist (Katharine Ross), who discovers hypnosis is the means to unlock hidden secrets. His other companion may not be a true ally. Donnie has a friend named Frank, who is either a large purple bunny, or man in a large purple bunny costume. Either way, Donnie is the only one who can see him.Richard Kelly, who wrote, directed and created a webpage to explain everything in a tantalizingly opaque way, seems to think he's being a lot deeper than he is. This is one of those movies that inspire obsessed fans to demand that you see the film many times over, study the obsessed fans' websites about the movie, become an expert on the movie?and only then are you allowed to say you don't like it. Except, in their circular reasoning, not liking it is a sign you haven't studied it enough.This is not "Hamlet." Much of the opacity of this movie is the result of sloppiness and pretentiousness. Take the engine that falls off the plane and destroys Donnie's room. Kelly seems to want to leave open the possibility that much of what's happening is all in Donnie's mind and that there is a rational explanation for everything. If so, why present us with an undeniably supernatural event? The plane literally comes out of nowhere.Does the above criticism reveal that I don't get it? Nothing about the movie inspires me to delve deeper into its mystery. I was somewhat entertained, but its cult can have it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting little gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an intriguing film with Jake Gyllenhaal playing the title role. Is Donnie Darko slowing going mad, is the weird giant rabbit a friend or an enemy, and is there something sinister going on? The story unravels and you get drawn into the strange world of Donnie Darko and his journey which reached an inevitable, melancholy but strangely satisfying conclusion.I won't say much about the plot, but you might need to have a second look to understand exactly what is happening. Only one thing needed to be said - if you ever want to watch this film, watch the original version, avoid the Director's cut version. The director's cut added unnecessary scenes and pointless graphics which, although perhaps the director thought might think help explain the movie better, is a big mistake. The original version is mysterious and all the better for it, and if you don't understand it completely, it matters not a jot. In fact it is silly to try to make sense of the science as some tried to do because it is hardly the point of the film, and in any case Hollywood simply can't do science well in most of its films. Just enjoy an intriguing journey through the mind of a disturbed (or may be not) teenager.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back to the Future...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is often described as a cult film. But what is it that makes a film 'cult'? Well, they usually have a hardcore fan following formed on the basis of the film having quotable dialogue, memorable characters and/or scenes, a low budget and a rather eccentric plot. Donnie Darko falls into all these categories with ease; especially the latter. It's one of those films that invite more than one viewing, maybe more than two. Or three. And if The Matrix left you asking "what?" and Fight Club left you asking "how?", then Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko will simply leave you asking "WTF!?" It's c-o-n-f-u-s-i-n-g and a little odd but ever since its 2001 release this sombre suburban tale has been striking countless chords amongst mid-to-late teens and sci-fi fans alike. Why? To be honest, there is no one answer. What I can tell you, though, is that Donnie Darko is black, bold and illusively cool; as fresh and provocative now as it was then. Pure independent cinema. So, what's it all about? I hear you ask (including those who've seen it). Well umm OK explaining to someone what Donnie Darko is actually about is about as easy as mastering a rubix-cube in less than 30 seconds, in the dark, underwater. Admittedly, it's a ridiculously perplex film but there's something just, well, brilliant about it. It's a melodrama-cum-sci-fi- cum-black comedy-cum-teen movie, with a truly mystifying plot that'll prompt all first time viewers to scratch their heads and question everything. And even though there are many who still don't really "get it" thus opting to label "it" as some strange form of sci-fi crap, there are many (myself included) who consider it to be one of modern-American cinema's most understated masterstrokes. OK, so, with that said, here it goes; Set in 1988, the film revolves around this grinning, groggy-eyed teen', Donald J. Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal). Not only does Donnie get into regular trouble at school, he's also prone to depression, schizophrenia, sleepwalking, waking up on golf courses, hearing voices and visualizing a giant bunny-rabbit called Frank. Donnie's one messed-up kid, then, and what-do-you-know- things get even worse when Frank tells him that the world's going to end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds. Oh, and there's also this book on time travel. And Gretchen. And Grandma Death. And there're these worm holes that kind of appear from people's chests. There's a tornado as well. And Patrick Swayze plays a pervert. Yep, Donnie's world, or parallel world, sure is a mad one but he tries his best to make sense of his ghostly visions; do they hold any value or truth? Is he a modern-day messiah? Or just plain bonkers? And why has a jet engine from an unidentified aircraft landed his room? The answers do become clear-ish as Donnie unravels the mystery surrounding, well, everything; discovering what he has to do to bring a halt to the madness and ease his pain. Happy ending? Sad ending? You decide. The real beauty of Richard Kelly's debut feature and perhaps one of the reasons as to why it's so popular is besides its unique blend of every genre imaginable, it's highly ambiguous; a compound prism of manifold meanings and interpretations. Some things just don't make sense and to be honest, its true quality will always be open to interpretation: you'll either love it, hate it, or hate it watch it again and love it. Me? I fall into the latter camp and would venture a guess and say I'm not alone. Which is probably why it performed so badly at the box- office, grossing more in the UK (?1.1m) than in the US ($728k). When Darko became available on DVD, though, word spread of its outlandish quality and it soon became a huge hit among sci- fi fans and teenagers. Why the latter? Again, I couldn't possibly say. It could be because it's rebellious in every sense of the word or because Jake Gyllenhaal is just so damn cool as the sinister protagonist. Or maybe even because the film itself expertly juggles high entertainment value- juvenile humour, endless intrigue, choking suspense- with a solemn tone as it chew on the themes of love and sacrifice, intolerance and depression, fate and redemption. Some of which, are subject-matters many teens know all too well. To cut a long review short, then, Donnie Darko is a pure and not-so- simple mind-boggler whose sheer weirdness does conceal its brilliance. In spite of its ever growing popularity, there are many who just won't take to it's off-the-wall temperament. Granted, it is a head- scratcher and if you're one of those who just can't bare to watch a film without having those precious answers handed to you on a silver platter, you best steer clear of this one. But, if you like your movies dark, doomy and challenging then may I suggest (if you haven't already done so) that you pick yourself up a copy just to see what all the fuss is about. But do not (and I repeat) do not expect to be spoon-fed the answers. Not all loose ends are tied-up for you and it's up to you, and you alone, to press rewind and tie them for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film, with a fervent cult following, but it shoots short of greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt there is an audience for Donnie Darko, which is perpetuated by the cult that it had gained following its release (and re-release as a director's cut, unseen by me). I also have no doubt that Richard Kelly, first-time writer/director of this film, is talented. But after seeing the film for the first time recently with its strengths I also found parts to become a little 'much' (pretentious may not be the right word to use, some would say it though), or at the least trying to be weirder (or surreal if you would put it that way) then it needed. The story is an unusual one, as is its central character played by Jake Ghyllenhaal, however Kelly tries to cover too much ground in one sitting of less than two hours, and also loses much of his conviction in the little coherence of the story by the last ten minutes (especially the last five, although it is not elusive or misunderstood by me, that's not what I had a problem with). There is also something off about how Kelly injects his dream-like projections in the film, which I'll get to in a moment.First off, I would like to point out what I did find commendable in the film. Kelly is a very good director of actors, and out of Ghyllenhaal he does get a truly tortured soul to emerge through. Although one might find a similarly troubled character in a film like The Good Girl, he does make Darko his own. There are also good performances from Jena Malone as a sort-of love interest of Donnie's, and even by Patrick Swayze in a surprising and funny role as a motivational speaker. Also, Kelly knows how to set up certain scenes and let them work well in his 1988 setting (the introduction to Donnie's school was one, where there was an interesting collage of images against a cool 80's new-wave song), and creates some dark comedy in Donnie's rebellious nature at times (especially against the forces of authority). And in the first third/quarter of the film, Kelly sets up a story that attempts to dig into a kind of adolescent mood that follows many outsiders in high school movies.Where I did find that the film went into territory that is questionable is how Donnie's strange phenomena is explained, or not explained. The elements of time travel, paranoid-schizophrenia, the controlling power of hallucinations, the end of the world, etc, are all jumbled up at times and Kelly doesn't seem to know where to go except to make things seem 'cool', perhaps, in a dark way (maybe like a high schooler Fight Club). A problem I had though is that, unlike a controlled and smart surrealist director like Bunuel or Lynch, Kelly doesn't take the visions and ideas anywhere except to a muddled point. There are so many ideas about topics and behavior that one almost loses sight of what the story is working to, which I won't reveal but is a little too obvious.In a way, the end result reminds me of seeing a student film at a university- you appreciate and get entertained by scenes and lines and such, but you see more talent that will later emerge than actually present. In short, like with 2004's Garden State (also directed by a first-timer Zack Braff), the hype doesn't entirely suffice, at least for me. Maybe it might serve more on a repeat viewing, or of the director's cut (which are really just the deleted scenes on the theatrical DVD incorporated in redux style). For now, I give it a B grade, however I would recommend it for most high school kids looking for a 'head-trip' who are still vulnerable to masterpieces like Eraserhead and Un Chien Andalou.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are you ready for something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT? Donnie Darko.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of these movies that not just bend but brake virtually every rule of cinematic storytelling in a way so unique, mind-boggling and satisfying at the same time, no else can follow. Do not expect to see another movie "inspired by" or "of the same sort" as Donnie Darko. It is one of a kind and that makes it even more special. Richard Kelly set an impossible standard for himself with his very first feature, it will be extremely difficult to top this one, if ever.The story is, well, simply inexplicable! This is the selling point of the movie. It blends a number of diverse elements, 80's nostalgia, teen angst, depression, insanity, death, romance, sacrifice, comedy, tragedy... and a little bit of time traveling by the way. And did I forget to mention the giant rabbit? How could all these combine into a meaningful and coherent whole? As it turns out, under the commanding hand of the writer/director, the result is far from coherent, but flooding - literally - with meaning in all kinds of levels. The finished product is like looking at a painting. It isn't the original intend of the artist or the distinct parts of it that are the most important, but the emotional impact it causes on the viewer. There is a point about two thirds into the movie, were emotion just takes hold and doesn't let go until its incredible, chilling finale that has and will continue to fuel endless discussions. Is it easy to understand? Certainly not, at least with the usual sense of the word. Is it easy to feel? Definitely! And this is one of the reasons why DD has become such a cult phenomenon. Think of it as David Lynch but on one of his very good, lucid days.In terms of execution, the movie shines in many ways and is not hampered or handicapped by its small budget. Performances are great from both lead and supporting actors. Patrick Swayze gives his best in years and Mary McDonnell is simply devastating. But the real star here is Jake Gyllenhaal, who totally owns the film, conveying emotion and maturity with exceptional confidence. The screen couple of him and Jena Malone also has great chemistry and makes you deeply root for the characters and their dark fates. There is also a wonderful soundtrack, complete with vintage 80's tracks and a haunting score by Michael Andrews. The closing sequence with Gary Jules' "Mad World" playing easily qualifies as one of the most memorable pairings of music and film.One certainly needs to see this movie at least three times to start making up his mind about what actually happened. But this is beside the point. Some things are better left unexplained. Donnie Darko is above all else an experience, one that provokes the mind and the heart, an existential fairy tale and an unforgettable journey in the dark alleys of the human soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its really hard to say something else about this movie except that its just amazing.I watched it recently and just don't know what to say.It affected me so much that i can watch it over again and again and it just won't get boring or something like that.The whole idea of the movie is so philosophic and distracted from the real world and in the same time so easy to see, so easy to feel.The moment when he finally understands what he needs to do its so highly romantic and tragic(I even cried at that moment and I'm not afraid to say it), but after all its a kind of beating your own instinct for survival.But i don't know a person who,in case he had everything friends,family and love would let them fade away.The meaning of the life is in having people you love and care about and you are sure they are OK. Because at the end if your really close person has died or got hurt and only you have the chance to make it all right,would you let this chance go away....?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not one for top 10 polls, or top fifty or what have you, point in case, such things are too subjective and stir up useless debate. However, if I was making my own top 10 poll, this movie would certainly sit comfortably on it as far as the best of the decade. Storytelling this dense and compelling transcends intellectual engrossment. This movie runs in the vein of films like 'The Fountain' and even shows shades of renaissance noir as in 'Memento'. Jake Gyllenhal rips this film apart as he ebbs and flows from fits of hostility to drowning in pure delusion. His performance in Darko flies under the radar as one of the best in recent memory. This is a film that deserves several repeat views, and is deserving of equal amounts of debate and analysis. It is also demanding to the nth degree, it will leave you spent as the credits begin to roll but also dreaming. If this film doesn't haunt you, I'm not sure what will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>paraphrase on the gospel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is widely misunderstood. Most critics fail to see, that this is not a David Lynch wannabe in a spooky-comming-of-age-in-the-80's-flick. This is a modern fairytale about the passion of Christ. Notice that this boy is tormented by the anxiety of loneliness in the face of death (the prophecy from the rabbit, that the end of the world is near). The meaning of the narrative as well as spiritually first appears for us and the troubled young man as choice of sacrificing for love takes the gloom out of life and the movie. The turning point of the movie is placed when the young lovers a attending a screening of Raimi's "Evil Dead". In the theater the tormented youngster decides to follow the rabbit (down the hole) and burn the fake evangelists house down eventually disclosing the hollow moralists lies and diabolical misleading of the school kids (remember the scene where the young man calls the moral-preacher "the Antichrist" in front of the school). As he leaves the movie-theater to follow the advice of the rabbit, the young man passes under the billboards, where the two main features of the cinema are announced: The last temptation of Christ - the evil dead. When these two movies are placed together, they point towards the message of the movie - when you are tempted to think, that dying is always meaningless even for the ones you love, you are a victim of the anxiety, that even tried to get a hold of Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane. But as the young man gives life back to the girl he loves, by paying with his own (placing himself in the room, where the jet-engine crashes) - he dies with a smile, he sacrifices himself - in the spirit of Christ - hence giving meaning to a cold and superficial world of shallow psychiatry and cheap morality. Watch it again - and this time let the fairytale of the oldest truth outshine the appearance of the surreal. This is not Lynch - it's Pecinpah drunk on joy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the Mad World was smoothly embedded at the end of the movie, I was totally moved. And The Butterfly Effect quickly rushed through my head. Both of them got a protagonist who had the so called mental problem and they did things like traveling through the time and finally chose a sacrificed way to achieve the universal happy-ending (of course except him), full of mysterious things, and remanded you the life is full of possibilities.This kind of films is trying to deliver a supernatural story in a logical way, so they ended with a yanking to the stark reality, but the stark reality which should be extremely sad became a happy-ending because the whole movie told us there were ways worse than that. And this mad world still full of possibilities.There are a lot of intellectual conversations in this film: God, the belief of god, time traveling, English literature, love, fear, and life. I love this movie, mostly for its mind-stimulating story-telling and incidentally for the song Mad World.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IMDB Ratings Madness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this website, but some people's rating of films leaves much to be desired. So let's see: out of many tens of thousands of raters, this rather lame flick scored a 10 on a scale of 10? Please. What nonsense. It only calls into question the overall quality of the IMDB scoring. There are way too many people who have no idea how to rate on a 10 scale. I'm just a regular guy who loves movies. This decade I have watched and rated 500 movies, all released since 01/01/2000. Of all these films, I have rated 1 film a perfect score of 10. A ten is a classic film of the highest caliber. To suggest that this Donnie Darko is a 10 is utter nonsense.For the record, I gave this film a 5 rating. A 5 rating means the film has as much wrong with it as it does right with it. It is an interesting watchable movie with serious shortcomings.As for you thousands of people who gave it a 10, I'd love to hear how you rationalize that score. No, actually I don't want to hear. Why don't you take a minute to think about what a 10 rating means, before ever using it again.Cheers...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie when it came out years ago and thought it was awful, I remember falling asleep during it. But the clerk at my local video store went on and on the other day about how great it was so I decided to watch it again, chocking up my previous negative encounter with the movie to me being too tired or in the wrong mood to enjoy it.So I sat down to watch this movie thinking it deserved a second chance. After all, this movie really has a host of actors I think are great, the Gyllenhaals, Drew Barrymore, Noah Wylie, the late, great Patrick Swayze, Mary McDonnell, even Seth Rogen, although his part is minuscule.Well, I'm sorry to say, this movie wasn't any better the second time around. In fact this movie stunk, but I wouldn't say it was the actors fault. In fact all of the actors did a very fine job. No, this movie is bad because of the writing. For the life of me, I don't know what was the point of this movie. Was it teenage angst? The dangers of medicating our teenagers? I'm sure there is some symbolism involved, maybe the creepy rabbit is some modern dark version of Jimmy Stewart's "Harvey"? The best think I could say about this movie is that its creepy and I can dig that. If it goes somewhere, like in David Finchers, Seven and The Game or even Jacob's Ladder (which I think is a horrible movie with a great ending)No, this movie keeps you disoriented almost from the first frame to the last one. I'd love to try an explain it to you, but I need someone to explain it to me first. I didn't tell the video clerk that I thought it was bad. Why bother? He loved it. It just goes to prove that people like different things.Some people like lutefisk too, but NOT ME.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lot of buzz about this one; people either seemed to think it was the coolest thing around or an example of overcleverness.There's a fine line between clever and stupid, as the saying goes, and Donnie Darko doesn't cross that line - it stays firmly on the side of stupid. Oh, it &lt;i&gt;thinks&lt;/i&gt; it's clever, but it outsmarts itself, dissolving instead into a puddle of drivel.Basic story is that Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a high schooler with some awesomely awful visions; he keeps seeing an evil mutant bunny rabbit who tells him to commit acts of violence and that the world's ending in 28 days. You know, your garden variety doom-and-gloom stuff. Donnie doesn't know how to deal with these horrendous visions, so his family sends him to a psychiatrist.in a very early scene, one of Donnie's acting-out episodes (or is it sleepwalking) finds him outside the house in the middle of the night. Suddenly, a plane engine crashes into his house, landing in his bedroom. No one's hurt, but it's the first of several weird tragedies to befall him and his family. Donnie thinks it's a sign.Maggie Gyllenhaal (who, as you might surmise from her name, is Jake's sister in real life) plays his older sister here, and she's fantastic in the few scenes she's in. Mary McDonnell plays their mom. Some guy and some girl play the father and the younger sister, respectively; neither made an impression on me. Jena Malone plays Donnie's new girlfriend. Drew Barrymore has a thankfully small role as a teacher. Even Patrick Swayze shows up.Time travel, philosophy, nihilism, evil clowns, evil bunny rabbits, and funky coincidences all play roles. Absurdity upon absurdity is heaped onto the steaming pile of plot with the apparent intent to confuse and obfuscate. Weirdness does not cleverness equal, sadly. J. Gyllenhaal is miscast; he looks too pure and innocent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Darko is one of those occasional movies confused for being brilliant. After two viewings, I took a guilty pleasure in this film that I regarded as a cute, specific and unique homage to the 80's and movies themselves. But it was only after watching the DVD version with the Director's Commentary that the truth was revealed. Mr. Kelly's visual acuity outweighs his story-telling ability because the story he claims to be telling is not the one I saw nor one I would ever want to see. So heed my warning, approach this film with an open-mindedness and revel in its great soundtrack, clever plot, and well-turned performances and do not tarnish your experience by trying to connect Mr. Kelly's wayward attempt at telling his story of some sort of Super Hero. In this case, your interpretation of the film will prove infinitely superior to his.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko may be the cultiest film to emerge this side of the millennium. It did disastrously at the box-office, leaving many people unsure how to take its far out ideas and blinding layers of surrealism. But that hasn't prevented it from becoming a highly regarded cult classic. Many people enjoy deconstructing its messages and possibilities, and it became so popular that just three years later a Director's Cut was released. It's that resonant with people.DD is a difficult film to write a review about. I'm uncertain how to put it into words because I don't want to get this wrong. It's a film that changes my perceptions with every viewing. When I first saw it, I quite enjoyed its wealth of ideas. But on subsequent viewings, it didn't seem as satisfying and makes less sense the more times its watched. But that doesn't change the fact it has a rich and varied screenplay. I didn't always know what DD was, but it never ceased to amaze me.DD is the type of film David Lynch might have dreamt up. There does seem something Lynchian to its storytelling. Eccentric smalltown folk. A layer of bizarreness that hovers around the narrative and eventually punctuates it. And most importantly, the sly dissection of smalltown America.Jake Gyllenhaal is Donnie Darko, and in an opening that mirrors the beginning of Lynch's Blue Velvet, Donnie is found waking up in the middle of a country road. His bike is off to the side. He smirks and moves off back into town.DD is set in the October of 1988. Donnie is an outspoken young man with deep emotional problems. His psychiatrist Dr Thurman (Katharine Ross) is making little headway with him. And he has the disturbing habit of avoiding taking his medication.One night, Donnie dreams about a giant rabbit called Frank. When Donnie dreams, he sleepwalks. He goes outside. Frank is waiting, and informs him the world will end in a month. Just as Donnie learns this, an engine turbine from a passing plane crashes through his bedroom. This one bizarre accident sets off a chain reaction of increasingly odd events. All the while the countdown to the end of the world continues.DD is one of the most unusual films I've seen in a long time. It's not always clear what director Richard Kelly is trying to say with his debut feature, but his direction is engaging enough to keep you involved throughout this bizarre but often quite fascinating film.If the film's intentions are not always clear, the fine cast helps to breathe life into it. Why Jake Gyllenhaal ever agreed to sign onto to such an unusual film is frankly a mystery but his performance really can't be faulted. Gyllenhaal is certainly an actor with a future, but I think he works best when he's served by a strong screenplay. I still have yet to decide if DD's script is as profound as it's made out to be, but there must have been something that attracted Gyllenhaal to it. And he makes the most of his screen time.Donnie's unravelling mental state is very ably communicated by Gyllenhaal. His insolent attitude is quite startling on occasion. And the role of DD is certainly unusual. I mean the very idea of a boy's dreams of a giant rabbit making dire prophecies about the end of the world is sure to raise more than a few eyebrows. But somehow Gyllenhaal pulls it off admirably and brings lots of interesting ambiguities to the scenario. Is it all true, or just the overactive imagination of a very disturbed young man?Richard Kelly supports Gyllenhaal with an imaginatively chosen cast. At the head of the line is Jena Malone as Gretchen, the new girl in school and Donnie's (sort of) girlfriend. She brings a tough, forthright attitude that matches Gyllenhaal's every bizarre step of the way.And then there's Drew Barrymore as Karen, a freethinking teacher at Donnie's school. I'm not convinced Drew Barrymore is all that much of an actress. But I enjoyed her performance here. Karen's independent thinking is quite well suited to Barrymore's often aloof style of acting. It's the first time I've ever perked up whenever she's around.And you mustn't miss Patrick Swayze's hilarious turn as a self-important motivational speaker. His speeches about the polar opposites between love and fear are very amusing. Donnie's cynical debates over Swayze's life plans are fun to watch too. This may be the closest thing to a good performance Patrick Swayze has ever done.DD is a film rich in ideas. It touches base with many radical concepts. From time-travel to parallel realities and even the life-paths of each individual person. Its certainly nice to see a film in this day and age with more than one idea in its head. But sometimes DD feels like it has one idea too many. Which only adds further complications to an already unclear screenplay.I was never exactly sure what new direction the film was going to pull me in next. Or even what Frank is supposed to represent. And then there's the ending. DD has a finale so mind-bending I wasn't sure if it was conceptual brilliance or purely a screenwriter's cop-out.But nonetheless, I'm giving DD 10/10. If its a film that doesn't always make narrative sense, it at least succeeded in making me think. Quite a bit actually. The different avenues it chooses to explore are never less than fascinating. Its got a wonderful selection of the 80s greatest hits to sift through. And the cast add so much drive and energy that you can't help but be swept along. This film may always be an eternal mystery, but it's that element that makes Donnie Darko so fascinating to behold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget what Richard Kelly says...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget about what Richard Kelly says about the "Philosophy of Time Travel", and Donnie as a "Living Receiver" whose duty it is to close the "Tangential Universe" and save the world. The movie is about satisfying a restless soul's desire for justice and redemption. It's about Frank. In the future he runs over Gretchen, probably due to alcohol and careless driving. He is tormented by his crime, and his soul, upon the opening of the time portal (caused by his own tormented soul?), goes back to seek justice. Although, one could imagine him going back to prevent the accident, that would not assuage his need for justice. He seeks to use Donnie to carry out his own execution. Why does he pick Donnie? Perhaps Donnie, in that previous future, was Gretchen's boyfriend, maybe even at the scene of the accident sans gun. Perhaps Donnie's house just happened to be where Frank's soul and the airplane engine ended up as the wormhole opened up in the past, requiring Frank to rescue him. One could imagine Frank's soul forever looping from the future to the past, each time having to ensure that his own execution would take place. His quest for justice extends to the crime of the Swayze character. But each time thru the time loop, things change, and on this last time thru, Darko finally understands Frank's torment, seeing himself, not as the tool of justice but the cause of injustice, leading Gretchen to her death. In the end, he understands time travel and achieves what Frank achieved, having his soul pass thru the wormhole. Upon arriving back in the past he stays in his room to be killed by the engine. Thru his death, Gretchen maybe lives, Frank never kills her, and is no longer doomed to repeat his passes thru the time loop. If it was Frank's guilt that originally opened the wormhole, then Darko, by allowing himself to die, saves the world.This is only my interpretation. Most stories are about personal crimes and the search for redemption and/or justice. Why would this movie be any different?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undeniably weird but not necessarily engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsDonnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a dysfunctional teenager living with his mom,dad and two younger sisters in a suburban town in America.On the night of 2 October 1988,a mysterious force,which later identifies itself as a giant bunny rabbit named Frank,draws him from his house and informs him that in exactly 28 days,6 hours,42 minutes and 12 seconds....the world will end.The next day,Donnie returns to his house and finds that a plane has crashed through the roof and so meeting Frank in turn saved his life.The film then basically follows Donnie through what are destined to be his (and everyone elses) last days and the nefarious activities the rabbit comes to require of him.If ever a film had developed such a strong and unexpected cult following from such humble beginnings over the last few years,it is this one.A small,independent film only ever intended for a limited release,word of mouth must have spread to such an extent that it has now become regarded as one of the most contempory movies of our time.The premise will be regarded by people in equal measure as weird or preposterous or both.The latter is really true of me,and although I couldn't help but notice the film's slant originality in some respects,I simply didn't find it engaging in any way.Gyllenhaal carries the film fairly well and the rest of the cast turn in recommendable turns too.Most of them are no name,but the two that aren't,in the shape of Patrick Swayze (returning from oblivion) as a motivational speaker and Drew Barrymore as an unconventional poetry teacher,are thankless roles that aren't really of any necessity to the already convulted plotline.The bunny's presence has an eerie,unnerving feel (for something so ridiculous) but maybe I'm just a bit too phased for characters like him to have an effect anymore (something to do with psychopathic,demonic clowns,that kind of thing.)Overall,I'm sure the film had some kind of deep,hidden meaning and significance to it,and I'm pretty sure I got it.The film just had no real effect on me.**</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Various disjoint remarks on Donnie Darko:Stylistically, the film appears to cite David Lynch from time to time, but obsequiously and with success; to wit, slow motion shots of iconic suburban settings with strongly juxtaposed music track giving irony.Anyone who has attended high school in North America will find strewn vignettes in this film detailing the gestures, ploys and situation comedy that typify the inimitable phenomena of adolescent baiting and peer to peer cruelty. By comparison to other teenage themed movies, these short takes are witty and very much on target. Their brevity and restraint are unusual.Indeed given the flirtation with so many genres, from film noir, to comedy, thriller, psychological study, fantasy, teen flick, and so on, Donnie Darko is a refreshingly self-assured film and its campiness is honest and smart.Interpretation of film's end: *** beware: big spoilers follow ***What Donnie Darko "was" is conveyed in a nutshell in his first innocent, abashed and quirky conversational encounter with his girlfriend-to-be the day after Middlesex high school's water mains have been chopped, the school flooded. Replying to the remark, 'What kind of a name is Donnie Darko? Sounds like a superhero,' Darko gamely quips, 'How do you know I'm not a superhero?' Indeed. For superhero he is, one who trips the Einsteinian space-time fantastic to thwart the natural fates reserved for many, to arrive at odyssey's end in his own bed and meet certain death. That possibility realized in virtue of his powers (it's all explained in Philosophy of Time Travel if you want to know), what once was real has now been demoted to counterfactuality and his damsel in distress can flourish - albeit in a world without Darko. Chivalry has been done: Darko the knight has given his life to save hers. His reward is epistemological in nature: he well knew the girl he saved; as a necessary consequence of his deeds, she will never know him. His chivalry is rooted in a kind of self-effacement, certain knowledge that his actions can never be acknowledged because only he can be privy to them. So their romance was truly an otherworldly one, one that unfolded in another world which now will never be. Darko chose to perish in a world he remade rather than to suffer love's loss in a world beginning the night a jet engine fell from the sky. Thus Donnie Darko, by accident a superhero, by design a romantic one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can't just forget a film like Donnie Darko and that's a compliment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is one of those films that you can't easily forget; i saw it last week and i'm still thinking in the story and truly is one of the best films that i have seen in this year. I know that this film was release in 2001 and that i saw it 6 years later but here in Mexico it wasn't release in the theaters and like in the rest of the world this film gain popularity in the DVD format and right now is a true cult film.It's hard to write a resume of the plot but i must say that is film is just unique because is not just a sci-fi story, is also a critic to the establish society and a view to the teenage life.Let's forget for a moment the time travel part and focus into the points of view of Donnie Darko. He is very clever, shy and very different from the rest of his school partners. Whe he start having this strange views of the rabbit (i really love those scenes) he start doing things that he always want to do but (like most of the persons) he was afraid. I mean, he wants to "change things" and in resume, he was against the establish society. Like in the school when he was against the idea of his teacher that in life there were just two things: love and fear, Donnie says that life wasn't that easy and simple but the teacher was afraid to go out the "normal" points of view of the school.So i really love a lot of things like that one in the entire film apart from the time travel story which also, i think is great. Like the talk between Donnie and the "f****** Antichrist", is really good and an example of the people which Donnie was against.About the sci-fi story: the time travel story is not easy to forget and is not easy to resume.I have only watch his film one time and other time very quickly so maybe i'm not correct but that's the magic of this film, is a very interesting story that makes you think.SPOILER ALERT!!!! (just for the people who already watch the film) For me is was like everything really happened, no matter if Donnie could travel back in time. I mean when Donnie dies, everybody wakes up from like a dream but they are thinking in what they lived with Donnie: Frank touches his eye and the "Antichrist" is crying for example. And also in the final scene there is a recognition between Gretchen (Donnie's girl) and Donnie's mother, so is like a story that ends on October 28 when the plain travel back on time to October 2 and in the case of the film we see that Donnie stays in his bed. Other thing is the character of Roberta Sparrow (Grandma Death) that is always checking the mail box because i think she knows that in some part of the story she will receive a letter that i think before she have already seen.Well is a very interesting story that you can comment with your friends and that makes you see this film more than 1 time.SPOILER ENDS!!!!!About the cast: is just great with a young Jake Gyllenhaall making his best performance (along with his character in "Zodiac") and with Drew Barrymore in a little role, i think she read the script and love it and said like "i give you the money but you give a role". And the rest of the cast is excellent.The visual part of the film is nothing but a piece of art and the music is more than excellent, with the beautiful "Mad World" and also with "Love will tear us apart" by Joy Division.As a conclusion: Donnie Darko is just a work of art and now is a must see; and for me is one of my favourites films of this decade. 10 out of 10DVD: is just great because that is the unique format that this film was release in Mexico. I have the "regular" edition with only 1 disc but is great with a lot of bonus material so i really like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the top five of the decade! "Donnie Darko" is original, entertaining, and ultimately tragic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" is near perfect and easily one of the top five films of the decade so far. The film manages to take several distinct tones and work in all of them seamlessly. Its a satire on high school and suburbia, a bizarre bit of surrealism, and ultimately a saddening portrait of a youth losing his mind. Its also open to interpretation and has a lot of depth, more so than the fan boy and angst-filled teen praise would lead one to believe. Its close to perfect and in the end any minor flaws don't detract from its overall power. Simply put, "Donnie Darko" is one of the finest films in recent memory, certainly one of the most original. I eagerly await Richard Kelly's next film.This is another film debut where one wonders how the director will ever be able to top it. Even though I'm sure he has many other fine pictures to come, it'll be tough for Kelly to better this. Later efforts may be more polished, but "Donnie Darko" is brimming with energy. Its definitely one of the most amazing film debuts ever. The acting is fantastic, with a truly revelatory lead from Jake Gyllenhaal. He brings the right amount of awkwardness to his role and in the end makes him a sympathetic and tragic character. This is at heart, a character study and both Kelly and Gyllenhaal create a memorable protagonist. If you haven't already picked it up, "Donnie Darko" is a masterpiece. Few films are as multi-layered and intelligent as this one. (10/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard about this film I did'nt know what to make of it. The fact that one of its central characters was a giant rabbit. Although after seeing it I was just blown away by it. Director Richard Kelly covers so many topics in this film such as teen alienation, family issues, school, time travel and philosophy.The result is a powerful piece of social satire and American popular culture.Jake Gyllenhall is superb as the rebellious James Dean style chacter who is told the world will end within a month.The film demands repeat viewings as it can be hard to follow at times but is certainly a modern day masterpiece.It is good to see this film finally getting the respect that it deserves.Richard Kelly Roll on your next masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Thought-Provoking Modern Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: Review is based on the Director's Cut version) This film is one of those films you truly have to see to both believe and understand. To be perfectly honest I wasn't quite sure what to make of this film the first time I saw it due to its, for lack of a better term, strangeness but upon repeated viewings the film begins to make sense and you'll begin to appreciate the intricate plotting of Richard Kelly's script, the fine acting of the cast, and the overall excellence of the film Donnie Darko.Jake Gyllenhaal is the one who carries the film and his performance is nothing short of hypnotic to watch. Gyllenhaal is perfect in the role as the weird, troubled, and confused title character. Gyllenhaal never steps out of character and it is his performance that keeps you glued to the screen even during some of the film's weirdest and confusing moments. In short, the talent that he has that would appear during the years that followed this film's release is seen here in an inkling.The rest of the cast is not very far behind Gyllenhaal in terms of their performances. Jena Malone gives a surprising performance as Donnie's girlfriend and she is in many ways the emotional anchor of the film. She is also the source of sanity for Donnie throughout the film as it goes along and even she is drawn into whatever is effecting Donnie. Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell play Donnie's parents who seem not to be sure of what to make of their son's unusual hallucinations. Added to the family is Donnie's sisters played by the seemingly innocent Daveigh Chase and with, a nice sense of sibling rivalry, by Gyllenhall's sister Maggie. Add to these appearances by Katharine Ross, Drew Barrymore &amp; Noah Wyle as the authority figures of Donnie's life plus Patrick Swayze as some self-motivator and the highly unusual appearance of Frank (played by James Duval) and you get a spectacular cast.And now onto the script. Richard Kelly has managed to create a script that is both gripping, well-textured, and confusing as hell upon the first viewing (or two). The script is layer upon layer of story, character development, and a plot involving parallel universes and time travel (I think). The script explores issues of acceptance, existence, and everything short of and including the meaning of life. Not east stuff to get the first time around but as I wrote above, repeated viewings makes it easier to understand (plus the fact that Richard Kelly himself has said the film is open to one's own interpretation). In short, the most confusing film script since 2001: A Space Odyssey is the only way I can really describe Donnie Darko.Beyond the script lies a film masterpiece. The film is beautifully photographed from start to finish, starting with the sweeping opening shot of Donnie and ending with the waving between characters at the end of the film. The music score for the film is an interesting combination of well-chosen pop songs (including the opening song "Never Tear Us Apart" by INXS and the hypnotic "Mad World") and a well done score by Michael Andrews to create a hypnotic soundtrack to an hypnotic film. Add to this some weird special effects to Donnie's visions and it is a journey into?well something (as I said this is one of those "you figure out what it means" films).Overall, Donnie Darko is a masterpiece of modern film-making. With an exceptional performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, fine performances from the rest of the cast, an intricately layered script, beautiful photographed, well scored, and being truly hypnotic, Donnie Darko is a must see for anyone who wants to take a though-provoking two plus hours and go into the unknown. See this as soon as possible. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>first of all, i agree that this film is in a way highly overrated, but still is a good movie. of course, many of you who scored a "perfect ten" for this movie will say that i didn't understand it... oh, but i did. and it isn't too much to understand. i hate those guys who try to find a story where there is not one and try to find out the "deep meaning" of each and every detail (of course after they saw the movie and saw the IMDb rating and comments). i accept the fact that many of those who watched this movie really loved it, but i disagree to the fact that some of them believe that we (the ones that found this film to be not a "genial" one) didn't understand it and that we are in a way frustrated that this movie has a great rating. like i said before i think this is a good movie, but is far to be a great one (in my opinion the movie is saved by its end, its cast and the "cute" bunny). 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I'm very easy to please when it comes to stuff like this, especially if it successfully and visually builds a world of mood. I give special consideration to first-time competence, and am especially interested in projects Barrymore sponsors. I love time folding, self-reference and narrative challenges. I really enjoy films whose narrative depends on other films, ideally classics.And yet this film failed me, because of reliance on two devices that really annoy. The first is the embedded parody on 70-80's teen flicks. This is simply hackneyed by now. I could take it in 'Ghost World,' in 'Go,' even in 'Ginger Snaps.' But here it is simply a crutch with nothing new and much that is old.The other annoyance -- rather a barrier to endearment -- is the heavihanded symbolism. I gladly swallowed it in 'American Beauty,' more eagerly in 'Fight Club,' and reluctantly with 'Magnolia.' But here, it is so heavihanded only a teenager could not think it unsophisticated. And this in a film quoting Graham Greene!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>crazy potential, poor execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a hassle to follow. As someone who has always been extremely keen of those movies with slightly confusing premises, I'm shocked that I did not enjoy Donnie Darko. It had everything I thought I loved: thought provoking concept, attention to detail, revelations, chilling scenes, unpredictable plot, eeriness, Jake Gyllenhaal. If that sounds like your cup of tea, I suggest you watch it! I also, commend the humor. Donnie Darko is such a character, and he made this movie less painful to watch. Onto the disappointment...The film's intended "AHA" moments were absurdly far-fetched, and as a result, the movie felt completely... incomplete. Even with my utmost attention, I couldn't follow.The movie did not give the viewer enough time and references to absorb the time traveling concepts from the book. Therefore, when it came time for the film's several unexpected disclosures, yes...I was shocked, but I wasn't sure why. It came off as just some random fluke that totally caught me off guard, and I had no idea where the movie was going. For some, that is the "art" of Donnie Darko; don't get me wrong, I love the turn of events in this movie, but when the viewer doesn't know what relevance those twists have to the plot, that "big reveal" means absolutely nothing. In retrospect, this movie is too abstract to be considered high concept. I give it points for its unique flair. After some research I began to connect the dots, and I also now understand why it is praised: It's a movie with incredible creativity and complexity! It leaves the viewers with a confusion that awakens a fun search for answers, but that confusion took so much away from a movie with such crazy potential to be GREAT. Even now, with all of the answers to the story, I find it difficult to hear that anyone could've possibly put the pieces together themselves and thoroughly enjoyed such a broken movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's films like these that make me love cinema. I know I say that a lot, but it's worth mentioning how movies like Donnie Darko give me a unique feeling. It's hard to explain, but much like Mulholland Drive, I wanted to look up more about the film after I watched it. It's not a film that allows you to go back to your normal life before you sit down and think about what you just saw. I cant believe I hadn't watched the movie until now, but I'm also jealous of people who haven't seen it. It's one of those movies that transcends the screen and becomes more than just something you watched, it's something you experienced.It's 2015 and Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the top actors in the world, but way back in 2001 that wasn't the case. In fact, Donnie Darko was one of the first movies to showcase what he had to offer. I will still maintain that the most impressive thing Gyllenhaal does is create a character with his eyes. Everything goes through his subtle eye movements and gestures. Take a look back at his performance in Nightcrawler or Prisoners and analyze how much his eyes define his character. He may very well be the best actor working today. As Donnie, he was able to showcase just how good he can be at nailing a character with inner demons. None more terrifying than Frank, the strange rabbit who appears frequently throughout Donnie's dreams. More importantly, Jake gives us a character who you sympathize with even after all of the horrible things he has done. Not many people can say that.For most of the film, it's hard to figure out just what is going on. Not just because of the huge cast and seemingly several important characters to the plot, but because the film juggles many different genres all in one. It's a psychological thriller at heart, but mixed in is sci-fi, horror, crime, and even a little bit of romance. It's actually probably because of those many genres that I feel the films main weaknesses derive from. The tone is shifting a lot throughout the film and the music constantly switches from being a 90's high school angst film to a dark twisted psychological mystery film a lot.But overall it's a really good film. The phrase "keeps you on the edge of your seat" can be considered an understatement for Darko. The two hours sped by and I honestly didn't want it to end. Even after the twisted ending, I wanted to see where these characters went. Speaking of characters, it's worth mentioning how good all of the other actors are here. Maggie Gyllenhaal, playing Donnie's sister, looks just about as stunning as she's ever been, and is also pretty darn good in the role too. Jena Malone in one of her first major roles definitely carries her own weight as the lead female and love interest to Donnie. But Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, and Mary McDonnell all make their presence felt here.So of course, then comes the question of what my opinion is on the ending of the film. While in some senses it's ambiguous, I don't think it's beyond belief to think that the ending was meticulously crafted in order for us to debate for years to come. I've done my research and am satisfied with what I believe to be the fate of all the characters. But one of the biggest takeaways from the film I found was the inspiration the film seemed to take from David Lynch. Even though Mulholland Drive came out the same year, it really seemed to take a whole lot from that type of storytelling. If you told me Lynch directed Donnie Darko I would have believed you. But anyway, Donnie Darko is on it's own one of the best thrillers I have seen in a long time, and definitely one of Gyllenhaal's best films.+Gyllenhaal's performance through his eyes +Great cast +Unique +Ending that takes some time to process -Genre mixing can be exhausting at times 9.0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have now seen this movie twice in two nights. Started with the theatrical version, then the Director's Cut. And I went on three different websites that explained the story behind the plot for me. And I will tell you, I am not entirely impressed. What is the whole purpose behind all of this?From my understanding, Donnie was guided by "God" throughout the whole Tangent Universe in order for the universe to be saved. And Donnie followed along. Is this to show that Donnie was aware that God was behind this and he had to follow along for the sake of the world? So in the Tangent Universe, Donnie has as much power IF NOT MORE.. than God himself.. And Donnie made the right move.He saved the world. Donnie IS a hero, he is not a wacko. He IS the HERO. The hero every single character was antagonizing in the Real Universe.This movie is amazing.I am now changing the grade from a 7 to a 9. The only reason this doesn't get a 10 is because the director went out of his way to make this overly complicated. I mean, I don't see how anybody who watches the theatrical version can understand without doing some kind of research afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is clearly a vehicle for young actors to show their stuff to industry insiders. Like an extended audition, the plot is unnecessary, the continuity irrelevant and the ending is only needed to let people know the audition is over and they can leave. At least the crew got some work, made a little money, kept the economy afloat for a while. So much of what is churned out by Hollywood is simply make-work for people, a way to keep money changing hands back and forth, create a void where money can be siphoned off without the tax-man knowing about it. This movie is a prime example of that. If you're looking for some redeeming value in this turkey, skip it unless you're in 9th grade and like to make faces at people in the school hallways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't think it was possible for a movie to deliver both a browbeating and confusion, but this one certainly does!The fear vs. love theme is painfully clear. The details, however, are extremely convoluted, and the filmmakers knew this. Together with the original film, they created a website dedicated to explaining the storyline. This doesn't make for an intelligent movie; it makes for bad storytelling. It almost seems like the creators of the movie realized way too late that their thoughts don't translate well to the screen. I love a movie that makes me think, but not one that has me exhausted with the work of re-creating it.There are some good points. The acting is excellent, and the rabbit is oddly, insidiously disturbing. It's been an hour and I still can't shake that image. The movie is worth a look for that alone.For years I thought I was missing a compelling piece of cinema. I was wrong. If you haven't seen it but feel pressed to, relax. It can wait.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing is ever as it seems?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As humans, we're probably the only animal capable of contemplating our own mortality. Many say or think that, at the point of death, your whole life --- maybe only a part? -- flashes before your eyes. And who knows what you really see, anyway..? That's what this movie is all about: it provides a glimpse of what might have been going on inside Donnie's head in the brief few seconds before he dies when a 747 engine drops though the roof of his parents' house and lands on top of him. So, all that you see from the start of this movie until near the end is simply Donnie's (Jake Gyllenhaal) last thoughts for this earth. Very near the start of the story, Donnie has a vision, meeting a strange figure called Frank who tells him that his world is coming to an end. That's a clue that Donnie's dying but I didn't cotton onto that until much later in the plot...This narrative structure has been done at least once before that I know of: Jacob's Ladder (1990) had the story of a Vietnam soldier dying on an operating table. That story was again the soldier's weird thoughts before he succumbed to his wounds. If you haven't seen it, it is worth the time; but, it's quite a scary movie for some.I'd seen Gyllenhaal, for the first time, not so long ago in Jarhead (2005) a movie I didn't like but was much impressed by his acting. So, that's one of the reasons I saw this one: his intensity is once again at the forefront of all the characters in Donnie Darko.At another level, this movie is also partly about the American Dream and the lies that support it: there's the dream psychology coach Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze), and what a ham he is, and very cunning to boot because he's got a nasty, dirty little secret; there's the idealistic English teacher Karen Pomeroy (Drew Barrymore) who's trying to open the students' minds to the delights of language ? and gets more than she bargained for; there's the phys-ed coach Kitty Farmer (Beth Grant) who wants her girls to win a national dancing competition, and will stop at nothing to get it; there's school principal Cole (David Moreland) who wants nothing more than peace, quiet, and all the metaphorical garbage kept out of public view; and finally there's Donnie's family, (see cast list), jaded, all mixed up, almost brain dead, and resigned to la dolce vita, or what passes for that each good morning, America.As Donnie, we learn from the story what might have happened had he lived, and as the final tune and final scenes play, what still might happen. Those final scenes are out of kilter with the whole thrust of the story (much like Jacob's Ladder, where the viewer knows what happens after the soldier dies ? a narrative inconsistency) because Donnie's dead and the whole thing was his thoughts anyway. However, directors must cater for the viewer, tie up loose ends, and hope that nobody notices... But, heck, in a fantasy dressed up as science fiction, anything can happen, right? I really enjoyed this movie: good performances, snappy dialog, very effective cinematography, and quite funny in parts. Recommended.</fullReview>

Emotionally self-destructive, really cynical and controversial (in some contexts). If you can't enjoy the psychological twists of this movie, you'll enjoy the general excitement and that may be even better. If you can enjoy both, than this movie is worth buying. I would say, rent it first. Don't jump into it or you'll be lost, $15, $20 wasted on a movie that you simply cannot appreciate and there's nothing worse.

		<fullReview>Tonight a Dutch television station broad-casted Donnie Darko. I saw it listed in the television guide, and decided to watch. For some personal reasons (for which I don't give any explanation) I hesitated a bit, but I still did. The story was well told, and the plot was based on a good foundation. However, it wasn't too hard to follow the storyline. Even the meaning of the "cellardoor" was clear to me! The most special thing about this movie is the consequence: its story is still puzzling me (in a pleasant way)! So, the movie is much longer than listed! It's a real fantasy-story, in which several things are very illustrious. But following the plot until the end, it becomes clear. You even are beginning to believe the possible truth of it. It's hard to name a negative point of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko defies all laws of our regular universe (much like time travel?!). I think that the beauty the film, like any good piece of art lies in the fact that there isn't any 1 comprehensive interpretation of it. Yet, at the same time, I'd like to give my own. After reading some if the other reviews, I'd didn't quite agree with some of the stuff that was written. At one level, I think the movie understood as a critique of and rebellion against our narrow-minded (the school.. embodied in the 'fear and love' teacher) view of life (and this is where Drew Barrymore's character comes in). There's the 2 boys, who jump Donnie and his girlfriend, with knives in the end who fit the totally useless, wasted and disturbed archetype. But Donnie is not like them although he falls into many of the aforementioned categories. He's intelligent and yet can't cope with life, but for precisely that reason (he sees through all the facade's and bullshit that life has to offer - Cunningham). And that's where his schizophrenia comes from (I'm not talking medically but metaphorically). Now to come to the question that's on everyone's mind at the end of the film... If he dies at the end, then what is the whole film about? Is it a dream, hallucination..? But if he's dead then who's hallucinating and if he hallucinated all this before his death then isn't that a bit weird? I think the the film is supposed to through up these contradictory questions to make us break out of our 'conservative' views, confined to logic, rationality..... I don't think this is a Chrisopher Nolan type film in which you're supposed to try and tie up everything in the film in light of the end. It's not a 'jigsaw puzzle film'. Maybe the director just wanted to have some fun with the narrative and purposely added an illogical twist in the end...? The point is that, the questions here maybe more important than the answers... Now maybe I'm reading too much into the film but I feel this interpretation adds a very different flavour to the film. But however you may interpret the film, one has to agree that the camera work was amazing. As was the script and most importantly, the wide variety of characters. I haven't really thought about the film in very great detail so there are many important features that I must left out here. A film that should be seen twice (though i haven't yet) and most definitely, at least once!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Watched the Dir's Cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just experienced another journey with this fascinating piece of work but with this version I found it much more 'contained' and 'linear' and not nearly as provoking as the cinema release. The conclusions, ideas and thoughts of the cinema release were not as 'set' as they are in The Dir's cut, which --when watching it this evening/morning-- made it 'easier' to follow and 'see what was' THUS affecting its purpose which is --surely-- to provoke? With the original cut you have so much more room to 'imagine' and go places that you may well otherwise have not ; nonetheless, beautiful. All done for love.Plus: Opening track in the original is Echo and the Bunny Men, Killing Moon, a much more captivating way to start the film IMHO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director dumbs down Donnie Darko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As good as the movie is, the open-endedness left more to the imagination, which the director's cut attempts to over-elaborately explain. I understand that the director is probably just trying to respond to comments about how hard it was to understand, but his response shouldn't have been to dumb down the movie. I loved it exactly the way it was. For example, in the scene where Donnie puts a hatchet through the bronze mongrel, the original leaves the audience in a state of awe. The Director's cut, on the other hand attempts to explain it with a quick except from a text book which states that those who go back in time are given super-human strength. It completely kills the moment. Watch the original if you have a chance, if you don't then see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"When people run in circles it's a very,very-mad world..."I think,there is no middle about this film. You'll like it or you will not.Maybe it's just better to be dead,or stop doing anything in order to save the humanity.Look at the history,or even better,look around yourself,watch on TV,hear on radio,the destruction is a form of creativity.Like Ivo Andric wrote in his Nobel prise winner work ( Bridge on the river Drina )-"Nothing can bound and gather people as collective disaster".Donnie Darko is wicked story about mentally unstable teenager who thinks that a world is going to be end in less than a month. Dialogs are quite interesting,David is awesome and whole plot is excellent set.Everything is spinning about Donnie's rationality which is perfectly used to give an answer of some major questions about growing up and to criticize cold,cliché way of living in American dream. Maybe the perfect way of living,in the world where problems doesn't exist,creates monstrous people,changing calmness to destructively behavior. The main question in the movie is-when is going to be the end of the world? Now,when i've watched the movie,I think that for Donnie the end came on the night when his girlfriend was ran over,and when the love was, once again,destructed by human hands. We create love,we destruct it,it is endless circle of our existing and the only thing that separates cowards from heroes is an answer on question-Would you have enough heart to change things if you would be given one more chance? Even though that a price of changing the faith is your own life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently reviewed my DVD of "Donnie Darko" and was disappointed. What seemed fresh and engrossing about the film had gone stale over the couple of years that the DVD had stayed in its case.Please don't let me put you off if you haven't seen it yet. "Donnie Darko" is well-acted and the bonkers script just manages to avoid disappearing up its own fundament, but it's no classic.Director/writer Richard Kelly didn't waste his time at film school and "Donnie Darko" is his first stab at running the whole show. The film is a bold and only slightly self-conscious mix of high school drama, mental illness and metaphysics. Unfortunately it doesn't contain enough movie magic to merit further viewings. However, I urge you to watch it if you haven't already seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that everyone has an extreme view of this film, its either the greatest movie they ever saw or the worst, the truth is somewhere in between. This is an intelligent movie that makes you think, is darkly funny and doesn't necessarily end happily, to some people these qualities make a movie great to others it makes it bad and to some they dosn't make a movie good or bad. Donnie Darko is a fun movie, it is at times confused and confusing. Donnie is "rescued" from death by someone dressed as a rabbit who tells him the world will end in just over 28 days. From this point on the world is apparently slightly out of kilter but we can't know for sure because we aren't shown enough before he is saved. Life goes on and the man rabbit tells Donnie to do "bad" things, arson, vandalism and the like. HE also sees "strands of time showing him what is about to happen. Everything comes to a head as people die, we learn where the rabbit came from and then Donnie watches as a time worm hole, he may or may not have created, sends him back in time where this time he is not rescued. While I enjoyed Donnie Darko I have two gripes, first we aren't given enough back story to know what is right or wrong in the universe that should be fixed and second it would appear that if Donnie had just died in the first place none of the story would have been necessary. The movie itself creates its own paradox. Definitely a movie worth seeing but not the greatest movie ever made either.</fullReview>

But at the same time very few of these 'in the know' people have actually bothered to explain the heck this movie is all about. Which leads me to believe they're sanctimonious English Lit students who are just as confused as the rest of us! But hey that's ok because this movie has depth and meaning, right? Well if there is it's totally lost on me I'm afraid. I did enjoy the way the film poked fun at the hypocrisy of American Christian Conservative culture, particularly Patrick Swayze as the child molesting motivational speaker. Apart from that aspect I found the film rather morose, confusing and unsatisfying. And it's certainly not because I like brain-dead Hollywood blockbusters, on the contrary I usually like thought provoking independent movies but unfortunately this one didn't engage me at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" blows. The movie is an audacious, pretentious disaster. It's an embarrassment to everyone involved and an embarrassment to everyone who sees it. Sure, there are still a few people left out there who saw the film as wide-eyed teenagers and still have the naiveté (stupidity?) to call it a good movie but this crowd is maturing with every passing day. And as the good-hearted people wake up one-by-one the little cult that kept the buzz alive grows weaker, and fewer people are subjected to this film. There is a God.First-time director Richard Kelly gives new meaning to the phrase "biting off more than you can chew" with a movie about teenage isolation, sleep-walking, imaginary friends, self-help, rebellion, death, psychology, martyrdom, love, death, and a pivotal sequence about an elementary school dance troupe which is NOT just another excuse to play one of his favorite songs from the 80's. Oh I almost forgot- Kelly also throws in sub-plots about time-travel and alternate universes just to keep things interesting. But you won't have to do a lot of thinking to grasp these deep concepts- he didn't.In fact Kelly doesn't seem to over-think anything at all. The movie cruises along until the baffling twist ending that simply negates everything that came before. None of it never happened. Now, we're hip to non-linear films, Dick- most people are these days. We understand stories told out of sequence, parallel narratives, mind-blowing twists... and we like them, when they're done right. But the end of Donnie Darko is what my parents would call a cop-out... just a cheap plot device to avoid making a statement or offering an idea. There's no resolution or explanation for what has come before, not an ounce of effort to provide a cohesive conclusion to what you've been watching. You will be sucked in by Donnie Darko... it's a watchable movie... and you will watch because there are interesting conflicts and because you're sure SOME if not ALL of them will be resolved... SUCKER!!!And that's exactly how the cult grew: intelligent moviegoers were so devastated by the film's aborted ending they reasoned there had to be more. (There isn't.) The audience insisted the story must make sense. (It doesn't.) They took to the internet, writing thesis papers and studying theories of alternate universes and time travel and eating up the director's retro-active re-writing of his script to fit the beliefs of his cult's current demographic. You could do all this work, too... or you could save yourself time...And just flush.GRADE: F</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jake Gyllenhall stars in this mix of sci-fi, horror and mystery. And he does well, creating the memorable character of a troubled teen. Where the film falls down is the the way the plot mixes in pseudo science and pseudo religion. It is OK to do that if the pace of a movie is fast enough so that the viewer is not bothered but this is not the case here - it is a slow movie with a disappointing climax. If you are going to use this kind psychobabble you should at least make sure your plot holes are covered and again this is not the case. The director follows the standard method of a countdown to give the film some forward motion, a sense of increasing tension. The principle character is informed that the world will end in 28 days. The problem is that after a while, this countdown seems interminably slow - When the screen said there were 12 days to go I was disappointed, I was hoping it was at least within a week of the climax. There were other disappointments, the man in the scary bunny suit was certainly scary-looking but there were no moments of real terror, which is what I was expecting. On the positive side the mood and characterisation was good. It remains flawed but watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>?I thought this film was dull. I understood it, though it was a challenge, and saw its point, but I couldn't help feel unsatisfied at the end. Perhaps I wasn't meant to; I usually don't feel satisfied at the end of any film. (Save Jean-Pierre Jeunet's `Amelie', everyone liked that)Richard Kelly is quite young, so we may forgive him for being so skittish with his plot, but not his debauched characterization. Donnie, the protagonist, veers from suicidal freak to happy-go-lucky in a matter of seconds. He's on medication and is crackers, but it's still not forgivable. It is important for us to feel connected with the main character, and here it is possible only for deranged teenagers with a giant rabbit for a friend. These particular persons are a minority.I quite liked Drew Barrymore's acting in this; but then again I hated Charlie's Angels and am always up for giving people a second chance. (Save Kate Bosworth) In short, the movie was well acted, well-cast (Particularly Gyllenhaal, whom I will always applaud) and is delightfully dark. However, like other delightfully dark items such as Black Forest Gateau, the thick veins of the movie are choked by a sour chocolate sauce. There are too many subplots. Now I love subplots, don't get me wrong; they are one of the three Messiahs of the film world (the others being Marty Feldman and Hitchcock) but here it is absolutely ridiculous. There is a jet, time travel, Christina Applegate (who is ridiculous enough by herself) a giant rabbit named Frank, the 80's for chrissake, and something about water coming out of people's chests which evaded me completely on the first viewing. The whole thing is like a drunken trip round a disco first time round; you're supposed to take it with a pinch of salt and not really do anything. Don't think about it, and you'll be cynical. Do and you'll be lost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You will be disappointed, I promise you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend, whose judgement I normally value, recommended this to me as a 'must see'. Set in 1988, Donnie Darko is the tale of a troubled American High School Student (yes, yet another one). After 40 minutes of this I was still waiting to be grabbed like my friend was. And here's the rub - you won't be grabbed, believe me. The true test for any piece of fiction is that you care about the characters, or, at the very least, care enough to find out what happens to them. Be honest folks, did you really care about what Donnie's problem was? Of course not. He was a bland, unsympathetic cipher. A lot has been said of the performance by the lead, but I've seen Keanu Reeves turn in more heartfelt and engaging performances. The writer/director has obviously stuck by his 'Youth Films 101' coursebook to a T. There is one excrucitating tacked-on scene where Donnie and his mates discuss the deeper significance of 'The Smurfs'. The director clearly liked Tarantino's deconstruction of 'Like A Virgin' in Reservoir Dogs and has attempted a weak copy himself. NO ONE ever had that conversation (and certainly not teenagers in 1988) and to pretend otherwise is just smug revisionism. There is another scene where, to the strains of 'Head Over Heels' by Tears For Fears, the world goes into slow motion. The viewer expects something to happen. Like the rest of the film, nothing does. Drew Barymore and Patrick Swayze play minor parts. Why? Who knows: they certainly brought nothing special to the table. Set in 1988, the 'special' effects mimic the era also. Strange, translucent 'watery' worms emerge from people (think 'The Abyss'). And what does it all mean? Should you last till the end, you will be very, very disappointed. Chronicle of a death foretold - how original. Don't believe what the 'respected' critics have said about Donnie Darko. It says nothing new and does so in an unoriginal manner.</fullReview>

It is 7 out of 10; very good, but does lose its way a little, after a good start and before an intriguing, even haunting, conclusion. I must confess I didn't fully understand what it was all about, but the fact that it makes you think about the possibilities of time travel, and the facts of death and schizophrenia, make it thought-provoking enough to stay with you for a long time. The 80s music, although not my favourite era, was perfectly toned for the events taking place, and the finale of 'Mad World'as the film reached its conclusion was one of the most memorable moments in recent cinema. On the plus side, I thought most of the acting was credible. On the minus side, there's Patrick Swayze. Although well-cast, he is sickeningly revolting! A film worth seeing twice, but not in the same league as 'Mulholland Drive' for sheer weirdness...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd like to advise any one who has read this far down on the additional reviews page to disregard any positive reviews you have read about this movie. I strongly believe it is a waste of time. The director, Richard Kelly, comes from USC film school, which trains him to take what is successful in other films (i.e. Magnolia, Being John Malkovich, to name a few) and slap them together. Unfortunately, he doesn't add anything else to this mix except for a convoluted, plotless story and TV sitcom, one-dimensional characters. I'm sure many people have commented on how the plot was "confusing" or "complicated" - it is. That is all it is. It means nothing. And then, in one scene Darko yells at a teacher who is trying to get him to label a situation as either "Love" or "Fear". He says that life is more complex that that duality. Ironically, every character in this film is either good or bad. There is the mean, knife-wielding bully, the sweet girlfriend, the good, daring teacher, the mean, narrow-minded teacher, etc. etc. Watch any other film besides this one, please. Don't support this schlock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch "Donnie Darko" only if you are impressed by its 'cult film' status.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What does one observe while watching a film depends on how the viewer watches a particular film ? However, there are certain elementary things which all viewers can notice easily. These qualities are related to the way a film progresses, how its narrative structure is composed and what is the general feel about it. Donnie Darko is one film which provides ample chances to viewers to detect its essential qualities. Most viewers would not waste much time to conclude that it is rather slow, episodic in nature and popular only due to its status as a "cult film". What do these three primary qualities leave for those viewers who have not yet watched it ? This is a key question to be discussed by all intelligent viewers but there is hardly any secret when it is revealed by some viewers that "Donnie Darko" is a story about a high school student and his psychological frame of mind to deal with senseless acts of violence. The worst thing about "Donnie Darko" is that actors Patrick Swayze and Drew Barrymore have been given too small roles which do not do any justice to their acting talents. Having the name of a literary giant associated with a film is a blessing in disguise for a good film but "Donnie Darko" is so pointless as a film that even the mention of British author Graham Greene does not help much to elevate this film's chances of success. Lastly, Donnie Darko is to be watched only if a viewer intends to ascertain whether it truly deserves its cult film status or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Repeated viewings of this is part of the requirement to fully appreciate this. Also included are genuine effort to get into it, thought applied to putting it all together, and obviously sufficient attention span. Reading the FAQ and visiting the site for it, and working through the puzzles found there, also help. I don't mean to scare people away from this, more to inform. This is like a jigsaw puzzle, and not a simple one at that. When the pieces do all come together... well, I imagine that it's satisfying, I honestly can't claim it's happened for me yet. But I really can't find anything in this to criticize. The plot is interesting, and develops throughout. The pacing is deliberate, nothing is rushed or dwelled upon in a manner it shouldn't be. The acting is flawless. The philosophy and food for thought are well-done. Editing and cinematography are excellent. They're experimental(that, in fact, is a word that really applies to this entire film) without being flashy or over-stylized. The music is amazing and always well-chosen. The production never shows that its budget was little by today's standards. The effects are astounding in every case. Kelly definitely deserves his work being noticed. The overall concept is well-thought out, and while this is certainly not the first depiction of it, even on the silver screen, it is the most "realistic" and consistent one, and it's near the top of the list as far as how engaging it is(The Butterfly Effect does, for me, beat this in that respect, but I will admit that the writers of that did do stuff that was more cool than it was sensible, if not very often). I understand that the Director's Cut is the version that largely explains what happens, whereas the Theatrical(which is the only I've seen thus far), to a wider degree leaves it up to individual interpretation. There is a bit of disturbing content, and there is some language, as well as dialog that should perhaps not reach younger ears. In any event, this is hardly meant for children. I recommend this to fans of Richard Kelly, the others involved in making it, and dark science fiction that you, when or if you watch, must be an active participant of. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Genre Fusing Masterpiece Of Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lynchian? Perhaps this is the only way in which a summary of Donnie Darko can be compressed into just one word. This film is an absolute mish-mash of varying styles and genres, but has the added bonus of succeeded in its amalgamation of styles which quite frankly makes it one of the great films of not only the 21st Century but perhaps in cinematic history. Am I over-hyping this film? Perhaps not nearly enough.A surreal blend of dark humour, science fiction, teen drama and high school angst, Donnie Darko is a mind tripping, thought out journey through the life of one adolescent as he comes to terms not only with the arduous task that is puberty, parents, school and friends, but that his perceived delusions and eccentricities will make him the only one that can save the universe from complete destruction. This may sound like a garbled mess but it works wonderfully due to the way that the director, Richard Kelly, manages to tell convincingly all aspects of this story in a way where nothing feels, forced, nerdish or out of place.Guiding Donnie through the time ridden paradox that is this film is be-musingly a six foot tall bunny rabbit named Frank. While Franks identity may become somewhat clearer throughout the course of the film, his presence works on several levels (as indeed does the film). Not only is he a mental figmentation but he is also a manifestation of the teenage angst that raged (or will rage, depending) inside all of us. The need to rebel and break free of rules, moulds and confines to cope with the fear that comes with having to grow up. On top of this there are many referential notes to make with Frank, that first and foremost of "Watership Down", which itself is present in the film make reference to how Donnie and Frank mirror their rabbit counterparts fiver and the spectre that haunts him with tales of the worlds demise. There are more obvious analogies, the simplest of which is Alice In Wonderland and how the White Rabbit provides the means for the hero to return to where they are supposed to be. Unfortunately, it's far too difficult to go into too much detail without having to ingrain a spoiler at the top, because many of the films key notations are inward and secular, as they constantly repeat themselves in varying formats, but by the same token provide a film which can be interpreted by all viewers in different and personal ways.Donnie Darko succeeds because it gets the small things right. The made for cinema cut is slightly more Lynchian than the directors cut due to the absence of some notable moments and thereby lacking the continuity, and so I'd have to recommend the Directors Cut due to it being somewhat more coherent (although that's not essential) and providing a deeper explanation as to the events which transpire. Moments where Donnie is playing on an Arcade machine, and the importance of placebo's are key plot moments but are lost on the viewer without the Directors Cut. But whichever version the subtleties of plot and character developments keep the viewer hooked. The interesting twists and turns of the story whether it be human drama or science fiction are exceptionally well written and perfectly acted. Suffice to say this film works on more levels than one, and will leave a deeply profound affect on all those that want it to.Donnie Darko was recently credited (if all the critical acclaim and general love by all fans of cinema wasn't enough) as being in the top ten of fifty films you must see before you die, and to be honest I couldn't have phrased it better myself. There is little to say without spoiling the film for those that haven't seen it and there is little I can say which hasn't already been said about this film. It is for want of a better phrase a modern day masterpiece, an exercise in cinematic achievement highlighting an ability to tell stories which many thought was all but lost. Few films are worthy of pedestals, and while the amount by which tens are brandished around on IMDb, few films are worthy of a ten. Donnie Darko deserves it all. Maximum.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd watched this film a couple of years ago and never thought much of it. Like another IMDb user states I just thought this was a weird film just for the sake of being weird.In the last four months I have maybe watched it another 20 times, at first out of boredom and then because it dazzled me so much. I like this film so much because I don't get it. I'm not as smart as some of the users of this site so I haven't completely figured it out but I'm certainly working on it. Reading some of the FAQ's hs helped me and I'm going to look into it even more.There are some scenes that seem so powerful and I don't really know why. The scenewhere Jim Cunningham is talking to the school children and Donnie calls him the anti-Christ, the scene where the dance-troup are performing at the talent contest, the scene where donnie tells cherita that its all gonna be OK in the future etc etc.What an unbelievable and inspirational film, I can't wait to read more into it and uncover the depths that I currently don't understand.Michael</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**WARNING- THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**there are very few movies that really reflect the way i feel, honestly i think its the only one. there are many explanations for this film but, from my point of view all the movie is happening is those couple of moments that we see donnie laughing, he is see what is going to happen, he see the nothing that beyond the society who around him.this movie talks about how this life line is like a box that u cant go out, because what kelly trying to show that the you cant go nowhere in school u cant develop and u cant be creative, school made u like a robot. donnie see in frank the knowledge of what he needs to do, and that's the reason that he see him as something scary, because he knows what he needs to do and that is frighting him.. like frank says in the theater- why do you wearing that stupid man suit? frank explain donnie that he choose to see him as a monster.frank represents the wisdom that beyond. u can see frank also as a tear in donnie's heart donnie was so long in that box where he cant express his emotions until he "blow's out" you can say, and the only way to survive is break what around u break the rules. also frank say's to donnie- "wake up", wake up.. wake up from the box the society created for you, wake up- don't afraid to create, don't afraid to destroy. this movie show's to us how people go around them self all the time and they don't even notice, this movie give us any reason to believe in obsessions and fate, that movie show us that our fate is already set and we cant escape from it. frank already knows that he cant save donnie, he want at least that before he dies he shows what really stand's beyond all this. but what kelly show's us in the end that even if a man look that empty he can also cry and he also afraid and like donnie all the people are troubled in their own way, you cant really know somebody until u see him alone in his room. more or less this movie laugh about the American society, but still he kinda build in a American way that i find very disturbing with that movie, i think that this movie needs to show more dream like, kinda like "mulholland dr".but this movie shows perfectly loneliness and to be a stranger in school. and ross there plays marvelous and she is so sweet , i fall for her couple minutes after her first appearanceit is one of my 3 tops and i much prefer it from movies i would give them 10, but i gave IT nine cause it think it can be better for others who doesn't identify with the movie.for me it gets 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique story, masterfully done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a movie sets an off beat tone like this, the level of quality of the presentation makes it either a brilliant masterpiece or an incoherent mess. This one was expertly organized with generous doses of everything from sinister humor to philosophical and imaginative perceptions, and succeeds in becoming one of the masterpieces.This story is as rich as Fort Knox with symbolic metaphors, there's literally one at every moment of the film. You'll probably notice, in repeat viewings, new elements you hadn't noticed before. From blatant ones, such as Donnie's last name, to subtleties, such as who was on the plane when it lost its engine, they just keep on coming. The film will leave you considering its many meanings long after seeing it. Different people will take different messages from the story's many sub-plots; I suspect if you were to put 12 people in a room and have them write their interpretation of the film's meaning, you'd get 13 different responses. The well meaning motivations of Donnie and others that lead to destructive, rather than constructive, solutions is only one topic to analyze. How much of what we see is real or delusion? The acting is sensational; the entire cast become their respective roles, some of which are quirky and even bizarre. Jake Gyllenhall, is great in the title role, at times creepy, evil, heroic, psychotic, hypnotic, confused, introspective and so on. Just discussing his character alone can leave many opinions, I'll simply refer to him as an "anti-hero." What would seem at the outset as a film being weird just for the sake of being weird proves to be much more. This film could have been lazy and stereotyped one character to pick on, but it succeeds in rounding all its characters, their strong as well as weak points. A film well worth a viewing. Make that two, or three viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is one of those movies that you can watch once and say," oh yeah I get the whole movie." I've yet to see it more than once, but I talk about it with friends all the time. Donnie Darko really makes you think about yourself, the people around you, and your mind. The mind is a still a mysterious part of your body that can sometimes be unexplainable. To those of you who watch LOST and enjoyed the episode about how Desmond has "gone through time" this is the movie for you, because basically they took the whole idea of Donnie Darko and copied it, (which made me mad :D) If you want to see a movie that will mystify you until you see it about 10000000000 time, this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong: the Director's Cut is still an ... (searches for a charitable term) ... "interesting" film, but it really does attack much of what was interesting in the original. The idea of time travel only makes sense when you set reason aside, so, please, LEAVE IT ALONE! Back-filling with necessarily half-baked ideas is distracting. The book extracts read like some scripting artifact or plot out-lining device designed to 'set the mood' for actors and technicians; writing NOT designed for the AUDIENCE! ... Please, no one tell me that WAS the source of the prose .. that would simply be too sad ...And the "PURGE! PURGE!" and 'eye' additions were, as others have noted, just ... plain stupid. My charity gland is spent ... please retract the Director's Cut!Just don't watch it. Do yourself a favour and watch the original three times instead. No: seriously. The original is freaking awesome.*** SPOILER WARNING *** My theory is the entire film is an exploration of the last fleeting moment of the main character's lonely life as the engine crashes through his roof: there was no bunny etc. It was all the 'best dream he'd ever had'. He realises that even IF he had a companion, death is inevitable, and everyone dies alone (and you'll not feel more lonely than if the person you're with dies). All his heroic acts were musings on missed opportunity. All you can do is laugh at the paradoxical absurdity of existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director's cut made me lose respect for the film itself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently decided to introduce Donnie Darko to a couple of friends of mine, but the only available copy the movie store had was the director's cut. Having not seen it, I immediately assumed that it would be better than the theatrical version and would be great for first time viewers. I was wrong. Dead wrong. Not only did the director's cut pretty much scare away a crowd of about 15 first time viewers with its off-beat pacing and obnoxious super-imposed editing sequences, but it also scared away a long time Donnie darko fan. Many of the beautiful transitions and music sequences which were so crucial to the delivery and near aesthetic perfection in the theatrical version were gone. What was left instead was a less familiar Donnie Darko with repetitively clichéd editing techniques, unfamiliarly disjointed music sequences, and abrasively disproportional pacing that really took away the meaning that film once held for me. Now that I've seen what the director originally intended for the film to look like, I don't know if I'll ever be able to appreciate it the same way again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, well, well, where do i start with the best movie ever made? i think three words would describe it perfect, man's greatest creation. Donnie Darko is my number one movie, and i'm not the only one, it is ranked just above the one - hundred mark on IMDb's top 250 movies and is in the 50 movies you have to see before you die. What do i like about it so much? I'll tell you. First of all, Donnie. Donnie Darko. Just his name sounds like a superhero. His eeriness, his distance from his family, the one who really stands out in a crowd. He says what everyone else isn't willing to. He speaks the bitter truth, and sometimes, the future. Along with his humor and logical explanations, which is demonstrated in the Smurfs conversation he has with his friends, explaining, Smurfs could not have reproductive organism. Next, my favorite character, Frank the Anthropomorphic Bunny. What isn't there to love about this demonic creature. His face looks as if it was forged out of the pure stench of death. His eyes, those giant, glass eyes, and the ears, twisting hi above his face, and finally, his teeth, crooked and bucked as a man's when he rots his teeth out. but apart from his dark look, Frank has the most significant role, next to Donnie, throughout the movie. He first appears on October 2nd at Donnie's bedside. He later proceeds to tell him that the world will end in exactly 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds, which he speaks in his ever hellish tone. He guides Donnie throughout the movie, trying to help him save the world before the tangent universe destroys its self. He helps Donnie, he comforts him, he teaches him and even frightens him. I love Frank. Later, we find out that Frank is a Manipulated living, those who got the director's cut will now what i mean and we later meet living Frank as Donnie's older sister's boyfriend and he writes "Frank was her, went out to get BEER" on the fridge in the exact same handwriting Donnie writes "They mad me do it" on the school grounds. Next, is the camera angles, the lighting and the use of the deus ex machina eye, which shows us something in it each time that represents one of Donnies objectives, e.g, we see a flooded city which is reminiscent of Donnie flooding the school. Lastly, i love the way there are so many different interpretations and there are so many things unexplained, leaving you to make your own mind up. This movie truly is the greatest film ever made and probably will keep that title for a long, long time. It was so advanced for its time, and still is, and its no wonder it was a flop in the states, typical of our modern life; everything needs to be explained perfect. I hope the reader loves this movie as much as i do, but i think its pretty hard to beat my admiration for the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is one of the best and most thought-provoking movies that I have seen. Jake Gyllenhaal was perfect as the lead, as he has the dark, almost tortured and menacing face that suits Donnie's character perfectly. The movie, like the Butterfly Effect, shows how each action has a consequence and affects the people around you. Except, Donnie Darko goes further, at times exploring the possibility of taking different paths. This was only part of the movie, however. This is also one of the better movies to play around with the possibility of time-travel. The movie also holds so much meaning in the form of looking at the effect that one person can have on a number of people's lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic allegory of the impact of belief on reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie with many layers, and no two people will see the same story when they watch it. That is how it was intended for even the writer and director made it clear that options exist for interpretation. For me this is an allegory which reflects upon the role of how one's perspective on life is influenced by how one views God and the gods of science and religion. Michael Andrews music is superb and adds a depth worthy of this classic. Those who watch this movie as science fiction will enjoy it, because this movie is a science fiction classic. Alternate universes, time travel and the possibility that two alternate universes can impact each other are handled with a subtle brush that leaves open many interpretations. But when the movie is watched a second time, the science fiction is replaced with the notion of a mind game with each character reflecting an aspect of the human response to a world driven by religion, science and desire. The third viewing allows the two competing (and conflicting) views to interact in a strange way that gives this movie the depth that keeps bringing people back again and again. If you own only one movie, this would be a logical choice because you can watch it repeatedly and find something new each time.</fullReview>

Through out the film Donnie answers Franks requests by doing what he says, (Such as flooding the school), until the day comes of when the Tangent Universe opens up. This movie is a little twisted, and its also a type of movie that you have to watch a few times before you actually get the story line, but if you liked movies such as Final Destination, and the Sixth Sense, then you will love this one.

It is something different, and director Richard Kelly really does a remarkable job on directing. I think the directing is what makes the music. The soundtrack is awesome 80's, the casting fits perfectly (besides Drew Barrymore). Patrick Swayze, Mr. Dirty Dancing, is also in the movie, with an excellent character in Jim Cunningham (pervert to the extreme). There are a lot of undertones in the movie, such as, politics.

		<fullReview>I watched Donnie Darko with pretty high expectations. After all, look at the cast: Drew Barrymore, Jake Gyllenhaal, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Patrick Swayze, Jena Malone, etc. Well, this movie exceeded my expectations. This is NOT a movie for those who don't like to think during movies. Donnie Darko is about a troubled teen(Jake Gyllenhaal) who escapes a freak accident because of following a 6-foot tall demonic image of a bunny rabbit out of the house(yes, you read that correctly). Frank then tells him that in 28 days the world will end. Donnie begins to see Frank a lot and is convinced by Frank to commit a series of crimes. Important to the story is Donnie's girlfriend, Gretchen (Jena Malone). I can't tell you really anything else so I don't reveal any spoilers, except that the storyline also has to do with time travel. This is a psychological thriller that has quickly become my favorite movie. It is VERY different from the movies out there today. Being the girl I am, the ending made me cry. Loved it, excellent.</fullReview>

Apparently they did not have it, but they Did have it for sale. I bought the Director's cut version 2 disc special edition for $12.99$. When I got home I put it in my DVD set and was amazed. I loved this movie so much . The Acting was amazing and the storyline was ingenious. This is one of those cult classic movie that will never die out. I don't care if my parents hated it ( they usually watch boring old movies anyways ) I loved it. I think that my favourite part of the movie was......... well I really can't decide because the whole movie was amazing. This is a definite top 250 movie. And it should not be 100 it should be in the 10's along with all the other really good movies.I really enjoyed the song at the end of the movie (by the way in case you're wondering what it is it's called Mad World). Well I think that I've said everything that I could and I recommend this movie to anyone. man I can'believe my comment is not yet ready for submission. Well I gotta take up the space.

The rabbit also tells him to do other destructive behaviors and Donnie willing obeys this Rabbit named Frank. Along the way, Donnie also gets a girlfriend and tells his teacher where to put the lesson plan. I liked the part where the whole movie circles back around itself and wraps itself into a complete circle, blanketing into Donnie's madness.

		<shortDescription>Genre-Splicing, and Ambiguity Makes for A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" defies genre classification. At once it could be subsumed under the categories of Sci-Fi, Horror, Coming of Age, or even Tragi-Comedy.Donnie Darko is a complex character, transcending the clichéd "trouble teen" syndrome that has littered the movie landscape for so long. Is he a person with a mental disorder? Is he a genius? Madly creative? Or is young Darko some sort of Superhero? (I have my own view on which it is, but that would necessitate spoilers which I'm loathe to do here).Darko initially avoids catastrophe (an airline turbo-jet crashing down on his room) by being directed by a man in a rabbit costume (we're not talking Velveteen rabbit here - the costume is quite sinister looking). The man in the rabbit costume, Fred, is an enigma. Throughout the movie the audience must decide if he is a figment of Darko's imagination, or if his existence is "real" in the film's universe.Is Fred evil? He speaks that way, and compels Donnie to do some prima facie evil things. But are these "evil" deeds necessary to effect some greater (that is, morally "good") end? Like Darko himself, Fred's character is complex, and not fully resolved by the films' end. Is he a "saviour" executing God's will (yes, this film touches on the role of God in our lives on several occasions) or is he bent on destroying a vulnerable Schizophrenic (Darko)? For the questions I've heretofore raised it becomes apparent that one must watch this film to truly appreciate their significance. The film is so ambiguous that one must make his or her own mind up as to the film's proper interpretation. The plot leads down so many paths, that a concrete interpretation becomes a mugs game. But that is to the films credit, rather than to its detriment.That this film was shot with a budget of under 2 million dollars is miraculous. The soundtrack, and political/social references, are very evocative of its time and place - suburbia in the 1980s.Perhaps "Donnie Darko's" greatest contribution to cinema, is that it stands for the proposition that ambiguity in interpretation and genre splicing (to coin a phrase) are possible in American cinema.A great film. 9/10.Note: even on multiple viewings things do not become any less strange, or susceptible of less interpretations. To paraphrase literary critic Harold Bloom, a masterpiece of literature is to be recognized by its strangeness. If that is so, then Donnie Darko is a masterpiece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time travel meets teenage angst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This great film nicely tackles the old chestnut of time travel by slowly revealing details throughout the film, but it is not until you get to the end that you realise what's going on, and then you need to watch it all over again to check it out. No wonder it bombed at the box office, but took off finally in DVD format... and now is number 95 in the IDMB all time hit list. The new double DVD directors cut is the business, including an amazing art show based on the movie, and loads of extras.Richard Kelly (director/screen writer/artist) covers all the bases of teenage angst; teachers, parents, gurus, relationships, fat kids, bullies, religion (it's no surprise that the highest ratings for this film come from teenage girls). But in the end its a love story, and love conquers all.This is one of those films that demands several viewings, and much discussion. Surely it will be studied at film school ("Discuss the significance of rabbits"). Perhaps it was Richard Kelly's intention, having just left University of Southern California studying film only 3 years before shooting DD. In the director's over-dub, Richard Kelly states that once he decided on the end and beginning of the main plot, he then just filled the rest of the film with clues... and yes, they are there, waiting to be deconstructed by film buffs the world over. In HARVEY, the 1950's classic where James Stewart talks to an imaginary 6'7" rabbit, the advantages of his company are elaborated by Stewart... "Oh, yes! Yes. Yes - these things always work out just the way Harvey says they will. He is very, very versatile. Did I tell you he could stop clocks? Well, you've heard the expression 'His face would stop a clock'? Well, Harvey - can look at your clock and stop it. And you can go anywhere you like - with anyone you like - and stay as long as you like -- and when you get back -- not one minute will have ticked by".... coincidence? I think not. If I understand Richard Kelly, then he will love the connection even if he didn't plan it (but a film graduate probably had to study how Stewart made acting to an imaginary character seem natural).And of course the music is fantastic. The film made Gary Jules famous for his cover of the Tears for Fears classic "It's a mad world" .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware of the bunny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I have to say it's my No. 1 movie of all time.Donnie Darko has that *something* about it that makes it a truly great movie but what...A dysfunctional teenager played by Jake Gyllenhaal (Subsequently of Brokeback mountain) gets sucked into a surreal life trip, driven by a strange character in a six foot bunny outfit. Due to Donnie's psychological condition, rather than being phased, he greets the surreal with a level of matter of fact acceptance that a more balanced character would not. The Bunny informs Donnie that in 28 Days, ... the world will end. From here, the plot unfolds, introducing us to a wealth of rich characters that all interact and combine to shape the final outcome of the movie in a myriad of subtle ways.This film, from first time writer/director Richard Kelly blends a refreshing combination of non-stereotypical characters with an absorbing and intelligent storyline. While doing so however, the pace is mostly spot on with perhaps only the hotel scene really coming across as slow.The retro 80s soundtrack is well chosen, especially as it has gone on record that the choice of music was constrained by budget in some places. On top of this, the instrumental scores fit beautifully... The most notable examples come when Donnie embarks on the various tasks he "has" to complete. Of special note is when Donnie sits in the cinema talking to the rabbit. This is a fantastically dark scene combining atmospheric visuals with a haunting instrumental.The "Mad World" track, both words and score, over the final scenes of the film works so well, you could almost believe it was written for the film, were it not for Tears For Fears original version released many years before.An element of light comedic moments punctuate the darker undercurrent of the film. These however, never spoil the overall ambiance of the film as they mostly come in the form of sharp script and are executed well by the characters, never becoming overbearing.Perhaps the most enthralling aspect of this film comes on subsequent viewings. You can view the movie once, enjoy the soundtrack, the effective though not lavish visuals, the clean well defined characters and the 'superficial' story. After this viewing however, you're left hungry by the questions of what certain scenes meant, why characters did what they did and said what they said. This to me, is what makes it truly great. You go back again, and on the second viewing you understand some more, see things you never noticed the first time, and start to piece together a much deeper, more complex story. You see now, how actions and consequences inter-relate.Once you think you understand Donnie Darko, then I'd suggest looking at the forums here on IMDb, or look up one of the many fan sites for it on the internet and see how close you are to others interpretation of the story... It can be quite enlightening, and chances are... you'll want to watch it again, and again.I for one can't wait for his next project, Southland Tales.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a balanced scales of good and bad sides of a "cult movie".Richard Kelly, is a very young director that created (written and directed) a movie with a low budget and an interesting plot, so interesting that the film goes on and nothing happens, nothing involving happens, 'till the end where the great draw is disclosed.Kelly settled the story in October 1988. For the entire film I wondered WHY ? Is a simple Amarcord (as we were...) or it's a piece of the final puzzle ? Nothing. It should have been settled in 1938, in 1967 or in 1999 and nothing should've changed. Why ? Mystery !!The actors. Drew Barrymore and Jake Gyllenhaal (even Maggie) c'mon, aren't at all good actors !! Especially in 2001, when the Gyllenhaal brothers were pratically beginners. And, both actors are out of their role. Barrymore is too young even to play the role of a young teacher and Gyllenhaal is too "old" to play a teenager.I enjoyed the soundtrack, with a lot of my childhood hits of Tears for Fears, Duran Duran and Joy Division, and the piano-cover of Mad World by T.F.F. and some supporting actresses like the psychologist or the bigot teacher.Anyway I liked it, the two hours went by lightly - The countdown to the end of the world electrifies the spectators, but the end is down by the expectations. It's pretty good, but doesn't deserve to be in the top 100. This movie has the value to have launched the brothers Gyllenhaal and to be re-born like the Phoenix from the ashes (initially ignored, now a cult-movie).Donnie Darko hasn't the merit to be a "forerunner movie", it's clever and nothing more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Donnie Darko for the first time just a few days ago. Many of my friends has told me to see it, but I'm a bit sensitive about that.. I often DO judge a book by it's cover. Anyhow, I rented it, I saw it, and I fell completely in love! When I do rent movies, it's usually these easy-going comedy's, often starring Ben Stiller. But Donnie Darko is absolutely one of the best movies I have ever seen. Right now, it's on top of my favorite-list, right there with The Butterfly Effect. I liked Donnie Darko, because it's one of those movies you don't forget after rewinding your DVD. It takes time to process what you've seen, it makes a grand impact on your life in some way. For me, it can be anything; one look, one scene with a special light etc. In Donnie Darko, it was everything! The lighting in this movie gives a feeling of "normal" even though Donnie isn't. It gives an insight in how this guy's world looks like. I bet a lot of people, ones or twice, has felt a bit weird in some way. Like the Matrix; is this real? How do you define the truth? There is a unique universe inside of every mind, and Donnie's universe is really something. I find the story, the actors, the lighting, the filming, everything to be perfect. The feeling this movie provides is not going away that easily. It will haunt you, until you either learn to live with it, or it twists your mind around until it creates an own, personal Frank. See this movie! Unless you have some serious problems with reality, you will love it. //Lina</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible film - an enigmatic treat that throws up more possibilities each time you watch it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" is the very quintessence of cinema. Enigmatic, absorbing, humorous and thought-provoking - it is a film that throws up endless possibilities and debates, and ingeniously allows a whole range of interpretations that viewers might wish to pursue. There are many viewers who prefer films that provide immediate closure. In the minds of such viewers, films like "Donnie Darko" are unsatisfying or irritating or, worst of all, pointless. Then there are viewers who like to be challenged, perhaps even teased, by films. I would urge everyone - regardless of their usual preference - to give "Donnie Darko" a go. Even those who are usually dead against subjective and open-ended films of this kind will almost certainly find themselves questioning and pondering over what they have experienced. And those who revel in the mysterious, the enigmatic and the downright peculiar will absolutely LOVE this film.Troubled teenager Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) awakens on a mountain road on the morning of October 1st 1988, having either cycled there in his sleep (one interpretation), or as the result of being trapped in a month-long time loop that begins in that place and on that date (another interpretation). In the early hours of October 2nd 1988, Donnie is awakened from his sleep by a giant, grotesque bunny rabbit named Frank, who lures him away from his house to a nearby golf course and reveals to him details of the imminent end of the world. While he is out of the house, a plane engine mysteriously falls from the sky and smashes into Donnie's bedroom: bizarrely, there is no indication of where the engine fell from as no plane lost its engine in that area on that night. Having apparently cheated death as a result of his hallucinatory relationship with Frank, Donnie spends the rest of the month experiencing incredible, and often disturbing, events as time ticks inexorably towards Frank's terrifying deadline. Guided by Frank, he carries out irrational actions - such as burning down the residence of behavioural guru Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze). Each time, Donnie's actions - however mad or misguided they may seem - lead to worthwhile consequences (e.g Cunningham's house turns out to be the site of a child porn ring, which is uncovered when firefighters arrive to tackle the blaze started by Donnie). It eventually transpires that Donnie is living in a tangent universe which began on the night he evaded death in the plane engine accident., and only Donnie can set straight this potentially catastrophic time corruption.... even though it will mean sacrificing himself in the original October 2nd accident."Donnie Darko" is a superb film on so many levels. Richard Kelly directs the film with an incredible eye for striking detail and his script is full of quotable dialogue and inventive, philosophical ideas. The narrative, which seems initially confusing, is proved by repeat viewings of the film to be extremely clever. Even if repeat viewings never fully clear the confusion, the ingenuity of the story comes from the fact that it invites and supports several different readings of what the film is really all about. Nothing is made explicit, everything is left open, and for that reason the film remains a fascinating experience regardless of how often one re-watches it. The music and photography (by Michael Andrews and Steven Poster respectively) are brilliantly atmospheric and add yet more to the film's incredible bag of goodies. "Donnie Darko" is quite literally life-changing - a film like no other, and one of the very best movies of all-time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what to type. Honestly. This is just one of those movies you have to see for yourself.Its also one of those movies that to fully get it, you have to see it more than once. Its a brilliant film, but a bit confusing.Well, the plot may sound stupid, and if it hadn't been as brilliantly executed, it probably would have been. But its brilliant. I am going to attempt to explain it. Here goes...A giant rabbit (no kidding) comes to proclaim the end of the world (no kidding) to troubled teenager Donnie Darko. Then, an aeroplane engine crashes into his bedroom while the rabbit is proclaiming the end of the world. (no kidding. Donnie then is able to see peoples 'paths', (represented as a long tube in front of the person, showing where they are going to go next) and is able to deny his own path. Confusing eh? This is a movie I can't explain any more. The rest has to be seen for yourself. Don't go in expecting a fully blown horror movie or any type of film with a straightforward, easy to understand plot. Because this film is really deep. Thought provoking, captivating, mesmerising and moving, this is a work of genius. This isn't the sort of film you can just watch casually though. You have been warned....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original but difficult movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" is a movie that remains difficult to understand. Everybody has his own interpretation of the ending and the story in general. That is a good thing. Everyone looks at this movie differently in his own way, which makes "Donnie Darko" an unique movie.It's a good first long featured movie for director Richard Kelly. Still I didn't liked it as much as everyone else seems to do. The movie has some odd moments and almost nothing is explained. Everything is left to the viewer his own interpretation and imagination, which seems like a lazy but of course also original way of movie making. The story is good but there are several missed opportunities, such as the whole time traveling element of the movie that is hardly used at all.There are some good actors in the movie. Jake Gyllenhaal is a good leading man but even better are the supporting actors played by well known actors Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore and Noah Wyle.In my opinion the movie is still overrated. Just because it's original and 'odd', doesn't make a movie brilliant. It's professionally made all and well written but not everything is making sense and the movie makes little effort in making the movie its story understandable.I can give my own interpretation of the movie and its story and try to explain everything about that but in my opinion that would be useless. Just watch this movie and form your own ideas and interpretation of the movie, since everyone will have a different opinion and interpretation of it. It certainly is a thought provoking movie that is worth watching.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An impressive coming of age story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion there are two types of writing. Controlled Writing where the superego controls the pen. The other is where the imagination (the id) takes over. This was id writing. Uncontrolled, wild and chaotic.In many instances this type of writing doesn't work - its energetic and vibrant, but without focus it just winds up a mess.This film makes it work however for the following reasons.This is the tale of a young man, a 'coming of age' story, and the story of most young men are tinged with wildness and chaos. Thus the premise and themes fit perfectly with the wildly imaginative way in which the story was told.It speaks to young men in the way a good 'coming of age' story is meant to. Its rare, I can only think of a few films that do it well: Good will hunting, fight club, star wars and now donnie darko. I'm in my mid 20s and looking back, the fear, distress and sheer confusion of teenage life is always a brilliantly painful experience. But this distress (the movie fight club refers to it as the "great depression") is incredibly heightened in this film due to the sense of impending doom that Donnie feels throughout. Thus i ask you :Is this not the way all of us were feeling post 9/11 ?Its timing was perfect. A simple message powerfully expressed to me is the height of great writing. Everyone understands a simple point and everyone (no matter their education/literacy) can be moved by it.Now here are the Cons:OK so he stole the rabbit from alice in wonderland/the matrix and the time travel discussion is pretty juvenile, but then what talk amongst teenagers isn't? If they spoke like college professorsa) the characters don't seem like realistic teensb) you lose your target audienceThe director's cut honestly sucked major ass. It showed that the director is a little clueless about effective ways of film-making. they took out some of the great songs that made the original really gel and replaced them with a classical score in parts that clearly didn't work. Also some weird kiddy kaleidoscope images were thrown in that were a fake ass attempt to look like the closing images of 2001 a space odyssey. The directors cut was a travesty that should not have been allowed. An obvious attempt to make some quick cash based on this film being a huge hit at the video rentals arena (it didn't do any business on the screen 1st time around). I think the directors cut version should be burned.But hes still young and allowed to make mistakes. As are we all. I'm looking forward to his future work. This film may be a "one hit wonder", or it might not. But no pun intended - only time will tell.</fullReview>

The story is very clever, but is difficult to follow if you don't give it your full attention.Rarely will you see a film as good as Donnie Darko, but i must stress that this film could easily be discarded as rubbish if you are not ready for its complexity and depth.Perfectly cast and with very few (if any) plot holes this is a film that toys with time incredibly effectively.A firm 9/10 If you like the idea but not the execution then try 'The Butterfly Effect' it is inferior to this, but more linear in its approach . 'Frequency' is another worthy of your attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Philosophical Snake Oil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is it that as a society, the high brow amongst us become giddy with excitement when they discover something they don't understand, but believe that meaning within that something must exist.Donnie Darko is a film that throws out metaphors, symbolism, iconography, and semiotics like a garage sale. Everything is just thrown onto trestle tables for the neighborhood to pick over,take what they want, and discard the rest.The major flaw is that the film was written and directed by the same individual. It strikes me that Richard Kelly should have handed the reigns to the adults. Everything had an off kilter cartoony element to it, not quite of our world. It reminded me a little of a Steinbeck novel. Where all the characters are stereotypical constructs of an author who has limited practical knowledge of the world and its base elements. The film seems to be a pastiche of "The seventh sign", "The sixth Sense", and "American Beauty". What is most galling about films like "Donnie Darko" is that the audience are so dizzy, disoriented, and torqued up that they are frightened witless to admit that they didn't follow many plot points at all. And they are then too unsure of themselves to blame a poor script, or 'happenstance' plot elements for their confusion. The pathetic witless fools try even harder to find 'hidden' meaning and hide behind the mantra "the author has left the film open to individual interpretation". Well I can interpret it for you, it goes something like this "Waffle, waffle, waffle, baffle, red herring, happenstance, twist, waffle, bible, baffle, amateur psychology, half baked scientific claptrap read at doctors waiting room from a dog-earred copy of the American Science Monitor, break in the films time continuum, waffle, more bible, simplistic cultural elements like smurfs, lifestyle gurus, the end".What if Jackson Pollocks "Blue Poles" was simply a case of an unskilled man flicking drops of paint on a canvas and then attaching method and meaning. What if Bjork really is just an eccentric, borderline manic depressive who has no technical skill and hides behind weirdness and intrigue. And what if "Donnie Darko" is just a rambling anecdote of amateur theatrics, psychology, and philosophy hoping to hoodwink another town into buying its philosophical snake oil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusion from the cutting room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Region 4 DVD release of Donnie Darko contains more compelling material in the "deleted and expanded scenes" section than the feature. Here we find parts of a puzzle that explains much about the probable intentions of the writers and director. What a mess! There are concentric subplots involving a link between Frank the rabbit as a boyfriend of Donnies Sister, discussions over the subtext of Watership Down and some illumination on Karen Pomeroys' deeper beliefs over the misdirection of students by faculty and parents. From the cutting room we are left with an incomplete and oblique story that allows more latitude for the viewer to interpret(or be confused by) the message assumed to be contained therein. This is where I can get off the fence and state clearly that the misuse of common, adolescent male isolation fears and confusion, mixed with some slick "liquid metal" effects and gibberish about portals and time travel does nothing but make Pop-Culture Pulp. Go watch Repo Man or Being John Malkovich for more stylish and capable presentations of similar theories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely worth watching, it has some extremely dark moments (pun intended) along with highly humorous situations. I especially loved the character of the so-called motivational speaker, along with his middle-aged religious nutball crazy housewife believers.Donnie himself is played very well. He's a highly intelligent kid who gets thrown into a very weird situation involving a temporal anomaly ... what happens for the next month just doesn't make any sense to him but he manages to glue all the parts together towards the end.Actually explaining anything about this movie before you see it could really spoil it. For me, it came on the Super Channel here in Tokyo and I had never seen it before - I was pleasantly surprised.I guess the comparison to make would be with 12 Monkeys - if you didn't understand or enjoy the time-jumping shenanigans in that film, you won't like it in Donnie Darko.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko isn't merely a bad film but a genuine stinker. It's animated by the kind of sophomoric musings contemplated by kids sitting around a dorm room smoking pot late at night. Instead of a plot it offers merely a series of puzzles. (What's with the guy in the bunny suit? Will the world really end in 28 days? Is Donnie really schizo?). Instead of character development it offers the touchstones of adolescent angst that movies geared to teens have plumbed for generations (the school bully, the inept grownups who run the school, uncool outcasts and so on).That IMDb users could rate it so highly is a sad commentary on the state of our culture. But then again, these are presumably the same people who think The Shawshank Redemption (#2) is a better film than say, Shadow of a Doubt (#185).If you don't believe me when I tell you how bad this film is you could always see it for yourself and form your own opinion. But don't say I didn't warn you: You're risking an hour and 53 minutes of your life you'll never get back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>every few years you get a movie that doesn't do very well yet far surpasses everything that people and critics, and Donnie Darko is one of them. this is probably my new favorite movie, and it's certainly one of the best movies in the last 10 years. Donnie Darko combines three elements, dram comedy and science fiction. now usually movies like this suck horribly, but instead of trying to force all three types to work at the same time, but this movie gives you the intense drama, some breathing room with some really funny parts, and than gives you some scientific bits that are really interesting.jake gyllenhaal was perfect for the roll of Donnie Darko. he is truly one of the best actors of this generation. jena malone also does a great job as Donnie's love interest who has her own set of problems (seems like most of her characters do). this is also a very clever movie. it gives you a lot to think about, and it is one of those endings where you could argue with some one about possible outcomes for a long time. one thing that i really liked was the humor. it is really unique, because the funny parts generally come in a serious setting (like the line above was delivered by Donnie's spastic gym teacher who is upset by the fact that donnie told her to shove a book up her ass).every person i have watched this with has loved it. i think it's just one of those movies that most people like, yet not many know of it. i guess if this movie had been over promoted that it wouldn't have that sort of independent feel to it. i usually hate 80's music, but the song 'mad world' worked very well at the end. an all around great movie. i recommend it to everyone. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunately, this bunny rabbit leaves no eggs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a nice little scene in "Donnie Darko" where his girlfriend reflects upon his full name. "Sounds like a superhero," she muses. Donnie gives her a sly glance and quips, "Who's to say I'm not?"Indeed. And by the movie's end, we're left to question whether or not Donnie really is such a savior. At least I did. In fact, I did a lot of questioning at the end of this picture. Not the good kind, either--born of wonder and amazement, but the bad kind: spawn of frustration and delirium.The year is 1988, and Donnie Darko is a dorky, reclusive, temperamental teenager growing up in a typical dorky, reclusive, temperamental teenager environment. He deals with bullies at school, falls for the pretty new girl, fights with his caring, concerned family at home, and desperately tries to understand the life he's been given. Oh, and as our story opens, he begins to receive regular visits from a nightmarish overgrown bunny rabbit from the future named Frank.Frank reveals that the world is about to end and the only person that can prevent it is Donnie. Thus begins his quest to unravel a mystery that includes a 100 year old woman named Grandma Death, a new age spiritual evangelist who preaches about love vs. fear, a mysterious book called "The Philosophy of Time Travel", and two young school teachers who seem perfunctory at first but then take particular interest in Donnie.I love movies that toy with my mind, confusing the hell out of me while promising understanding and sometimes, by the movie's end, delivering revelation. "Jacob's Ladder" ranks among my favorite films of all time. And even when "The Ninth Gate" failed to deliver a satisfactory ending, it worked for me nonetheless because I so enjoyed the journey.But "Donnie Darko" seems to think 1 out of 3 is enough. It's not. With every dark scene, every social satire, every equitable performance, this movie promises greatness. But that's all. The ending is simply another enigmatic scene. I wish I could say that the sum of its parts makes up for it, but it doesn't. There are moments where you brace yourself and smile and think: okay, here it comes, here's where it all falls into place!But, unfortunately, this bunny rabbit leaves no eggs.2 OUT OF 4 STARS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually feel quite sick when I think back at the times before I had seen this movie and I also feel sick at the fact that I had not seen this earlier. I saw this movie in August 2010, nine years after the release date of the movie. I had no idea what it was about, no idea what I was getting into, I simply wrote down a list of moves I had to see and this one happened to be first on the list. I was expecting your simple modern day drama about an upset teen with a love interest. Little did I know what I was about to embark on. This movie has it all. Hallucinations, Time Travel, Comedy, Horror, Romance you name it. The characters are so deep and interesting, it makes me sad that I will never see a better movie. Richard Kelly (director) obviously reviewed every scene thoroughly and did not make one loophole, mistake or anything for the audience to complain about. I watched the directors cut first and I would stress others do so also, but I don't think the ending effect of the movie differs between editions. 6 months onwards from seeing this movie, I must have watched it 12 times, I am constantly quoting this movie subconsciously and thinking about making other similar movies. This truly has inspired me to become a filmmaker and with my commitment to Sparkle Motion let's hope I do so. Ending result : See this movie, if it's the last thing you do I don't care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different type of Science fiction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard that this film was "different" so when I saw the DVD on offer a while back I thought I'd give it a chance. It certainly was different and in a good way, I was gripped from start to finish due to the combination of an interesting story, great acting and direction and a well chosen sound track.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie Darko, a troubled teenager who has a vision of somebody, called Frank, in a strange rabbit costume who tells him that the world will end in twenty eight days. The next morning he wakes up to find himself on the local golf course, this is rather lucky for him as during the night an engine that fell off a plane crashed through the roof of his house and destroyed his bedroom. The accident is rather mysterious in that no plane has crashed or lost an engine, in fact the serial number of the engine matches one that is still attached to an aircraft. When he returns to school he soon befriends new girl Gretchen Ross he also floods the school one night at Frank's behest. As the twenty eight days pass more and more strange things happen and Donnie gets more and more interested in the possibility of time travel. I won't say more about the plot as I wouldn't want to spoil it too much.Some people think this isn't science fiction presumable because it doesn't feature high-tech gadgets, space travel, robots or other sci-fi standards, I think it is though as things happen which couldn't happen in normal life; such as the engine falling from the sky yet still being attached to a plane and other things which are revealed towards the end of the film.While it is Jake Gyllenhaal who carries the film mention must also be made of the other excellent cast members, including Jena Malone as Gretchen, Drew Barrymore as his English teacher, Mary McDonnell as his mother and Patrick Swayze as Jim Cunningham a rather creepy maker of inspirational films who lives locally. Richard Kelly does a great job of directing the story which he also wrote.This review is based on the original cinema version of the film, I can't compare it to the director's cut as I've not seen that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is fantastic. I saw it last year for the first time, and it changed the way i look at film. Every time I see it, it gets better and better.Richard Kelly chose probably the best collection of actors and actresses that he could have. Each one completely takes their role in, so that you feel like you are not watching a movie, but watching real life happen through a window. The best, in my opinion, were Jake Gyllenhaal, and Jena Malone, who played Gretchen. Their chemistry was brilliant. the sibling rivalry between Donnie and Elizabeth Darko was incredible, Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal were phenomenal. The actors seem like they were created for that part.The story line presented is at first a little confusing. Universes and rabbits can make things confusing in a story like this, but it is not meant for mere entertainment, but to think on. I would write more, but I do not want to give anything away.Richard Kelly did such an amazing job directing. His vision is clearly presented and there's not too much too say and still serve it justice.This movie is a must see, if you do not like it, that is fine, but still a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Deep and Well-Crafted Film that Needs to be Viewed More Than Once</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw it for the first time last night and I have to say I was impressed. Richard Kelley does an astonishing job for his first film, I look forward to seeing more of his movies in the future. 'Donnie Darko' is a film filled to the brim with such intriguing ideas, original plot turns, extraordinary visuals and riveting acting. Jake Gyllenhaal is outstanding in the lead, and the ensemble cast consisting of a humorous Patrick Swayze, a surprisingly solid Drew Barrymore and an always remarkable Jena Malone is first-rate. The only part that confused me was the ending. I'm not saying it was bad, it was just very unclear. I've been told if I watch the movie again a couple of times I'll have a better understanding of it. I recommend this to anyone who appreciates innovative film-making. Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brief...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After coming across 'Donnie Darko' several times while it was airing on cable, or something, I pretty much believed that it was something stupid since I always caught the scenes where all the kids are waiting at the bus stop and they always seemed to be teasing some girl, and I ultimately never stuck with it. But then, after coming across it at my local video store, I was surprised to see that it featured Drew Barrymore...and Patrick Swayze! Hmm. Odd. Where has he been? Anyway, I've read almost all of the reviews on this sight and I personally would find it exhausting and pointless to summarize the plot of this title...so I won't. What I will say is that 'Donnie Darko' is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I believe that no one should miss it. Seriously. DON'T miss this one.10/10 is my vote. Have fun with it. It's definitely on my top ten list for 'best films of all time'. Open your mind a little before you watch it, though. ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an explanation much simpler than most imagine?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie, and its' plot, can be much simpler (and full of sense) than most seem to imagine. and if it has a perfect sense, a good explanation, and a reason behind all the plot, than I believe it cannot be other than as follows: in the end, Donnie chooses to die (that is obvious). why? because, if not, the whole "path" presented to him (and to us) would lead to much worse (death, of his girl, of his mother and little sister, of frank). there are also some good parts that come along that path (I choose the word "path", but it could be called any other way - variant, alternative etc.), as, for example, the exposure of the child pornographer, and even the short love story between Donnie and the girl). but, obviously, the "goods" do not even closely match the "wrongs". so, Donnie chooses consciously what everyone else with a conscience would, meaning his death instead of all the wrong things that would come on the alternative he is presented with. and his choice is not an anomaly in itself, that's what the movie is trying to say. for that, the key lies in the short talk between Donnie and his physics teacher, when he says that changing the future is not wrong, as long as it is still on God's way (I can't remember the exact quote, but I recall that was the meaning). the rest, the "time travel" philosophy is of course unconvincing from a scientific point of view, but that does not necessarily count, as it can be seen as only a metaphor. and, also, "the world coming to an end" does not have to mean "the whole world", but maybe Donnie's world. he saves his world through personal sacrifice. that is of course not scientifically possible, and there remain lots of unexplained questions about how it is possible, but I must repeat that this is not the point, that a perfectly logical explanation is not necessary in art, or else we should renounce on every metaphoric form of expression.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Directors cut provides a guide to the artistic accomplishment that is Donnie Darco</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These two different films have two different consequences. The original film is completely bewildering, but in such a way that as the credits roll through, you squint your eyes and gaze off in the distance, but your mouth slowly curls into a silly open mouthed smile. There is somehow a sense of satisfaction in the confusion this movie creates. With the original, you need to explore the book pages on the DVD extras and the website may be helpful. The directors cut is a little different. The philosophical statements come across a little more clearly. The pace of the directors cut was enjoyable to me. Somehow I felt as though the questions i had were able to develop more and really simmer as the movie progressed, whereas there is so much momentum in the original cut that it felt a little rushed. So here is my comparison of the two: Original Cut is a great artsy confusing conversation piece that can entertain your thoughts for days. The Directors Cut is a little more straightforward, less questions are left unanswered. I recommend watching both, but at least a week apart</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" is well-written, with a medley of humor, tragedy, and clues that keep the viewer guessing. The plot was engaging, but the ending was a little disappointing. However, I feel this ending was the only credible way the movie could have ended without drastically lowering ratings.The Darko clan is interesting and reminiscent of the Addams family. Donnie, our protagonist, displays wisdom at odd times, rebelliousness whenever necessary, his psychotic side at pivotal moments, and teenage angst everywhere else. The Darko parents have a very strange sense of humor, and are very fun to watch. Donnie's sisters seem to be normal post/pre-adolescents, but still entertain the audience. The characters, even the minor ones, are also believable. Donnie's friend, Gretchen, is supportive and loving. Donnie's English teacher, Ms. Pomeroy, is informative and very cryptic. His phys. ed. teacher, Mrs. Farmer, is the epitome of awful teachers around the world. Donnie's science teacher, Dr. Monitoff, is resourceful, but a little too inhibited. His therapist, Dr. Thurman, is hard to describe; she is a gentle person, but she contributes eerie comments during her hypnotherapy sessions. There is also Jim Cunningham, a motivational speaker whom Donnie deems "the Antichrist." Lastly, there's Donnie's imaginary friend, Frank, the "six-foot-tall bunny rabbit." He is arguably the most mysterious character. Frank appears at frightening moments and delivers strange advice. He also takes control of Donnie while he sleeps and forces Donnie to do rather interesting actions.Because the movie does not solve some issues on its own, I recommend that viewers watch the movie (especially the Director's Cut) at least twice in order to understand everything. A major plot point is a book entitled "The Philosophy of Time Travel." Throughout the movie, certain passages from the book are displayed on screen, and it is the viewer's job to piece these passages together and solve all the mysteries. It's a perfect rainy day activity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slightly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly a good movie. This movie is interesting to watch throughout all of it. Interesting plot, very good pace and great actors. Specially Jake Gyllenhaal that makes a very convincing performance of his not so easy character. Plus the support of some more known actors like Mary Mcdonnell, that plays awesome, Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze in good performances.The main idea of the movie is maybe not an original one, but it's execution is definitely different from anything that is done before. The main disadvantage of this movie is that it comes in a period of lots of other movies like it: Sixth Sense, Memento, Frequency, Butterfly Effect, Mulholland Drive, Identity, Heaven(1998) and probably some more. All these have non-standard storytelling and most of them have twist in the end. Which makes all of them better than average ( maybe except Identity) but naturally not equal among themselves. Donnie Darko also has shortcomings in inconsistency of the plot. No major holes, and nothing noticeably disturbing but after the end twist some question arise, and some remain unanswered.My personal subjective opinion places Donnie Darko below Frequency, which is far more breathtaking and compelling, Sixth Sense, whose twist is far more shocking and the plot is much more consistent and Mulholland Drive, that has superb storytelling, wonderful soundtrack and a down to earth realistic story. Not impressive as those three but better than most like it and far better than any average movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>***fantastic - great film***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a normal everyday teenager; well, he was until a jet engine crashed into Donnie's house and triggers a parallel world, which will end in 28 days. Frank, a 6 ft tall rabbit is sent to warn Donnie of the end of the world and help guide Donnie into a position where he will send the engine back through time, which will close the parallel time frame and save the world. Donnie meets a girl called Gretchen (Jena Malone), who has moved into the neighbourhood and has been put in the same class as Donnie; Donnie takes an immediate like to her. Frank manipulates Donnie into burning down a man's house which, means that Donnie's mum has to take his sister to a dancing competition. To get to the location of the competition they must go by plane, which leaves the plane in the correct position to deposit its engine into the black hole. As the climax begins to unfold Donnie unwittingly gets Gretchen killed, and realises his mother and sister will also die if he doesn't close up the black hole. At the end of the film Donnie kills Frank. Closing the black hole means that Donnie will sacrifice his own life, saves Gretchen from being killed, he doesn't burn down Cunningham's (Patrick swayze) house so that means that his mother and sister aren't on the plane (the other mother has taken them). He also doesn't kill Frank and everybody wakes up on what would have been the 1st of October (the beginning of the film) to news that Donnie has been killed by the jet engine that landed in his room.Although the film has a very complex plot, it has you gripped from beginning to end. "Donnie Darko" is not a film that you can categorise into just one type of genre, its thrilling, it's full of fantasy, the whole film is a mystery, its got drama within it and also sci-fi. The film has a very interesting ending; it goes round in a circular motion, the more the film moves on the closer you get back to the beginning, so by the end of the film you are back to where you started, in this case back at Donnie's house when the engine crashes in to Donnie's bedroom. All the answers to the ending to of film are there you have just got to look hard to find them. This is not a film I would recommend to anyone who likes to lay back and just watch a film without having to do much thinking. The film was made in America which suggests that it's going to be a happy ending and everything will work out fine. This to some extent is true but however it's not for Donnie who dies. The movie was set in 1988 and take place over a period of 28 days. "Donnie Darko" proved popular with the teenage audience. This is because the film is about teenagers and their life at secondary school, which a teenage audience can relate to. Many people stereotype teenage films into that they are all sex, or "lovey-dovey" but when the release of "Donnie Darko" came about this all changed. "Donnie Darko" is a film which is similar to "back to the future" and if people give the film a chance would appeal to an older audience as well. This movie is beautifully made, considering the budget was a mere $4.5 million. Richard Kelly the writer and director of this film were only 26 when this film hit the theatres in October 2001. Throughout the film there are many interesting use of special effects. The one that stands out to me the most is when Donnie is in the bathroom taking his medication and Frank appears, as Donnie reaches out his hand is stopped by a rippling sheet of 'glass'. Frank repeats this process and the same happens to him. This stands out to me the most because its something you don't expect to happen and I like things to surprise me. Donnie also starts to see "wormholes" coming out of people's chests, seeming to psychically illuminate where they are going in the immediate future. It's an eye-opener for Donnie and it leads him into the field of time travel. These "wormholes" look like tubes of water and they are located in the stomach of the people he looks at, they move also the air and "take" the person to where they want to go."Donnie Darko" has a questionable climax (all the answers are in the film but many people choose not to look for clues) but I think it is in keeping with the movie's theme of how unexplained events can change a person, if not a whole family, even a small town. Donnie Darko is on to something - he is searching for meaning in life and in the universe (he has an interest in time travel). His girlfriend, Gretchen is searching for peace and beauty in the world. It is rare in movies today to see young people engaged in such rational thoughts. That is part of what makes "Donnie Darko" so refreshing. With all these concepts taken into account I would say that "Donnie Darko" is one of the best films I have ever seen and I would certainly recommend it to others if they haven't already seen this masterpiece, especially since it was quite a low budget film and it has still managed to have an impact on the audience with the special effects, which you would not usually expect from a film of this amount.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done Richard Kelly. I think you've done it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am studying media studies and have been asked to study this film for my examinations....Well, there are supposed to be negative connotations to any exam material I have to study but this one isn't.Donnie Darko, a story about a teenage boy, who depending on your view, is experiencing hallucinations or is ahead of time. An unusual concept of time-travel, which has been experienced in the past but not quite like this, set in an unusual time zone of the 1980s. The reason I say its an unusual time zone is because the 1980s is very recent history and not many films set them selves in history that recent. It's genius.This film is a masterpiece, it makes the audience search for the answers by watching it a second and perhaps a third time. Also it's one of the few films that I don't think can ever be remade, or at least to the same standard. With the clever use of CGI, using just enough to tell the story that it isn't overloaded with the special effects.The acting is the root of the story, the actors provide the anchor in the surrealism. Jake Gyllenhaal and Jena Malone are superb in their portrayal of teenagers of the 1980s, their characters are quite obscured also.It is an interesting film to watch, you'll remember it whether you liked it or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The way I see it, the whole film develops thru the last few seconds of poor Donnies life. About 5 minutes in the film he is lying in bed, nothing but bad relationships, nothing but a bad history and the last word he utters to his mum is "bitch".However, after the argument with his mother he takes his medicine, which stops him from walking around at night he sleeps like a baby in bed.Then he is killed by a fallen object. And in the pico seconds before he dies he invents the rest of the movie - a good relationship with his family - he even chuckles and have a drink with his father agreeing that everybody else are bastards (something that would never happen in Donnie Real Life) - and all in all, the whole world focuses in on Donnie just before he dies. This way, his sorry little life can end with a feeling that he is giving life to other people. If he Don't die, other people will, so really he is pure chivalry.Well, just my 50 cents, i gotta know if anybody else had the same experience? Great film - uh ! Frederik Oh by the way, I have never seen a Directors Cut which was better than the original. Dunno why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the theatrical version, buy the director's cut instead!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Minor spoiler noted at bottom of review) The following is a comparison review for both DVD versions of the movie. Whereas almost everyone seems to see the theatrical version as the superior cut, i couldn't disagree more. The director's cut is superior in every way. It isn't a chopped up mess that just seems like random events are happening like the theatrical cut. Many people would argue that they understand/understood the theatrical version on their own, but i doubt that. It makes no sense whatsoever. The only way to grasp some understanding on the theatrical version was to read an online 'philosophy of time travel' book. When you have to read something online just to understand a movie, you know something is horribly wrong. A viewer shouldn't have to spend hours on end to understand one movie, nor study an online entity that is separate from the actual movie. The director's cut, on the other hand, makes near perfect sense, and everything falls into place (as a movie should) and INCLUDES the important 'Philosophy of time travel' book pages into the movie. Like i said, the movie may not necessarily make complete sense on the first viewing, but upon the second or third viewing, the movie will make pretty much complete sense. After that, it's fun to watch over and over to catch all of the little clues strewn throughout the movie. The director's cut also contains many satisfying family moments between Donnie and/or family, and many other story-crucial scenes which should not have been cut in the first place. Scenes like this flesh out the movie. The theatrical version doesn't have these and it just ends up making the movie feel rather stale. I wish movie studios would learn to back off and not to require a movie to be cut up just so more people can watch it in theater. That's really ignorant. A movie should always be ONLY cut to the best of it's full potential, not cut for more people's butts in theater seats. And the theatrical version suffers horribly from this. As for the music changes from the theatrical version to the director's cut version: while i didn't like the changes at first, the director's cut quickly grew on me and the music changes in are ultimately better. While the 'killing moon' song does go good in the beginning of the theatrical version, i disagree with it because the words in the song give away what the movie is about way too soon. The theatrical version DVD transfer suffers from dirt poor sound quality compared to the director's cut DVD. The sound on the director's cut DVD is superb. The bass is good, sounds and music are clear and sharp, and the picture seems to be slightly clearer and more refined. Theatrical version DVD: PROS: -Good extras/special features including 2 audio commentaries CONS: -Movie makes very little sense (if any sense at all) -Poor sound and picture quality -Vital plot elements and scenes are missing -Doesn't include the time travel book in the movie (it is in special features, but is way too small to read, so it is useless.) Other: -1 DVD -So-so DVD case artworkDirector's cut DVD: PROS: -Makes sense (Finally!) -Good picture and GREAT sound quality -Vital scenes are included -Nicely enhanced special effects sequences -Includes the story-crucial time travel book IN the ACTUAL movie -Hilarious '#1 fan Darkomentary' -1 audio commentary Other: -2-disc DVD set -Cool DVD case artwork and slipcoverCONS: -Some of the time travel pages pass by too quickly to read completely, resulting in having to rewind/pause the movie to read them. PRO: After reading them the first or second time(s), you'll already know what they say next time you watch the movie so you won't have a reason to pause or rewind the movie anymore as you can just glance at them and know what they say.Theatrical version: 6.0 out of 10Director's cut: 9 out of 10Theatrical version/director's cut DVD sound comparison example: (Minor spoiler warning)When Donnie is in the therapy room and tells the doctor than Frank the rabbit is "RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME!", the theatrical DVD sound is very bland but the director's cut DVD sound for this is crisp and chilling!Closing comments: I was never a fan of the movie until the director's cut came out(i bought it on release day), now i love the movie. Thanks to the director and everyone else responsible for putting this director's cut DVD set together!</fullReview>

Having being told it was 'thought-provoking' and 'an amazing movie' i found myself annoyed by the utter nonsense that was being delivered. It felt like the writer had created the weirdest story who could possibly come up with then desperately tried to find meaningful messages to explain it. This movie was obviously aimed at impressionable youths who try to impress people who ask their favourite movie by coming up with something obscure and weird, something with 'meaning'. The kind of people that have inevitably made this film a 'cult classic'. Which is a shame, because it is neither weird enough nor clever enough nor obscure enough to be given this title.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I decided to see this movie some weeks ago, after having read many positive reviews on it, and in the end I was terribly disappointed. While its not a really bad movie, is has some nice touches, the whole just seem to be too incoherent, just like the director didn't know in what style he should make this film, and tried to do some kind of mixture; a mixture that fails on most levels (for me, at last).The most annoying for me was the forced 80's setting. I mean, apart from the clothes, it had a whole lot of crappy 80's music... 80's pop music sucked big time, and I see no real purpose to why fill a serious film with this kind of music... So if you're annoyed by 80's music, just like me, then avoid this movie, 'case it will drive you to madness.I won't say much about the story, it's not very challenging, it's rather easy to follow if you can use your brain a little bit. I had a feeling that they tried to make it seem complex by adding themes like "time travel", "end of the world" to the mixture, but again it felt forced and some of these things just sounded ridiculous.The acting wasn't that bad, except for the lead role... This guy could be the actual "teen idol", but it is so obvious that his acting skills are not nearly complete. He just stares and tries to make *confused* faces all over the movie, he was really bad.Since the movie is dealing with teenage problems in much sreentime, I think only teenagers can resonate with it totally, and they are the ones who's trying to make this flick into a cult movie... If you're making a compassion with David Lynch's movies, well, Lynch's work is much more exciting for adults... Teenagers can settle for less, what Donnie Darko is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i've seen donnie darko several times and i think the time travel questions in the movie are incidental. i think the entire movie is basically donnie realizing he's going to die and him fighting his fate. he is shown, through the characters in the movie, what could happen if he chooses not to die. i also think there's his fear of dying alone without wrapping up the loose ends of his life that has made him create the distraction of time travel to try and explain the unexplainable. i think the characters in the alternate universe are symbolic of his fears and questions about life and he's trying to resolve those fears and questions before he actually dies. that's why i think he laughs at the end....b/c he was able to resolve the loose ends and die without regret.my simple theory does not answer several questions though.......part of it is we have no idea what donnie's life was like before the jet engine crashed through his room. so all of the people in the alternate universe are probably people he had some sort of relationship with previous to the start of the movie and that's how they play certain roles in the alternate universe. i don't think there was any literal time travel happening. i think the time travel story line was just donnie trying to explain the unexplainable; i.e. the mystery of death. i think the time travel storyline was created by donnie. i think frank was symbolic to donnie of his fate. i also think the portals that came from several characters during the movie are symbolic of that person's soul or their path through life. oh yeah, and i also think that donnie shoots frank at the end of the movie b/c he realizes that the universe was not real but all in donnie's head just before he's to die.i loved the symbolism throughout the entire movie and wonder about some of them: when the two teachers are in the lounge and the male teacher says "donnie darko?" and drew barrymore's character says "i know". i have no idea what that scene means in the movie.also, the jogger in the orange suit is staring at donne and his girlfriend when he wants to kiss her and then that same jogger is standing out front of donnie's house during the halloween party. he also flashes his flashlight into the camera, similar imagery that frank's glowing eye had throughout the alternate universe story.also, the scene after donnie and gretchen walk down the stairs at the party and donnie follows the portal to the kitchen where there's a note that says "frank was here, went to get beer".....there was a strange cut after that and then suddenly gretchen was standing there and it seemed like some time had passed so what happened during that span of time?i don't know....just some thoughts. my simple explanation doesn't explain lots of other things in the movie</fullReview>

OK, I started watching this movie and 10 minutes into it, I see some bunny talking. I turn it off and watch Count Of Monte Cristo (for the 4th time).I just don't understand why people LOVE this movie. I guess it's because it's extremely vague, and they feel belittled since they can't understand it.It's just one of those "OMG it's creepy" movies like The Ring. Which I must say will into the same bin of creepy by obscurity. If you enjoy being confused and cheap movie trick tactics, this is your movie, I guess.The special effects in this film (while few), were absolutely horrible.

		<fullReview>I've heard quite a few people comparing this film to the 'sixth sense', the 'usual suspects', 'Open your eyes' and the likes. What they have in common is (obviously) that the end changes the whole film and makes you understand it. I just think this doesn't work at all with Donnie Darko. The problem is that our interest has to be kept until the surprising end, and mine did certainly not bear with Donnie. it's just not enough to show a countdown to make me really interested in knowing what will happen at the end of it. I wouldn't say I hated the film, there were some good and very funny moments in it, but not enough not to make me annoyed with it. Also, I felt it lacked to comment on the things it was depicting. The American-High School-Not So Feel Good-Setting with the contrast between the two teachers was not developed at all, and at some points during the film I just thought I might not have been getting it because of cultural differences (but I was assured by some American friends that that's not the case:-)) All in all, I think it's VERY overrated.

		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" is the type of film that has the pretense of being deep and insightful, yet when you get to the bottom of it you recognize that it is quite shallow and has very little substance. The film is intriguing for a while-- you want to know just what is going on and why everything is happening. We are promised that all of this will be explained at the end by the buildup of tension, and then when the climax comes-- you end up knowing less than you did before. Clearly the filmmakers were going for a "Pi"-like effect in which much is left up to the viewer and that is interesting enough, but it this case it is easy to see through to the fact that not only do you have no idea what the point of the movie was at the end, but you doubt the director knew either. Some have argued that the movie is good simply because of the buildup of anticipation and suspense leading up to the climax (regardless of whether the climax means anything or not), but a lot of suspenseful buildup and no closure doth not a good film make. That being said, the director does make use of some good stylistic techniques, but it all seems to be going nowhere. A worthy effort, but ultimately a failure. My rating: 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes the buzz is wrong. Really goddamned wrong. So wrong you walk out of the theater in disbelief that the movie ever got made in the first place.Cloaking itself in some social satire against the easiest targets possible, the movie shifts clumsily in tone from horror to teen comedy to family drama. Pop culture references from the '80s--the smurfs, hungry hungry hippos, etc.--pepper the film, largely out of an attempt to capture the decade through products rather than through a compelling or sensical plot.The end makes little to no sense and is made worse by a severely inept soundtrack decision. Executive producer Drew Barrymore has a small role as a rebellious teacher at the high school. This is about as fitting as anthony hopkins as jabba the hut. You'll laugh a couple times, cringe a helluva lot and taste bile at the schlock end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious Nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a bizarre sci-fi film about a dysfunctional family, with an unstable teen-aged son who talks to a large rabbit. Where's Jimmy Stewart when you need him? Unlike "Harvey," this one isn't played for laughs. The characters are poorly drawn and none of them are likable. The Darko family is so cartoon-like that it's hard to care what happens to them.The script is meant to be thought-provoking but is instead headache-inducing. It's nonsensical, overlong, tedious, indulgent, and pointless. Kelly, directing his first feature film, is in over his head, unsure about what kind of movie he wants to make. Kelly is also responsible for the lame script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko the movie is quite a bit like Donnie Dark the character. It raises questions worth pondering, it searches for truth, it wants to see good in humanity, it challenges many assumptions, and it tackles many issues with passion. However, also like its namesake, the movie is restless and desperate. It jumps from issue to issue like Donnie, searching for hope, but finding none.His psychiatrist asks him the question, "Do you feel alone?" He responds, "I don't want to." He explains to her that he wants to believe in God, that the debate could go on and on forever, but that there's no point because there's no proof. No proof, no point. The movie concludes that weather or not there is a God, if we can't prove he's there than it doesn't matter, so we should just live the best lives we can live.**SPOILERS** Donnie ultimately realizes that his impact on the world only causes negative results, so he 'heroically' jumps in front of a plane engine to save the world from himself. It was a touching end, but strangely unsatisfying. To think that he was only able to do evil was as chilling as the thought of there not being a God.**END OF SPOILERS** As far as movie making quality the movie was top notch. The acting was excellent, and often stellar. The movie's pace was a thoughtful but gripping, and the story was original and fresh.However i found the the 20+ F-words to be distracting and in poor taste. Also the strongly sexual conversations and sub-plots were poorly handled. If they wanted to deal with those kind of issues that's fine, but they didn't, they just threw disjointed sex around until it dirtied their story and characters.However captivating and gripping a movie (and character) it was, i don't only take story, quality, and acting into consideration when rating a movie. I also take message into my decision, since message is a huge part of what why we tell stories. And the message in this movie was hopelessness. It raised questions it didn't know how to answer, leaving you with a more or less well entertained, but bitter taste in your mouth.A movie with the potential of 10 stars, but ultimately failing were it really counted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me see if I can summarise this extremely confusing plot in the simplest possible terms. "Donnie Darko" follows Donnie (Gyllenhaal) a troubled teenager who one night follows a voice in his head who leads him out of his room and house and avoids death when his room is soon after hit by a falling jet engine from the sky, which would have definitely killed him. The voice that lead him out of his room is an illusionary character in a bunny suit named Frank. Frank warns Donnie that in 28 days the world will end.In fact, what has happened is that Donnie has entered a tangent universe - he was supposed to be killed but wasn't and as such the current reality (universe) is wrong, and in fact will end in 28 days. Thereafter Donnie follows this voice (Frank) who tells him to do things (which ultimately will lead to the tangent universe being closed off and the primary or proper universe becoming reality again)..confused yet? It eventually turns out that Frank is the man that Donnie kills in this alternate or tangent universe - so had Donnie died as he was supposed to, Frank would still be alive. Frank helps ensure that the tangent universe will end so that he can exist again. And so, there's some predestinational paradox???...yada, yada, it goes back to the beginning where Donnie DOESN't get out of bed and is get my the plane part hitting his room and the normal universe becomes reality again.You see? It's quite impossible to describe this film in simple or even coherent terms. It simply doesn't make sense because it is science fiction. So what is the film about then? Fate? Ummm. Destiny or something? Tangent universes? Since time travel or the event of some guy in a bunny suit telling you to cheat death and creating an alternate universe are impossible, it renders anything this film purports to be about null and void. If you want to watch something about the different paths our lives can take maybe watch Sliding Doors. Sure its cheesy and sappy but at least you know what the hell is going on. Its not pretentious and doesn't require reading on time travel and time paradoxes.The film has quite an impressive cast: Gyllenhall, Maggie Gyllenhall, Patrick Swayze, Jena Malone, Drew Barrymore. There is nothing really note-worthy about the characters they play. Nothing really needs to be said beyond the attempted analysis of the absurdity of the plot.There is absolutely no explanation for the ending, really. A plane traveling 28 days after Donnie cheats death, hits turbulence, goes through a wormhole and hits Donnie's house 28 days earlier, killing him? Well, I guess everything's wrapped up in a neat little package, then.Enough said about the ending, there shouldn't have even been a beginning. Why would Frank lure Donnie out of bed to avoid death, if this alternative universe would result in Frank dying? I don't quite understand that and I don't really care. This isn't calculus, I might try and figure out an equation because it has relevance to life, this doesn't. This has relevance to nothing. Why does this tangent universe exists? No idea. What significance is it? None. How does what happen in this alternate universe relate to themes of destiny, fate? It doesn't. If you're going to do something about time travel stick to the comedy where Michael J Fox has to save his Dad from Biff or something. Let's not get all deep and meaningful about it and pretend like it really could happen.Well, I certainly wouldn't recommend this film unless you're spaced out of your mind, in which case it would be perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact that this is the Directors first film is amazing to me. The scenes dripped with style, yet that style never seemed distracting. None of it was self congratulatory or gluttonous. The visuals were supported by a truly emotional score and its hard to find fault in the 80's pop tunes that found their way into some of the more impressive scenes.The story is very much thought provoking. Its the type that leaves you pondering the possibilities voiced by the characters. There is nothing condescending about this film. Answers aren't simply handed out, rather the viewer is left to draw many conclusions instead. The acting is also top notch. If i hadn't known beforehand that Patrick Swayze was in this film I would have been shocked. His character is amusing and interesting all at the same time. A great cameo for him. Drew Barrymore is forgettable, though that in no way detracts from the film. Of course the star is Jake Gyllenhaal. There is nothing that can be said to properly praise his performance,he gives a great performance in what i find to be his best movie yet.This movie is great in every way and leaves you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A paranoid schizophrenic fails to save his girlfriend, and possibly all of humanity, by murdering a giant bunny rabbit. So he finds religion and goes back in time to kill himself, which does the trick. Only the bunny rabbit's ghost has tricked him into killing himself before he kills the bunny who kills his girlfriend. And he's not really schizophrenic, maybe. No, wait. My favorite movie about teenagers and family, the creepiest exploration of mental health management since CUCKOO'S NEST, definitely the best recorded use of Patrick Swayze: DONNIE DARKO is all these things, though it spends little time on these elements, because primarily it is a very smart thriller. The mystery is compelling and scary, and that journey is worth taking for its own merits. But this movie is much more, because it touches with the illuminating finger of God the years between carelessness and responsibility. The thriller part of the story is told through the filter of a crazy person, a nice allegory for the teenage condition - we don't really understand what we're seeing, a lot of the time. Why does a Halloween mask whisper doom from the mirror? Why do we keep waking up in strange places? What's with the jet engine in our bedroom? These scenes of disorientation are juxtaposed with a hundred moments of great reassurance and normalcy - Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell are the truest screen parents in a long time; 80s pop conjures an ironically simpler period of American history; Swayze and Beth Grant are comfortingly familiar bogeymen. The contrast of order and chaos allows both elements to stand delineated.It is a great help that Richard Kelly is apparently very good with actors. The performances are among the most poignant in any of these fine actors' careers. There's more, though. There's thoughtfulness at every level. It's idiosyncratic in the most exciting way. Direction neatly supports script, such that nearly every choice works. I think the visible boom mike in Swayze's video is a little much, as is Beth Grant's mistaking Graham Greene for Lorne. These moments break the truth of the world for cheap comic effect. But Kelly was still very young, and besides, he makes sure that every other piece of dialogue, every cut, every music cue, reinforces theme and propels story while expanding the moment. The talent show is a feat of theme engineering-as-character development - the fat girl's recital nearly, but not quite, transcends her inherent awkwardness. The disapproving teacher can't help tapping her feet to the music. Teenagers leap in approbation of younger girls' precocious sexuality. There is real hell here, hell on earth. Your harmless 10 year old sister is trained into a prancing, haughty little bitch. Your girlfriend's stepdad stabbed her mom and is still running around loose. You're going insane, and the best intentions of the nicest people you know are worse than useless. That's real life. It's bad enough without the bunny. I wouldn't be 16 again, even if I could be 16 again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if this isn't technically the best film I've ever seen, it easily remains my favorite movie of all time. Every thing about it just feels right - from Jake Gyllenhaal and Mary McDonnel's terrific understated performances, to Kelly's twisted vision of "Back to the Future," "The Breakfast Club," "Harvey" and Clive Barker.Most everyone has commented on the score but I will say it's the most well-chosen soundtrack I've ever heard (on the original version, not the director's cut) with most of the lyrics, i.e. The Church, Echo and the Bunnymen and the brilliant re-interpretation of Tears For Fears' "Mad World," fitting in with the plot and script.I would recommend the original cut of this film in general, as it leaves the answers up to your interpretations. There's something harrowing and beautiful about how open-ended yet connected everything feels in the mind-boggling climax.In the very least, Donnie Darko is worth admiration for what it attempts to achieve. This film is a must-see for anyone who thinks they've seen it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my, I can't believe there are actually people who liked this stinker. I'm having a hard time deciding where to begin, because there was SO much wrong with this movie. The script, the plot, the acting... WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?? Donnie Darko is a clichéd mess of a teen angst film that tries to be deep and edgy, but rather ends up being sloppy, dull, and derivative. Jake Gyllenhaal plays your typical outcast teen, a character done better in hundreds of films of the past 30 years or so. He escapes his social torments by doing bad things for an invisible rabbit. The whole rabbit deal can't decide if it's trying to be funny or creepy, and it comes off as neither, just kinda stupid.The surprise ending just made me wonder why I had to sit through an hour and a half of this drivel, when it all could have been over in 5 minutes.Bleh. Not often does a movie make me feel like someone has stolen a portion of my life. Donnie Darko accomplished that in spades.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS IS ONLY FOR THOSE WHO HAS SEEN THE MOVIE ALREADY... This movies to me sums up to stupidity. Some man in a rabbit costume comes to a probably mentally ill teen and says the world will end. At the end of the movie I think the storywriter theorizes that the world would not have ended if the teen died. In between this there is a collection of profanity, a boy doing pervert acts in the presence of a psychologist, time-travel chit-chats, a chick getting nailed, a teen challenging his teachers, a chick getting teased, some girl going to Harvard, some psychologist have the hots for Mr. Roger and classifying the world as either fear and love. You also need to watch the movie a couple of time to get the meaning of certain things. I personally think you do not need an all-star cast to make a movie like this. All-star cast require good scripts or its not worth the cost and production time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Warning: Possible SPOILERS....*Poor Donnie. His family just doesn't understand him. His classmates think he's weird. And evidently, his world is coming to an end. Now, if Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) were an existentialist, he may have spent more time pondering the strange goings-on that directly affected his life. Instead, he conceals himself, wrapped in a pity me, I'm adorable brood, and talks to a six-foot tall bunny named Frank. Frank, it seems, isn't a bad fella - he leads Donnie away from his home one night - one in a series of sleepwalking adventures - only to return and find that a jet engine has crashed into his bedroom. Now, here comes the existentialism...well, sort of.His life is saved...for the time being. Frank informs Donnie that he has 28 days to live (it seems that fate has been fudged a bit, allowing Donnie to live in a tangent universe, a sort of "what if?" reality where he can break free of his quiet nowhere-man life and be a hero - of sorts), the "World" is going to end (more ponderous pseudo-philosophizing), and Donnie now had free creative license to wreak havoc wherever he wishes.His victims - the society that shunned him, the family that ignored him, Patrick Swayze - all take notice of the quiet little boy from Middlesex, Iowa...and realize this kid is just plain screwy. As his lashings-out increase, Donnie becomes more disturbed, and little bunny Frank becomes more fuzzy.Richard Kelly, the writer-director of Donnie Darko, must have had some wild, long nights in college, where he no doubt took philosophy...and got a D+. His disjointed script is directed with a smoothness, a gritty, neo-noir flair that is visually stunning, but carries a lackadaisical serendipity, and the story lags in mis-matched sub-plots, and tragic little ironies that concern a young man we learn very little of, and find that we don't care if his "World" ends at all, existentialism be darned.Jake Gyllenhaal, an indie-brat extraordinaire, carries on a false sense of bravado; his character Donnie is a tool, a pawn used by Frank's king to lash out on an undeserving world simply because Frank and Donnie both are kindred spirits - both of their lives were cut short by freak accidents - and if they have to suffer, we all shall suffer. And we do. In spades. Gyllenhaal mumbles and broods his way to the end, and into a neurotic romance with Gretchen Ross (Jena Malone), who finds herself attracted to the unshelled Donnie, and joins him in the havoc.In the two years that have followed since its initial release, "Donnie Darko" has earned a cult following, an undeserving one at that. It seems that if you make a movie featuring a despondent young man and have the film make very little sense to the few who are aware of symbolism and make no sense at all to the many who marveled at Donnie when he told that guy from "Dirty Dancing" that he is the "anti-christ", then you have cult-indie gold. Well, so be it. As long as Drew Barrymore shows up, it can't be all bad, right? Right...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my all time favorte films, Donnie Darko is a film that I think most people will either love or hate. It's a genre bending head trip. No film has ever envoked so many emotions in me. A lot has been made over the movies plot. What does it all mean? I have my own ideas and they might or might not be right. But for me the plot really is secondary. The films real strenght is its ability to play with my emotions.Jake Gylenhall is outstanding as Donnie Darko. He has the whole teen angst thing down. It reminded me of a lot of emotions I felt at that age and sometimes still do. Mary McDowell and Holmes Osbourne do a great job of portraying parents who desperately want to help their son , but can't really comprehend what's going on. Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, Maggie Gylenhall, and Kathrine Ross have small roles but make a big impact.Its hard to bealive this is Richard Kellys first film in the directors chair. The mood he is able to create is haunting. He envokes darkness, an eerie tone, and a sense of surrealism. The 1980's seems to be weird era for this sort of film but somehow it works. Kelly does a remarkably superb job at uses the right soundtrack and score to make a scene memorable.This is without a doubt near the top of my list of favortes and I recommend it to anyone who dosn't mind a plot thats requires a little work to follow</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko tells the story of a delusional teenager who begins to see visions of a a man in a blue bunny suit, who orders him to do certain tasks through suggestive clues and voices, to which he insists he MUST do, or the world will end.Now, really, this is a movie you must see to get the plot, if I were to give the full, detailed, complex plot it would take far too long (And will probably you leave you more stumped) to which reveals the majestic brilliance of Donnie Darko; which is that their are endless amounts of theories and interpretations, making it one of the most thought-provoking fantasy of recent years.The acting is superb (Maggie Ghyllenhal, Jake Ghyllenhal and Drew Barrymore to name a few), the music is perfect, subtle and atmospheric and the fantastic direction, coupled with a roller-coaster ride of a storyline will leave you of utmost interest and intrigue like no other movie. Not only that, but you will find yourself watching it more than a few times, as it will stick in your mind until you reveal your own personal interpretation (To which you may experience a Donnie Darko 'phase' which I did, warning: It WILL take up a sizable chunk of your life).But adding to the already deep and complex storyline, there are also a vast amount of underlying themes, most noticeable the character Patrick Swayze plays, in which it represents a false 'superior', referring clearly to religion.Donnie Darko is truly a classic, one of my favorite films and I recommend it to anyone. Incredible.</fullReview>

Hard to believe, I don't think his acting is _that_ good. His face keeps the same expression the whole movie. I know he can do better. The first time I saw him was in The Day After Tomorrow. Fairly good performance. So maybe he kind of evolved after Donnie Darko. There aren't any visual outstanding scenes in the movie.

		<fullReview>I have never been a huge fan of "Donnie Darko" as a science fiction story, which is how it was intended by writer/director Richard Kelly. The vague storytelling masks the gaps in logic and the budgetary constraints that did not allow them to show things more convincingly (also Kelly needed more experience before he tackled a project of this scope). However, fans have embraced this failing as the film's strength and have used the open-ended structure to mold the thing into something that fits their own individual agendas.By now most everyone knows that early in the film the world diverges into a tangent universe, a situation that must be remedied in 28 days or the normal universe will end. Donnie has been selected by some undisclosed guardian to bring the tangent and primary universes back into alignment. He is given some superhuman powers for this task but only a few clues about what must be done. Searching for answers (mostly about time travel) during the day and performing sleepwalking pranks by night (an inefficient way to bring about certain vaguely tangential events), he semi-cluelessly moves forward toward the deadline. At last he figures out that he must send an "artifact" (a jet engine) back from the tangent universe to the normal universe. He seemingly knows that doing so will result in his death in the normal universe but he selflessly performs the task and restores things to a stable balance.This is not as silly and contrived as it sounds but it does have some major issues that must be ignored if one is to really embrace the film. It also lacks useful philosophical depth and is just a teen movie with some intriguing thoughts about time travel.But "Donnie Darko" becomes extraordinary when viewed instead as an allegorical story about free will versus destiny. It is basically a twisted remake of Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life", with Donnie a 1988 version of George Bailey and Frank his guardian angel. Instead of being given a chance to see what the world would be like if he had not been born, Donnie is given the chance to see how his continued existence would alter events. For George Bailey the experience was full of positive revelations, for Donnie it is the opposite.To go with this unintended interpretation you just dismiss the whole thing about tangent universes. Instead Donnie dies at the beginning of the story by a random event (a jet engine falls off a plane passing over his house)over which he has no control. Since he is not essential to the event, he is given a chance to experience an additional 28 days of life to see the effects of his remaining alive and then choose between the two alternate futures. But he is also given the ability to actually see the force fields that draw everyone toward their destinies and finds himself powerless to resist such manipulation. Ultimately he makes his first "free choice" and elects his original death."Heathers" was a major influence on Kelly and "Donnie Darko" has that same sedated tone, with characters generally under-reacting to absurdly extreme developments. As in that film parents are not the problem, rather it is kids being incredibly (but believably) cruel to each other.The cast is solid although avoiding Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze is normally a good idea. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent and it is nice that his actual sister Maggie plays his film sister. Unfortunately both Maggie and Jena Malone are wasted in unchallenging roles with minimal screen time.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of "those movies"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing it twice now, I've come to the conclusion that "Donnie Darko" is a conundrum--but a conundrum even the most disciplined philosophical mind wouldn't want to ponder. Writer-director Richard Kelly's tale of a psychologically disturbed boy (the title character, played with remote detachment by Jake Gyllenhaal) with the ability to see through time and space, aided by a creepy rabbit-faced entity, is simply too ambitious for its own good. It has a lot of worthwhile ideas and characters going for it, but their realization usually only reaches the halfway point, thus transforming the film into an underwhelming, frustrating experience. Though it addresses issues of mortality and fate, the emotional tone could have been lifted from any number of "Teens-Coming-Of-Age" movies (the presence of Jena Malone made me recall the much better "Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"). Perhaps the director's cut fleshes out some of the weaker threads of plot, but I'm not curious enough to find out. I won't fault "Donnie Darko" for going in a different direction that most teen-oriented films, but "12 Monkeys Meets Ghost World" is quite a stunt to pull off, and nothing here comes close.</fullReview>

So I passed.But then the whole Donnie Darko thing has ballooned so much throughout the year, that I found it impossible to go on without finding out what the fuss was about. So I rented it.And you know what? I was right all along. There's nothing here but hype.Please don't give me that "You're just dissing it because you're not smart enough to understand it" line. If I don't understand it, it means the director and the writer (who happen to be the same person) didn't do their job right. Don't compare it to Memento; there's no problem in understanding Memento, as long as you pay attention. This just doesn't make any bloody sense. Don't tell me to read the friggin Philosophy book; if I'm required to read some text to understand what was on the screen, then this Kelly guy had better find a different line of work. And yes, since you ask, I have read the thing, and it explains the story, and you know what, it still isn't very good. A story that needs to be so painstakingly explained to make sense, becomes hollow.I hope everyone will continue to have fun endlessly debating the "finer points" of this gobbledygook. Me, I'd rather watch real films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie yesterday evening with my girlfriend. My girlfriend felt asleep after 15 minutes. I thought just to give it a chance, 'cause I read so much good critics here. So I waited and waited, time seemed to stretch like chewing gum and nothing really cool happened. I liked none of the characters. The best performance in my opinion was Donnie Darko himself and even that was not a good one.I've read here to watch the movie twice or more to fully understand it, but I'm not sure if I want to. I've watched 'Memento' and that's a movie you have to watch twice, too, but in fact this film was so cool that I WANTED to watch it twice. This movie is in my eyes a waste of time. Only worth 1 Star out 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko: Pretentiousness Personified</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Time and again I read the comments of other people on IMDb on films I have found to be truly awful - just to see what other people think of them - only to find the majority of them describing the film in question as wonderful, brilliant, awe-inspiring etc. Again, the comments I have found on "Donnie Darko" are no exception to this general rule.My wife and I have only just watched "Donnie Darko" on DVD and were furious in the extreme at having wasted over two hours of our time on this annoying and frustrating rubbish that "cleverly" tried to be so-called "art". We absolutely abhor films that start off from a certain premise, and then at the end the viewer is confronted with the nasty trick of, "Ho, ho, this just didn't happen this way at all!".So that, in "Donnie Darko", the sleep-walking character of Donnie Darko - played by the epitome of the somnambulist actor of all time in all his varied film roles, Jake Gyllenhaal - is shown to have escaped the falling jet engine on his bedroom (occurring at the beginning of the film) because the "bunny rabbit" by the name of "Frank" had mysteriously got him out of the house, only for the film to end with the very fact of the jet engine killing D. D. in his bedroom.Certainly, this kind of "twist" between a film's starting "reality" and concluding "unreality" has been seen many times before, most notably in the Bruce Willis masterpiece, "The Sixth Sense". There, though, it works absolutely brilliantly, so much so that every time I watch the film it leaves me very disturbed and upset.But not this time. We were both angry with ourselves for watching this piece of utter pretentious nonsense, and straightaway the DVD ended up in our rubbish bin where it truly belonged.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is pretentious trash! Get over it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh my GOD! If I have to keep listening to people saying this movie is good in any way I will scream. It is pretentious crap. C-R-A-P. The plot makes no sense! In fact there is virtually no plot at all. Even the people who like the movie have said that they have watched it numerous times and still don't fully understand it. It is not a movie to be thought about and pondered as some would lead you to believe. Just trying to think about it is guaranteed to short circuit your brain because there is no logic to this movie. It tries to be witty and cool and dark and funny, but in reality it is just dumb and half baked. The acting is very poor, Jake is at his worst here. The director must have told him to make the same face and deliver his lines in the same monotone way for the whole film. The cinematography is also poor, it looks like a bad student film; a first attempt at doing something stylized. I could have made the same movie with my hand held. I can't understand why all these teens like it. I am 16, but I hate this movie. The only reason that so many people like it must be because the majority of people are dumb and can't tell if a movie is good or not. Also a lot of kids who like it are trying to be non-conformist and emo. They think if the adults don't like this movie it is because "the man" is trying to keep it down and rebel by liking it. I went to see it thinking that I would like it, and I really tried to like it but it is just bad. It is a pretension magnet for people who think they know good film. Please do not see this movie, especially if you are not between the ages of 14-22.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all know how great the original 'Donnie Darko' is, so I won't bother talking about that at all.When I heard that the Director's Cut was out, I thought "yeah, more character exploration, maybe an extra scene here and there", you know the usual.When I saw it though, I discovered that the new version included "more information". It did something that it should never have done. It explained stuff. Things that made the movie what it is, that created the myth of Donnie Darko are all gone. And done badly too.Visions of the time travel mechanics, the handbook of time travel and other things that were added, made the movie seem like an okay episode of the Twlight Zone.I am sorry but after watching the Director's Cut the movie was ruined for me. Do yourself a favour and stay away from this abomination.Director's Cut 5/10 Original Version 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When weird stops being weird.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It never ceases to amaze me how people think they're being original when they're really not?oftentimes they're following the oldest clichés without even realizing. Donnie Darko suffers from this, like most every movie in this somewhat overdone sub-genre. More about that in a second.The sub-genre I'm referring to is the wannabe The Twilight Zone episodes turned into full length movies. Pretty much everything M. Night Shyamalan has written fits here, as well as Big Fish, The Invisible, The Cell, Donnie Darko, The Matrix, etc. But what confuses me is all the movies in this sub-genre forget the others exist and act as if they're the only one who has treaded the overdone "weird" path. In this sense, Donnie Darko is just as typical as the pointless movies released every year.With that said, I liked Donnie Darko. I liked it because some scenes were absolutely beautiful and captivating, like the movie theater scene, the hit-by-a-car scene, and all the little hilarious details that I'm not going to bother mentioning. I liked the editing. I thought the relationship between Donnie and his girlfriend was well done, for the most part . . .. . . but like a sledgehammer to the balls, the writer/director decided to use two of the most common clichés ever used in movies like this. Not only that, but he sacrificed such a likable and original movie because he didn't have the common knowledge to make the mundane original, not just the over-the-top elements: - First, he makes Donnie have mental problems. According to the Unoriginal Hollywood Hand Guide of America, if your main character has fantastic visions he has to have mental problems; if your main character has super intelligence, he has to have mental problems. From an entertainment standpoint, this movie would have been so much more entertaining to watch if I didn't have to keep thinking: "Wow, another scene with him acting like a retarded person . . ." every five minutes. It ruins the beauty entirely. It ruins the ability to take Donnie seriously, even after his visions prove to be real. From a critical standpoint, it's ridiculously sad that a movie with this much originality would use such a tired cliché that every movie uses. Why couldn't Donnie have just been a normal kid? That alone would have made this movie so much more enjoyable and original.- Second, the ending. *Major spoilers* Donnie goes back in time to commit suicide. *End spoilers* Once again, this is the cheap, childish, cliché ending that every movie uses. When you're watching a Twilight Zone wannabe movie, this kind of ending is the single most generic ending there is. You expect it from the first five minutes. Through the entire movie I kept hoping Donnie Darko wouldn't end up with such a cliché finale, but it did. I assume it's a misunderstood idea that all intellectuals must be pessimistic, and all intellectual movies must end with a generic tragedy. If a movie is truly intellectual, you'd think it would break this pathetic trend.- Third, the subject matter of this movie is just as generic as the other two points I mentioned. Time travel. The movie is obviously trying to be weirdly intellectual, but, really, there is nothing intellectual about the same exact arguments in every single movie like this: time travel, the fabric of destiny, and the clichéd argument of God vs. free will. Once again, a truly intellectual movie would have thought of something new to argue about, but this movie follows the exact same formula as every other movie of its kind.Overall, Donnie Darko (the movie, not the character) flirts with perfection so many times it's sad I have to give it a rating as low as this. But, listen up future directors, it becomes so pretentious by thinking it is so original, and parts truly were, that is ignores glaring clichés that break the rest of the movie. It's sad to see what could have been a truly superior film fall to mediocrity.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The way in which Richard Kelly has crafted the piece to be humorous, entertaining, tragic, dark, and above all, deep at the same time is a credit to him. Whilst most movies aim for to evoke one emotion from the viewer, by being purely comical, or purely dramatic etc., Donnie Darko evokes a whole spectrum of emotion... and in the end it amounts to an overwhelmingly great experience...The many layers of the plot relay truths about the destructive society in which we live... Jim Cunningham being worshiped despite his flawed character; the man who needs the most help advising the rest... the school system failing those who need the most help... the delusional parents who push their premature children into the adult world.. the joke that is psychiatry and the almost uniform methods of treating mental health problems... teenage angst and conformity... This movie really makes you think.The acting is superb. Donnie's character is likable yet disturbing at times, and slightly cynical. Jake Gyllenhaal's acting confirms that he is one of the few young actors that will outlast manufactured actors such as Josh Hartnett. He holds the movie on his own, and even when he is not speaking at all, he commands the scene.You have to see this movie. Not just once, but many many times. The intellect seems hard to fathom at first, but it really isn't the basis of the film. I think this film is a comment on society, but it is an extremely entertaining and fulfilling experience in the same. The humor lightens the heavy nature of the film and adds to the enjoyment.Anyone who doubts the integrity of this movie or the directors intentions is pretentious. The effect of this movie can't be under-credited; it is stimulating, left of center and completely unforgettable. After reading many comments which tag this movie as being an unstructured mess, I have to say that you need to get a grip. If YOU didn't UNDERSTAND the movie, don't discredit it and pick at it merely to redeem yourself in your own egotistic eyes.Great soundtrack too. The montage at the end with Mad World playing over the top shook me. So engaging.MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More clever than the Butterfly Effect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I want to know how a Drew Barrymore movie got past me. This is a very deep, intellectual demonstration of the inner workings of the human mind and imagination. This is a very good rendition of what happens to the gifted young who are not taught to keep their light hidden from the 'straights.' From time to time, one like Donnie Darko emerges from the primordial cesspool that is our genetic makeup; one who can see, hear and know of when's and where's which are not this reality.Children like him are invariably medicated and caged...or worse.While this is not the only movie to speak of children of this kind (Powder, Warlock 2, Firestarter, The Sixth Sense, and yes, even Harry Potter on some level), this has to be one of the most creative twists to this vein I've ever seen. This story is simply astounding.This movie shows the human condition within our society. Why people sometimes make the really bad choices. How sometimes that "thing" in your head doesn't go off and scream "BAD FREAKING IDEA!" Why suicide sometimes occurs. Why sometimes a person would stop fighting for a better life and just...surrender to the one that is.It also shows that by going back to undo the bad things in our lives, we will also undo the good, leave those who loved us feeling empty and alone, and somehow miss out on this reality and hopes of something better in the face of insurmountable odds.I won't spoil this by telling the end. But wow...if this does not leave you feeling "disturbed," nothing will. This is every bit as quirky and darkly startling as "May." That's all I can say, except that this was one of the best movies of this kind I have ever seen.On the B scale (which you don't notice, by the way), it rates a 9.1/10.On the A scale, it rates a 7.7/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

Novice writer/director Kelly spins a yarn about a delusional burb-dwelling WASP teen male who sees a shrink for performing misdeeds while under the spell of a monster rabbit because he's getting ready to travel through a worm hole....or something like that. With no reason to give a crap about Donnie, except that he's a cute kid, one can only sit idly watching this confused mess of a movie which counts down the time to doomsday or something and then ends in another place in space/time...as if that were even remotely interesting. Nonetheless, "Donnie Darko" scored well on this website, so go figure. There's no accounting for taste, hmmm?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie, I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler First off, I'd like to say, that I just saw this movie 8 days ago. I honestly can't remember if I heard about it before or not.I now almost wish I had never seen this movie...I can't stop thinking about it. I'm 28, been working for 9 years in the same company &amp; love to see movies. I love music, movies &amp; basically the whole "media". I watch on average 5+ movies a week. New rentals or old ones, whatever. I suck it all up.Since I put this in, I've been constantly haunted by it (literally). I go to bed thinking of it, wake up thinking of it. I've since then watched it 3 more times, in an effort to get it outta me system, to no avail. I can't shake this movie. It has struck so hard a chord with me, that I feel like I've been swallowed whole by it.I remember putting it in &amp; the first opening scene that 1.5 mins, I knew I'd love the movie &amp; nothing had happened yet. I found myself transfixed by it.I lost all sense of time &amp; by the time I was finished, it was 4am &amp; I had to get up at 7am for work. I also didn't care when I realized what I had done.I found myself absorbed by the movie, &amp; I didn't know it, till it was too late. When I did realize how much I was really liking it, I was a lost cause.I think the reason I'm so attracted (obsessively with no control) is that I can 100% relate to it. I didn't have a therapist &amp; wasn't a schizo, but everything else, from just not feeling attuned to the world. To this day, I've not thought of myself as a normal person. I think differently, react differently &amp; have the ultra rare curiosity of accepting possibilities of things unknown, even though our pathetic tiny use of our brains, doesn't allow one to understand this, or what exactly it may be, but I know there's more to life than ... this.I feel that was how Donnie was. He was aware of things &amp; "intimidating" by his intellect. He knew on some level, there was something... there. When he finally realizes it, with the help of the "manipulators", he slowly comes to understand it.I found that I could understand Donnie &amp; even see myself in his place. I remember the 80's, the smurfs, the music &amp; the guru's. Its familiar enough that I can remember details of it.Donnie is definitely a troubled kid &amp; though I don't consider me teens that way, I did feel outside, even though I got along with everyone (I wore the man suit, as a mask of who I really was). I've read tons of the comments on what the movie was interpreted as &amp; agree with some of it.I thought, I'd instead post how this movie has affected me &amp; made me completely think of things differently. I don't view the world the same way. I question the choices I've done in life &amp; the life I'm living atm. I find that I'm contemplating things that I want to change &amp; change right now.The last bit of the movie, I find myself with tears down me face, almost to the point of uncontrollably weeping. I find that I can actually feel what the characters are feeling. I'll admit, that I like the darker side of life &amp; this movie is indeed hauntingly dark. If Donnie was played by a blonde guy, the sound wasn't as haunting &amp; the music wasn't retro (making you remember how things were retro) it'd not have worked for me at all. I'm dark &amp; mysterious like Donnie is. I'd swear on many aspects, he is me twin.If I even think about the movie, hum the tune in me head, I'm instantly gripped in me gut with the feeling of the movie. I can't honestly put it into words. I've never felt it before. Its sadness, grief, empathy &amp; lastly envy. Its taken me 4 watchings to rationalize this last one. These 4 emotions are not usually all grouped into one, let alone so strongly (hit by a bulldozer strong). I feel envy with him, because at the end, when he laughs, either subconsciously aware of whats happened, aware of it, or just some weird Donnie thing. Whatever anyone's guess as to what &amp; why he laughs, you can tell he is at peace. Peace with himself &amp; the world. This probably wouldn't have had so much impact, had the not not be narrated. Its cause of this, that even though he dies, I envy him, cause he's attained something, I can only hope for, someday.This movie, due sheerly by its immense hold it has over me, has now become me ultimate favourite. I recommend it to everyone &amp; hope they view life differently as I do.As odd is it may sound, its almost like this movie created a midlife crisis in me. At the very least, its made me aware of deep emotions that I've been ignoring or not realizing are there. (I feel a therapist calling me name now, lol)If you want to see a movie, have an open mind &amp; are accepting of things not easily defined, definitely see this one. It is so powerful, thought provoking &amp; emotional on every level, you'll find yourself thinking about your own life. That is if, you get this movie, like I did.Have a watch &amp; spread the word. Also, I'd say, watch this movie alone. You need to see it, &amp; think on your own, not have someones influence on you. You need this so that your reactions &amp; thoughts are solely yours &amp; yours alone, not what the person next to you is thinking, or gonna think about your reaction. As much as we don't want to admit it, we react differently around people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, first of all it is highly overrated. Yes, it has a good plot. I have never seen or read any time travel story like this one. However, In my opinion, it was too boring to watch till end. its sequel, probably named darko S. is a disaster. I don't know what else to say about this movie. There is nothing which will hold you to the plot. It seems like a fantastic and simple story was taken and a lot of characters were filled in. Most of the part of the movie goes in presenting redundant things and characters. So, I think it would have been better if it was somewhat interesting. I am typing rest of the words to complete so called "10 lines of text requirement of IMDb". So, guys chill and watch some good movie instead of it. And yeah, never watch it with your family or girlfriend/boyfriend or you will be in a really big trouble.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie DarkoDonnie Darko is a 2001 American psychological horror-science-fiction film written and directed by Richard Kelly. Set during the presidential elections of 1988, this movie tells us the story of Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) , a "disturbed" teenager who sleepwalks out of house and meets a figure in a scary rabbit costume named Frank, who tells him that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds. Donnie returns home to find a jet engine crashed into his bedroom , an engine that cant be traced to any crash or an airline.But the mysterious events don't stop here. Donnie starts to become more detached from the reality and starts meeting Frank more often who often talks to him and orders him to do weird things.Jake Gyllenhaal does a fabulous job in making Donie a menacingly mischievous teenager with a very curious but deranged personality to go hand in hand with the very dark and disturbing atmosphere of the movie with many things spiraling out of control. Jena Malone(Gretchen- Donnie's Girlfriend) , Maggie Gyllenhaal(Elizabeth-Donnie's Sister) and others added to the story in their respective ways.Donnie Darko is "not" your everyday entertainment. It requires the audience to think hard on what they are seeing. It is like a puzzle becoming more and more confusing as you watch while you try to make sense out of it. Why? Because the film has been carefully made so that there are multiple explanations to what happens and none of them are explicit when you first watch it.I enjoyed the movie very much even after watching it several times as you experience something different every time you watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a movie about time travel. It is about a boy with schizophrenia who dies in an accident. He hasn't had much of a life and he is haunted by his illness, but the movie allows us to experience what he experiences in his last seconds of life. Read "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge." Not so pretentious really, if you know anything about schizophrenia and have read about accounts of people who have died and been revived. The performances are extraordinary, the combination of events and music evoke adolescence for many people who watch it, and the fact that so many of the characters are familiar to us provides a contrasting background against which Donnie's visions can stand out as vivid and disorienting to us as they are to him.</fullReview>

The teenage angst was palpable at the time. Everyone was misunderstood and no one appreciated it.But then there was this boy, this borderline intelligent boy ("hey"), that didn't really fit in at all with the rest of the established society ("HEY") and that longed for self-made discomfort ("THAT'S ME!").It worked. The young morons of those days longed to have a name as ridiculous as "Donnie Darko" and the movie grossed 7 million dollars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>that crazy movie is this ???? more is very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is one of the most difficult film I've ever watched, so that the film is full of theories on the Internet, and many theories makes a hell of sense, especially when you review the film, the cast is good, Jake Gyllenhaal, Maggie Gyllenhaal , Jena Malone, Drew Barrymode, Patrick Swayze, Seth Rogen and etc., the direction is Richard Kelly who was rookie when released the film and was only 26 in the year of release of the film, and he does a good job, if you notice every detail in the film, you will find many hidden things and create your own theory, the soundtrack of the film is very good, fully match the pace of the film, the script is good, even making some slide, the picture is also good, it is very dark at times, especially when the rabbit appears, has moments I particularly thought unnecessary, the character Donnie Darko I found very humorless (obvious that the idea of &#x200b;&#x200b;the script is to be this), but I found it very bland it and the film has that kind of ending that leaves you thinking too much, Donnie Darko is a very good film has a good cast, and an interesting script with moments that will leave you and thoughtful. note 8.7</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite all-time movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can not put my finger on exactly what makes this movie perfect to me, but something is there. Maybe it's the acting, the writing, the story, the twist, the intriguing use of time travel, the hidden Easter eggs, the quotable dialogue; or maybe it's because I see part of myself in Donnie's character and sympathize with his trials and tribulations (to an extent, I'm not really in his exact situation). Not many other movies have made me feel on an emotional level for the characters, at least in the sense that this movie does. Even minor characters are seen as important in the movie's plot, and I find that so intriguing. Richard Kelly went on to make two mediocre films before what seems like basically disappearing off the face of the planet, but this one contribution has surely secured itself as my favorite movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A look at the dark side of an adolescent filled with mystical hallucinations (the bunny rabbit frank), unexplainable chance occurrences, vivid secrets and premonitions of the end of the world, the narrative chases down so many dark alleys that it finally hits a perfect end. Although most viewers will probably resent the crash at the conclusion of the trip, some will find the journey sufficiently stimulating to make it a lot more than worthwhile. Viewers Generally liked the dark side of the movie. As Richard Kelly's debut which was expected to be an average movie it turned out to be one of a kind. At the end of the day it is a really enjoyable movie and I strongly suggest you watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is fantastic, with an optimal direction, you realize the care that Richard Kelly had to the scene extras, fine performances, a photograph of places totally in the 80s, fantastic soundtrack, often making a counterpoint between relaxation and tension, a film that makes you a complete immersion in it, some little problems are really in the script, the film contradicts and sometimes not even he knows to explain, Donnie Darko is a complex film to others, resembles the works of David Lynch, but ultimately worth it because mixing religion with physical, meta-physics, time travel ..., it's crazy, but oddly enough, the film has meaning.Richard Kelly, to where did all this talent?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film divides people, you either love it or hate it. For me I love it. Why? I am not sure, it has that je ne sais quoi.It begins with the intro, when the music begins it sets the atmosphere and when you have seen it before and revisiting it gives me butterflies.I love the fact it was a modern film set in the 80's. It lets us reminisce of an older time. It touches on issues which still are here today in some areas.It's purposely vague. When I first watched it not everything made sense to me. When I watched it a second time suddenly so much began to make sense. Now I have seen it countless times over the years and the film seems to complete in my mind, with so many visual metaphors. The ending may be a little confusing in some respects but I cannot help but feel it's so poetic especially with the sound track.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A profound experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director's cut of Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko is one of the most profound experiences I've ever had watching a film. It transports you to its many layered dimension with unforced ease and tells it's story in chapters that feel both fluid and episodic in the same stroke. It has such unattainable truths to say with its story, events that feel simultaneously impossible to grasp yet seem to make sense intangibly, like the logic one finds within a dream. These qualities are probably what lead to such polarized, controversial reactions from the masses, and eventual yearning to dissect the hidden meaning which at the time of its release, didn't yet have the blessing of the extended cut and it's many changes. A whole lot of people hate this movie, and just as many are in love with it as I am. I think the hate is just frustration that has boiled over and caused those without the capacity for abstract thought to jump ship on the beautiful nightmare this one soaks you in. Movies that explore the mind, the inexplicable, and the unknowable are my bread and butter, with this one taking one of the premier spots in my heart. Kelly has spun dark magic here, which he has never been able to fully recreate elsewhere (The Box is haunting, if ultimately a dud, but his cacophonic mess Southland Tales really failed to resonate with me in the slightest). Jake Gyllenhaal shines in one of his earliest roles as Donnie, a severely disturbed young man suffering through adolescence in the 1980's, which is bad enough on its own. He's also got some dark metaphysical forces on his back. Or does he? Donnie has visions of an eerie humanoid rabbit named Frank (James Duval) who gives him self destructive commands and makes prophetic statements about the end of the world. His home life should be idyllic, if it weren't for the black sheep he represents in their midst, displaying behaviour outside their comprehension. Holmes Osborne subtly walks away with every scene he's in as his father, a blueprint of everyone's dream dad right down to a sense of humour that shows he hasn't himself lost his innocence. Mary McDonnell alternates between stern and sympathetic as his mother, and he has two sisters: smart ass Maggie Gyllenhaal (art imitating life!) and precocious young Daveigh Chase (also Lilo and Samara from The Ring, funnily enough). The film also shows us what a showstopper high school must have been in the 80's, with a script so funny it stings, and attention paid to each character until we realize that none are under written, and each on feels like a fully rounded human being, despite showing signs of cliché. Drew Barrymore stirs things up as an unconventional English teacher, Beth Grant is the classic old school prude who is touting the teachings of a slick local motivational speaker (Patrick Swayze). The plot is a vague string of pearls held together by tone and atmosphere, as well as Donnie's fractured psyche. Is he insane? Are there actually otherworldly forces at work? Probably both. It's partly left up to the viewer to discern, but does have a concrete ending which suggests... well, a lot of things, most of which are too complex to go into here. Any understanding of the physics on display here starts with a willingness to surrender your emotions and subconscious to the auditory, visual blanket of disorientation that's thrown over you. Just like for Donnie, sometimes our answers lies just outside what is taught and perceived, in a realm that has jumped the track and exists independently of reality and in a period of time wrapped in itself, like a snake eating it's own tail. Sound like epic implications? They are, but for the fact that they're rooted in several characters who live in a small and isolated community, contrasting macro with micro in ways that would give David Lynch goosebumps. None of this malarkey would feel complete without a little romanticism, especially when the protagonist is in high school. Jena Malone is his star crossed lover in an arc that finds them spending little time together, yet forming a bond that that feels transcendent. Soundtrack too must be noted, from an effective opener set to INXS's Never Tear Us Apart to the single most affecting use of Gary Jules's Mad World I've ever heard. It's important that you see the director's cut though, wherein you can find the most complete and well paced version of the story. There's nothing quite like Donnie Darko, to the point where even I feel like my lengthy review is stuff and nonsense, and you just have to watch the thing and see to truly experience it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another pseudo-philosophical, way overcomplicated flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This starts off well. It's got intrigue, and the acting is really pretty good for a teen, and the girl's pretty good too. It's got some good in it, and the efforts to produce something so genre-bending and original should be saluted in itself. There's also some pretty funny humor going on, a very sarcastic sense of caricature of many things and types of people. But overall this is common social commentary, an overly complicated plot that introduces too many things and fails in the end to convincingly resolve the tension of any of those things, and it just keeps going and going and the answers never actually come. Lots of elements are flat out left unanswered, things like they'll develop a character who seems to have purpose but then that character never shows that purpose. Ultimately very disappointing when your attention has been commanded for such a long period of time. And the whole definition interludes, it's just not a viable option to include so much written theory behind a single motion picture, a series perhaps but not a single flick. Too much, just way too much. Movie-makers should've spent less time including different angles and more time answering fewer.This just isn't a very good film, but it's certainly got good elements to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It came as no surprise to hear that Richard Kelly's biggest influence as a film maker is Terry Gilliam's Brazil. This movie, made on such a modest budget, has an amazing cast, truly fantastic script, and one of the best soundtracks of all time.The dream-like quality of the story as it unfolds, the concepts of spirituality, morality, and destiny make this a though-provoking and uplifting experience despite many of its dark themes. At its center is the relationship between Donnie and his family, his teachers and the pretty but troubled new girl Gretchen. Can the ominous character in the rabbit mask lead Donnie to rewrite unfortunate events?It's definitely in my top 5 favorite films (along with Brazil). Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DONNIE DARKO is a film hard to classify. Some might pass it off as a routine teen flick but they'd be mistaken. It has all the trappings of adolescent movies, from soul-searching teenage talk to parent problems and plenty of intrigue and simmering violence at the local high school, but it goes a lot further than that.The base of the story involves a paradox in time, and it is set in an alternate universe packed with imaginative effects and a really creepy guy in a rabbit costume who goes by the name of Frank. I can't really say any more, except that this is the film that brought THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW star Gyllenhaal to fame, and he is excellent, as is the rest of the cast ? including Patrick Swayze in a very surprising change of character.This is one of those movies with a plot that doesn't make much sense until the end, where a couple of twists or three make what has come previously crystal clear. It's a good trick, and one you won't tire of. Add onto that an '80s setting and plenty of cool Tears for Fears music (which could almost have been written for this movie) and you have an emotional thriller with a heart and a brain. It might leave you scratching your head, but repeat viewings should remedy that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched Donnie Darko when it came to DVD - around 2002 - and it left me utterly baffled. So baffled, in fact, that I immediately lent the film to someone else to watch, in the hopes of some revelation. Having watched it again recently (2016), I find it a beautiful, beguiling and intriguing film - and every bit as baffling. Perhaps that's just me.Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a moody, troubled teenager who suffers from bouts of sleepwalking and visitations from a 6-foot talking rabbit called Frank. Frank tells him the world will end in 28 days, pitching Donnie into an increasingly fragmented reality in which nothing quite makes sense. Is that enough? Yes, in a sense. This movie comes together somehow - brilliantly so. You don't need to understand the significance of absolutely everything to understand the film - you can read it as a metaphor for puberty or human existence, or make up your own mind about some of the theories hinted at in the movie, from psychosis to dreams. Once you find the significance, though, you see how absolutely every scene, character and action is crucial, and how it's all connected like one massive jigsaw. It's really quite clever and, I'll confess, not something I think I'd ever have discerned for myself without reading the film's original website (still archived at http://archive.hi-res.net/donniedarko/ - most definitely worth a look).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is not just an incredible movie, but an underrated one. Many people have stated the movie is either too dark, too "artsy" or even pretentious. That is not Donnie Darko. Donnie darko is an original tale of a disturbed, but gifted seventeen year old boy, who becomes the most unlikely movie hero imaginable and his decision to save the world from a collapsing tangent universe, as foretold by a giant rabbit... yeah... This is a movie that explores the ideas of free will, human binary choices, religion, death and even the meaning of life. It is a complicated movie that may require multiple viewings. And because of this, this movie may not be for everyone. But one can't deny that this is a well crafted masterpiece of movie art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It starts out as a rather standard American Beauty type of movie about conservative versus liberal values and teen angst. But Donnie Darko is no typical movie. It quickly escalates into hallucinations, supernatural events and even the law of the universe's timetravel.Some moments are profoundly scary, such as the rabbit costume. The directing is superb. Yes, there's some plot holes, contrivances, time paradoxes and inconsistent stances on determinism, but the lore is pretty complex, and unless you want to read it somewhere online, you're best off with just your own unadultered interpretation of the film's events. Good luck figuring everything out. Its very complex and there's so many things I could say.

His sessions with his therapist? and with a high school teacher who's not supposed to discuss theoretical physics with students?are, like the rest of this creepy, insightful coming-of-age story (2001), beautifully kaleidoscopic in tone. Kelly is a supple and courageous storyteller, boldly free-associating as he mixes parody and satire with earnest psychodrama and coming up with plot points no one could anticipate. Donnie submits to the therapist's increasingly questionable treatment, taking his medication even though it seems to be causing hallucinations?or are they visions??involving an evil-looking bunny the size of a man.

The performance including direction, filming, acting and sound was just more than to be called perfect. As though I understand, the story goes around the main character 'Donnie Darko' which represents psychological manifestations of near-death experience and adds to the philosophical debate of reality (subjective vs objective). After watching it second time I came to a very vivid realization as it just bursts inside my brain and create a neural image. We all have unfulfilled desires, dreams, hopes, fears, potential purpose of life, and limitations. This film is a best depiction of all these emotions and experiences to find solace and peace before ending into "the unknown".And finally I do agree with our one of the review writers evilmet-3 from Woodland Hills, CA: "Combine the fact that the large majority of the movie-going public is just going to find it unbearably weird with the fact that the movie begins with part of an airplane crashing into a building (this has got to be the very definition of bad timing) and it's pretty clear that this film is going to stay underground. However, if you are looking for a beautiful experience with a unique film, _Donnie Darko_ is just about as good as it gets."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tangent universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that the film is entertaining but told in a deliberate and extremely complicated way, that it need to be gutted afterward. This is its original sin to me, and it's a shame.The plot isn't easy because the premises are themselves too complicated and not very rational.- SPOILER -Occasionally the time can "corrupt" for unknown reasons and create parallel realities called Kickbacks, or Tangents, Universes. These unstable temporary realities seems destined to collapse on themselves and causing the destruction of existence. At the same time, they form a kind of space-time vortex, when the Tangent Universe is about to collapse, that allows the journey in time and that can be traced back to the point of their origin.The "Artifact" (the airplane engine) is the sign of the birth of a Tangent Universe, usually made of metal and his sudden appearance cannot be explained rationally. The "Living Receiver" is chosen as a normal human being (Donnie Darko), without explications, to return the Artifact before it causes the destruction of the universe, through the space-time vortex. To do this, the Living Receiver receives various powers and it is often tormented by nightmares and visions for the duration of the phenomenon. Also, who die in the Tangent Universe can return with powers, to help the Receiver to fix things, and that's why Donnie kills Frank in the parallel reality, to use him as a guide. Every event, every person next to him (the Manipulated Living) must lead Donnie to complete its mission by creating a compelling reason for the appearance of the engine and allowing the safe closing of the Tangent Universe. To achieve this our hero, Donnie uses the powers it holds as Receptor and take advantage of the opening that is created while the Tangent Universe is dying to let engine that is detached from the airplane back in time to the night of the twenty-eight days before, to fall on the house, killing Donnie and clear the Tangent Universe.Donnie chooses not to avoid the destiny and sacrifice himself.The characters we see in the final sequence suggest that they somehow remember something happened during Tangent Universe.- END SPOILER -Now, being me a fan of the Luc De Vauvenargues aphorism about language: "Clarity adorns deep thoughts", I must say that this movie doesn't clarify itself and this is way I can't give it an higher score. The director Richard Kelly, who is also the writer, only secondarily, by the director's cut, helps the viewers to extricate themselves, but it is too late, the film still deliberately overly cryptic and intricate, which does not make it completely palatable to my taste in the first instance.7+/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a thrilling, mind-blowing, unique masterpiece from Richard Kelly starring Jake Gyllenhaal.Richard Kelly is a smart director who knows what he is doing. He did the shooting in 28 days and on a budget of just $5.000.000. Richard Kelly also wanted this movie to take place in his hometown Midlothian, VA, but then changed it to Middlesex, VA.The movie starts with Donnie waking up in a forest and while he is returning home he is thinking about how he got there. We can clearly see that there is something wrong with him. Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko) acts really well in this film. He doesn't blink even once in his scenes with Frank showing Donnie's mental disorder. After some time he meets his imaginary friend Frank, the bunny man who tells Donnie that the world will vanish in 28 days and makes Donnie act weird and break the law several times. Remember Fight Club? Here is another imaginary friend that makes the main character commit crimes.The movie is great for sci-fi and drama lovers. And it will make you want to watch it over and over again. The film deals with parallel universes in a very complicated way but the more you watch it the better you will understand the events. The films ends in a way that will really surprise you. Also, there is a long explanation of all the undigested parts of the movie on the website http://www.donniedarko.org.uk/explanation/ But there are plenty of fan theories that explain the movie in different ways too. There is also a mockumentary about the film which has higher rating than the film itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've been lead to believe that the director's cut would have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can see the attraction behind this film, the main idea the film makers were trying to accomplish, their vision. It's supposed to be a film that combines complex time travel ideas and philosophy with eerie dark comedy and teenage love drama. And on the paper it's not a bad idea. The main character Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) gets told that he doesn't have long on this earth, while he simultaneously has to question his very sanity and even his existence. This is shown to have the effect of releasing him from his bonds, allowing him to express himself in ways he has never before realized. In a way you could say that he was happier during that final month or so than he was ever before. Except that he's constantly plagued by the knowledge of what might come. The film's atmosphere is very dark, with muted colours and uncomfortable, yet occasionally sweet scenes.So what went wrong? The time travel aspect mostly. The thing about a plot device as complex as time travel is that it pretty much always requires a lot of explanation to pull off. The audience needs to know why something travels through time, what caused it. In Back to the Future it's explained to be the work of a brilliant scientist. In The Terminator it's future technology. Sometimes it's magic. In Donnie Darko it sort of just happens, which is always a terrible choice. Some films get away with it through the use of humour - the randomness of it is dismissed with a shrug. Donnie Darko however spends a significant amount of its running length talking about the methodology of time travel, yet explaining very little. And this is immensely frustrating, because either we should be receiving information or we should be doing something else. Of course a mystery left open is sometimes a valid plot device, but it needs to be brought into the story just right or it ends up being frustrating, like in this case. Though to be fair I've read that the director's cut is better in this aspect, so perhaps there's still hope for this movie.Aside from that major aspect, I think the movie's OK. I'm not crazy about any of the performances, but the main actors are good at what they do. Gyllenhaal especially is very believable in his role, even though he comes off very detached and nonplussed. In this case I believe it's deliberate and he shows emotions in the right places, so it works. On the technical side of things I have no complaints. It's not the best looking film I've ever seen, but it's solidly slight above average, which is more than enough, considering that this movie is mainly about the idea behind it rather than how the idea is brought to the screen.In the end I have to find this to be an average film, perhaps slightly above average. That's only the theatrical cut, though mind you. Had they explained the time travel any better and had they really focused on the complexity of Darko's situation, this could have been an amazing film. And it's entirely possible that the director's cut could be just that. Now it's a bit too open ended, a bit too non-explanatory, to really pull me in. Still worth a watch, but nothing spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Good Plot/Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe it took me 11 years to discover this movie. I saw the end of it on TV the other night and finally saw the whole thing on Netflix yesterday evening. As a person who likes eccentric and thought provoking movies I felt thoroughly satisfied at the end of the movie. Donnie Darko is more about the drama, tragedy, and ironies of life than anything else. If you like movies that make you really think about the possibilities of the physical and metaphysical world then this one is for you. If you are into the action packed, violent thrillers that is so typical of movie goers of today then this is probably not your cup of tea. For those who are willing to use their brains though Donnie Darko does not disappoint. The ending is simultaneously sweet, happy and sad. The end of the movie left me feeling all those emotions simultaneously. It was wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Donnie Darko" Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie's cover, I didn't know what to make of it, much less what to expect out of the film itself. That strange image of a kid with a wiry, skeletal body surrounded by seemingly-digital writing and this gaping hole in his chest; is it some kind of science fiction? Is it something horrific? Is it something otherworldly? Truth is, Donnie Darko is all of those things in its own distinctive way. It's a high-school drama, wrapped up in an eerie, surreal, mysterious type of sci-fi overtone. This might actually go down as the one and only school drama where time travel and tangent universes factor into the kid's life. The science is kept to a minimum, focusing more on story and character development. In spite of that, the film is pretty evenly paced ? not too fast and not too slow ? with a particular emphasis on crafting an atmosphere that's simultaneously creepy, otherworldly, and perhaps somewhat spiritual in nature. It makes for an experience unlike any other.The story for this is pretty odd, and without a whole lot of straight or concrete answers, the film will come off as weird and confusing. It definitely requires some thought and interpretation to fully comprehend. But even if you don't spare that type of attention, the drama scenes can stand really well on its own (if it wasn't for the time traveling stuff, this would simply be a story about a confused and angry teenage boy). Characters are pretty strong and endearing. Through their interactions and dialogue, greater themes of spirituality emerge, which not only adds depth to the story but also ties together the looser elements of the story into one tight package. Overall, despite being enigmatic, the story is as deep and tightly-constructed as it is interesting.Despite its low budget, the film has some very interesting photography and editing, and I find it quite invoking in some areas. Acting is swell: Jake Gyllenhaal is effectively perfect as the title role, while Holmes Osborne, Mary McDonnell, Jena Malone, and Beth Grant all contribute quality performances. Additional smaller roles by Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore, James Duval, and Maggie Gyllenhaal are also noteworthy. Despite a few odd lines, the writing is really good. This production makes the best use of its limited sets, props, and costumes. Special effects aren't terribly great, but they definitely accentuate the film's unique style. Music is really slick.This is not a film that offers a straightforward storyline or answers; it is fundamentally sublime, offering an experience that is mesmerizing and surreal. It is certainly recommended to those open-minded viewers who have the patience and tenacity to view and interpret this mysterious storyline.Two cuts exist for this film. I've seen people favor the theatrical cut, because it explains less and therefore stimulates the brain more. I personally prefer the director's cut, because it does explain things some more. I'm also more fond of its added special effects. Music is different between the two versions; it may irk some viewers, but not me personally.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Very Good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance, Donnie Darko could seem silly, and a bit stupid. This was my first impression when I first came across this film. I mean, a giant bunny? That alone could leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. And when I first watched the movie, I was severely confused; which I considered a problem with the movie back then. I digress, my expectations were a little too high back then, but now I've re-watched it and found something closer than it appears..The thing I love about Donnie Darko is how confusing it is. Now while that may seem like a problem, it's really not. Donnie Darko has this plot so we can put the pieces together: forming our own branded puzzle set. This is why I refuse to put one footstep into the director's cut, because my imagination seems like a more reasonable and valuable choice. The movie itself? Fantastic. I literally was at the edge of my seat, and there was no point where my arm was resting below my chin. It's one of those films where you're so confusing, so deeply engaged into it's strangeness, that it turns out to be a special one. I don't even need to go into the plot, because twist after twist! I never saw it coming, I never saw the deeply-rich story. And while people think they know the whole film by saying these two words - time travel - they have no idea. The movie has so much more power than what'd you'd expect. And the movie never tells itself what it is, making it one of the most visually- experiencing films ever...So why would you just sit around and read this with no intention to even see the film? People watch a couple minutes, turn it off, and read the story online stating that they "watched" it all, and end up giving it bad reviews. That was my first choice of action, but nothing would ever make me go back in time to make that happen. Donnie Darko is one of my favorite films of all-time. Not enough? It blends everything you need in a movie, including fan favorites of the atmosphere, the story, then the twist that sets the film off into a whole new image that you can't quite see, but want to. I recommend for everybody and anybody wanting to experience a film, not just find it as escapism. Now question is: what would you do if you could see into the future?10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAINS SPOILERS! It is certainly a complicated film, in the sense that the plot revolves around a fictional book content made by one of the characters (Roberta Sparrow) concerning time travel. What makes the plot complicated is the fact that the content of this book and its "theories" are not disclosed to viewers, making it very difficult or almost impossible to decipher what's going on most of the time. This is probably the reason why this movie has been designated as a "cult" film, simply because the plot is so cryptic that is exposed to as many interpretations as people who watch it.This is not necessarily bad, in fact it is a good idea, it's a good way to invite people to think, investigate and generate their own conclusions, and to give a mythological touch to the film.I think that in order to form an interpretation of the plot it is necessary to read the excerpts from the book "The Philosophy of Time Travel" shown in the extras on the director's cuts version DVD. (Just google "The Philosophy of Time Travel" and you'll find it right away).The characters and situations are sometimes realistic and sometimes surreal, at the point it made me doubt several times if the plot was developed in reality or a dream or imagination of the protagonist. I guess in the end it's up to each one to choose which of the two is.The dialogues seemed good in general, and credible.The direction is very good, and as some say, is hard to believe it's the director's first film (Richard Kelly). Certainly the best work of his short career.As for acting, I found it very good, and almost none (if any) overacting. I liked the cast, and they all play their role effectively. But I think the applause goes to Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko) that does a great job, Mary McDonnell (Donnie's mother) who doesn't cease to surprise me in every movie I see her, and Maggie Gyllenhaal (sister of Donnie, his sister in real life), i really loved her performance. These are at least the three characters i found most believable and best played.In conclusion a little gem of the 7th art. To see more than once. If you didn't you should, don't think twice. Though, i warn you that you won't fully understand it the first time, or the second, if you don't look up "The Philosophy of Time Travel" or the website afterwards.And to those who says "this movie is no entertaining" "it gives no new ideas, nothing to think about" "i wasted my time" i can only say: It is after all just a movie, you like it or you don't. But you can't judge other people for enjoying it. I bet you waste more time doing things more unproductive and stupid that watching a movie, i know i do.With nothing to add. Thank you for reading my review (my first critique on IMDb). (Sorry for the broken English)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbingly fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko, a movie by Richard Kelly, tells a story about the title boy, who is accredited as mentally unstable. One night, he meets a big, scary rabbit named Frank. His new friend knowingly saves Donnie's life. From now on, he needs to recompense this favor and be obedient. What is more, with this eerie encounter Donnie falls into a labyrinth of mysterious events, incidentally seeking for the truth behind life and death. This movie is a specific blend of horror, science fiction and psychological thriller. It is nothing like all teen movies, such as American Pie, which gives the viewer a miserable bunch of jokes. This is really a very intelligent movie and, at the same time, unpredictable. Nothing is certain, until the ultimate ending. It is one of those movies that have so many to offer: great acting (brilliant Jake Gyllenhaal and Jean Malone), sensational turns in action, suspense and overwhelming mystery. Also, songs used in the movie give a great impression and fantastically collide with the picture.The only negative point may be the confusing script. It is hard to understand the remittance and some viewers can reject this picture, because of lack of patience. It takes a few times to finally make any sense. However, that is what makes this movie so magical and unforgettable. There are many apt interpretations and, still, people try to grasp it from another point of view. Personally, I think it is one of the best movies ever made, and it is only sad that it was not ever promoted, as it should have been. It is really well worth seeing, as it may be one of the most spectacular and, at the same time, murky movies of all times.</fullReview>

Then today I watched it, and realized that despite it sounding silly it is in no way silly. The best scenes in my opinion are when the bunny is around. His voice send shivers down my spine. It has a lot of powerful buildup to a genius ending. Also I would like to point out the movie has a great soundtrack. It has strange images and camera angles, but at the same time it keeps a brilliant storyline. It is brilliantly directed and written. "Donnie Darko" is one of the best films to come out in the 2000's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was an excellent movie. It really shows American life from an honest side while at the side time being really imaginative like a Twilight Zone episode. The character Donnie Darko is also very interesting. It is difficult for me to explain why I like this movie so much. I think it must be because of the story, and because like The Butterfly Effect it is independent cinema. For example, in these movie there are clever meta-references and intertextuality. There is something amazing about seeing people in new movies go in to see Evil Dead and Se7en like they do in Donnie Darko and The Butterfly Effect. I think, that is pretty amazing. Evil Dead is a brilliant movie, by the way. Anyway, I cannot explain why I like the Donnie Darko movie but I really do. Maybe it is because of the main character and his emotional problems, which I guess most of us can identify with, even though there is nothing wrong with us. Also it is a nice critique of the self-help genre in the movie where it turns out that the self-help guru is actually totally miserable himself. I think, that is a good point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Surreal Caught On Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard about this film for years before I finally saw it on DVD. What a treat. Only David Lynch, Nic Roeg, Ken Russell and a handful of other film directors are able to create the myriad of brain wave types in pairs, triplets or in unison: theta, alpha, beta and gamma and maybe even delta. It takes deep subject matter, good acting, and the proper creation of atmosphere to take an observer's mind to that other place. Donny Darko does this many times throughout the film to great effect.The story creates a sense of inevitable doom, but with a core of hope. Never a big fan of Jake Gyllenhaal, he is perfectly cast as the lead in this film. All of the subplots weave together perfectly and the cast is terrific with excellent performances by everyone. Menace and mystery come from the strangest places in this film and the mundane becomes farcical and yet dangerous.The visual effects are excellent for the sky shots and the "water tube" effect works pretty well also.The first time you watch the film it has its greatest impact because you are intrigued with the possibilities of where this odd story could possibly go. Upon repeat viewing the film loses a little of its magic because the closed-time-loop-cannot-upset-fate resolution to the story reminds you of the possibilities ignored.What if the bunny had been something more sinister or ethereal rather than someone so conventional? But I quibble, all in all an excellent film</fullReview>

The phys ed teacher who brings in the self help guru played by the late Patrick Swayze (who is also screwed up).The English teacher who is using a passive method of kids reading short stories but that isn't working either...Donnie is doing things to save his community but in the end the only thing he can do is?

		<fullReview>The film DONNIE DARKO has got to be one the most powerful films I have even seen. Having said that, you must be wondering why I only gave it a rating of eight stars. I'll explain.When I first heard about this gem of a film, I had been informed that it was extremely depressing much like the song that appears in the ending of the film "Mad World". This intrigued me as I am a lover of dark depressing cinema. Although this film is dark and by the ending a bit depressing, it isn't what I would call bleak which is also what I expected it to be.The images can be very disturbing and the dialogues or rather the points and philosophies brought up in the dialog can be very interesting. However some of the dialog is one of the things that I didn't like about this film. What I am referring to is the constant vulgar cussing that goes on between siblings at the dinner table next to their parents which has become a routine scene in American films pertaining to teens. I guess because my I'm not American I can relate to those situations. I also didn't like the incredibly lenient and cowardly parents Donnie had.Since allot goes on this film it was easy for me to forget about these flaws, especially when the last fifteen minutes of the film played before my eyes and took me by surprise. The climax's mix of nostalgic, devastating, and uplifting emotions were only enhanced by "Mad World", I must say that I first heard this song three years before seeing this film and it felt good to hear it like this.This film left me feeling strange in a way no film ever has, DONNIE DARKO is truly a film worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is one of the most unique and fascinating films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I watched it for the first time around two years ago, and since then it has not lost it's power. Richard Kelly is a true genius. He has a lot of interesting ideas and he lets them through in his first film. His writing is incredible. He blends in a lot of ideas with science-fiction and religion. The reason I have such a special bond with this film is because of the characters. Theya re intriguing, and Kelly really explores every aspect of a human mind and every emotion there is, even literally. I thought the film had a lot of similarities with American Beauty, as in the strange guy and his relationship, and a lot of the family aspects of the film are similar. Sadly, only American beauty is the film that got the attention when it came out, but I am glad this film has such a strong reputation now. It is wonderfully shot, and it is one of the most thought-provoking films I have ever seen. While I also love Kelly's sophomore film, Southland Tales quite a lot, Donnie Darko will always be his best. The performances in the film are extraordinary. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a very eerie and special performance, and I thought Mary McDonnell's portrayal as the mother was the second best performance in the film. The scene where Donnie asks her how it feels to have a wacko as a son, and her response, perfect! The whole cast is great. I think the reason the film works so well is because it as a mood unlike any other film. It has a very slow, somber, mellow mood to it, and together with the creative scenes involving the Bunny Rabbit, it creates a sort of thriller sci-fi drama.Overall, this is one of the key films in my long list of films I have seen. In my Top 20 of all time, and just a powerful, very affecting film that will never leave me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a good film- there is no point in denying it. It is well acted, the story is strong, it hits the weird-o-meter on all time high (in a good way) Without giving too much away, Donnie is a teenager who smokes, gets in trouble, swears and ends up meeting Frank, a six-foot tall bunny rabbit. Werid, right? Surprisingly, this film feels normal even though it is a bit long and the direction isn't a masterpiece, yet it is a good entertaining film that is a nice piece of thinking work It's flaws are what makes the film strong, it will make you want to see it again and again afterwards- until you have figured out the ending for yourself.

		<shortDescription>My simplified take on what happened</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the original version of DONNIE DARKO and enjoyed the air of mysteriousness. However, after finishing the film I still didn't quite grasp what was going on. After reading through countless explanations and discussions on the topic, this is the simplest way I can make sense of it all:***SPOILERS!***Due to some clerical error (caused by God, time-traveling aliens, who knows?) a jet engine was sent 28 days back in time, falling onto the Darko house with no explanation. This was not supposed to happen. The engine didn't belong in the past.What this did was create an unstable universe. In 28 days, when the jet made its flight, the universe would have two identical jet engines existing simultaneously. This would upset the time-space continuum and cause the universe to collapse upon itself.Donnie Darko was enlisted to save the universe. He had to make sure the jet engine in 28 days was sent back in time, thus resolving the time-space error.(Think about this: in the life-cycle of the jet engine, it was built, it flew around a few times, on Oct. 30 it broke off and landed on Oct. 2, where it was retrieved. If Donnie hadn't sent it back in time, the engine would've stayed in Oct. 30 and Oct. 31, while the same engine also existed from crashing on Oct. 2. The one engine would become two duplicate engines for no reason. To keep one engine in the "life cycle", the Oct. 30 engine had to be sent back in time to become the Oct. 2 engine. Confusing, I know...)Once the jet engine is sent back in time, the universe re-sets from the night the engine crashes. Everything that happened in the 28 days in the unstable universe is wiped away. The universe is stable now because the jet engine has a reason for appearing out of nowhere. That reason is because someone (Donnie) sent it from an alternate timeline. (Before it was just a sloppy goof by some 4th dimensional power, manipulating time-space.)Donnie didn't have to die to save the world, but saving the world likely meant that he would die. (Since the engine crashed into his bedroom.) Donnie was willing to make that sacrifice in order to save the world and to "save" Gretchen.Frank the bunny is kind of a time-traveling ghost. He's killed by Donnie on Oct. 29, but his ghost goes into the past to guide Donnie on his way.Why was Donnie chosen? Perhaps because he would've been killed in the accident, so he was easy to convince that the universe needed saving. If Donnie had died, maybe they'd have to find someone else to send the jet engine back in time. Or maybe there was something special about Donnie, and he needed to be saved in order for him to right the universe.But in the end, the engine crashes into Donnie's room on Oct. 2. Donnie is killed. Everything from the 28-day alternate timeline seems like déj?-vu. And an unexplainable jet engine is retrieved for further analysis. (Nobody knows what to make of it, but we know it came from another reality.)***END OF SPOILERS***It's still complicated. The Director's Cut supposedly dives much deeper (too deep?) into the sci-fi mythology behind everything. But I think I like the artistry of the original version better. The viewer isn't sure what's going on, even at the end. Is it real? Is he just crazy? What will happen in 28 days? It leaves some things open to interpretation.But I think DONNIE DARKO, in its original form, is a film with almost no answers. The ONLY way for anyone to know what director Richard Kelly was going for is to do research and read interviews, listen to commentaries, dive into the website, watch the Director's Cut, etc. I don't think you can make sense of the movie without an explanation from the filmmakers.The Director's Cut spells everything out, but the film becomes more of a crazy sci-fi flick than a dark mystery. Personally I prefer the original.Donnie Darko is a troubled teenager. He starts getting warnings about the end of the world and believes that he alone has the ability to prevent it. Influenced by an imaginary friend, Donnie's actions become destructive. Meanwhile he meets a girl, goes to therapy, and tries to unlock the mysteries of time travel.The movie is very complicated, and is clearly designed to be so. It's full of layers, from the psychological angle to the Christ-like symbolism. It's one of those movies with dozens of interpretations. A movie that allows people to see what they want to see. Often over-analyzed and possibly over-rated.I think it's a very interesting film, capturing a sense of mystery with storytelling artistry. The film might not "make sense", but you can tell that it was crafted that way deliberately. The acting is very good and the movie sticks with you days later. I wouldn't call DONNIE DARKO the "greatest movie ever", like some people, but it certainly is an interesting film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An extremely complex structure/movie, that might be too much for some people. Too much information, a too confusing plot line, not enough action, too slow a pace. All things that could be said about this movie. But it's still gripping. Even if you don't get what it means, after watching it the first time (I didn't), it still is a mesmerizing experience.In a time-line that doesn't seem clear, in a world that looks like ours, but feels entirely different, this movie gets its strength from the plot, which as well can be it's weak point for many. If you're not appalled to the strange, feel free to experience this movie ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How do you define a classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this film i was stunned by its complex plot structure and outstanding casting choices but I did not completely give its true admiration. The second time i saw it i declared it in my top 10 all time for movies. But the third time i saw it left me stunned at its originality and its poignant display of how well the combination of every element of film can create a masterpiece. This film is my favorite film of all time and that is no understatement. I have seen this film probably 6 times since i first viewed it on my tiny computer screen. Each time it leaves me speechless. Each element of the film is perfectly choreographed to elaborate the plot, and the editing and sound are perfectly done. The way Richard Kelly uses slow motion and fast motion is astounding and needs to be recognized. Also the soundtrack for this film is perfect and every song fits perfectly for each scene. The movie starts off with Donnie, an average young boy, waking up on top of a mountain road. The audience does not know how he got there but that is explained later in the film. The opening sequence in my opinion is the greatest ever in film and the use of slow motion and the song playing in the background is perfect. Jake gyllenhaal in his breakthrough performance gives the audience one of the most prefect displays of character acting that it leaves the question who but Jake could play the part as Donnie as well as he did? Even though the plot is confusing at times every answer is in the film. Because this film uses conventional themes through such a complex plot this film blows away every film I have seen. I know that this film is considered a cult movie but i do not think that should prohibit it from being declared as one of the greatest movies of all time. Also all the people who dislike the film because they do not understand the plot that is only because you are not observing the film you are just looking through it. Overall this film stands the test of time and i know that i will be watching this film all my life.

		<shortDescription>The Dreams In Which I'm Dying Are The Best I've Ever Had ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a high school kid with behavioural problems; sleepwalking, pyromania, depression, antisocial tendencies. He starts having visions of a creepy guy in a dark rabbit suit called Frank, who tells him to do things and warns that something significant is going to happen soon. Is Donnie finally losing his marbles ?This movie achieves the near impossible - it's an original modern-day teenage angst film. In a genre that's been done a million ways twice, it skilfully blends together elements of youth rebellion, small town exposé and temporal paradox sci-fi stories into a unique and compelling drama. Better than that, it expertly forces us to identify with Donnie and see the fractured world through his perceptive eyes, and it has a terrific payoff that makes you want to watch the film over in order to understand it better. It's pretty weird in the absorbing way that David Lynch's films are, but unlike those it never feels surreal or arty. Kelly has a great bag of tricks full of clever surprises, but doesn't compromise on the drama of Donnie's situation and his movie is rich, funny, sad, thoughtful and intriguing. Gyllenhaal is terrific in the lead, never overacting but making us feel Donnie's confusion and insecurities so we can't help but empathise. The support cast is good, particularly McDonnell as the mom, and Barrymore, whose Flower Films company helped to finance the picture. It also has a commendable eighties drum machine song score, notably the Joy Division classic Love Will Tear Us Apart (very apt to the storyline) and a wonderfully fragile version of Tears For Fears' Mad World, performed by Gary Jules and composer Michael Andrews. The photography by Steven Poster is quite beautiful, as he uses subtly altered speeds through the frame (a much copied technique since) to echo Donnie's out of kilter abstract view of his small town world. A word about why I hate establishment film critics; this is a very interesting and laudable movie, but because it doesn't fit easily into a niche it was treated very badly by both the movie distribution business and the media, with the result that the extremely talented Kelly has struggled to find any funding for future films. Speak to any real people who've seen it though, and they're entranced. This was perhaps the most imaginative film of 2001, and yet critics would have you believe it was Gosford Park or A Beautiful Mind - spare me. So listen up kids; ignore those backhander-grabbing senile scribblers, and check out this puzzling, rewarding, deftly constructed little teenage-boy-goes-nutso drama instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What if paranoid schizophrenics are able to time travel?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie asks a strange question and gives an in-depth and stylized answer in a film medium, an answer that is both sci-fi and spiritual. What if the young man that everyone sees as a "troubled teen" is really troubled by the actual things he is able to witness?Is Donnie a superhero or Jesus Christ figure? A bit of both, if there really needs to be a distinction. Donnie calls Cunningham the anti-Christ. That could be the best insult he could come up with, or you could say that it takes a Christ to see the anti-Christ. When his soon-to-be girlfriend asks him, "What kind of name is that? Sounds like some kind of a superhero", he retorts, "What makes you think I'm not a superhero?" This is the hidden reality of the story. Donnie and his dad's schoolmate Frank are apparently superheroes, albeit unsung. In the movie theater Donnie taunts Frank by asking why is he in that stupid bunny suit. Frank replies, "Why are you in that stupid man suit?" No mere mortal, Donnie.Why does Donnie like "Chut up" Cherita? He knows she is in pain. He knows that the world is not a fair place, where the fair-looking people have all the advantages. Contrast his little sister's performance with that of Cherita at the school theater night. Donnie cares for the downtrodden, the unsightly. But on a deeper level, his interactions with Cherita show us a larger purpose; his time travel seems to have a meaningful impact on those he leaves behind. The right-wing radical teacher seems to recognize some error in her ways, the awful Cunningham seems to realize he dodged a bullet, Cherita smiles, assured of the promise that life will be better for her.How can there be a Frank Jr., didn't his dad die on his way to the prom? Only if Frank Sr. had a son while still in high school.Why does Frank the all-powerful bunny turn into a clueless young man? Frank was never really just Frank. Let's say Frank Sr., the Frank that Donnie's father references, is another superhero. Then perhaps a whole other story relates to that unfortunate, dying on the way to his prom. Frank Sr. was another paranoid schizophrenic who had to face a similar choice as Donnie did. In this way, we are given the sense that the world we know is sustained by these heroes, tragically because the rest of us simply see a "doomed" crazy person. (It could also be God, showing himself in a form that will be helpful.) Donnie- Why do they call you Frank? Frank- It is the name of my father (smiles) and his father before me. --This would seem to indicate that Frank Sr. is present in the bunny suit; Frank Jr.'s grandfather is Frank Sr.'s father "before him".So how do the Smurfs fit in? There must be some irony in the name of the town in the film ? Middlesex. Smurfette is created for an evil purpose, but is turned around by the loving ways of the smurfs. She, like Jesus and Donnie, is created and placed into "the world". But just as you think he is reacting to their crassness, he makes the surprising observation that a life without a penis is not worth living. Sex is a convenient representation of all earthly pleasures. He finally makes love with Gretchen and that is what steels him in his resolve.Does Donnie really have a choice? Yes and no. He would have a choice if he were not such a perfect individual. Witness the conversation with his physics teacher. This is the final conversation he has with him, where the prof says he has to stop speaking with Donnie or risk losing his job. (It's pushing the Christ myth interpretation a bit far, but note that this is a form of desertion, or denying one knows Christ.) The prof goes through the usual logical conundrum of having no choice, tied to your fate, then seeing the future and choosing whether to take that path, thereby crashing the concept of being tied to your fate. But Donnie counters that this wouldn't happen if one were to follow "god's channel". This fits into the Donnie as Christ concept in that yes, Christ has a temptation in the desert, but come on now, is he really going to go the way of the devil (that nasty kid at school is a good stand-in for the devil, by the way)? Donnie is our hero. He is a good person, however tormented he may be. When he sees the right way, the path of virtue, it seems certain he will take it.Speaking of tempting Christ, why is the theater playing "Last Temptation of Christ"? Just a hint from the storyteller that Donnie is Christ and that these are his last days.Was there some deeper meaning to what Roberta Sparrow ("Grandma Death") whispered into Donnie's ear? "Every living thing dies alone." How appropriate coming from Grandma Death. Her role is to prepare him to make the sacrifice, for him not to be deterred by the natural revulsion to the pathetic act of dying alone, like his dog crawling under the porch.Why is this story oh so ripe for a sequel? Donnie's sister dates Frank Jr. She obviously is sleeping with him. Recall the night of the plane engine crash. Sis comes home and chuckles as she leans against the inside of the front door, apparently ravished. Her son would then be the next in the perhaps infinite line of Franks.Why are Donnie's last words "I'm going home"? He is obviously going to his bedroom in his house. But on the level of the Christ myth, he is going to Heaven, from whence you could imagine him having come to earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>donnie darko director's cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I saw the Director's cut of this movie today (never seen the original) and it was a different kind of movie to say the least. It had some pretty funny moments that had me just laughing out loud and it also was kind of creepy at some points (but nothing too extreme). The movie keeps you watching and questioning things. Jake Gyllenhaal provides a great performance here as the mysterious Donnie Darko...plus Jena Malone, Patrick Swayze, and Drew Barrymore also have good parts in this. I didn't really like the ending of this but I gotta admit that it is much more original than other movies similar to this that I have seen. I know that this is a favorite movie for many people, I thought it was good but nowhere near my top favs list. Overall, I'm still glad I watched this, it was a different kind of movie that actually made me think and it was pretty entertaining along the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Winner of the "mess with your head" category</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching a teenager appear to descend into the madness of paranoid schizophrenia is not a pleasant thing to watch, but Jake Gyllenhaal is completely convincing and very sympathetic. I sympathized with him and his parents, who, like most people, are not equipped to accept or cope with this mental illness, much less help their son. I was involved enough in the story and characters to be angry with the psychiatrist, who should have had the parents commit the boy for in-patient psychiatric treatment about mid-way through the film. After Donnie vandalized his school and committed arson, I steeled myself for the inevitability that he would use his father's gun.If the plot had played out to a conventional conclusion, it would have been merely notable. But the reason this film has achieved cult status is its deliberate attempt to mess with your head. After you've accepted the grim nature of the movie, the filmmakers throw in a crazy, pseudo-scientific twist at the end designed to make you say "What the hell?" and spend the next 30 minutes discussing it with your viewing buddy. I could tell you not to try to make sense of it, but you won't be able to help yourself.If you decide to rent this movie, be sure to get the director's cut. There were 20 scenes deleted from the theatrical release, most of which needed to be put back in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice movie if you strip off all the sci-fi ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie several times on the big screen. Recently I watched it again on DVD and I was a bit disappointed. Some bits that are funny or interesting on initial viewing become very tedious when viewed later.I could not understand, and I still don't, what the psychiatrist character (Katharine Ross) is supposed to do. Also she quotes what must be one of the most nonsensical lines ever uttered in motion picture history ("If the sky were to suddenly open up, there would be no law, there would be no rule. There would would be only you and your memories.")Also, I would have gone along with the idea of guiding spheres that come out of people's abdomens, but the idea of a sphere making gestures is just ridiculous. In fact when I first saw the movie I thought the sphere was giving Donnie the finger!And the less said about the smurf scene, the better.But I do not want to sound too negative, but in reality this is still a great movie, with great performances in particular from Mary McDonnell. Watch out for her when you see this movie again.</fullReview>

The plot line, seemed like to much was left on the cutting room floor. The plot has real potential and it was enjoyable, but I didn't feel it was fluid. My take on the plot is that Donnie is schizophrenic but then the end of the movie I thought it might be the entire story was a dream before death, the unconscious mind similar to anesthesia, when your mind is in a deep sleep. I guess we are suppose to guess the meaning of the movie. I prefer a movie that tells the entire story, so I don't have to think so hard.

Firstly, I went to school the next day after I saw the movie and was talking with a friend of mine, we began talking about our weekend and he brought up the movie. I was shocked because we both watched it the same day and had never mentioned it to each other. The next day I slept walked and woke up sitting straight up and woke up exactly at 5 a.m. The next day I was watching the news and a school's watermain broke in Sarasota. The next day the same boy showed me something written on the ground at my school in front of a building, " Burn it to the ground". For awhile nothing happened and then the next week I got into a car accident and met a girl that is like my soulmate, never have I met a girl I have connected with so well. Our fathers died at the same age 13 and in 2002. The next week, exactly a week later I got into another car accident, I'm waiting for the next event now. Do you think this is just all coincidence or some sort of sign? Am I paranoid?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko Prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the Donnie Darko prequel, released in 1981. It details the events that led to Donnie's mental breakdown seven years prior to the events in DD. Apparently, this is not the first time a time portal has opened in his bedroom, leading to threatening visitors and a confrontation with the nature of god and the corruption of time. In this movie we also learn that his real parents were killed as a result of the 1981 time portal, and the parents in DD are, in fact, adoptive. Also, his born name isn't Donnie, it is Kevin.Apparently, the universe was made in seven days, and was a "Rush job" according to one of god's mysterious servants. As a result, time is riddled with holes that threaten the very existence of space-time. God has assigned several agents to tracking down and repairing these corruptions to preserve the universe's integrity. Unfortunately for Donnie, and the universe, these agents occasionally become dissatisfied with Gods plan, as they are agents with free will, and stop their very important jobs of time repair and take up the indefensible practice of Time Banditry!! The choices made by Kevin/Donnie in both cases saved the universe from destruction. In DD we see how god's servants operate in secret when they are doing their assigned jobs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a film that at least in my opinion can be given many interpretations, or otherwise subjective and symbolic meanings; It portrays the paths that are meant to be followed in life, some believe by a higher power or maybe by destiny itself. The book " The philosophy of time travel" is essential for understanding the film's main plot, which has to do with time or time travel if you want to be more specific, this helps you understand what was Donnie's intended path of life and how one event can change the future of the world we live in. That's why Donnie laughs at the end of the movie, because he truly understands his path, an how it influences the people that were supposed to be a part of that " path of life", he saw it in his dreams and was able to make an interpretation of his own while seeing what the end of the world meant, for him at least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a refreshingly different masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a work of genius, and is certainly not your average teen movie. Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a creative yet troubled youth, who seems discontent with more or less everything around him - be it the perceived imposition of authority from his school, his anal (literally) gym teacher Mrs Farmer, or, more importantly, the regular hallucinations he is experiencing which involve a giant bunny called Frank.Donnie's grades in school are described as 'intimidating'. This is a major clue in terms of plot: he feels limited by what society is offering him and seeks refuge in the depths of his own imagination. This is one of the ways in which the film's satirical nature is perpetuated.The attention to detail throughout is breathtaking - witness the scene just a few minutes from the start where Donnie cycles home and the fateful red sports car passes him, with the words "the killing time" accompanying in the soundtrack.I will reserve particular praise for the cinematography and soundtrack, both of which add a certain richness and depth to the whole film. Kelly reportedly had a budget of around $3-4m to work with (post-Drew Barrymore intervention) and the results are brilliant. How much was spent on securing song royalties?! Beneath the surface of the film lies a burning, pulsing sense of satire. The way in which the oh-so-moral Mrs Farmer attempts to teach her students about morality and family values yet outrageously sexualises the dance troupe in her command; the self-help guru with a dark secret of his own; the supposed beauty of 'cellar door' sparking off the chain of events leading to tragedy; the idea that your elders may not be completely useless and redundant, in the form of very old neighbour Roberta Sparrow - shown constantly checking her mailbox waiting for Donnie's letter to arrive.One of the key things I think this film tried to make the audience think about was the importance of control, responsibility, and making good decisions. We've already seen in 'Run Lola Run' how life can change inextricably given a matter of minutes between decision making. Control - or perceived control, at least - is what attracts Gretchen to Donnie: her life has a singular lack of it. The abusive stepfather assaulting her mum results in her relocating to Donnie's community and some sort of stability is required from her perspective.Donnie is placed in a position of superheroesque responsibility to protect those he knows. When Frank orders him to flood the school, it is because of the hazard posed in the form of the child molester. A different responsibility ensues when Frank runs Gretchen over - Donnie knows he will have to die so that Gretchen can live. Crucially, he's still in control, hence his relaxed expression as he lies in wait on his bed - a personal sacrifice for, amongst others, the girl he loves.Clearly, Lynch has been an influence on Kelly. I was thinking in particular of the role the man in the red suit performs in the film contrasted against the role of the Cowboy in Mulholland Drive. Both feature as some kind of secondary indicator within the plot.It is extremely rare to watch a film which combines so many genres - horror, romance, sci fi, psychological etc. - and takes you on a ride of so many differing emotions. It is rarer still for that film to pull it off with any degree of success, but Donnie Darko does it with aplomb.</fullReview>

The reason I like it is because it has left me thinking quite a few days after I've seen it. Any movie that can do that for me is considered at least decent in my book.However, the confusion I found in this movie is much the same as found in The Terminator movies. In the terminator a man is sent in the past to save the woman from the terminator. He ends up impregnating her with a son who turns out to be the man who sent him in the past in the first place. This to me doesn't make sense because there is no reason for him to even go in the past until the boy exists and he doesn't exist until he goes in the past. In this movie the same goes for certain events like Frank and the turbine. How can Frank be there to save him if Frank wouldn't have even died unless he was there to lead Donnie to the events of killing him? And why would he save him and then lead him to do all that other stuff and then lead him to finding the way back to where he was supposed to die? I'm sure all of these questions have probably been asked before. Sorry if I'm repeating but does anyone know what the writers really meant by all that stuff? Did they say in one of the special features I didn't see or something? I am usually pretty good at understanding movies like this but for some reason Donnie Darko (and yes that is an awesome name) has got me stumped. It seemed like the movie was supposed to have a special message but I didn't get it because of these things so any help would be appreciated. Thx ~Stephanie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do I like this movie so much?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can safely say I don't know why, how or where I get off recommending this, but I highly do so. It's a really good movie, very unlike most anything else. I won't get into the plot because, when I read the back it deterred me from wanting to see the movie. Given the competition I went ahead and I'm glad I did. It's a unique movie that is a definite 2 thumbs up. Worth the rental. The acting is very well done, it didn't take me long to suspend disbelief and get sucked into the storyline. There was a brief period of "is this going anywhere" feeling. (If you aren't familiar with this feeling watch Eye of the Beholder, that's pretty much the feeling you have the whole movie) but that passes quickly as the movie gets into gear. Then ending is unique, I can't quite say that I saw it coming, and that is almost always the highest compliment I can pay to a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Indie Film Of The New Millennium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What "Pulp Fiction" did for the 90's Donnie Darko does for todays modern cinema. All over the internet, i've heard that the director Richard Kelly is the new Quentin Tarantino. I don't agree with this since their styles are so different and too the kind of movies they make. Their only similarities are that both have written scripts for Tony Scott. But in some ways, their films are similar. Like in Pulp, Donnie Darko has a few pop culture references, outside the box violence, and very well thought out dialog. but thats when the comparisions stop. DD is a mix of sci-fi, teenage drama, physcological thriller, and black humor. the acting is top notch featuring a mix of young talent(Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, Jolene Purdy), Veterans(Mary McDonnell, James Duval, Arthur Taxier) and Hollywood favorites(Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze) all delivering great roles. I would Recommend this for anybody who want to find an indies masterpiece(which is really hard to do) or who just wanna see a great movie that the average moviegoer wouldn't think of watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psychological Thriller that sparks thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all of those who have not seen Donnie Darko I suggest you go see and for all of you who have seen it and thought it to be "stupid" or "corny" I suggest you carefully watch the movie. I cannot think of another movie with so much symbolism (trampoline, American flag) and with a more accurate portrayal of suburban life. My only knock on the movie is the ending, which I will not ruin for all of you haven't see the movie. It's not so much that the ending doesn't work, but it raises questions about the directors motives. Aren't good endings supposed to spark questions and thought? Maybe the director did accomplish what he wanted, the thought process. If you are a fan of non-traditional movies that are thought provoking, then Donnie Darko will be one of your favorites. Contrary, if you are a mindless, ignorant movie observer, than you will loath Donnie Darko and regard it either as a dumb movie or to complicated for you to comprehend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is pretty good.I really enjoyed it. This movie, though, is not for everyone. If you don't enjoy dark humor, aren't willing to watch a movie a couple of times in order to understand it, aren't willing to think about a movie or are unwilling to interpret a movie as you wish, don't bother watching it. After watching the movie, everything will suddenly make complete sense, then an hour later not make any sense, then make a little bit of sense until you watch it a second or third time. Its one of those movies that has no real explanation for the end; the end just sort of happens. Truly a work of art that many should view, less will view, and few will understand. The movie is very freaky and scary at some points in time, but overall not bad in terms of how freaky it is. Just very, very weird.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not much wrong with this movie. It had some chilling scenes with the bunny. Effective use of sound and music. I really liked how the art director made us believe it was the late 1980's. Excellent direction. Excellent acting too.-- SPOILER -- Some think this is a time travel movie.I do not.I believe that when the Jet engine fell on the house in the beginning it actually did kill Donnie. I believe that what we experienced in the 90 or so minutes after was Donnie's last living dream before his mind was starved of oxygen.Regardless this movie makes you think. Which is an accomplishment for any movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see film. I recommend you see Donnie Darko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a troubled teen living in Middlesex, Virginia. The movie is set in 1988. The opening scene is of Donnie waking up in the middle of the road with his bike and in his pyjamas. I was told I would need to watch Donnie Darko a number of times before I understood it but that was not so. It obviously depends on if you are concentrating or not but I have come to this conclusion: Donnie Darko is a film that is left to interpretation. For example he could be imagining the whole thing or this is real and he really did understand the essence of time travel. One thing that is definite though, is that he is a schizophrenic who has stopped taking his pills. Because of this his "daylight hallucinations" are more dangerous and the ones he sees at night are even worse. If you have seen this film please look at the bizarre website: www.donniedarko.com This is by far the best movie I've in my entire existence on this planet ( I am not exaggerating, I've only been on this earth for just over 15yrs).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movies I would've loved to write...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi folks,I watched "Donnie Darko" for the first time last Saturday. I was expecting some kind of teen movie with stupid bunny jokes. Hang me, I was wrong. Damn wrong. I'm gonna review the movie, but not in the way it usually is. I'm going to go over the scenario, this scenario I would've loved to think about.Donnie Darko is written on three levels of interpretations. On the first level it is, an high school movie with a kid talking to a giant bunny. On this first level, I saw some thirteen years old kids finding it funny, but being somewhat uncomfortable with the movie. On the second level is about this science fiction physics-a-go-go riddle that Richard Kelly is proposing us. I am an aficionado of riddle movies. Donnie receives messages from a giant bunny in his sleep, ordering him to do stuff like flooding a school or burning a pervert's house...in order to save the world. This bunny in fact announced the end of the universe after a jet engine fell from nowhere on Donnie's house...while he was curiously sleepwalking. What is this all about? Well watch this movie and find out. I gotta say it's one of the most challenging riddle movie i've seen.The third level of narration is in my opinion the most important one, and it struck me right in the heart. I think that most of all, Donnie Darko is a critic of conformism..and a powerful one. Donnie Darko, by being the "choosen one" who receives the big bunny messages gets to feel solitude and difference in his ultra-conformist religious school. Take a good look at every scene where the confrontation with Jim Cunningham, the epitome of conformism in this movie are somewhat touching. I felt the pain of Darko's solitude and fear or what he didn't understood.Great great movie from a very young director. Everyone should love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Eulogy for Wasted Lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend of mine brought the DVD round to have with tortilla chips and a home made salsa - and to ask me what I thought it was about. At first viewing I loved it for the sound track, but thought it was weird and didn't really understand it at all. A year later, at second viewing I thought that maybe I did. Perhaps not all of it, but the important thing for me behind it all.Donny's lesson is the effect that one life can have on all those around them, or at least could have done. What you see is a good deal of happiness and enlightenment and a justice which is anarchic yet poetic is brought into the lives of others by this obviously somewhat ill young man.Yes, he's ill, that much is very clear. That night he goes to his room, having been teased by his sisters and nagged about his medication, feeling sad, his mum does try to help. Then the fuselage lands, and the crossroads has been reached. Only then do we get a glimpse of life with Donny and without him; the first, full of weirdness admittedly, but a great deal of humour and touching ordinary life stuff with love and parties and good stuff, and the second showing the people who never had the chance to have those good times either with or because of him.I have become sure that the falling fuselage is a metaphor. I am surprised to hear this called a comedy, for to me it is far from it. Yes, it has humour, but its primary purpose is to make us think, to ponder a life, a death, not to make us laugh. The second time I saw it, I cried when I realised. As a depressive, or perhaps even a schizophrenic, Donny felt under unbearable pressure as represented by the fuselage. That half of his family were aboard the plane was the irony, and almost certainly part of the metaphor for the pressure he was under.Donny, I think, killed himself; the film is telling us how much of a waste that is. I'm sure we know that much already, but that's what it said to me. And weird though he was, which of us didn't think Donny was a hero? Yet he felt himself worthless and couldn't bear his own life any more.But it's still a fantastic soundtrack.lazylaurablue</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A not only great very smart film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko is a good drama/sci-fi film. Its left open to interpretation yet does make some great subtle commentary about society, religion and some other issues. Set in a retro-like prep school (looks like the 80s), Gyllenhaal plays donnie Darko a rebelling student. The film is written well, and directed also fairly well by Richard Kelly. The cast is good, i liked Gyllenhaal in the lead, he was very convincing. Jena Malone was also great in the female role of a girl he starts "going" with. I thought Noah Wyle and Patrick Swayze were both great in short supporting roles. Drew Barrymore wasn't that great as one of Donnie's teachers, i didn't like her in this role (i rarely am convinced by her anyways). This film i think is worshipped by a lot of people, although I didn't find it as perfect as some, i thought it was a great entertaining film. 9/10 #115 on my list of all-time favorite films</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahh, one of my favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is actually one of my favorites. The whole idea of the film will make you think back on everything that happened in the whole movie. Richard Kelly has a vivid imagination, and was extremely lucky to get the cast that he was after. The feel of it is actually real, unlike other movies which have families that you don't actually believe are real. In this film, he was able to have a cast that acted well together and felt real. You can't get a plot like this and a cast like this very often. The way the movie was filmed is amazing as well, with more emotion in the words and actions than in most movies these days. It's so emotional, and Jake Gyllenhaal did a magnificent performance as a troubled young man in search of...well, that's for you to find out I suppose. Mary McDonnell, as well as the rest of the cast, had a wonderful performance as the mother of Donnie Darko. The emotions, again, are something that you don't find everyday in a film. Richard Kelly uses everyday situations that you encounter with family members, even the smallest scene. But this is something that I enjoyed because it's nothing too overbearing. Most movies take it to another step of "dysfunctional", but in this film you feel like you've known the family for years right from the first scene when you see them together, and Kelly keeps this throughout the film. A very enjoyable film.</fullReview>

It is a very confusing tale relating with a troubled teenager trying to escape the pain of escaping his inner pain all dealing with the subject of time travel.It is not a very intense movie for being rate "R" there is brief violence only one real scene, some language containg some f words and the drug content is very mild. It is not very younger children not much for the sake of "rating" but for the themes and the story itself which very hard to follow. Many people will not understand until watching it about 2-4 times. I had to watch it twice to really get it.all in all this is a piece of movie-making genius, and i believe is very underrated.

		<fullReview>A delusional high school student (Jake Gyllenhaal) by the name of Donnie Darko has visions by a mysterious figure (James Duval). The mysterious figure dressed as a rabbit is telling Donnie eerie visions of the past and future. This suburban teen has to come face to face with his dark destiny.Directed by first-time filmmaker:Richard Kelly made an excitingly original, edgy, psychological, sci-fi/thriller with an dark sense of humor. Gyllenhall is excellent in the film. The film has an terrific supporting cast including:Jena Maline, Drew Barrymore, Mary Mc Donnell, Katherine Ross, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Holmes Osborne, Daveigh Chase, Patrick Swayze, Beth Grant and Noah Wyle. This independent film was well received but it turned into a box office flop. The film become a major cult hit on DVD that has a huge following.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an entertaining commentary track by the director and actor:Gyllenhall. DVD also has another commentary track by the cast and crew. DVD also has Deleted/Extended Scenes with optional director's commentary, music video. original theatrical trailer, t.v. spots, hidden features and more.The Director's Cut DVD has an terrific anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an excellent-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an new commentary track by filmmakers:Richard Kelly and fan of the film-Kevin Smith (Clecks, Chasing Amy, Dogma). Disc Two has an production diary with optional commentary by the director of photography:Steven Poster (Dead &amp; Buried), a hilarious Donnie Darko fan #1, featurettes and the theatrical trailer for the director's cut. Some will love this Director's Cut more than the Original Theatrical Version. So, judge it for yourself. This is one of the most unique and underrated films of 2001. Barrymore is also one of the executive producers of the film. Nicely photographed by Steven Poster. The film has a terrific remake of a Tears for Fears song-Mad World by Gary Jules. Do not miss this. Written by the director. Panavision. (**** ?/***** for both versions).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enlightening and totally enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so amazing. I really loved it, the only character I disliked being Drew Barrymore's. Thrilling at parts and hilarious at others, it's one of those rare black comedy/romance/psychological thrillers that I was hooked on from beginning to end. Watch this as long as you won't be offended by quite strong language or permanently scarred by a man in a bunny suit. I've seen it too many times to count, and each time I'm surprised by the new depth I discover. Levels of story and characters keep on emerging, making this one of those movies you won't get bored of after seeing it again and again. Everything comes together in the end, or it will if you've followed everything closely up till that point. This film covers everything from child pornography to the Smurfs. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a fantastic performance as Donnie Darko, a guy with serious problems, including a man dressed in a pink bunny suit and insect mask named Frank whom only he can see. Maggie Gyllenhaal is playing her real-life role as his sister. Jena Malone is awesome in her role as Donnie's love interest, a tough job for anyone. Drew Barrymore is all right, but I got the feeling that she was only there to give the film real star-power; her character was needlessly put in in some scenes. However, one finds him- or herself involved in the characters' lives, from Donnie's troubled mind to his mother's lack of commitment to Sparkle Motion. It's not a movie for the faint of heart or tolerance to raunchy language and dialog. Even when this movie is making fun of things, like evangelists, it is giving its opinions and thoughts. This is NOT a movie in which you can drift off, not pay attention, or think of as a light-hearted farce. Don't be fooled by anything you may have heard about this being for laughs; sure, it's funny at parts, but that isn't what it's about. "Donnie Darko" is a new turn on emotional distress in adolescents, time travel, and psychiatry. I don't even pretend to fully comprehend the true meaning of this movie. Maybe I'm taking it too seriously, but I find it more likely that I just don't understand what was and is happening in the minds of the people who made this movie or in the minds of people who actually know what this means. I've been blown away by other movies, but this one made me think more than anything. Try not to be too skeptical about the views in this movie, and don't be saddened by the surprising deaths. I can't think of another movie that stirred me as much as this one. See it, because even if it doesn't affect you as it did me, it will provide a couple hours of enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw Donnie Darko after hearing about it from my sister-in-law. My wife and I subsequently went out and bought the Director's Cut DVD because the theatrical version was so good, but a bit lacking in info. The Director's Cut ties up some of the loose ends in the theatrical version, and leaves you with even more wonder and love for this movie. Trying to describe this movie is quite difficult, but suffice it to say that it's a dark, satirical look at today's society, growing up, and mind games all rolled into one little movie.If you like movies that get your mind racing then this movie is for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie is the saviour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is, like Mullholland Drive, Blue Velvet and others before, a personal movie. Kelly has provided his viewers with a canvas open to their own interpretation. My personal interpretation runs along the lines of Donnie functioning as the worlds saviour, realigning the balance between the Tangent universes. The first part of the film sees Donnie fighting against the forces of the world he feels threatens him. His struggle manifests itself in his neurosis and visions of Frank. In this part of the movie Roberta Sparrow's declaration that we all die alone is negative to Donnie. However as things become clearer to him (and more confusing to us)he realises that he has to die alone, he has to die to save Gretchen and put things back the way they should be. The final part of the film focuses on Donnies acceptance of this. Frank must die in order to free Donnie who in turn saves Gretchen. Donnie declares 'Our Saviour' after Gretchen's death and heads home to sacrifice himself to rectify the traumatic events. The films ending poses the question to us that can one death to save others be justified? The personal nature of the movie creates many question and an equal number of interpretations. Flaws in its analysis are impossible to avoid but that is the best part of this cult classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a beautiful movie, yet it will haunt your mind. Donnie Darko is a story of a teenager (Gyllenhaal) who sees an evil rabbit named Frank who tells him the world is ending and he must stop it. The brilliance of this movie lies within your mind. Even after you see the outcome, your mind will have just started to comprehend it. It is recommended to view this mulitple times, because there is so much to comprehend and if you see this in one viewing, you cannot possibly take it all in. This movie is a masterpiece, Kelly struck gold. Gyllenhaal's performance is by and far the best of 2001. An honorable mention goes out to Mary McDonnell for providing some of the most emotionally taxing yet subtle scenes I've seen in a movie. This movie captures '80's Suburbia perfectly and the soundtrack proves it. This movie is for those willing to think about the reality of time, love, and existence. Do not expect a typical teen horror flick. Expect one of the most thought provoking movies ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all know the story of the teenager full of angst; it's an old tale. But this movie takes the teenager and put him into a new situation?. The end of the world! Seriously though, the atmosphere of this movie hits you and keeps attached throughout the whole film. The story line is thought provoking and quite deep; it leaves quite a lot of the story open for the viewer to view it in their own way (intentional or not..). This has lead to most people saying that, to get the real idea of 'Donnie Darko' you should watch it at least twice. Well in my opinion there is no need, I understood most of the story in the first viewing. The only problem being that with misunderstanding of the story this film could be discarded as rubbish. (I have also been told that this film is stupid because it makes no sense, this was by the same person who said exactly the same about the less confusing matrix??) The film is about a kid (conveniently named Donnie Darko) who has been having 'emotional problems' for some time. This has lead Donnie to be seeing a therapist about it, this seems has no effect on his problems. Donnie has been having visions of this 6 feet tall rabbit, called frank. The first time we encounter Frank we discover that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds.So we follow Donnie for the next 28 days, with his development on the end of the world. With more encounters with Frank (don't worry it all becomes clear close to the end) and characters such as 'Grandma Death', Donnie's teachers, friends and family all add to Donnie's development and his realisation that, with fate, we all die alone. As you can probably guess this is no 'sexy cheerleader, oh my God she is taking them off' teen movie but a deep thought provoking film about alienation and the meaning of life.Not that this film is perfect it has some flaws. I felt that his dreams, full of special effects seemed to go on a bit too long. I got the point of Frank after a while; I didn't need to know that Donnie couldn't stab him because of a force field. The only things I can find wrong are tiny pathetic things like that, so no major problems.I wouldn't advise people to go and see this if you are too lazy (or stupid) to think about what is happening. Also if you enjoy the mindless Hollywood trash then this is not the movie for you. But for all the people who are willing to go and watch a thinking persons movie then, this is for you! So go and watch it now you thinkers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had a profound experience on my life, especially as before watching this film i could be categorised as a bruckhiemer, slow-motion action film nut. Watching films for explosions never caring less what the story was.then i had the urge to watch Donnie darko. The main picture of frank was like an intense calling to me, so i gave it a shotand what a shot it was! It is without a doubt the best cinema experience i have ever had. Now let me clear this up, it is not the best film i have ever seen(pretty close though) but the best cinema experience. The perfect musical score running through the speakers, giving me goosebumps at certain points of the film. getting this films on DVD was good, but seeing this film in cinema just seems divine. There is probably enough comments on her telling you how good the film is so let me just say they are right. It is not a film for everyone, some will hate it, some will love it (like that stupid crap mar-mite). For some the aspect of this film is so profoundly confusing that i have spent many days explaining it to others.But the film is confusing, as it is supposed to be, this is not a clear cut Hollywood blockbuster, direct line throughout the film, this is supposed to make you think, feel, it will make you use a range of emotions in such a short period of time. Watching this film in the cinema changed my views on films and i will never have the same experience as i did with this film. Richard Kelly, you bow to no-one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Donnie Darko' has a reputation for being a seriously strange film; but in some ways, it's undeserved. This is not just to say that it is fundamentally very conventional compared with the work of the likes of Bunel; it's actually far coherent than many mainstream science fiction thrillers (for example, 'Open My Eyes', or it's American remake, 'Vanilla Sky', which where simply praised for their "dazzling" plots); or horror films like the 'Ring' cycle. My guess is that audiences were thrown primarily because of the expectations of genre; supernatural, surreal happenings are simply not supposed to appear in what is partly a teen movie, and partly a suburban satire. As a straight film, 'Donnie Darko' isn't bad: all the sympathetic characters are unnaturally beautiful, of course, and there are the customary easy pops at educational behaviourists (to a Briton, this recurrent aspect of American teen movies is very strange, can they really be so prevalent to deserve this amount of attention?); but there's some nice dark comedy, and the acting and editing are generally of a high standard. It even manages to possess a good soundtrack using 1980s songs (in my opinion, quite an achievement in itself!). As science fiction, on the other hand, it bears some resemblance to Douglas Copeland's book, 'Girlfriend in a Coma' (and indeed, makes much more sense than that book did). What it doesn't give us is any indication of why the events we see should happen to its hero; the film may be sensible, but it's also essentially meaningless. Nonetheless, it's intelligently made, distinctive, and not really that confusing, providing you leave your preconceptions at the cinema door.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Swayze subplot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my biggest sticking point with this movie. Was the subplot needed? I know it showed that Donnie could be dangerous and added to the mystery of Donnie's psychoses, but why was Swayze's character Jim crying at the end? Had he also been saved by Donnie's sacrifice and would now give up this wicked ways? Or was he crying for his own wickedness?I know it added another level to this film, and showed Frank's advice to burn down the house to be based on moral values thereby showing the Frank/Donnie relationship to be based on good not evil. But I still feel Swayze was a subplot too far. What do you guys think?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the movie is probably one of the greatest movies made!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people need to see the movie twice to like it, and three times to get it. The best part of the movie is the 2 hour conversation afterwards. If you like movies that make you think about society, politics, religion, science, etc. then you will love this movie. The reason why this film is so great is that the topics are not blatantly portrayed, everything is hidden and has multiple meanings. every scene, every line, every image is filled with metaphors, similes, symbolisms, etc. it's poetry on film. definitely a must see, everybody that i've recommend it to has loved it, well actually disliked it initially then loved it after we talked about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is the tale of a troubled boy trying to get through adolescence. In the first scene, you start by finding Donnie alone and asleep by the side of the road somewhere. After he gets home, you meet his family, who are rather bad-mouthed (at least the kids) but a normal American family nonetheless. You discover, after Donnie goes to bed, that he seems to be a chronic sleepwalker, and you watch as, after hearing some strange voice, follows it downstairs and out into the yard. A giant rabbit awaits him there, who, after saving him from a deadly disaster, tells him the world is going to end. Donnie realizes that he must find a way to save the world, do whatever his imaginary savior asks (Which may include some things you wouldn't want your child doing), and romance the neighbor girl before that time comes, and before he is locked up for being the neighborhood "nutter".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie for the first time a couple of weeks ago on the TV with my brother. At the end we were "big-eyed" because non of us understood it. But something told me I should see it once more. So I downloaded it from the internet. Till today, I've watched it several times and I want to watch it more. Because it hasn't rang a bell to me yet. But the story is more than exciting! I understand the movie part by part... but I can't seem to put all parts together. But Donnie and his personality are everything but usual, that's why he amazed me so much. I recommend it to everybody who thinks a human mind is much more that only a human mind and the ones who think that time in much more than only time. It tries to show the world behind the facts and it really is great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie basically follows Donnie Darko, a teen who recently survived a brush with death. Afterwards, he is plagued by visions and becomes obsessed with time travel. I'm not going to spell out all the details to you but I can say that the storyline is very complex and will most definitely take more than one viewing to understand fully. The movie is very depressing but at the same time it's a happy story as well. It's very paradoxical in the sense that you don't know how you should feel about it. I even went to the official website for more information but the website is a mystery as well. The acting in the film is really good and the music fits well with the mood of the movie. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best way to describe it is.....scrumtrulescent. Although great acting abounded, It was the Story that captivated audiences the most. You go from a series of disconnected events to an actual cohesive piece as the movie concludes. It isn't a feel-good movie that one could easily predict the outcome. This characteristic added to the captivation of audiences. Another aspect of the movie that was part creepy and equally captivating was the seemingly random use of a dead looking bunny. This character makes sense as the movie progresses, but initially it strikes audiences as intriguing. I only wish more movies were like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko: When Reality Meets Something Different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko. There are a few movies I can think of that are quite like it.One can argue that from the opening scene of the movie, when Donnie rides his bike home, and that eerie piano solo comes in, the movie is dripping with an atmosphere just on this side of paranormal.It has some classic supernatural entities that make it a beautifully creative film. Donnie's hallucinations in the form of Frank for example. How many films have a six foot menacing rabbit with a skull face talking to a teenage boy? There is also the element of time travel which, as the movie unravels, becomes the base of everything that goes wrong, and in the end seems to go right with the sort of bittersweet bite that any teenager can appreciate.But, outside the realm of the supernatural, is a reality to the film that anyone can relate to. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the epitome of a troubled, confused and lost teen in the character of Donnie. There is family relationships, issues of societal acceptance, and even teenage romance to aide in the reality of the story.A movie with both reality and then para-normality is a winner in every interest circle. And that is what Donnie Darko is. It touches a person wherever that person likes to be touched and leaves them emotionally and cognitively effected in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DONNIE DARKO is a cleverly written story about a teenage boy in high school, whose mental illness causes him to speak his mind (a very human thing to do), as well as have hallucinations of a giant, deformed rabbit (not as normal). His name is Frank. Frank tells Donnie when the world will end, and 'forces' him to perform violent acts. Donnie obeys him because he believes that Frank saved him from being killed by a jet engine that unusually fell from the sky. As Donnie begins to experience more and more unusual occurrences and signs that only he can see, he tries to get as much information on one key element that he believes is critical to explaining Frank - time travel.As soon as the movie begins, you are met with fine acting from Jake Gylenhaal (Donnie), Jena Malone (his girlfriend, Gretchen) and from Drew Barrymore (his influential English teacher) a little later in the story. The course of events in the story is entertaining and suspenseful. When you think something big is going to happen, something actually does, though you don't realize it right away. And when everything seems normal...pay close attention. The subplots and simultaneous (though unexplained) vignettes that link to the main plot are interesting to the story in whole.Along with the main suspense story there is a good, realistic view of high school and home life. The dialogue is real, intriguing, and easy to relate to. Also, the special effects in some parts of the movie are awesome; giving eerie, majestic, or futuristic auras.Donnie Darko is an important movie because it delves into a not often ventured part of life -questioning its normality; e.g. What happens to the dead? Do all living things follow a predefined course of life? Can we change our path? etc. It goes deep enough to inspire the viewers' own thoughts, though not enough to answer those questions, to be general.Overall, I believe Donnie Darko was an excellent film that should be seen by all teenagers in high school as well as adults. If you've already seen it, it may be good to watch it again to pick up on some details that may have passed you by the first time.*****/***** (9/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darco has unbelievable emotion range and at the same time is an intensely thought provoking movie. I am currently reading a book called "A Universe In A Nutshell" and my favorite movie ever made is "Fight Club" so you might be able to tell right away (if you have seen this film) that I have thoroughly enjoyed it.The part when he is discussing time travel with his science teacher and rebelliously lashes out at that conservative town teacher (who is quite hysterical, adding to the elusive deranged theme of the movie) who tries to tell Donnie to sum up life between the categories of 'fear' and 'love', are two of the best scenes.Since I have been reading a lot lately and currently have some supplement knowledge about quantom theory and time travel it somewhat helped me decipher the movie to find out if it was even more than an artistic creation. Donnie Darco cinematic ally is filmed showing his alternate universe if a fictional rabbit with a bunny suit had got him out of the house before the jet engine had crushed Donnie Darco. As you see the movie unfold you notice how this tangent universe (or more simply, altered destiny) has shaped this new personality Darco exhibits. This is where I think the brilliance of the movie is based on two factors, all the relevant emotions subtly exchanged in the movie and more implicit were in the editing, directing, and screenplay that added an extra element of complication in the movie by giving the audience information about this tangent universe, majority of the movie emphasizing a great experience for the moviegoers.The energy coming out of your chest outlying your expected path in time was a great and nicely visually represented helping me to grasp quantum theory, it shows how empty space really isn't empty but is very dynamic and that spacetime is indeed curved (time is constant but also variable, which shows how you can continue on spacetime through a tangent and ultimately rejoin spacetime at a later personal time...which may or may not have been one of the hidden suspenses in the movie).One theorized way to find out if there is a fourth-dimension is to spatially subtract finite empty matter, invalid space, relevant to valid space. This is the tip of Hawking's mathematical depth.I was also thinking that after he was talking to the scientist about spacetime that he would perhaps find a way to travel to the speed of light to change his destiny.Before I want to get to far ahead of myself, this is what's going on. This movie is the only movie that you can say contains everything you could possibly need in a movie. Science, entertainment, visualization, suspense. And if I'm not mistaken, a truly grand decision by the crew of this movie who knew when they made it that it could entertain on all levels and also incorporate very creative artistic talent. ***Spoilers***As far as the ending goes, I infer that the ending basically shows Donnie Darko going back in time. And embracing his original fate or dying in order to save Gretchen (because she would have never met him in the first place and got killed) and also to surrender because of his basic knowledge (from Frank) about the world that shows him that people die alone and that he'd rather just accept his original fate then go on knowing he could have prevent Gretchen's death and have the knowledge of such despairs in the world. Donnie took these thoughts well and in a comedic sense said "f-this" and just went on and died the way it was intended for him.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is creative, its a super hero movie that you don't find out is a superhero movie until its over, and the use of time travel and world destruction is new as well. The pace is off, it feels much longer then it is, thats a problem, it makes it feel boring, even though it really isn't, it feels that way. I was expecting Donnie to do a lot more then he did, i was expecting more pranks and anarcistic deeds then what we got, we see him flood the school, burn a house, shoot someone, thats it, for entertainment value we should get some funny and shocking mischief. The performances were decent, no Oscar material, but tolerable. It has its moments, but overall, it could be a much better film, 6 out of a 10. I hope to see more films that kelly writes, but not directs, hopefully since Scott is directing Domino it will be a great movie with a great story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a debut film... It's a good DEBUT film. But put all of this into perspective, people. The hype behind this movie is really getting out of hand. This kind of art-film-for-idiot-teenagers movie (Garden State, Napoleon Dynamite, etc.) makes so many peoples' (and even critics') top 10s, that it's just completely made Donnie Darko into a better film than it is.Just watch the damn thing and you'll see that it's a first-time director with a lot of mistakes to make (a Deus Ex Machina in your first film dude?), a fair amount of money, not a lot of time, but a whole lot of potential that, somehow, I don't think he's going to live up to with his next 3 films -- considering the frenzy surrounding him.It seems to me that the only reason most people own this movie is because it was $9.99 at Best Buy, and their friends told them to do so. I find it incredulous that this movie is in the IMDb top 100. Those of you who voted this movie a 9 or 10 need to get your cinematic head off of your hype boner (or out of your hype-filled ass, whichever is funnier). 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Questions Aplenty (Based on original release)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a science fiction kind of guy, so when I heard the good word about the movie Donnie Darko, I was excited. My anticipation was only partially met. Yes, it is a quality science fiction movie, but there could have been a lot more to it, and a little less of an ambiguous ending. I do not mind having unanswered questions at the end of the movie, but I just thought there was too much to this movie that we were expected to know. Regardless, any movie where the world is scheduled to end by a certain date automatically has my attention, I like that kind of thing. The acting, especially Jake Gyllenhaal in the title character, is top notch, and since it takes place in the late 1980s, there is fun nostalgia of the date. The political divide between the older Bush parents and the young Dukakis kids is priceless. The movie revolves around Donnie Darko who has an invisible friend Frank who walk around in Darko's mind in an evil looking bunny rabbit suit. The music sets the tone to the movie perfectly, lots of 80s songs and low, quiet composed music setting the mood of despair and questioning of what's really going on. While a fun movie, the ending left me asking questions about what we saw, and that's good, but I thought there was one question too many. Perhaps the longer director's cut helps wrap up the movie a little better. A mentally challenging movie to be sure and would be perfect if we were presented with all of the facts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was not one of them. I will give this movie a (generous) 9 because i did like it and found it, as an artist, very inspiring. Darko is a movie that sucked me in and i found myself on the edge of my seat while watching it. The intro of the dark bunnie in the golf course was twisted and awesome and the movie did a great job of retaining its dark, morbid and twisted feel.....until the end. Well, let me switch gears and say that i have found that one, it is hard to be creative or find a movie that is halfway creative and even harder to be original and unpredictable. Darko did a great job of being both original and unpredictable (in the beginning). Yet, soooo many movies suck you in for the first half, then have a totally disappointing and predictable ending. A masterpiece movie that comes to mind is Pulp Fiction, where as the movie is playing, you're thinking to yourself, what the heck is going to happen next? It's like being on a rollarcoaster. The difference, and the reason Darko is not a masterpiece, is because the ending crashed and burned, as do the vast majority of movies that start off great. The major turning point and downturn was the moment Frank the Bunny removed his mask. This most evil, twisted and mysterious character and ingredient in the movie, was a simple (goofy/dorky) human who was no longer scary or suspenseful. The ending also brought to mind 'Jacob's Ladder' where the main character (Tim Robbins) is critically hurt in Vietnam, he survives, returns to America and his life is played out until the very end, he is projected back into Vietnam at the pivotal point where he can either fight to live or let go and decides to let go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a teenager who lives a normal life. Until that fateful date October 2nd 1988, strange occurrences and events will happen to Donnie which he cannot explain.The movie begins on a cliff top. Donnie Darko gazes at the horizon at night. He then rides his bike to his home, and everything seems quite normal. Later on that night he goes to bed and swears at his Mom for no reason.He then hears a strange voice from somewhere it summons him to follow this Bunny it says "In 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds the world will end". Donnie sleepwalks out of the house. Just as he leaves a plane crashes into his Mom's house he just left. Nobody was killed or injured.The next 28 days Donnie Darko will behave in a more aggressive manner towards his friends and family. The Bunny appears several times in this movie and tells Donnie to perform evil acts of violence such as flooding a school and arson. Later on he meets a girl at school. It's all very confusing and hard to figure out why this Bunny talks to Donnie, it all becomes clearer at the end or does it. I won't give the ending away it will spoil your enjoyment. When I Watched the ending I was surprised, amazed, confused and bewildered. You will be too unless you are clever and solved the clues to this complex movie.Definitely watch Donnie Darko for it's original,brilliant and fantastic story. The best movie I've seen in a long time. I am going to see it at least 2 more times,it's that good. Also I will buy it on DVD. Don't miss it your perspective on life will make you think.</fullReview>

He Also Says Hungry Hungry Hippos in a funny way when he is with his psychologies. Grandma Death is a good character as well in this film and plays a major part. Evertime You see the Darko Family Donnie and his little Sister Samantha are always on that bloody trampoline. They are always on it !!!

		<fullReview>The porthole opens right before the moment of Donnie's death.Frank knows this, and gives Donnie the opportunity to experience a tangential existence in which Donnie escapes death. Inevitably, Donnie realizes that a universe in which fate is denied is doomed.When the porthole closes, on the date specified by Frank, Donnie has the choice of whether or not to live in this tangential existence. For him, the choice is either, watching everything around him crumble, or leaving before the porthole closes then dying. It's live and be alone, or die and face the unknown.I guess the movie has no real meaning, rather, just plays with unproved scientific and philosophical ideas.Frank possibly is God, who for unknown reasons chooses Donnie for this experience.The film may also be suggesting things about the nature of death, and that possibly, before any of us die, we are shown a 'truth' which allows us to know that the life we have lead is both meaningful and meaningless, and that we are part of an organic process that allows to just 'be'in the moment of death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the simplest answer is usually the correct answer, I give my theory for everyone to ponder.The entire movie, including many days prior to it taking place, up the the point right after the engine hits (second hit) and kills him, takes place in dream as Donnie dies.There was no missing aircraft, no girlfriend, no psychiatrist, no murders ,imaginary friends or time travel. This was all a figment of Donnie's imagination, a product of his brain losing oxygen while he died.When Donnie is hit with the engine of the aircraft, he dies almost instantly. His mind struggles to comprehend as it runs out of energy.The only part of the movie that may have existed outside of his mind was the just after the second crash as the family stand crying in the yard. As this point there is no mention of what happened other than an engine hitting the house, (no missing aircraft). there is only a scene of the engine being extracted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All time travel films are confusing as they leave you asking many questions and you can only come to the conclusion that it isn't possible. Donnie Darko is the story of a teenage boy who is mentally stalked by a huge bunny rabbit called Frank. Frank tells Donnie to do a series of chaotic acts. Donnie (...and the audience) is then on a journey to find out what it all means. In his struggle he his helped by girlfriend Gretchen, who turns out to be the key to his fate.He sees his life lay out in front of him and realises for others to live he must die. It is an entertaining film with a rather good soundtrack . It deals with the idea of fate, what should or could happen.

It's a good movie to watch if you have all day and want to do some thinking. The characters were very real, and the whole movie was well-written. Jake Gyllenhaal is the love of my life - he's so cute! And he did a good job in this movie (at least I thought so), also Jenna Malone is one of my favorite actresses, as is Maggie Gyllenhaal. Overall, I loved it, and it made me think, which I don't do that often about mainstream movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this is what I look for in a movie. Honestly, most likely over my head.However, I'd rather be stumped by a movie, than to have it too easily discovered in the first 10 mins. of viewing. I plan on watching this movie many many times. I have more questions than answers right now. Nevertheless, I just know I really enjoyed the depth and dark humor of this film. To think, I almost didn't see it.I think everyone that worked on this film were at the peak of their game. Even Noah Wyle. No one tried to go overboard on dramatics, and still it was all pulled off convincingly. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone and I don't want to say anymore. This one MUST be enjoyed without any information before-hand.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>incredible in many different directions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie summarizes artistic and symbolic film making. With parallels left and right I couldn't stop thinking about it after I had seen it for the first time. On the outside it's a story that could be either really weird or really stupid, but the actual film displays an idea of time travel/paranormal capabilities of any one human being is enough to get one started on trying to unfold the story itself. Donnie is also seen as a kind of a super hero in his attempts to rectify his destiny that he is so eagerly trying to find. Plus, who can escape the relationships between Jim Cunningham and the Anti-Christ as well as the strange link to Frank who was the cause of the whole predicament of Donnie's. This movie makes you think and if you'll watch it again, take a look at how the director is trying to tell you the inside of all that's going on, not just what the story is unfolding for you. That is the definition of creativity on screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw D.D. when it was released on video (and just re-rented it this weekend); I've avoided purchasing it so that it stays fresh - I'd probably over-view it if it were on-hand. The actors obviously felt strongly about the script, which bodes well for the future of American cinema as it is brilliant. Watching the bonus scenes on the DVD filled in a few holes - for those that haven't seen these scenes, I recommend them highly.There's too much great content to comment on. Loved it because it talks to the shadowy parts of our souls that we seldom get to see in life as well as on the screen.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Destined to Become a Cult Favorite!" (Not a Spoiler!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has become one of my all time favorite flicks, even though I'm nota fanatical about the fantasy or sci-fi genres. To genuinely appreciatethis film, you don't have to be either. It contains elements of drama,comedy and romance that are as dominant and effective as any other. This is the sparkling debut of young writer, director Richard Kelly ashis first feature length film. Along with being superbly written anddirected it is also very visual, as the cinematography is phenomenal.Also, if you're into 80's music then you should love the soundtrack. Asif all this weren't enough, the film is also superbly cast.Jake Gyllenhaal, who is fantastic in his portrayal of Donnie Darko,became a household name and received considerably more notoriety forhis work in the more recent film "The Good Girl". This is unfortunateconsidering "Donnie Darko" was a much better flick. Don't take my wordfor it; consult the IMDb top 250 films. As of August 14, 2004, "DonnieDarko" is ranked number 93, "The Good Girl", (which wasn't bad), doesn'tplace in the top 250. Between his roles in these two films Gyllenhaalmanaged to illustrate a substantial amount of versatility, although thepart of Darko seemed to be a significantly better fit for him.Strangely, only the title role in this film can be specificallycategorized as a lead. However, the supporting cast lends as much to theoverall achievement of this piece as any I've ever seen. There are ahost of cast members, including Mary McDonnell, Jena Malone, DrewBarrymore, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Noah Wyle that play integral roles,which are vital to the success of the film. A prime example is PatrickSwayze's cameo in which he may have finally found his niche. He playsthe part of a Cheese Ball who turns out to be a Sleaze Ball. Who knows,If he had confined himself to this type of role at the beginning of hiscareer he might have become one of my favorite actors.One thing in particular that added to the ambiance of this flick, andsomething that I found quite puzzling, is the fact that the story lineis based, in part, on time travel, and is set in 1988. Under normalcircumstances the basis for such an effect would be to allow someportion of the story to relate to the present, (the time in which thefilm was actually made). Here, this is not the case at all. The timetravel element, which is far from conventional, is based on a period ofless than a month. This is fascinating to me because when people watchthis film twenty years from now, and they will, most will automaticallyassume that it was made in 1988, not 2001. In effect, Kelly has createda period piece for no apparent reason. I've encouraged a relatively significant number of people to watch thismovie and the results have been extraordinary. This may be the onlyrecommendation I've ever made to ten or more individuals withoutreceiving any negative feedback. Don't get me wrong, I have yet to boastabout the film to any of my associates who choose to confine theirviewing choices to the Lifetime Network.Read the plot outline and if it doesn't impress you, force yourself andwatch it anyway. There's a good chance that you'll be pleasantlysurprised. I know I was!</fullReview>

And who the hell is Frank!-cos from the beginning we all think that he is donnie's imagination, but then at the end, he is a real guy who, killed Gretchen?Sorry to say but no wonder this movie never came out in the cinemas...and no wonder its only 4 quid in HMV.... Another thing, what the hell happened to Reberta Sparrow?-and like the letter and stuff......oh stuff this!-this movie made no sense, but i mean it was pretty cool, in a way, its just that i just finished watching the movie on DVD and its 3:12am here in England...and I'm a HUGE movie fan and i cant sleep with all these unanswered questions!!!!!!!!

I can look extremely deep and class them as the devil and guardian angel as Sharita has a book on Donnie maybe she just admired him or was it his book of destiny because when he says every thing is going to be OK she screams and runs is this because she knows whats going to happen to him and that he had dodged fate and everyone would be effected? The man in orange suit is only seen twice he stops Donnie from kissing Gretchen for first time maybe this is because he wants Donnie to stay alone also when its the Halloween party he is outside again and Gretchen comes goes to grandma deaths house with Donnie and dies the devil had want he wanted in getting Donnie to be alone but Donnie notices what he had done and when Gretchen had died he realized he was meant to be alone and had gone down the path of evil in dodging his death then goes back in time to follow gods path.

		<fullReview>I've never seen a movie quite like Donnie Darko and I can guarantee I will never see one like it again. For some unknown reason this movie had a good grasp on my attention and never let go.The plot is confusing and it's hard to even summarize, but I can tell you it had such elements as fear, time travel, destiny, teen romance... and how can I forget demonic bunnies and pedophiles? This movie is so far-fetched but it's one of the best (and certainly most deranged) movies I've ever seen.And if you're wondering, Donnie Darko is the name of the main character. Poor Donnie seems a bit on the schizo side(what with seeing those demonic bunnies) but he's a great character and one of the most interesting protagonists(?) I've ever seen. And the other characters certainly add a little somethin' to the awesomely outlandish yet amazing plot.Things just don't get any weirder than Donnie Darko. Final Thought: Watch-worthy but don't strain yourself too hard trying to realize what's going on. I did, and now I have a headache.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a typical teenager, with the usual issues that permeate the high school years, but his life takes a strange twist when he begins to have visions of a demonic rabbit named "Frank." Each of his choices effect the options in his life, but in the end, he makes one last choice. For those of you who have read Nikos Kazantzakis's "the Last Temptation of Christ", this movie seems based upon the same story line with a little Star Trek and teen love thrown in. It combines both the lightness of a love story and the darkness of a horror drama. For most of the movie, all the extra "threads" that run through the movie may seems needless, but at the climax, they are what pull the movie together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>( SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS AHEAD ! ! ! ! SEE IT FIRST AND THEN READ THIS - DON'T LET ME RUIN IT FOR YOU ! ! ! ! !) It's Sunday night in New York and I just walked home from a dazed viewing of the new Director's Cut of Donnie Darko. I taught a film class last year and showed my class the original version - not for content but for more formal filmic elements like the outrageously flawless tracking sequences through the school, the Dawn of the Dead/Sparkle Motion/burning of Patrick Swayze's kiddie porn den, the exceptionally moving Mad World finale - as well as the brilliant editing of sentimental 80's songs and vivid new music. I left this new viewing with an even more intense admiration for the film. The first viewings left me giddy with structural appreciation, and with a great nod toward the performances and the direction, but the new cut fleshed out many of the more obtuse plot points. The original left the viewer with too many questions, I felt - too many unknowns. I always appreciate the opportunity to be left to my own convictions and to draw conclusions myself but I felt that this original film was too opaque. The director creates a world that is so accessible - so vivid - so familiar ( I'm a 35-year-old white man so I say that with all presumptuousness fully acknowledged) that you absolutely expect an explanation - it's a linear film with a clear narrative - it needs an ending. With the new cut - Roberta Sparrow's chapter openings and more fully developed relationships in the Darko family - the questions were answered in a perfect and satisfying way. I interpret the end to mean that Donnie is a paranoid schizophrenic, unmedicated and poorly monitored, who inappropriately interprets arbitrary daily events as seizmic prophetic moments. Paranoid Schizophrenia strikes in late teens/early twenties and he experiences the typical symptoms. He's in a spiral toward madness and along that journey he contemplates God and Fate in an unselfconscious exploration of his suburban existence. Most of the other characters are plastic 2-dimensional people that he experiences as exaggerated caricatures of themselves. None of them (the gym teacher, the bully, Patrick Swayze - could possibly be as simple as he's imagined them - they're necessarily playing the roles that, in his mind, represent various impossible barriers to his own peace.) The time-travel almost feels like a necessary conceit to make the narrative plausible. But it's a film about madness - and one boy's journey there. Jake Gyllenhal has probably given the performance of his career, at whatever tender age he inhabits. It's this kind of film that destroys careers. He will be forever indelibly stuck in the viewer's mind as Donnie Darko. I, for one, will never see him differently. It's like Tim Curry in Rocky Horror (not to compare the films - there is nothing to compare) but he has fashioned a character that is so rich in his delivery that I don't know how he'll ever escape. But he should be proud of his achievement - this film transcends Hollywood and offers a glimpse of greatness. I am honored to have experienced its wealth of humanity and the naked horror potentially therein.</fullReview>

It was recommended to me by a friend and now I'm addicted, I've seen it so many times its really a good movie. After finishing it the first time I immediately watched it again- its one of those movies (kind of like the 6th sense) where once you know the ending you want to go back and see what you didn't catch. The soundtrack is great too, that must be part of the reason of why I love it so much, it has all these great 80's songs that I now cant get enough of. Everyone can have their own opinion on what happens in the movie and what all of the symbols mean and while it makes you think to understand it its still pretty easy to get.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw the Director's Cut, and wow what a film. I would have seen the original cut, but it was only in town for a couple of weeks, so I didn't get a chance to see it. I was excited when it was re-released as the D.C., so I could see it on the big screen. I'm looking forward to renting the original cut, so I can compare the two.The first thing I noticed about this movie is that it is a sheer pleasure to watch, an observation that I have not seen in any of the comments I've read so far! From the opening scene of Donnie sleeping on the road, to Frank's costume, to the brilliant montages, this movie is more visually appealing than most films I've seen in the past couple of years.The other compelling aspect I found in this is of course Donnie himself. While I confess that I've never committed arson, nor felt the desire to, I can certainly relate to the craziness of trying to grow up in an environment where the only thing you know for sure is that nothing seems to make any sense, and maybe I'm just as disturbed as Donnie, but being haunted by a ghostly 6-foot bunny rabbit seemed oddly familiar.I have the feeling there is far more to this movie than what I got at the first viewing, but its scathing commentary on American culture was spot on. (SPOILER AHEAD! ! !) It makes complete sense that the motivational speaker championing the troupe of little girls dressing and dancing like hookers has a secret collection of kiddie porn in a society that vilifies child pornography and child molestation on the one hand, but sexualizes child in advertising.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a disturbed kid that any with even slight detachment will quickly latch on and begin to ponder. The movie is admittedly confusing beyond all belief, until you take a look at two things; a time line and a tangent. When you combine the time line of all life with a tangent you get the altered reality that is 'Donnie Darko'. With this you add in a bit of everyone's favorite pieces of society: cults, cliques, crime, love, hate, and the expectation to conform. Mix these all together in a detached mind and all you get is perfectly ordered madness. In the end you get a comforting and dark feeling as you wonder just what will happen this time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Possible spoilers ahead***Well Donnie darko...the most sucessful independent movie ever (at the time this was written) and so it should be. You sit down to watch this movie and expect what you always get which is a film with a point that is explained to you (the audience) through the story and you (still the audience) get to the end and say "Ahhhh I see what they are trying to say with this film" and you either like it or you don't.Well boys and girls this film will leave you (thrice the audience) going, "what the hell was that about?" and then you will watch it again and still the message of the movie will not be apparent. You will go to your friends and discuss the movie and then you will find each of you will have a different messagew this movie gave them, each of you will have found a different meaning to the film and each of you will have got something different from it.This is because the writer has clearly put the point of the movie to one side and simply told a story, the basis of all film is the audience take a journey and experience things through the characters and then are educated and/or entertained. Most movies these days are trying to bombard us with super objective (that's the message of the movie) and sometimes movies suffer for this. This film doesn't, you watch it and then you get whatever you want or need to get from it. </fullReview>

But, one thing I can't really get is why Roberta Sparrow's book is given so much credit. The fact that she wrote The Philosophy of Time Travel and is also listed by Donnie as one of the Manipulated Living in the back of the book is almost a complete contradiction. For all we know her motives could have been the same as anyone elses for Donnie to fall into the Ensurance trap. This completely disavows any credibility the book may hold. The only conceivable reason why I think Richard Kelly allowed her name to be written back there is because it does leave open this option.

		<fullReview>Everyone kept repeating to me over and over again "Donnie Darko is great Max, you should see it". I finally did get to see it and was quite disappointed really. It was basically a horror version of the considerably better James Stewart classic "Harvey". The actors in it were good and I did find a few bits interesting, but for a lot of the film I sat staring at the screen saying to myself "Oi, what's the point of this film". I didn't understand a thing about the film when I saw it, and had to ask tons of people over and over again. I was told that when I understood the film I would say to myself "Oh now I get it. That explains everything", but when, after a considerable amount of time, I finally understood the film I found myself saying "Oh. Is that all?". It does have a song that is played over the closing credits ("Mad World", it was number one at Christmas) which I admit to finding quite good. But other than these minor good details this film is not much. If you want to watch a good horror film watch "The Shining" by Stanley Kubrick starring Jack Nicholson (I'm pretty sure you've heard of it). 6/10</fullReview>

Although this movie is a bit slow and a bit confusing, I still loved it. Jake is very talented and should've been noticed for this film. They should've nominated him for at least a Golden Globe or Oscars. Everybody in this film did a great job acting. This movie had a lot of suspense and some humor in it, with a bit of confusion. It may not be the best film in the world. But it a good film though.The target audience for this movie would probably be teenagers and adults. Younger children will probably won't like this. It will probably confuse and bore them and freak them out a bit. For there are a few freaky moments. Like when Donnie Darko sees Frank, the evil bunny and believe me, you won't want to pet this bunny when you see it. There is a few sexual dialouge and extreme language. A lot of 'f' words are used throughout the movie, including a little kid saying the 'f' word and asking what it meant.But I totally recommend this film.

		<fullReview>One aspect of "Donnie Darko" I wish to comment on is writer/director Richard Kelly's unsentimental treatment of Donnie's mental illness. Sure the audience is led to believe Donnie's visions have some validity but they are visions of a man in a skeletal rabbit costume who impels Donnie into destructive acts. Jake Gyllenhaal appears to be channeling Jack Nicholson in "The Shining" when he is under the spell of Frank the Rabbit. When his parents (wonderfully played by Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell) learn the extent of his illness from Donnie's doctor, it is heartbreaking. But they handle the news, and Donnie, with aplomb.And yet in spite of his problems, Donnie still manages to fit in high school - most of the time. He participates in class discussion, he hangs out with his friends, he teases his little sister, he even finds a girl friend. Mental illness is a lonely condition. What is Mr. Kelly's implication of the teenage condition?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's good to see thought provoking movies like DD coming out of the states when there is so much dross being made (e.g., Legally Blonde: what is THAT about?). Also, the cast is excellent and all turn in great performances, the cinematography is stunning, the score is brilliant, as too is the choice of 80s music.Whether or not you like DD will depend, I think, on whether you empathise with the Donnie character. He's borderline paranoid schizophrenic, and many of the devices in the movie play on the symptoms of the illness, such as the imaginary figure in the form of frank (the giant and sinister rabbit who is apparent only to Donnie), and an ego-centric view of the world where chance and coincidence are intrepreted by Donnie as signs confirming that he alone understands the events that are unfolding around him. The suspense builds as you are challenged time and again to decide whether Donnie truly is delusional or whether he really has special powers.According to Jake Gyllenhaal, the film is about the view that there is no single answer to any question. Take what you want from it. A cracker of a film, IMHO. Go buy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>hmm..i'd say that naming the film 'donnie darko' THE ONE is a bit of exaggeration, nevertheless, it is a very good film which gives you food-for-thought. the thing i was most pondering about after having watched the film was how time seems reversible if you consider the way in which the events put into its frame make a kind of a circle. idea neither new nor revelatory, but still the picture 'donnie darko'presents us with is worth noticing. if we tend to treat time as yet another dimension which we still need to learn how to move in, we're not surprised anymore with what happens to donnie. after all, his going over and over again through these few (yet crucial) episodes of his life enables him to gain awareness (you may change your destiny if you do believe in it, but you should be prepared for changing accidentally the fate of many more people - in a way you can't predict or control) and, finally, to make his story/destiny fulfilled. donnie, rejecting the chance to survive, sacrifices his own life to let the girl live (his world would end the moment she would die - by what he did the end of his world didn't have to include the end of her life). anyway, 'every creature in this world dies alone', as we hear in the film.to put it in a nutshell - 'donnie darko'is a film definitely worth seeing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard a couple referances to this movie, mainly people saying that it is overrated. so when i saw it was on T.V. i decided to watch. the film is simply good for a while, but a couple scenes, starting with the axe in the bronze dogs head, and taking full effect with the Evil Dead movie scene, sucked me into it like no other movie. every single actor was perfect for their role, from their looks, to their voices, to their lines, to their names. the music, while partly recycled (and not badly, imho), was spot on. never has a movie moved me so much. i bought it on DVD as soon as possible, and just watched it on DVD. anyone who refuses to see this movie is refusing to see a masterpeice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is an incredible film, one of the best that I have seen. I believe the reason for this is that it makes you think, days and even (in my case) months after you've seen it for the first time. The only other movie to really do this for me was "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."Anyhow, I believe that it is silly to say that so many of us who post on here/read the posts read too much into this movie, because Darko is clearly a movie that has so many layers. It's virtually impossible to fully understand it the first, even the second time, that you see it. And while I enjoy several movies that have you leaving the theater feeling like everything is resolved, I like the fact that this one does not do that. So go ahead and call the movie stupid (which I know some people will and do) -- most likely if you can do that, you haven't taken the time to try and fully understand the intricacies of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark film, indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an odd movie (Patrick Swayze? Noah Wyle?) but it all comes together. "Darko" is a good name for the character because the story as well as the visuals are dark. If you tried to explain it to someone (uh..there's this big rabbit...) it wouldn't make sense. The film has a mystery feeling to it, and each scene just adds to it, and sometimes I didn't know what it all meant. But the ending was a surprise, and everything added up, with a great visual. The music is truly haunting. The photography has a dreamy quality to it, which adds to the tone. It's not a feel good movie, but there's nothing wrong with that. Worth a rent if you're into twisting storylines and dark themes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever watched a movie and felt totally confused afterwards? Donnie Darko was an amazing movie directed by Richard Kelly. I left the movie feeling not only confused but sort of wiser. It gave you a view in to the 'unexplainable' and lets your imagination go wild. Jake gyllenhaal was amazing, his acting skills are great. Donnie Darko is the kind of movie which is hard to explain or put in a category. It stands out for its originality. It's physiological and makes you think. I love movies like this, a film like this, but not as good, is 'the Others'. The filming was great. I love the scenes at the beginning and end where it zooms around everyone's lives and the school. I also fell in love with the music in it; the song 'Mad world' by Gary Juels was the best and really added to the ending. The ending made me cry but then I cry easily in films. If you want to see a film where you will feel so many different emotions in 113 minutes then this is the film for you. Let your imagination run riot!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fascinating as it opens and develops, "Donnie Darko" works as an effective study of a section of the young's inadequacy in crucial years of self-search, while it entertains us with time travel folklore, Psychology 101 and paranormal occurrences. With all this information added, the film moves to a satisfactory surprise ending, but it leaves situations (the never-fulfilled descent into the cellar) and references without explanation (the allusions to Frank during the party), a few characters go to limbo (like the Chinese-American girl, Cherita Chen) while others are simply wasted (the professors Pomeroy and Monnitoff, played by Drew Barrymore and Noah Wyle, or Grandma Death, a nun turned into a sort of Stephen Hawking.) The DVD release includes scenes that were cut from the final edit, which may explain some of the dark aspects of the story. Still, this is a better film than the average psychological thriller, with very good performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie that Fulfills the Meaning of Genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an experience. It carries a great mood throughout that I've never really felt before, and it's hard to explain. Much of the movie plays out in high school, with teachers and parents, and I really felt I was back in school, where everything doesn't quite make sense. The visual imagery is incredible. Scenes with Donnie Darko having his psychotic breaks featuring a rabbit are mesmerizing, and my mind felt haunted after the movie ended. Truly bizarre scenes. The movie plays with your sense of sanity, but subtly and without the standard cliches.And guess what? Not a villian or evil person in the whole thing. Just real people with their own beliefs. Okay, there are a few bullies, but they seem realistic, as though perhaps they are trying hard to cultivate a tough image.Jake Gyllenhaal is great as an innocent, intellectual (the principal says his test scores are "intimidating"), and disturbed teenager. You never know if he is doing good, or about to murder someone. Maggie Gyllenhaal is great as his fun loving, caring sister. The scenes between the constantly fighting siblings are so truthful, and you can tell they actually have an innocent sibling affection for each other though they hide behind the fighting. Patrick Swayze is great as a motivational speaker, especially when confronted by Donnie Darko in an auditorium of students. The father, played to perfection by Holmes Osbourne, is amazing. You will swear you have met him somewhere before. Jena Malone plays Donnies new girlfriend, and you will very likely fall in love with her as much as Donnie does. The rest of the cast including Mary McDonnel, Noah Whyllie and Drew Barrymore are well played, though not exceptional. This movie actually deserves to use music by Joy Division. Not many movies do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, but highly flawed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being vague doesn't make something good. Donnie Darko is okay, but its ending, without the help of the website, is simply meaningless. If someone drew a procession of random shapes, someone out there would describe it as being about the pain of a child abandoned by his alcoholic father. This is not to say something convoluted can't be good, but convoluted still has to have the meaning somehow planted underneath.I really think that part of the reason this movie is so popular here is because the people who have seen it are almost entirely its target audience: teens. And, unfortunately, many teens soak up anything that tries to have a philosophical meaning, even if it really can't muster one. The same can easily be said about Akira.That said, I would forgive Donnie Darko that if it weren't so uneven. The characters are drawn in such a way that we are asked to completely despise some of them, but then forgive them at the end just because they cry at how bad their lives are. I think asking people to sympathise with characters is always a noble attempt, but not enough effort is put into it, and the change in attitude we are supposed to have for them is a complete 180 degree switch. It's jarring and poorly done, and that's a real problem in any movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bizarre independent film that deals with a disturb young man played by Jake Gyllenhaal who has visions of a weird look rabbit who makes him stand up to his upper crust establishment with violence. As i said before, the rabbit does look weird and almost death like in its appearance. Making the rabbit ether a reflection of the kids own fragile mind or a much sinister force that is leading this young man to a very dangerous path. The movie is a bizarre take on human frailty, and the characters are motivated by ether the lack of happiness or the lack of conviction to pursue their dreams and Donnie becomes a short of a beacon of truth to his community, while the community itself becomes very frighten of the actions by this young man. This is a very strange film that is a good look at ourselves but the subject matter is very bizarre and the message sent is weird. Worth a look if you are into alternative cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to force myself to intentionally skip the user reviews for this movie, because I knew if I read them I would spend my own review simply railing against anything negative anyone might have said about this towering achievement.Now that I'm here, I realize I don't have a hell of a lot to say. How about this for a review: See this movie. If you grew up a weird kid in a styrofoam suburban high school, it will give voice to dreams and fears that can be hard to get in touch with. If you didn't, it might give you some small insight into the minds of those of us who did.The story has a surrealist feel, and it becomes a little bit of a science fiction story in the end, but that doesn't take away from this central fact - I AM Donnie Darko. It doesn't get much more realistic than that.As an amateur writer/filmmaker, seeing this movie gave me a feeling like I get when I read Michael Chabon - a deep, exquisite pain in a place that knows that if I live forever, write forever, I will never be able to produce something like this, that cuts so close to the heart of everything familiar, yet remains edgy and unsettling at the same time. I'm glad someone had the talent to make this movie, and I can't wait for the next one.</fullReview>

To say it's about time travel just doesn't capture any of what makes this movie so excellent and enthralling. You also can't really say it's about a teenage boy struggling with his family and his mental condition, because that sounds like every other teen flick ever made. What this movie is about, you cannot really know until you have seen it. But what it is, is fantastic and certainly worth the time to watch, and then watch again.

		<shortDescription>Interesting in Many Ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think in a way with this film, the social commentary could actually be more important than the plot (certainly more than in other films of the sci-fi genre.)The plot seems to be almost a theological observation on fate in some ways. It also seems like this was used to add meaning to social interactions in an supernatural way. These religious undertones are apparent, but never in your face. They feel spiritual rather than brash or fundamentalist, and help ask yourself questions, rather than to try to answer them for you.Donnie sees the world in a different way to others around him, who often seem to be outwardly characterised in diametrically opposed ways.He is obviously extremely lonely, and there are aspects of coming of age, and learning to be your own person in all of it.Throughout the film he constantly challenges the lack of grey area in other's moral observations of the world, which continues to alienate him from them and creates both trouble and enlightenment for him and his friends as the story progresses. His supernatural guide, Frank, also seems to help guide his moral ambiguity, and helps Donnie learn about the causality of the unique life he seems to now be leading.However, one of the most appealing things about the film is that the indignation and pain he feels which seem to be rooted from a lack of connection to others in his society, help justify his place as a 'superhero' of sorts.His psychiatrist tries to coax him, perhaps looking for a way to logically understand how he thinks and feels - but what could otherwise be someone's delusional fantasy is in fact like an act of God in Donnie's life.Frank, the giant evil looking bunny could of course be his imaginary friend, as a rational explanation would have it (and as others in his world would probably think.) However, the film doesn't leave you feeling that way, and all the characters seem to end up enlightened in some way by Donnie's actions, even when those actions may never really have taken place.The film doesn't completely make sense, and has different interpretations to different people, none of which are completely logical.Firstly it manages to show the futility of one's actions in the universe, because the sum of Donnie's actions actually end his own existence and wipe out his own effects on reality (they are seemingly self nullifying.) But secondly, it also demonstrates how much effect one person's actions have. This is because what happens in the alternate reality affects other people's lives, and sometimes deaths immensely, and had it not taken place, the world would have ended.It is difficult to understand, and definately without easy explanation, but one of the best films I have seen, for many reasons.To sum up, it is a beautiful and thought provoking film with some wonderful and inspiring moments, and some great acting. Go watch it if you haven't already.</fullReview>

He's not into taking up the spotlight, just having a little shine on him. Tragically, the movie doesn't end the way I wanted it to, but the rest of the movie makes up for that.

		<fullReview>I will forever be in Drew Barrymore's debt for making sure Donnie Darko was made. This, in spite of Charlie's Angels ? Full Throttle. Like other IMDb reviewers, I am surprised by DD's high rating. Don't get me wrong. DD is a very good movie. But, to rank it up there with Citizen Kane is a stretch. Moving forward, writer and director Richard Kelly, may have problems generating as much cult mania with his next project. I hope that Richard can continue his success many more times, because I am a fan and rank DD in my personal top ten.It is difficult to discuss the content of DD. It is a vague story at best, and upon first viewing, will leave you clouded. I recommended DD to a friend and all he could say is "that movie was messed up". By visiting the film web site and reading IMDb user comments, you will be able to develop your own understanding. I truly thought I had the story down, but after discussing with several frequent movie goers, discovered that each had their own understanding. The personalization of a mysterious story, a good soundtrack, a new movie star (Jake) and his sister Maggie, and several familiar faces (Drew, Patrick, and Noah) added up to an intriguing movie experience.The modification of my original review is to touch on Richard Kelly's upcoming Southland Tales movie starring The Rock, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Sean William Scott, among others. The buzz on the street about Southland is not good based on film festival preview reports of a seriously disjointed story and the lack of a central plot. There were similar issues with 2001 festival previews and the initial opening of Donnie Darko. But, here we are several years later with one of the more highly rated IMDb movies that continues to draw in fans. Richard claims that to understand Southland Tales, you must start by following the visual stories at the official web site. Let's hope he is on to something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hats off to Steven Poster in the cinematography dept. :)By the way, I pretty much understand the movie.. the warped temporary alternate universe, read up on the time travel theory, possible end of the world, manipulated dead, etc etc etc. So now that aside and moving on to commenting on finer points....Great camera work. Some VERY long complicated shots, sometimes involving a character getting back into the shot again (the bully, any others?)One of the more crowning moments beginning when Donnie and friends jump off the bus, go into the school up until the principal exits the double doors (bright blinding white ending the shot). There is like one long shot after that from Cherita at the mascot but it doesn't beat the first one.Had they been able to go from the bus to the classroom door fade... that would have been spectacular. All in all I put it ahead of the long shot in Goodfellas where Ray Liotta brings his date in the back door of the restaurant/club.I just wonder how many takes that took? Just one of the aspects that make this one of my favorite films of the millennia (OK that's only 4 years)Unless those were edited to *appear* to be all one shot. I am doubting they were edited or they would have joined the entire scene from jumping out of the bus until the translucent fade into the classroom door.Anyone else have any nods to any particular cinematography work?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(This review is for the DVD version of the movie.)Possible Spoilers (references movies with similar plots)I just saw Donnie Darko on DVD after blockbuster.com recommended it. I guess it was because I rated 12 Monkeys and Rushmore pretty high. Unfortunately this move did not quite measure op to my expectations and I expected to be blown away as with 12 Monkeys, but I just said "Ahhh.. I think I get it. Let me think about this..." The DVD extras revealed a different interpretation than I had and more Richard Kelly's (the writer/director) personal vision. The commentary on the movie reveals that he wanted to leave the audience with a more open interpretation. The book of the character Roberta Sparrow is very hard to read (letters are blurry) on the DVD, but provides the most insight.This is not a bad movie, but it could have been a lot better, I can't put my finger on what is missing. The director creates a great atmosphere and makes you fear and love Donnie at the same time. The fear-love opposites theme is ridiculed in the movie by Donnie Darko.The good: Music. Effects. Atmosphere. Smart story and interesting story line.The bad: Language. Unnecessary and excessively bad language. This took down the movie a notch or two in my opinion.The ugly: The rabbit costume</fullReview>

Drew Barrymore's decision to produce this film was a great one, a Richard Kelly should certainly have been awarded more for his work. There simply aren't enough independent features like this one recognised by Hollywood, but the success of Donnie Darko, proves that small time production companies and young inexperienced directors can make a a smash hit for all ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's really only one way to describe Donnie Darko - American Beauty meets Rushmore meets the Twilight Zone. The title character is a high school student who seems relatively normal on the outside - smokes, drinks, curses, yells at his family, etc. But he seems to be having trouble with perception of reality. By that I mean he sees and does the bidding of a six-foot-tall giant bunny rabbit wearing an insectoid mask. He calls him Frank. ...Right.It's not immediately obvious what kind of movie this is going to be, and to be honest, I'm still trying to decide myself. It's part teen drama, part psychological thriller, part time travel sci-fi movie, and part horror flick. There are times when the elements gel cohesively and form a whole that touches greatness, and other times it devolves into insanity of a David Lynch vein. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a marvelous performance, alternately creepy, sympathetic, funny, and odd, but it's really more of a filmed representation of Richard Kelly's dark dreams than anything else, so the acting becomes secondary to the atmosphere and ideas being put forth. I loved it, though, in spite of its flaws, and everybody I know either loves it or despises it. Seems to be one of those moves that polarizes people's opinions. Give it a try if you're in the mood for something very, VERY different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a film that stands in-between a few different genre's. Somewhat of an adventure film, it borders on Sci-Fi and most resembles a drama- But a hip drama. The fact is the genre is irrelevant since this movie is seamless in it's story telling. Any viewer aged 12 to 25 would most likely have their attention span levitated for the full duration of the film. While the social aspects of the film reminded me of many teen oriented films,(parties and making out therein, drinking...) the mystery and suspense was reminiscent of such films as Magnolia or Mullholland Drive. The soundtrack has inspired me to download three or four of its participants, nothing mainstream or "poppy" just catchy and enjoyable. Many of the story elements I could relate to and this made the rest of it(visions, hallucinations, vandalism and the like) much more fun. It may take viewing this film a couple times to fully understand it's meaning, so thank goodness it is entertaining and humorous even after seeing multiple times.</fullReview>

For the first half of the film I just assumed (like his psychiatrist) that Donnie was schitzophrenic (example - the film 'Repulsion'), but that was not the case. All that I can figure is that the jet engine from the beginning was from his family's plane at the end - one of those wormholes he talked obsessively about - and that by going back in time (28 days) to die he saved himself from a terrible life, or possible saved the life of his family, I don't know - I'd really like to hear what the director had to say about this. Maybe it's too impenetrable for its own good. However, great acting from all involved - nothing over-the-top, Donnie was human, and I especially enjoyed the unflappable character of his mother. I wonder if there is only one right way to interpret this film, or if it is supposed to mean different things for different people?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all-time favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was such an amalgam of so many things, that it surpasses all other films in my mind. Yes it is science fiction, but it is drama, comedy, mystery, fantasy and somewhat of a thriller as well. It references so many other great films and television shows, while remaining relevant. I can think of very few other films that come close to Donnie Darko. One of the best films of the last 10 years for sure. If you have not seen it, do so. If you don't get it or some of it; watch it again. I feel it is definitely worth it. Peace</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thinker's movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is one of the most original movies I have ever seen. You won't see too many sci-fi fantasy movies with this much drama. My favorite aspect of the movie is that it makes you think. Throughout the whole movie I was trying to figure what was going on (to be honest, I'm still not completely sure what was going on). I would like to think that the end of the movie is up to the viewer's interpretation, and thats the fun of the movie. There is no right interpretation, and there isn't a wrong one either (although there are some stupid ones). I know the director had his own meaning, but that shouldn't get in the way of the viewer's imagination. However, for those of you who like your plots "spoon fed" to you, and don't like to use your thought process, this movie isn't for you. Just wait for another sequel of "The Fast and the Furious" to come out. For the rest of you, GO SEE IT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I was instantly drawn into thecharacters and their circumstances. I think this is a brilliant andmesmerizing film inspired by teen angst that pulls you into anotherworldly dimension. I found the films lasting images to haverun the gamut of human emotion, from the lost and lonely faces ofthe teens, to the self righteous instructors, and then to the oneswho truly cared. I found myself thinking about the film andformulating answers to the films many questions long afterviewing it. The more I analyze it, the more fascinating it becomes.Truly a film for people who like to think, especially if you're notintimidated by exploring other ideas of reality. Also, the soundtrackis at the same time beautiful and haunting, the songs linked withthe images are stuck in my head! I love it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece compareable to any David Lynch movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely brilliant. At first, id like to point out that after you've seen it, it will be hard to figure out what it was actually about. It's like a puzzle that you have to solve yourself. According to, that almost everyone has different oppinions on what the plot on this movie actually is all about. The only thing people who has given it a second thought seem to agree about, is the fact that it's very very good.My conclusion is, that it's filled with hints that go all across the movie. It's filled with morales and ethics, hidden suggestions, and mindbuggling scenes. The movie tells different stories to all it's viewers, who always end up astonished by it's originality. But the creation of it, i believe, was'nt intended to be any sort of defined story - though many seem to think so. If it is, the story would have been made just like you and i are going to make it, figuring out all the small concepts of the movie, and trying to figure out our own final understanding that hopefully suits fine according to our personality. To make a movie this deep on purpose just seems impossible.If i was to say my oppinion, i'd say that Donnie Darko actually is some kind of superhero. He found a timetraveling portal - that not only traveles trough time - but also to a different dimension. He uses his own self? to persuade the people at the destination dimension to lead donnie? into an act, that will make him? save his nearest family. It all ends up with the 2 universes collapsing, and exchanging some people through them, so the people that stay behind Donnie Darko will be almost unaware to what have happened - due to Donnie's and the movies perfection in the act. A perfection that will only claim one loss, which you will see if you watch this extremely good movie. :)I'll give it 10/10.</fullReview>

And seeing this is something I do not regret at all.Donnie Darko is by far one of the deepest movies I've seen for years. I can't just compare it to any other piece, there are no words who are enough to express to the reader of this comment, how splendid this piece is. And it's not just deep, it's all very touching and I like being touched in this way. Seeing Donnie Darko is worth it's nearly 2 hours of runtime and if you haven't seen this one, go and rent it as soon as possible, take a break today from work and have a day of thinking. In some perspectives, this movie is a psychedelic piece to me, and I'm afraid I can't go more deeper into the subject without ruin some of the joy for the viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just spent two hours waiting for the moment in the movie where everything comes together and all makes sense. Tragically, this didn't happen and I finished Donnie Darko wishing that I could also travel in time and get my two hours back. The smaller elements of the movie, suburban private schools and their obscure teaching models as well as the dangers of local celebrity were interesting. The primary focus of this movie really boiled down to two possibilities: Donnie Darko is either crazy or he isn't. When the movie finally got around to showing what it thought was true, my patience had ended. It was neat that both Gyllenhaal kids together; nothing I've seen so far recommends Maggie to me as an actress to watch.Like Catcher in the Rye, the story of Donnie Darko will appeal to the darker sensibilties of the American teenager. However, it didn't ring true to me and just reminded me of why it's such a bad idea to over-medicate your kids. As a side point, if I ever spoke to my mother like Donnie did to his mother, she would have slapped the teeth out of my head.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie grows on you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Donnie Darko again and I think I even liked it more than the first time I've seen it. The movie grows on you. It is strikingly original - whatever keywords or theme words you find on IMDB to describe it only approximate how weirdly original it is. And maybe that is part of the allure, its originality, that when watching it you may guess what will happen next, only to end up surprised. Now, while that may not necessarily be a good thing, in this movie it is. Unlike what many have said it does have a line of thought and a theme, and it more or less follows through on them. Donnie Darko is remarkably honest (even realistic) about the characters it portrays. They operate on human laws, not on fictional over-the-top laws where they are either exclusively good, or exclusively evil. In fact, the totalitarian private school that Donnie attends is surprisingly believable. Donnie himself is an achievement, extremely well performed by Gyllenhaal, and crafted by Kelly. Though many have criticized this movie for alleged incoherence and forced symbolism, I think its twists and turns are meant to stimulate discussion and thought, not immediate rejection because it doesn't seem to make sense at first try. After all, how often does a movie come out that makes you actually contemplate its weird existence (or your own)?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>why is it movies where a main character travels back thru time to change things never has a happy ending? Is causality that daunting that we need to be reminded by only negative reinforcement?It is about responsibility, and choices.People often think that; it is the big things in life that are all that matters, never realizing it is the little experiences that create the big ones.The little things we take for granted. People in general dont take responsibility for causality in their lives; and that is at the crux of every movie about time travel.The best critique of this movie that gave me chills and I quote:"I can't recall a movie in which a song so perfectly conveyed the meaning of a scene. The song "Mad World" plays over the end of the movie. It explains it all. It's Darko's theme song: "And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad, The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had."Indeed the ability to make a choice is always there, a choice out of fear and a choice out of love. But even moreso, the path that is pathed with integrity, faith, and will, can make the loving action manifest in timeless ways. And though no one will recognize, no one will know or see, it is nonetheless on the table.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Manipulation of Destiny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something beautiful going on in Donnie Darko but it remains below the surface. It is the idea that we can walk through God's portal. To be able to transport ourselves back and forth within in our own destiny. Donnie Darko has figured it out or is he schizophrenic? A highly original film that leaves the senses spellbound. Then again, Donnie Darko also leaves the sense that we have just been had by a highly intellectual bored teenager.Donnie Darko is somewhat of a genius. He knows things that other students his age do not concern themselves with. That is because he has lived this moment in time repeatedly trying to spend every moment with the girl he loves and how he can save her life. He tries to evade destiny by making things right but because of his wants he takes Frank the Rabbit into the wormhole with him. Donnie shoots Frank in the eye killing him therefore, because of Darko's manipulation of time Frank's life was vainly taken. Donnie Darko has to make the ultimate sacrifice in order to restore normalcy. His schizophrenia comes from his manipulation of time. Frank is Donnie's Dark Conscious.The film is a true mess of a puzzle. Still looking for the missing pieces. However, the film possesses a unique feel. There is marvel at it's ideas that hold curiosity till the end. The characters are terrifically developed in 80's persona. Why 1988? Was it an end of an era. An end to the 80's ideals. Pre-Internet? The beginning of George Bush and his Global New Order? The world has changed. If we can find a wormhole and go back in time perhaps we can change destiny but someone is going to have to die. It all falls to self sacrifice to save the world.The film has a great soundtrack with haunting lyrics of 80's new wave alternative. Producer, Drew Barrymore showcases a refreshing presence. "cellar door, the most beautiful phrase in the English language" Patrick Swayze does a superb job as a self help pervert. Jake Gyllenhaal displays the awkwardness of teenage confusion very well. In a way we all have walked in God's portal as we enter a world of confusion and madness, of love and hate,...it's a mad mad world. Love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing, confusing and entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8/10Time-travel, love, God, death, and a big, scary rabbit are all on display in this wonderful and unusual film. Many people have given different theories as towhat it is all about and most of which you can see on the message boards here. But these are all discussions you can have after you watch the movie. Andbeing able to discuss something after you've seen it doesn't necessarily make it good. What Richard Kelly does is give us an entertaining, scary and stylish one hour and forty minutes.The central character is a boy named Donnie Darko, a boy troubled by visionsof a large rabbit who tells him the world is going to end in 28 days. The rabbit is a wonderful demonic image with a voice to chill you to the bone. His name isFrank. Nothing in Donnie Darko will be as you think it should. Kelly, who wrote and directed the film, creates a sinister setting out of an ordinary suburban neighbourhood. It's a surprising and challenging debut from a clearly talented director. The only problem I did have with this picture was that it left youscratching your head constantly. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't mind having to think when I'm watching a film, but I felt we needed some kind of closure at the end ? what we get is a twist which just leaves us with more head scratching to do. Mulholland Drive springs to mind at this moment. A film which I liked more than this ? but an equally confusing film. The difference being, I wasn'texpecting an explanation at the end of Mulholland Drive. Donnie Darko bubbles along, suggesting we are going to be told what it is all about. But theexplanations are hidden and difficult to find. But the inspiring visuals andbelievable characters pull you through an enjoyable and frightening ride.Gyllenhall puts in a great performance as Donnie ? a highly intelligent andcurious character. Everything he does is understated ? always implying a more disturbing side to Donnie. Patrick Swayze is also great as the `inspirational' talker, trying to `combat fear'.This is a great film and one you will be able to watch over and over. With Donnie Darko, Kelly reminds me of Lynch ? I hope Kelly keeps this dark and creativeside and keeps as consistent as Lynch has done.P.S. For us brits this film came out a year after it did in America. Now why does this have to be? It really annoys me that I have to wait so much longer to see good American art-house movies when films like Spider-man and Star Wars arereleased at the same time world-wide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've WATCHED 'Donnie'....but I've yet to SEE it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently finished watching 'Donnie Darko' for the first time. As a keen movie buff, I buy movies to add to my collection every week and bought 'Donnie' several months ago. So why didn't I watch it sooner.? Who knows? I knew it wasn't a 'Blair Witch' horror movie so why the reluctance? All I DO know is that every time I went to watch it....I hesitated and then chose another film. I now know that some part of me knew that this film would definitely disturb me..and it did! I knew immediately from the external opening shots which, although totally innocuous, exuded an air of a deep melancholy and very real claustrophobia and even menace - that I was in for an emotional ride. In some way, this opening shot put me in mind of the opening scene of 'The Shining' - an almost stomach churning sense of..can't quite put your finger on it.wrongness. This was a recurring theme throughout the movie - the cunning depiction of everyday situations which are then - ever so slyly and ever so subtly twisted until one is unsure of what you are actually seeing, hearing and more importantly - feeling. Without spoiling the film, take the first family breakfast - we are fooled into thinking that surely this is just another middle class, suburban family with good old Christian ethics sitting down to break bread with some light banter and innocent gossip..? Surely God is in His Heaven and all is right with the world.? We soon have our assumptions on this happy little family scene slapped off our smug faces and later share the pain of that one vicious word..'bitch!' In another seemingly innocent scene, are we watching a bunch of happy young children dancing for their proud parents...or slimy, insidious 'kiddie porn'. Is the name of the instigator of this so called Talent Show 'Cunningham' or 'Cunning Man'? The answer is actually given in the flaming 'Hell' scenes which begin to merge with the increasingly vulgar dance routine. Question: When the yellow school bus door begins to open.what did you expect..? Richard Kelly has created a film that, over the coming years, will challenge everyone who has the courage to confront it - and I use the word 'confront' intentionally. From the most trivial of items - the horrendous 'sculpture' outside Donnie's school (and the even more unsettling addition to it later in the film), to the majestic and eerie sequence at the very end of the film, Kelly asks us to question everything. From the nature of Time, God, Man and - what I believe to be at the heart of the film - Choice. This, logically, leads to the questioning of our own choices and the consequences of them - something made so terribly and yet so hopefully clear in Donnie's own smiling, uplifting choice at the end of the film. I now know of friends who have watched 'Donnie' over and over again...and still find things in the film that they have missed. A handy tip that they gave me - go to the official Donnie Darko website (ONLY IF YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE FILM!!) and take a browse - a LOT of questions are answered there...if you make it through the maze! When I asked one friend if he had seen the film, he got it JUST right and replied `I've watched it many times..but I've yet to SEE it.' 'Donnie Darko' is one of the most challenging, intriguing and original work I have ever watched and I am going to make a point of SEEING this film - if it kills me.</fullReview>

And the feeling you get for this movie, is enough reason to ignore that you didn't fully understand what happened at the end. (Besides from the fact that you can ponder in what it all meant.) After all... movies are for our enjoyment, aren't they??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where was this movie hiding? I did not know this movie existed until I use to come across it on HBO, but I never watched it. Lately, I have heard different people talk about it. Did you see it? Can you believe that? I wanted to see what all the talk was about. I went and got the movie. I went into this experience with the knowledge that this was a really messed up movie and there was a freaky rabbit in it. With that knowledge in hand, I was ready to enter the movie and see some crazy stuff. Did I? You can sure say that. This is definitely a movie I would recommend watching and paying attention to. There are some cool special effects and camera angles. The movie really makes you think and to me, that's a major plus. The movie goes into the real dark world of paranoid schizophrenic, but one may think at the end he wasn't crazy at all. In closing, this is a really good movie that deals with a topic that allows it to explore some strange avenues. The movie is not all serious and has some laughs as well. There is a great cast and I think anyone will be satisfied (on some level) with this movie.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Technique analysis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: It's October 1988 and Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a troubled teen on medication who sleepwalks right out of his house on some nights. He also suffers from visions of a man in a grotesque rabbit costume, a harbinger of doom who tells him that the world will end in twenty-eight daysThere are many things going on with the movie Donnie Darko, but I will attempt to describe one of the central ideas.Donnie Darko shows being at odds with a conformist culture that labels people (`Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?'). This film is generally presented this way with film elements such as low key lighting, and melancholy songs, such as `Mad World'.Low key lighting, in scenes when Donnie Darko is talking to Frank to Frank, helps to bring out the dark side of Donnie. Low lighting is important because it shadows the room and Donnie's face while Frank gives him extreme non-conformist ideals. For example in the first mirror scene when Donnie talks to Frank, then Donnie takes an axe and goes to the school, and breaks the water pipes, then puts the axe in the head of the school's mascot. This shows Donnie Darko being against his school, which is a major conformist place.Another film element used in Donnie Darko is music. During the film the music kind of gives you a feeling of conformity, being the same old type of music. But the song at the end of the movie I think stands out the most, because it's different. The song at the end is called `Mad World'. It's sung by Gary Jules, but it's a Tears for Fears original. Part of the song that reflect the movie would be the beginning `All around me are familiar faces, worn out places, worn out faces'. That part goes with the movie, because it's like Donnie seen all the same people, and places, and he is tired of it all. One part that talks about conformity would be `Made to feel the way that every child should, sit and listen, sit and listen'. The whole time the song is playing it's showing some of the main characters, and you get a since of their problems, which are due to conforming; they never got to do what they wanted to do, or what they should have done.I liked the way they showed the theme of a conformist society in Donnie Darko. There are more themes to this movie than just what I picked out, but conformity was the theme that I picked out the best, and that I would attempt to explain the best. This was Richard Kelly's first film, and I think the ideas he got out in this film was pretty good for a first time film maker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Last Temptation of Donnie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko will make much more sense to anyone who's seen the Last Temptation of Christ. Some similarities (spoilers)-The film takes place in 1987, which is the year Last Temptation was released in the theater. -The other movie playing at the movie theater where Donnie sees the Evil Dead is Last Temptation of Christ. -Like Last Temptation, the ending of Donnie Darko negates most of the narrative. In Last Temptation, Jesus (Willem Dafoe) is rescued from crucifixion by an angel, and he goes on to live a quiet life with Mary Magdellen. However, Jesus decides in the end that the world would be better off if he had died on the cross. Donnie ultimately makes this same decision. -In the structural sense, both films are "It's a Wonderful Life," only backwards.Donnie Darko gives a nod to another Jimmy Stewart film, Harvey, in its use of the invisible 6-foot rabbit.I gave Donnie Darko a 9/10 mainly for the outstanding acting performances. Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore's small roles as are overshadowed by Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal, Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze (his best role ever), Beth Grant, and Jena Malone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Worth the Risk (But You May Hate It)...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally I'm not a fan of movies that don't end with a clear conclusion. For example, I hated Mulholland Drive. However, Donnie Darko is, in spite of its ambiguous ending, well worth watching. But, before watching, you should know that this movie isn't going to cater to traditional "top 40" movie simplicity--you're going to have to think, and you're going to have to come up with your own conclusions.Donnie Darko takes you into the life of a schizophrenic high school boy in 1988 suburbia. I'm a psychology major, and I was fascinated by the accurate portrayal of paranoid schizophrenia in this movie. In fact, one of the things that makes me rate this movie so high is that it doesn't just tell you what it is like to have schizophrenia, it takes you inside the mind of someone with this condition--by the end of the movie you'll be wondering where the line between reality and fiction exists!If you're willing to risk the cost of renting this movie, I'd highly recommend it. But you definitely won't want to buy it unless you've seen it and enjoyed it. You could very likely hate it. You're probably more likely to enjoy it at a time in your life when you can relate to everything not making sense. If you're a person who wants a clear, meaningful plot, take particular caution before renting.Enjoy! 4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Go to one of the many websites dedicated to the the DD "mythos" if you want to know exactly how the TU came to be, or whether Frank is actually real when he acts as a "messenger," or why Donnie has to do what he does to set things right. But if you do, I think you're missing a great experience. This is definitely a Top 10 Movie of all time in my book, but I can easily understand how many viewers would not like it at all.Watch the film and form your own conclusions. It is very touching and personal on several different levels. (I'm a sucker for "Mad World"...I cry every time I watch the montage at the end of the movie.)Once you've watched this movie, go back and listen to the director's commentary on the DVD, You may be quite surprised at what you learn.This is definitely a must-see film.***** out of *****2005 Update: After watching the new Director's Cut a couple times, I have to tell you that I have mixed feelings. The film does indeed flow better and is visually haunting, but I believe that, overall, the DC is for the worst. Here are a couple problems I have with it:1. The movie is now a little TOO accessible. The insertion of the passages from TPOTT are a bit much and are really pushed into the viewer's face. The additional scenes are also too high-tech, as if they are supposed to simulate God or DD's consciousness as a computer, video recorder, or radar screen.2. The additional scenes also slow the movie down quite a bit. It was compact and terse in the original version.3. Last, and most important, the viewer gets to see hints, information, and foreshadowing that are not accessible to Donnie. In the original version, the viewer gets to see only the basic information that is available to DD, so we empathize more with his confusion. In the Director's Cut, we are less empathetic and view DD more from an detached, more omniscient point of view.I STRONGLY recommend that you view the original version first and then, after some thought, go ahead and view the Director's Cut a few months later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is an excellent film that was over looked by many people during its initial theatrical release. It starts off unassuming enough about a typical suburban family in the 80's. The title character is Donnie Darko, a gifted, yet troubled high school student. Donnie doesn't get along with many people. Soon he begins to have bizarre dreams and visions involving a giant evil rabbit that predicts the end of the world, and encourages Donnie to do destructive things. Is Donnie just crazy, or is Frank really a visitor from another dimension? You'll just have to watch and decide for yourself. I really love this film and would recomend it to fans of both science fiction and thillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not everything is as it seems....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike most films, Donnie Darko allows one to see beyond just the story and into the characters. Donnie Darko has emotional disorder that exhibits paranoid schizophrenic symptoms. He sees visions of a giant rabbit that tells him to commit certain controversial acts. His girlfriend has just moved from an abusive stepfather that stabbed her mom. The teachers all maintain the ethics of a Christian school but don't necessarily believe in it's truth, except one. Grandma Death role is essential to the underlying meaning of the film whilst her character is an old woman that nearly gets run over whilst going to her mailbox. The characters are portrayed with intelligence and thought.Time travel is a subject that is rarely portrayed well in a film, but underneath the characters and life stories, Donnie Darko psychological dilemnas focuses on it. As the film develops, Donnie, although very confrontational and somewhat disturbed, he is highly intelligent in his thoughts, actions and words. The acts that he commits have an effect on the community and characters in a positive way and his words make sense.Whatever thoughts you might have about simple surburbian american life, or theories of time travel, you must see this film. It gets quite bizarre in places, but makes chronological sense. The aeroplane incidents doesn't add up, but it's still enjoyable. Whoever wrote the script did well, and the characters are superb.9/10</fullReview>

It's full of mind bending twists, insane camera work, beautiful special effects, and amazing performances. I loved every minute it of.

		<shortDescription>A beautiful quirky film with only a few flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The executive producer (Drew Barrymoore) lends the only completely flat out bad note in this otherwise fabulous emotional and intellectual symphony of a film.Jake Gyllenhaal's character is fabulous. He's a melancholy intellectual high-school kid. He sleep-walks, and he can see and talk to a six foot tall man in a demonic looking bunny suit, that nobody else can see.The less you know about the plot, the better.The movie presents a skewered and lonely private reality, reminiscent of a Lynch movie, but it actually reminded me most of Memento and Magnolia, two other films in which things unravel, and sometimes come back together, in ways you cannot begin to imagine until the film is nearly over. What makes this movie unlike anything else I have ever seen is the way it spikes what could have been a merely bittersweet 80s mix of nostalgia and satire, by putting a clever and gifted protagonist into an existential predicament worthy of Satre himself.The art direction and the 80s music contribute to both a feeling of nostalgia, and a sharp reminder of the quiet despair that comes from being an outsider in high-school. The soundtrack is fabulous, lyrically rich, and finely tuned to the film, with turns of beauty and ringing loneliness that you just have to experience to understand. An understated cover of Tears for Fear's single "Mad World" transformed the 80s classic into a quiet personal musical epiphany, at a key moment in the film."and i find it kind of funny i find it kind of sad the dreams in which i'm dying are the best i've ever had"I rented this film because it's one of my very good friend's favourite movies. I usually know that any movie he like is going to have some kind of non-linearity to it, and some kind of way of getting, in a round-about way, to deal honestly with some aspect of the human condition, after much belaboured and stylish postmodern melodrama. But none of these trappings get in the way of just enjoying the film. In fact, this is a movie you could watch many times, and enjoy it for some different thing, each time you watch it.As I said in the beginning, I think everyone in this film succeeds nobly, except Drew Barrymoore, who plays an English Teacher who seems a shallow and profane copy of all the truly memorable English Teachers I have on film before. Maybe they should have cast Laura Dern, who played a teacher in October Sky, the movie I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in.Here's hoping that this writer/director is this successful next time. I hope he doesn't end up straightjacketed by this early success, a-la M. Night Shyamalan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most of you have this movie all wrong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Warning: May Spoil if left out***So you've watched Donnie Darko a couple times, so you have a PHD in philosophy, so you think you're smart, so what?A lot of you got this movie all wrong -- with all this talk about "death dreams" and visions and what not...let me set the record straight.Donnie Darko is a teen schitzo (sp) also suffering from several combined sleep disorders, mainly, sleep walking.At the start of the movie, Donnie awakes to find himself on the golf course... looks like it was another long night of sleep walking, and bunnie chasing. Luckily for Mr. Darko, this morning, he slept on the green, rather than becoming the landing zone for a detached jet engine.The movie goes on, Donnie was given another chance, his life was saved by the same character that later destroys it, a furry rabit named Frank. Frank would destroy Donnie's life by running over his girlfriend on halloween (hense the dude in the rabit suit) after a little gun play, Donnie goes home to bed.Meanwhile his mother and sister are on a flight somewhere over the Continental US, when suddenly the plane hits a storm system (a big one with funnell clouds, included) the jet engine of the plane breaks off -- now heres where it gets sketchy...in the movie's book, "The Philosophy of Time Travel" it talks about the requirements for time travel being: water, a metal vessel, and 2 connecting vortexes. Well what better than 2 connecting tornado's full of gusting wind and WATER to make up your water based vortex. So Basically the metal Vessel (the detached jet engine) flew into this double connected tornado and "re-wound" (past tense of re-wind) time. it rewound time all the way to the begining of the movie... but guess what? this time, our hero, Donnie Darko was inbed, asleep. And as the movie ends no one knows of the way things could have been.Let me throw a couple things in, now...To believe this theory one needs to assume that the entire "alternate universe" concept is flawed. Think of time and space as a "timeline"- time can be reversed or forwarded... but keep in mind everything that is changed has an affect on the future, not an alternate univers's future, but the ONE collectivly precieved reality that is time and space, as we know it.Just one problem (or seven)1 Problem: if there were only 1 timeline, one instance of time and space, then once Donnie was Killed, (by the jet engine) certain events would be different... Donnie would never set the Kiddy Porn Guy's house on fire, so he would never have gone to jail, therefore Donnie's mom would have never had to cover for the teacher who couldnt fly because she needed to attend the trail for the kiddy porn guy....and i was about to say since they would never fly, there would be no jetengine, but alas, just because Donnies mom wouldnt be on the plane, wouldn't mean that the engine wouldnt fall off...in the end, the entire point of the movie is to try to point out to the viewer that:1. Life is short 2. Life is controlable - but 3. Life is also uncontrolable 4. Life has an infinite number of posabilities 5. Life always has more to offer than what appears from the outside</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love time travel movies that get it right. This movie? i'm not so sure did. There were a couple of holes, and questions that I had.Was this a bad flick? No. It was very entertaining.I'm not certain why this movie has become a cult-classic, but after watching it a couple of times I feel that it's a good movie.There's a lot of things going on in this movie, and you shouldn't watch it if you're expecting a phone call, or don't have a very good attention span.If you have the patience to sit and think, instead of one of those persons who needs everything spelled out for them (which are probably the people ripping this flick) then you'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has so many ideas its excellent. When I first heard of it, a kid who sees a bunny, I thought it looked really stupid but then I saw it during an all-nighter and it was so great! It goes through many things like life and death, protecting people you love, insanity, time travel, etc. Pay the 5 bucks to rent it, it is just an unbelieveable movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is one of those films where you don't really know what to expect, but after the first viewing, you are hooked. Very original, well acted and photographed. A look at life from within a troubled teen; you are transported between real and unreal; fact and fantasy. An outstanding achievement on all levels. A sadly underrated film in my opinion. I recently saw it and am ready for another viewing already. Check it out - you'll probably buy it as a keeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Has there been a more remarkable debut film than "Donnie Darko" in the last 20 years? Even if there has, it does nothing to take away from Richard Kelly's fascinating, endearing science fiction/comedy/romance/tragedy. That may seem like a lot of hats for one movie to wear, but Kelly navigates fearlessly through a complex, circular plot heavy with ideas. With strong performances from a large cast, as well as measured, yet creative use of special effects, "Donnie Darko" is certainly one of the most unique films to appear in theaters in a long time.Donnie Darko, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is a teenager growing up in suburban Virginia. He has stable, caring parents (the excellent Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell), a wry, knowing older sister (Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jake's real life sister), and with Drew Barrymore and Noah Wyle, a set of smart teachers who take a personal interest in Donnie's struggles with modern life. Jake Gyllenhaal does amazing work as Donnie. While his character seems to be painted in broad strokes - he has had run-ins with the law, he rebels against his parents, he mocks a new age con who gives a talk at his school - there is a great deal of nuance and precision in how Gyllenhaal, as Donnie, acts towards those around him. Particularly strong are the scenes between Donnie and his therapist, played by Katharine Ross. Despite being confronted with surrealistic hallucinations portending the end of the world, Gyllenhaal never allows Donnie to lose touch with his basic humanity, and by extension, the audience.Kelly fills his film with a lot of discussion about topics that are rarely discussed at length in mainstream cinema - the existence of God, the possibility of time travel, the mysteries of the afterlife. Yet these issues never overload the narrative. Instead, they drive Donnie forward on his quest to figure out the meaning behind his baffling experiences. Who is the man in the rabbit suit? Why has he chosen Donnie to carry out these tasks? What role does Roberta Sparrow, "Grandma Death," have to play in this tale? Some questions are never answered fully, but Kelly answers enough of them with a stellar ending to leave the viewer satisfied."Donnie Darko" is hardly the first film to try and deconstruct the problems inherent in quiet modern American life; it's easy to draw parallels with films like "American Beauty" and "The Ice Storm," to name a couple. But no other film in recent memory has used such startling technique and vivid storytelling to totally reimagine suburbia as a fertile breeding ground for wondrous miracles. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Cult Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw Donnie Darko, I came away feeling perplexed and creeped out. I liked it, but just didn't get it. Now I have seen it five times. I absolutely love this film. I am not a teenager, I am a forty something bonafide movie freak. When people ask me, what is the movie about, I say, it's about an adolescent boy that is visited by a demonic looking giant bunny, it's about time travel, it's about the many paths that we travel in our lifetimes and it's about the consequences of our choices. This movie touches something very personal in me. This is not just a "teen fluff" film. It is haunting and thought provoking. The music is appropriately haunting as well. It is wonderfully cast and the acting is impeccable. As a rule, I don't buy movies, but I will buy this one. Even the cinematography is wonderful, the slow motion and backward shots. This is not a film for young kids. I think the bunny would scare them senseless because it is surely terrifying to look at. I am surprised the film is just now receiving so much attention, but I know it's because it is on cable all the time, I guess it was a sleeper at the box office. This is one of the most provocative and interesting films I have seen in a very long time, but I suggest you watch it more than once because it isn't an easy concept to grasp, and it would be easy to dismiss it as inconsequential. I think Donnie Darko is quickly becoming the new cult movie of our time, and am of the opinion, it deserves that distinction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True. The movie is dark. The third person portrait of young Donnie through his own eyes however is sympathizing- you don't perceive him as a freak. Or is he? He has emotional problems, and regular sessions with a psychologist. His sociological opinions and beliefs go against the voices of his teachers and the other people of the town. To them, yes, he probably is a freak. But the viewer of this movie won't agree with those people, they will say Donnie is the only one who see things as they are and he does have the guts to stand up for it and say it.However, this view is not completely simple to wield... Donnie hallucinates and is commanded by a big skull-faced rabbit. These commands are disturbing, and soon the element of time enters the plot. A series of strange events take place, and Donnie soon faces more and more coincidental pieces of elements that all puzzles up to something that can't be a coincidence... And a race against time to find out the truth about time itself... This movie makes you think deep. The end really puts the cherry on top, but not without leaving your eyes a little watery...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thanx but no thanx</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally I wouldn't have watched this movie.I'll reveal the reason in the end of this review. I've been proven correct after being convinced into watching this pathetic excuse for an original screenplay from a friend whose views on films I valued. Up to now anyway. To all those who haven't seen 'Donnie Darko': a)this review addresses specific shortcomings of the film so there are major spoilers for you b)don't waste time or money on this 'film'After the end of the film I was left with a sense of being conned ; someone had tried really hard to convince me there was a meaningful script,an original mix of popular ideas-even ideals and a proof of sorts that American independent filmmaking is alive and well. Those illusions are even more impressive than those apparently experienced by Donnie Darko, a demented yet brilliant teenager who seems to have a habit of sleepwalking and conversing with human-sized bunnies. There is a lot of talk about how this scenario is well-crafted and thought-out and how one must watch the film again and again for it to 'sink in' while taking the time to navigate the web site. Well the scenario did sink alright. I mean this was an experience similar only to those who had the dubious privilige of the maiden voyage of the Titanic. It really is a mess of time-travel,psychanalysis,karma,parallel universes,etc,etc. You name it ; it probably is in there.The problem is that there's no coherency at all. I'll only go into the specifics of two cases which do stand out cause of their crucial role in the 'script'.The first one is the bunny itself. I've been made aware of two explanations for it's existence. One is that someone from the future has sent it as a projection to fix the past and save the world. Since however the present would not have come to pass if the bunny hadn't showed up(?) then there would have been no future. The other explanation is that someone from a parallel universe has projected it into ours to save us. So here you'd basically have someone from a very advanced alternate future actually caring for as to what happens to one of the infinite parallel universes at some point in the past. I guess stamp collecting doesn't quite cut it anymore as a hobby in the year 3003..The second much simpler case is the one of the jet engine. We have a jet engine plunging from the sky in two instances and falling onto Donnie's room mercifully killing him on the second occasion. Now apparently the second time this happens, everything is made right again. The world is saved and Donnie can rest in piece ( or pieces to be more exact ).Where's the problem here? Well the jet engine apparently came from the wing of a plane (naturally) in which his mother and kid sister were in. Flying. Somewhere high above ground. In the air. You get the picture. Yet in both instances the crash clearly wakes up both mother and daughter. So what's the deal here? I will take out the first occasion since the world wasn't quite 'right' then. But what happened after the world was supposedly normal again? Did the mother and kid sister exist in two places at the same time? Darn! There goes the world again!Anyway since the film is apparently open to interpretation here's my take on it. There are some very interesting points made. The bunny appears up to the 2/3rds of the movie right after Donnie has swallowed his pills. The high school mascot has had an axe stuck at it's head. Its' solid metal head. Donnie tries to masturbate while under hypnosis.He also goes to sleep,presumably to die and he knows it ,with a wide smile.What do I make of this? Donnie is a schizoid personality. He has himself stopped taking his pills (as it's openly discussed in the beginning of the film). His psychiatrist has grossly underestimated the severity of his case instead of alerting the authorites and promptly locking him up. The rest of the film is part-true (as to him connecting with a similarly disturbed girl) and part-lies (visual and acoustic hallucinations appearing with some regularity) In the end he cuts off all links to his girlfriend explaining the event in his disturbed world by the intervention of 'deus ex machina' probably a neighbourhood boy who had courted his girlfriend thus 'killing' her as a person in his eyes. He completely shuts his eyes to the real world and 'goes to sleep' with his intelect collapsing in the Freudian expectation of Death. The only thing amiss here is the frame of some guys in white overalls tieing him down and driving away to the sunset.Overall the film was a huge disappointment. It had something going for it in the beginning but as another reviewer said 'after watching this look in Darko's eyes in his ominous sleepwalking routine I wished for 6-7 jet engines to come down hard on his head'. The more it seems to stretch itself,the less it has to offer. Make no mistake about it ; it would have made for two fine half-hour episodes of the 'Twilight zone', each with a different storyline. But as a movie? Thanx but ,no thanx. Which leads me to the original reason why I avoided watching this 'film' so far : Produced by Drew Barrymore....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I will admit first that I didn't watch the entire movie. But I did watch a pretty big chunk of it. It's honestly a very weird movie. It may not have been that bad a movie, but I really just did not like it. The storyline is pretty confusing. Especially the part with Donnie kind of having weird split personality things. I know monster tells him to do bad stuff, but the different personalities just don't work that well. I don't really know why. Secondly I don't really see how all the characters tie into the same story. It seems like there are way too many people and way too many different storylines. It gets a bit confusing. I wasn't the biggest fan, but others may disagree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It made me write a review!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a wonderful film the first time because in general you have no idea what just happened and it's so exciting to try and work it out for yourself. It will make you feel sad, scared, confused, and in the end happy as you finish with a smile and think that was fascinating; defiantly a good way to spend a night in!Spoilers Ahead - DO NOT read below if you haven't seen this filmI'm just going to make a few comments not cover the films entirety!I loved the cinema scene because of the line...DD: `What happened to your eye?' Frank: `I am so sorry'Together with the music and the softness of speech, it has such meaning and of course it's funny in a way because why would Frank say he's so sorry for a terrible injury inflicted on his eye! I felt so much guilt when Frank said that, even though I had no reason to, which I feel is a job well done to the director! + Sound department!Of course there are certain times during the film, which I didn't feel, were appropriate. Scenes and lines which intentionally try to confuse the watcher and have no real meaning. Some examples are.-The zooming in on the spiral in the aircraft engine and -The line in the cinema by Frank `Why are you wearing that stupid man-suit'I personally don't think the film needed these moments because the story was so strong by itself although I can imagine these scenes would cause stronger emotions of horror or confusion, which are main themes in the story among most people.On a positive note the film had an excellent sound track, which really helped to evoke the emotions, which each scene demanded from its watchers.So the film ended and I was thinking why does Donnie Darko have a big fat smile on his face and why does he laugh before he dies? Is it because he's so excited that he worked out how to time travel, is it because he knows he saved the life of his girl friend, is it because he knows death isn't the end, or is it because he thinks he's spent the last 28 days living in a world with choice designed to show he's not alone when really in end he is and he finds that funny because it's so ironic? Well in a way I like to believe it's all of the above because as the watcher the complexity of following so many lines to the story and being able to draw so many conclusions is what makes the film so great. In all of its diversifying plot and complexities the film allows the watcher to interact, more like a book, and it is this which captivates people and makes it such a great film.In my opinion Donnie's character is very intelligent and a very deep thinker. He's laughing because of the irony of his choice. Of course self-preservation is paramount in the human mind and so it's so funny that in his eyes fate is right even if it means he has to die. Think of all those times someone dies young, a religious person or someone who believes in fate is pushed to their limit of faith because why would such a terrible thing happen, you can never see past the event but Donnie can and I think just understanding a need for balance makes him laugh. He doesn't think it's unfair or wrong he thinks it's actually right for him to die and it's so funny because he would never ever think such a thing if he didn't truly have the choice.That was a great ending I really enjoyed the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jake Gyllenhaal. Wow. Not just for his acting, but for his provocative appeal and natural screen presence. This is somebody I hope to see a lot more of. Maggie Gyllenhaal gave a strong performance and I am not surprised to discover the two are siblings as the onscreen chemistry was excellent between them. Beth Grant, who played Kitty Farmer (The neurotic dance team's coach) was also excellent. Noah Wylie is always fun to watch. Though I was totally unconvinced by Drew Barrymore's short cameo, I was impressed that she co-produced the film.  Based upon the stupid evil bunny ad and lame title, I would never have rented it if it weren't so well ranked on IMDB. When I rented Donnie Darko, I had no idea what kind of genre the movie was in. The opening scene of Donnie Darko didn't really help either, but I knew this was going to be a good movie when the first song of the score played. I thought the choice in songs was excelllent (though overplayed at times) and added to the underlying sense of melancholic anxiety and euphoria of the film; a rare talent in filmmakers, save a very select few (as in David Lynch per Angelo Badallamenti). I don't think the direction of the film was meant to actually go a specific place. What makes the film good is how it leaves interpretation up to the viewer. I think any good psychological thriller leaves plenty to the imagination (er, psyche).There was, of course, some very obvious foreshadowing and explicit symbolism. When Donnie Darko had a talk with Prof. Monnitoff (Noah Wyle), they had to stop talking when fate and god became the topic. This movie, on a more obvious level, was about Donnie CHOOSING to accept his fate and follow the path of god. I gave 8/10 stars. I am very hard to please. I would watch the movie again. I thought the use of Echo and the Bunnymen was particularly silly and clever and have to go buy their record now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok ppl, I am in dire need of some help with this movie. I have watched it over the past week several times (better with each time) and I really need to figure it out. Now I know I can't know EVERYTHING and much of it is open to interpertation, but I will welcome any help if possible. So here goes....1. What is up with the first scene where he wakes up in the road? Is it just to set up the sleepwalking fact or does it have to do with the actual time-travel timeline.2. Why is it that Frank doesn't honk the horn the first go around, but at the end right before Donnie is killed you hear the horn honk frantically (a warning?)3. Does Donnie open up the wormhole to send the engine (Artifact) back or does that happen on its own, like before?4. Does anyone think that there was more to the whole Frank-Jim Cunningham connection (maybe Frank had a previous "encounter" when he was younger with Jim and that's why he wanted the house burned down)5. and finally, how exactly does he travel back and why does he drive up to the mountain in the first place, he sees the sky open above his house while he is there so why does he leave? isn't that where he needs to be?????There are some things that I have figured out and things I have noticed and I'm not sure if they have been mentioned before...1. one of the cool things I have noticed is that at the beginning of the movie Frank's voice is very distorted, but as the movie progresses his voice is distorted less and less until not at all when he shows himself to donnie (coinciding with him coming to grips with what he knows and must do, I guess)2. I do think maybe there is something valid about the whole super hero slant, the whole "why do you wear that man suit" comment in the theater, the "donnie darko sounds like a super hero" comment from gretchen, and the weird way he flips his hood up at several points in the movie (i can almost see his cape!!!)i have more, but i fear i have lost most of you already...lol!! thanks for the patience guys.Danielle</fullReview>

Does he sleep with a black marker? And the 2 "bad boys" who just happened to show up at Grandma Death's place."Donnie is shown picking up the marker when he was sleep walking. He grabbed the marker from the refrigerator marker board that was used throughout the movie.Now this is just a theory about why the two guys were at Grandma Death's house but I believe it was to rob her. They mention a couple of times in the movie that she was rich and kept jewelry around the house. Being that she was an invalid and it was Halloween made it a perfect opportunity to rob the place. Bottom line it was a plot device to have a reason for the Old lady to be in the street to make the car swerve and hit Jena Malone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is hands down one of the best movies of all time, or at least of my time, for a few reasons. #1. Originality. Though the idea itself may not be completely original it is damn close. #2. Acting. The acting in this movie is formidable to say the least. A key point to this is the relationship between Jake and Maggie. I think it was such a good idea to cast a brother and sister for a brother/sister role especially as these two are both great actors in their own rite. #3. No matter how many times I watch this movie, and it has been many, it is always different, I always see something different, understand something differently (especially the storyline as it is hard to decipher at best) and many other things.

		<shortDescription>Actually, it's not that dark...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is simply too highly rated because people are trying to take it apart and make 1000 meanings out of a story filled with meaningless McGuffins and Red Herrings. If you want to understand the film as a film made by a man, have a look at this explanation for some insight into DD...*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*I went to USC Film School so I can comment with some credibility on production students like Kelly. Take a quick look at this and you can see how USC production film student psychology explains much of DD that is a mystery to the rest of the world. First, read Richard Kelly's brief little bio and personal quotes on his IMDB page. Then, think about this: USC production students, especially those that spend $60,000 on a grad film that is a monstrosity of sci-fi and camp and mad scientists and teleporters are people who are trying to make 100 different films inside the scope of one big short film, DD is exactly this kind of thing: a glorified big short film. It is always a goal of every production student to one-up your colleagues and friends and to make a better "film to end all films" - whether it be on the student or USC graduate level. If you take this philosophy of filmmaking and place it on a film like DD it starts to make a lot of sense.For instance, Donnie Darko is not about time travel, it is not about God, it is not about philosophy, it is not about love, it is not about Frank, Gretchen, Cunningham, Grandma Death, small towns, suburbs, Chinese girls, Sparkle Motion, violence, bunnies, channels, gym teachers, portals, choices, mental illness, Drew Barrymore, or anything else for that matter. And last but not least it is certainly not about Donnie Darko. It IS about Richard Kelly imposing 1000 different ideas, which, each in their own right, are intriguing and might make an interesting short or perhaps a feature. But when you put them all together into an under 2 hour film like DD you end up with a real mess, a very entertaining roller coaster mystery mess that keeps you guessing, but still a big mess. I saw Darko in the theater when it came out and it was fantastic and I was really freaked out, I also enjoyed Star Wars Episode 1 IN THE THEATER. Then I saw Donnie Darko again on HBO two years later and the writing on the wall was clear: it wasn't about anything I had previously tried to rack my brain thinking it was about. It is just a collection of McGuffins that serve no purpose other than loosely tying ideas, characters, and scenes together using more Red Herrings than a Hitchcock film, the whole film itself is a Red Herring, it is a film that was made because a film based on that material and those ideas could be made and entertain an audience, and Drew Barrymore would get a part.People like to say this is an example of a "non Hollywood crap movie" but in the end it IS just another Hollywood movie, it is simply a compilation of a bunch of sci-fi B.S. that makes no sense on purpose, some religious wondering, and some overly emotional human responses to life, all thrown together in a blender and put together in an "Indy" style.My advice, if you see a movie in the theater and you think it is the greatest film even made, see it again on the small box at home, if it is AS GOOD OR BETTER, then it's a great film, but if it falls apart big time (Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace anyone?) then you'll know you're really seen the film for what it truly is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 'philosophy' of time travel, not the 'science'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand how anyone can take this film literally!No time-travel plot makes sense, simply because of the nature of time-travel. It's used in this film as a device to illustrate how an individual can affect people's lives - in one instance he dramatically changes the fate of a group of people, in another he does not. You can't get bogged down in the quagmire of time paradox because you'll end up chasing your tail like a dog.The director, by the way, must be a big fan of James Stewart. The scary rabbit is an obvious allusion to Harvey, the six foot invisible white rabbit, and the whole film is like a negative 'It's a Wonderful Life', where Donnie is shown what his life would be like if he lived, rather than if he died.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe I never saw this movie. But then again, I can believe it. The only thing I can remember about this film when it was in theaters, was the stupid "evil bunny" image they used to sell the film. That image combined with the title was a complete turnoff for me. It seemed as though it was a Stephen King type film, which I'm not into in the least. I'm not sure how that "evil bunny" mask wasrepresentative of the film. It's a damn shame they couldn't have marketed this film better, because it's a damn good movie.I didn't expect a lot of the things I saw, and the story was about as engrossing as anything I've ever seen. The story and the acting were compelling, and the casting was great. Somebody screwed the pooch in the marketing department on this. It should have done better in box office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My feelings on the film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING A SPOILER IS AHEAD!I've just watched the film and im going to have to say what i feel. The film was very good. Critics have dubbed it a "horror" (?) and a "psychological study", but to me, it is...simple as it may be...a love story.Donnie is Confused. So is everyone who has ever been a teenager.And nothing makes sense. But in the middle of it all is Gretchen. And there is nothing confusing about Gretchen. She is there for him. a And She doesn't present a problem. She doesnt probe Donnie. She doesnt ignore him. She doesnt reject his views or feel intimidated by his intelligence. So, there, in the middle of his confused state, is this one thing, so fantastic. Gretchen. And to anyone who has never experienced this, it is absolutely wonderful and cannot be described in mere words. And when she dies it seems so unreal to Donnie that all his confusion, everything he has been trying to understand, melts away. His world dissolves and come back to focus on one thing. And all he cares about is Gretchen.And as he reflects on everything, now he is apart from it, instead of in the middle of it, it all comes together and makes sense.And to me, when Donnie travels back in time, it is for no other reason than to save Gretchens life. And Donnies last laugh is because he is ecstatic and overjoyed that Gretchen will live, even though it is at the cost of his own life, and she that she won't ever know him. And that to me, is love.Maybe i'm just a hopeless romantic.It is funny, as i've just realised something. Patric Swayze was right. Donnie was looking in all the wrong places for answers. The answer was in love all along. Yeah, i definitely am a hopeless romantic, but i hope my view of the film has helped you look at it in a new way. Thank you for reading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a pretty good film. My inspiration to come here and put my comments down comes from something that mars the film, though. Drew Barrymore was terrible. It's her film, so I guess she caught some executive producr variation of the syndrome that M. Night Shyamalan has, where you feel you must insert yourself into your film regardless of logic, talent, good casting, etc. Drew, while good/appropriate in other things, sticks out sorely in this well-acted film, and her few scenes are played like an amateur. It's too bad she had to give herself a part. Delegate, Drew. You can walk through the Charlie's Angels routine, but this is different. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is one of the best films to come out of the United States in recent times. It feels sort of like what you would expect to see in a David Lynch film, but easier to understand.I'm not an expert on religion, but I think Donnie is kind of like a god like figure. Through his destructive acts he is giving these people around him a new life in the end, kind of like washing away thier pains and sorrow or maybe even thier sins. Through out the movie he follows a path of hints and symbols he sees along the way like following the path of God or the Rabbit. In the end he goes back to his room through the portal and kills himself to set these people free.I see the the annoying teacher and the speech person as being the devil's tool. They seem to walk the rightous path but it's ironic how they play the part of the anti-christ.I think the idea of time travel is interesting because all of us has something that we wish could be different in our past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Donnie Darko a remake of Carnival of Souls?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko was recommended to me by a friend who said I'd love it. The film had me on the edge of my seat throughout it's length, because it was taking me on a mysterious journey which I could not predict. I love films like this!!After the film's climax, I thought to myself: Hmm, this reminds me of a lot of ?Carnival of Souls' (1962). In fact, the more I think about Donnie Darko, the more I feel like the film was a remake of or at least heavily inspired by the 1962 chiller (anyone out there agree/disagree?).Overall, a brilliant feature debut by such a young dude. There were a few scenes however which I found a bit hard to decipher and afterwards I'm still a little confused by them. I think this added some needless complexity and shows that in some instances the film tries to be a bit too clever for itself.As for the rabbit: Beautifully, beautifully chilling. It's been nearly a week since I viewed DD, and I still cannot get that rabbit out of my head. Sometimes when I wake up in the middle of the night, requiring a visit to the bathroom, I just cannot make myself get out of my bed and journey through my darkened house lest the rabbit jump out to get me!!SPOILER ? JUST ONE, PROMISEI loved the way the rabbit became more and more defined during each scene he appeared. That was masterful!My personal score of DD is 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko's Death Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've recently read a user comment about Hitch's North By Northwest based upon the several absurd situations of the movie -like chasing a man to death using a biplane- to justify a low score review. Thinking of it, I understand we just can't take the superlogical mood to watch a movie (maybe unless it was by Ken Loach), since the very most of them have asburds and necessary tricks. Otherwise, genres like Action, Thriller, Sci-Fi or Horror would be completely pointless without this "cheating". And, in the other hand, this is the same old story about putting rules to art, boxing the emotions and so.But some of those tricks sometimes seem a bit unfair. I mean: putting the world of next-to-death dreams inside a plot (Muldholland Dr., What Dreams May Come, The Sixth Sense, Fearless) gives the story and characters absolute freedom. Similarly, focusing the facts from an out-of-order mind (Julia &amp; Julia, American Psycho), provides the same facilities to the writer. Also virtual realities (Tron, The Matrix) are extremely useful jokers in every game. Let's say the imagination bandwith is -intentionally?- boosted when any of these resources is assumed as the initial condition to develop a fiction, since everything in the Universe would have enough room to exist inside a nightmare, an ill brain or a computer program.***** SUBJECTIVE SPOILERS BELOW *****Donnie Darko -imho- may be taken in two different basic ways:1) A nightmare come true... with all that it implies.2) A death premonitory dream.In the first option everything is real: Donnie's visions, the rabbit, the psychologist, the school sabotage, the fire at the preacher's, the preacher himself, the car over the girl, the time warp, the plane incidents (the same only one but shown twice from different views), etc. Obviously, this is the romantic and non-realistic approach, at its top when Donnie's bravely decides to enter the reverse time warp.The second option grows on the premonitory dream of Donnie. This may seem pretty unreal too, but think there is just one premonition within his dream: the jet engine crash. Everything from this very point may easily be taken just as the threaded subsequent -agonic- dream; everything takes sense in this environment, as mentioned above. After the 1,5 hours dream lapse, reality retakes the scene to show the sad results of the disaster (actual people in actual situation).But, even this only premonition doesn't need to be a premonition at all: assuming Donnie, asleep, could hear for sure the loud noise of a turbojet getting too damn near and, then, dream of the crash right before it actually happens (don't you ever dream with cops and robbers while the TV plays a siren sound?). This last consideration makes this second hypothesis my favourite. Anyway, you can find lots of hints of this being the right look, for example the mother and little sister "surviving" the accidented flight... just because they never took that jet.In both cases, Donnie is the most sane and clever subject around; no matter he's a victim of Beyond experiences or just a very cohesive last-minute dreamer.An very interesting movie, not suitable for easy watchers.A P.S. question for the heavy staff: if you support the dream idea, who is the actual Frank? A friend? And the preacher? A relative? (Who cares?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what a good movie. Richard Kelley has struck gold here. Donnie Darko is the story of a young man who sometimes sees a giant bunny. The bunnies name is Frank. Frank tells Donnie to do harmful things, and predicts the end of the world. When Donnie gets this message there are 28 days left. In those 28 days Donnie learns of time travel, asks a girl out, and explains the way of the smurf to friends. A very entertaining movie, and a very interesting movie. But beyond that, it is a great movie that touches all in some way. It is more like some kind of poem than a normal movie. So if your in the mood for a great, unusual movie, look no further than Donnie Darko... Until next time, DonnieD</fullReview>

If you've read any reviews or synopses you might have heard about the man-sized talking rabbit. Sounds silly, but when you see the movie it makes sense. I also heard that the film deals with the idea of time travel, but if you're expecting the kind of time travel that Marty McFly is known for, then you're way off. It's hard to describe Donnie Darko. You just have to see it. Pretty impressive considering it was the writer/director's first major film effort. It's one of those movies where, at the end, you just sit there in silence for half the credits, with your mouth hanging open, until you finally start discussing what the heck is all means with the person next to you.</fullReview>

All that I will say is that you really need to think back to Donnie's last session with Dr. Therman(sp?). She really does some up what needs to happen. Also if you are going to watch the movie and have it on DVD I strongly suggest that you watch it with out the director and Jake Gyllenhaal's commentary.

		<fullReview>Contains Spoiler! Donnie Darko as a film builds curiosity well through an excellent narrative, that is, until the end.Like so many Hollywood films of the past few years, Darko falls apart at the final hurdle. The jet engine goes back in time - fine. However, it would have to be Donnie that does back if the past is going to be changed. He would need to return so that the conscious choice could be made to stay in bed rather than going out to the garden. If only the jet engine goes back then he would still be out of bed and wouldn't die.This could have been solved easily by the writer - Donnie creates a worm-hole and goes back in time and the jet engine is dragged back after him before the worm-hole closes.If it weren't for an unworkable end this would be a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OVERALL MOVIE RATING: **** stars. An excellent movie.DONNIE DARKO REVIEW:This was such a good movie. I originally saw it years ago on my birthday and was amazed at how incredible the acting was in this. By far one of the best movies I have ever seen, this is an award deserving film.Donnie Darko is about, well...Donnie Darko, a kid who sees weird visions of a bunny. One night Donnie Darko leaves his room just before some unidentified aircraft part lands in his room. He walks outside and is told by the demonic bunny that in some amount of days the world will end. Donnie soon believes that he has somehow travelled through time, and that is why he did not die when the aircraft part landed in his room.This movie has really good acting and it even has some funny parts. I was surprised to see Barrymore in it, but I was also happy to. She played her role as a teacher really good in this movie and she even added a few funny and good scenes along the way.This is a really good movie and it couldn't get any better. One of the best movies I have ever seen, I recommend this to anyone with an open mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From its premise, this film sounds absurd. A troubled teenager starts seeing a big man-shaped bunny that tells him the world is going to end.Yup. You read it right. However, this film is quite simply astonishing. Even if you don't understand it all the first time round, you know its makes sense...somehow. The giant rabbit, called Frank (but of course?)is one of the most terrifying things I've ever seen. The sense of impending doom and menace is just the right side of suffocating, but somehow it coexists happily along with sharply observed social satire, and philosophy.At heart, its a film about Donnie (duh). Donnie is troubled, as he himself admits. He's antisocial and sometimes violent, but he's also brilliant and insightful. He seems to be the only one to see through the local Dr. Feelgood, he's the only one to appreciate his English teachers doomed efforts to reach her class. He can negotiate time-travel theory and physics with ease, but he has trouble telling a girl he likes her. Despite his aggressive behaviour towards his peers, (and authority) it upsets him to see a girl being bullied. The Donnie we see burning down a buildings and swearing at teachers is the same Donnie who breaks down at the thought of dying alone.Simutaneously monstrous and terrified, Donnie is as much a paradox as the film itself. Its funny...but not really a comedy. The ending is tragic....but not sad. It has time-travel...but its not really sci fi. It raises some interesting questions, and answers just enough to satisfy...but not enough to spoil a repeat viewing.I saw this yesterday, and it bumped Citizen Kane from my top 5.To enjoy it most, watch something awful first, before seeing how a film can be made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being Richard Kelly's first big film, this deserves a ton of respect for its clever, original, and intriguing plot. Jake Gyllenhal, in my opinion, does a wonderful job in his portrayal of troubled Donnie Darko. Jake seems to have a perfect mix of Edward Norton's seriousness and understood commitment to a character, as well a hint of intensity, and comfort in character. He played Donnie to a T. Patrick Swayze was amazing in this movie in one of his best characters yet. Drew Barrymore is a bit useless in this movie, as well as Noah Wyle, but I do think they did their jobs well. This is a movie that you have to watch over and over and over again to catch all of the little hints and foreshadowing and symbolisim. This movie has one of the best endings I have seen in a long time. I could not have predicted this at all, which is why I think it makes it so classic. Great movie. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, who's to say he isn't? Donnie Darko remains as one of the greatest films made within the last 3 years. It's hard not to get caught up in the new age "superhero" genera, i.e. Marvel-comic-based-big-budget-action-flicks that are so prevalently spewed out of Hollywood today. With all that nonsense aside, this movie remains as a simple story of a boy with not so simple powers. In the classic sense, many may miss this point in the film. It is not in so how his powers came to be, but more in the sense of how he uses his ability to affect every other character in the movie. At the end of the movie, simply asking yourself the question: What would each one of these characters in the movie be like without Donnie? may lead to answering some of those strange feelings you have when this movie is over. Please don't watch this movie only once. With each new viewing you gain hidden insight into what the director was trying to accomplish with this film. Also, don't go away from this movie confused, disappointed, or sad because "I promise one day everything will be better for you." 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Q: Could this be the best film ever made? A: Yes, yes indeed it might be. The film, as you have probably already read, follows one mister donald darko, a troubled man child held captive by his own twisted mind. Donnie has been told some awefully scary news by a large bunny named frank and is struggling to deal with it. Now, if that sentence alone doesn't make you rush to the video store than listen to this: not only are there talking bunnies, there are also elements of time travel, an indepth analysis of papa smufs sexuality, and some of the best dialog since "Heathers." If you dont like this movie you are old!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film That Must Be Experienced Twice (At Least)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" is a film that dares to be different. Instead of laying out an easily followed A-to-B-to-C plot, "Darko" jumps, skips, goes in circles, and daringly, does not explain everything. This is the major flaw of the film in critics eyes, but in reality, this is the strong point of the film. To honestly understand "Darko", watch it twice. The first time, just experience the film. Feel the movie, do not try and intellectually understand it. Let the ominous mood, haunting music, and part archetypical/part realistic performances move you. Then watch the movie again with what you already know and try and piece it together. Even then, you might not fully understand it (I don't, Richard Kelly, the writer/director of "Darko" doesn't even fully understand it), but that's the boldest statement of all: some things in this life cannot be fully understood with the mind, they can only be truly understood on an emotional/spiritual level, and "Donnie Darko" is, gloriously, one of those things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Endearing, innovative film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without a doubt one of the most innovative pieces of cinema I've seen in a long while. Kudos must go to writer/director Richard Kelly for creating this little gem of a film, especially at such a young age. I'm not even going to begin to tackle the themes of this movie, as I'm still not sure what they are, even after several viewings. Suffice to say it is one film that you will find yourself thinking about for days and weeks after, and it will leave you hankering for repeat viewings.The film is beautiful to look at. The camera-work and Steve Poster's cinematography are absolutely first rate and I loved the use of the slow-motion and fast forward sequences. The soundtrack is great, and Michael Andrews' original score is perfect. The film is full of very likeable characters, most obviously Donnie himself, played by the excellent Jake Gyllenhaal. Donnie Darko is surely one of the most intriguing central characters in recent years. All the cast are first rate, and relative newcomer Jena Malone is beautiful as Donnie's girlfriend. Frank is a suitably creepy creation and whoever designed his costume deserves much respect for it.Having said all that, I must add that the story is confusing. A lot of people will be left asking "What the hell just happened?" at the end of the movie. Many, like myself, will be tempted back for another look or will visit the film's website for enlightenment. Others will just leave it and probably won't recommend the film to their friends. There are quite a few leaps of faith required and some (many?) aspects of the plot are left unexplained and unresolved. Personally, I think this is fine but there are a lot of people who won't. You shouldn't have to visit the website or watch the extras on the DVD for a film to satisfy you.Overall, a film that will polarize opinion. I loved it and rated it 9 out of 10. However, I can easily understand why somebody wouldn't like it. A fantastic effort but by no means a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having recently bought this on DVD after seeing it a few months before on video, it suddenly hit me that this film truly is one of the most original and quite frankly best films to grace us as human beings. It's funny, extremely thought provoking, extremely moving and in my eyes gives a more realistic view on time travel and the consequences of actions and the possibilities it could hold. What I liked most about it however, was the implicit style Kelly uses. Every scene in the film holds some sort of significance whilst not ruining the outcomes of the film or making anything predictable, every piece of dialogue is clever and intriguing and the use of analogies by use of certain images and things around adds alot to this spectacular masterpiece. I hate watching films like this though because all I want to do is make films for a career, and seeing something as clever as this is extremely daunting, I must learn the ways of the force! Anyway, a top top TOP quality film in every sense, see it, NOW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy.....but Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Herein.Going into this movie, I really had no idea about the plot or any elements of the movie at all. So, you can imagine my shock when a six-foot-tall rabbit starts to give him directions to destroy parts of Middlesex. Speaking of the rabbit, he was much more creepy than many characters in horror movies. The whole aura about him was just plain spooky.The plot of this movie unfolds in an interesting manner. There are some weird portions where you go back in time. And the whole ending maybe confusing to some people. But basically this kid, Donnie Darko, has a near death experience, and now this rabbit goes around telling him what to do. He obeys the rabbit because the rabbit saved his life by drawing him away from his house before a jet engine fell through his roof.The acting in the movie is fairly well done. They all do a good job of portraying their characters. Even Patrick Swayze, who I normally having an undying hatred for, does a sufficient job in this movie. The direction of the movie is good as well, as the movie follows a good enough pace to keep the viewer intrigued, while not throwing the entire plot at you at one time. The score of the movie is also appropriate for the movie. It enhances the general feeling of suspense and wonder of what might be the outcome of the situation.This is a very good movie. While it may not be for everyone, I would recommend it to most. Even if you are not satisfied with the beginning, I would suggest waiting to the end, as the ending is very good.Rating: 4 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you consider yourself open minded or intellectual at all, you'll think Donnie Darko is a movie you need to see more than once. Sure it has some very funnyparts, but that isn't the purpose of the movie. Infact, I don't think there actually is a single purpose or message to this film, instead, I think it is a brilliant work of art that brings thought provoking theories and hypotheticals to life. Philosophy, physics, existentialism, and spiritualism all wrapped into an hour and 45 mins. Plus it has an excellent soundtrack -- you can't go wrong. Thismovie is definitely worth owning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko, in its own dark narrative crammed with sporadic moments ofcomedy and its beautiful use of camera work is a wonderful tale drawing us into the life of a young teenage kid who's concerns with the world around him aredeeply rooted into and presented to us through his over-sensitive and intelligent character. He knows that people and events that take place around him areupside down and that he needs to do something about it.As far as one wants to make sense of a movie such as this, since it is closer to a dream than what may have happened in Donnie's reality: maybe this kid neverleft the bed and in an instant of clairvoyance he made his own sense about aworld that just seemed far too messed up anyway. And as he says in the movie, the answer will come to him in his sleep, just before the jet engine lands in his room, killing him just after he has understood "the meaning of life", or at least conquered his fears. Fear is the main theme running through this movie. Forone it is often made reference to in the movie itself; often by characters; such as that of Mr. Swayze, telling people to overcome our fears and become someonebetter, only it is not so much understood as overcoming ones fears (which iswhat Donnie understands one has to do) more so than repressing them which iswhat all these people of this small town are doing. One feels the unease with which the director has made them to appear through their sometimes-desperateacts in trying to make their lives and surroundings manageable.Donnie sets out to cleverly unveil and release the peoples' repressed fears with the guidance of Frank the rabbit (somewhat reminiscent of James Stewart in`Harvey'.The rabbit is only a 'vessel', the portal an opening to enlightenment, the book about time travel and the old lady are his conjured up signs taking to hisgreatest fear and back, quite literally.And all this comes to him in his sleep, which in turns frees him and ultimately all the townsfolk in the vicinity.A beautifully filmed dreamlike journey back to the eighties, with plenty of witty and at times dry humor, all tied up with an inventive dialogue, and laying down a great soundtrack listing classic pop and new wave hits from the eighties.All I've got to do now is go watch it again!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of rabbits and men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS AHEAD This movie is quite unique for the current US film industry. There is some elegiac mood in every shot,and music score is wonderfully appropriate. I liked the "hungry hungry hippos" sequence.And one in the cinema theater too. "Stupid man's suit" would become one of the most memorable lines in the cinema history. There is a lot of both tragic and comic moments in it,and the style remains of Paul Thomas Anderson a lot. On the DVD one of the actors comments that Donnie sacrificed himself for those dearest to him, and I personally like that kind of interpretation. It also brings additional meaning to the sequence with Last Temptation of Christ. I think it's good that movie is opened to interpretation. Plot was based on the idea of possibility of tangent universe to occur, but the fact that it wasn't explained properly is rather annoying.But that's about all complaints. Overall great movie, which leaves stunned, pacified and disturbed at the same time. Jake Gyllenhaal is absolutely great, and his character of "rebellious sleepwalker" and eternal stranger adds heavily to the movie appealing. And, of course, rabbit. 9 out of 10 with no doubt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a dream, a choice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers AheadI really enjoyed this film which surprised me as I went in told about how it was all a dream and he had never woken up let alone gone sleep walking. So when I watched it I was really pleasantly surprised because I really don't think that this film is about Donnie's dream, otherwise why isn't it just wish fulfilment. Why does he face the man he killed? Or watch his true love (its always true love at 18) die under the wheels of someone's car? Why say a dream is going to last 30 days? The questions are resolved but only if you look at the film another way. Donnie Darko did wake up, he was just given a choice, they almost (bear with some bad imagery here) folded a month of time back to show him the alternative of living. He could live and this would happen or he could die and save those people, even those he hated.Rather than compare this film to Jacob's Ladder its easier to compare it to Its a wonderful life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The PHILOSOPHY (not SCIENCE) of Time Travel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, didn't realise that this little gem I found nestled between Jaws 3D and Friday the 13th part 6 at my local DVD rental shop was so widely discussed by other movie lovers. Interesting to see how others interpret it. I would like to add my own, if you would indulge me...spoilers to follow, beware!!!Saying that this movie is about time travel or a death dream aka Jacob's Ladder is maybe being too literal in my opinion. Like others I was a bit baffled by the ending and had to contemplate a while to try and figure out what the whole point of this deliciously dark tale is. Like 12 Monkeys, another favourite of mine, probably only the writer really knows, but that's what makes movies like these so rare. Like a special poem, it can be interpreted by the individual to have a special meaning.I believe that what the writer was trying to say with this movie is summed up by the discussion Donny has with that guy from ER at school (sorry, no time to check the actor's name, forgive me Carter...). Their discussion takes a religious turn and is halted by the teacher for obvious reasons, but I believe that if this discussion was taken further, the message might have been more clear. In the end, my interpretation is this: Donny gets to see what will happen if he strays from the path chosen for him, i.e. not dying when the engines crashes in his room. All seems good, but it turns out that this alternative path has some rather dark twists and tragic conclusions, including the death of Donny's girlfriend and probably his mother and sister as well. In the end Donny decides to accept his fate and not let bad influences (probably embodied by the demonic bunny...brrrr) lead him astray, saving lives of loved ones by sacrificing his own, laughing when realising this just before the engine hits (let happiness in...). A dark little fable with a strong moral message, just like all other good fairy tales...So I suppose instead of comparing Donny Darko with Jacobs ladder, it might be more accurate to compare it to Sliding Doors on acid...Well, that's my opinion, use it, don't use it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So after much fanfare, I finally got the chance to watch this movie last night. While there was nothing "wrong" with it, I'm still attempting to determine what was so amazing about it (my rating, FYI, was a 7). Trust me, I've been a fan of "independent" cinema for the past 15 years or so, and I've loved dark comedies for as long as I can remember, so I'm firmly within the intended audience of the movie. I just can't help but think (especially after viewing a fair amount of the deleted scenes) that the movie really could have benefitted from either developing some of its subplots (what's with the Donnie and Drew Barrymore thing?) further (or, in the alternative, eliminating them altogether). And I think that the performances were fine, but unremarkable. The movie is good, but massively overhyped/overrated by the underground set.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>there is a hindu myth of the dreaming Bhrama who has constructed our "reality". this Bhrama sleeps and dreams resting on the petals of a lotus and that lotus grows from the navel of another sleeping dreaming bhrama who also sleeps on a lotus... etc etc. when the bhrama awakens the dream ends and we cease to exist.perhaps this myth exists to show how we really dont have much control over events in our lives even in our dreams ( which are usually composed of our desires). undoubtedly this is the case with donnie darko who even in his last few moments dreams a life which spins beyond his control; in fact even the ppl of that dream expereince events beyond thier control and undoubtedly wish they were "dreaming".(SPOILER DONT READ IF YOU DONT LIKE TO KNOW STUFF)now either i am REALLY old or ppl havent seen this done before; the ending for donnie darko is similar to that which was done in "Jacobs Ladder"; i dunno why everyone is so "blown away" that Donnie's "life" is composed of the last few moments of real "life" that he has before dying. Tim Robbins character goes thru this same revalation and the audience realizes that he dreamed his last few moments of a supposedly full life that is suddenly turned upside down by a feeling of dread( his impending death).Donnie Darko is a well done movie despite the formula being done before; its paced nicely, well acted, and has its own dreamlike quallity accomp[lished by the editing and dialogue which adds to the overall atomsphere of a dream from which you cannot awaken but merely experience to its conclusion.a definite 8 out of 10</fullReview>

I got the impression that, as so many have already pointed out, you watch the film through Donnie's eyes. You get involved in it because you want to understand and that's what Donnie is trying to do. That didn't make this film "heavy" because there are some good comedy moments in it. But it makes you think and that has to be a good thing.

		<fullReview>I watched this film last night on DVD and I truly thought it was a weird but amazing film. Donnie Darko is one of those films that makes you think and I love those types of films. Great performance from Jake Gyllenhall, what I wouldn't give to have that part. Definitely worth goin for a watch as it was considered the best movie of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard and read so many good things about this movie, that perhaps my expectations were too high. David Lynch Mulholland Dr. it's not! It's a rather predictable story, not difficult at all to follow like so many reviewers have warned us, full of cliches (the redneck teacher versus the "liberal" one who gets fired by an unimaginative principal, you see the type...). It's basically a teenager movie, with teenage-style bubble gum philosophy. It is well filmed, has a nice atmosphere, but everything is telegraphed from the start. The characters development also suffers from a simplistic black and white view of the world. Not a waste of time, but not a great movie either. 6* out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enlightning film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If ever there was a movie that is so mind enthralling, this is it. Donnie Darko is a powerful film and is definately on of my favorite movies of all time. The acting is spot on and the directing is also impeccable. Above all, the story line is so compelling and challenging that I have now seen this movie about a dozen times and am still impressed by it anew every time I watch it. The story of a teenager plagued by visions about the end of the world opens the door to a much thicker sub-plot which will leave anyone who watches Donnie Darko with a sense that they have just witnessed a masterpiece. Gyllenhaal's playing of Donnie is fantastic and throughout there are new scenarios and situations that need to be considered, making the film as hard to figure out as it is. The rewarding factor is that when you finally do figure what the movie is about, you realise that you have just spent two hours watching a movie that is certainly worth being watched. I have rated this movie 9 out of 10 and stick by this rating, 10 being highly unachievable by any standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hallucinogenic... Hypnotic... Harvey?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possibly one of the strangest films of 2001, Donnie Darko is an intriguing bag of goodies. Basically, paranoid schizophrenia affects the mind of a late-'80's suburban teenager, who falls victim to the hallucinogenic effects of prescription narcotics, and he befriends a mangled bunny who tells him the world will end on a specific date, so he researches time travel from a local author who has lost her mind, and eventually he realizes the world's end can be avoided by large Abyss-like bubbles which ooze from peoples' chests at random and cause them to travel back in time, yet unfortunately his death, avoided in one continuum, will reveal itself in the other. That makes for an interesting two hours. The film is charming, funny, and decidedly offbeat, and moves at a laid-back, 'suburban' kind of pace. Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal are both great as bro and sis, and Mary McDonnell is fantastic as always. The direction and writing are both commendable, setting up a doomed atmosphere which sucks us in but keeps us entertained. However, the only flaw to this film is the casting of Drew Barrymore in a totally unnecessary role as the English teacher. She is absolutely dreadful here, and the only reason she was cast is because she is one of the film's producers and helped get it made. I commend her for that, but why did she have to force the screenwriter to write her in? That's a ridiculous abuse of power, and her irrelevant scenes represent this film's sole weakness. However, this movie still earns a high recommendation- 3&amp;1/2 stars. It was refreshing to see a film set in the eighties that didn't exploit it's period with bad clothes, music etc.- a'la Wedding Singer- rather, I thought the soundtrack was ingeniously contrived- Echo &amp; the Bunnymen's "The Killing Moon" starts off the film wonderfully.... Check this little gem out when you get a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls short of a complete success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Donnie Darko, and thinking back on all of the trippy details, I felt the overall vibe it left me with was excellent. There are some terrific ideas here and it really makes you think about it long after viewing. HOWEVER, if I'm honest, my experience while actually watching it was not quite as positive. Most of the characters in the film are cartoony stereotypes which really kept me from getting fully caught up in it. A few of the actors manage to infuse some subtleties that lift their characters above this (most notably the family) but most do not. Most notably, I must say i had an easier time believing Drew Barrymore as a Charlies Angels superspy than an English teacher in this one. Also, it seemed like there were way too many scenes where it was more about playing a song for the soundtrack (which are all very good by the way) than advancing the plot.This is a film that should be seen, and I hope to see more from Kelly. Right now, though, any comparisons to David Lynch and Mulholland Drive are extremely premature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my favourite movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the IMDb registration system asked me what my favourite movie was, I hesitated for a moment then decided to go with what came into my mind first - Donnie Darko. As a film, I give it 9 out of 10, because there are plenty of little flaws dotted throughout the film, and because I find it impossible to bestow the title of perfection on any film (or anything).However, as a movie-going experience, Donnie Darko is exactly the kind of film I always hope for. I could go on for some time about its cleverness, its humour, its shocking moments, its acting etc etc etc... but what mattered most for me about this film was that I was transported out of the movie theatre and into a different world. Almost every character, in particular the members of the Darko family, was so perfectly realised that I couldn't help but constantly identify with the acts I was seeing.This is what happens when the magic of film really hits you. For me, it is the characterisation in a film that determines the effect it has upon me (with a few notable exceptions, such as Terminator 2: Judgment Day, where the special effects are the driving force). I walked out of Donnie Darko and into the light of the real world feeling confused and disoriented, wishing I could have spent more time in that alternate universe, but with a different outlook on the universe I was returning to.Kudos to Richard Kelly and his many associates who were able to create a world which seemed to be made especially for me. And it wasn't just me either - there are plenty people I've spoken to who felt a similar way. If you don't like this film, then fair enough, it's certainly not for everyone. I'd like to hope, though, that as many people as possible can gain as much from it as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off I'd like to say anyone who doesn't like this movie, it is simply because they don't understand it. This was fantastically done, and fantastically freeform. I thought the plot was genious. True, I watched it twice to make sure I got it right, but it was even better the second time. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good plot you have to think about and independant films. I just can't describe it.If you think this movie is about mental disorders...than you obviuosly blacked out during the movie, or just plain don't get it. Sorry to say most people are accustomed to having a movies plot spoon fed to them by a major hollywood star with plenty of c4 and shell casings to boot. If you think this movie is horribly acted then you are just hopeless.It's too bad that when such an incredibly original and intelligent movie comes along, people just dismiss it because they are to close-minded to see past it all and interpret the deep metaphors in the movie. I'd love for another movie from director Kelly, and I'd love any movie as daringly beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like DUH, it WAS in the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comment is in response to some of the people who thought the movie failed or was in some way lacking because it had an 80's vibe. All I have to say is, the movie WAS SUPPOSED to look 80's, use 80's music, and have an 80's vibe because it takes place in the 80's. If any of you paid attention, you would have picked up on this during the various references to Dukakis running for president! But hey, hardly any of us ever pay attention to presidential politics anyway, right. I mean, one of the smallest percentages of the population in election history managed to get off their butts and vote in the last election so I should expect such oversights. Geeze, more people need to vote.Anyhow.History lessons aside, I heard a lot of good things about this movie. So I rented it on DVD and was happy to say that it lived up to its reputation. Its more of a sci-fi thriller with non-linear story telling than a horror flick. Although, it is definitely spooky enough to make you want to sleep with the night light on.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes dark films that make you think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trying to explain this film to someone who hasn't seen it is a nightmare. Telling them about a giant scary rabbit, time travel and Patrick Swayze as a motivational speaker makes this film sound...lame (I blame this almost entirely on Patrick Swayze.)The film itself I loved. I liked all the actors - including the afore mentioned Swayze - and Jena Malone is definitely building a reputation as a fantastic character actress, as is Jake Gyllenhaal. The plot itself was well executed; as an audience, we are becoming accustomed to not thinking during our entertainment. I *liked* that I had to work out what the director wanted me to see. I enjoyed the symbolism and the even the lower amount of dialogue that is present in the film.I understand that not everyone would like this movie - personally I cant stand David Lynch, except for Twin Peaks, and this movie is a reasonably slow moving film. And yet, for me, it is all part of its charm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something is Happening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was about a month ago I went down to my local Blockbuster, and there really wasn't much left on the shelf. Consequently decided to watch Donnie Darko out of sheer boredom. To be honest the movie wasn't that bad.The synopsis of the movie was to enlighten the viewer about the theory of timelines and how those timelines decided your fate. However my personal thoughts about the movie, that ending was a little sketchy, as the 'real' reality did not coincide with the 'alternative' reality. The movie that came close to capturing the theory of timelines was Sliding Doors. Obiter Dictum I personally think that the theories of timelines should be thought of as two train lines that have to intersect. All aside the low budget actually enhanced the appeal of the movie, as it gave it an eighties look. Moreover the movie montage dubbed to Tears for Fears - Head Over Heals was absolutely brilliant. I really can't say that Donnie Darko isn't one of my all time favourites, however the movie is unforgettable. Apart from some of its flaws, the movie does deserve a high rating of 8 out 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad little film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*Donnie Darko surprised me. Sure, some of the symbolism was a bit on the obvious side and the late 80's setting seemed pointless, but overall I found the movie rather enjoyable. Through most of this movie I wasn't exactly sure what was going to happen. Donnie Darko achieves this without descending into the incomprehensibility that plagued other time warp movies like Lost Highway. For me that goes a long way towards making a movie enjoyable. The acting was decent, the script was good, and the directing wasn't bad (it was his first film so I'll cut him some slack). Darko is a niche movie though and will not be enjoyed by all audiences. Not the greatest movie I've ever seen, but it was more enjoyable than the usual crap Hollywood is cranking out these days. I'd rather see 100 movies like Donnie Darko get greenlighted than one more Pearl Harbor or Charlie's Angels II. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well crafted, thoughtful film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to talk much about the plot of DONNIE DARKO, I think many of the scenes and revelations work much better without aforethought. I will say that the ending, though debated, is best left open to personal interpretation. I have not seen the DVD, or heard the director's commentary, which may reveal the true meaning of the film's conclusion...I don't know. The ending evokes David Lynch, with its' ambiguity, and allows the viewer to complete the story in their own way. DONNIE DARKO does not labor to explain away the finale, it simply concludes leaving the viewer with resonance and echoes.What really surprised me was that this is a film about teenage life that actually has ideas. The lead role (superbly acted by Jake Gyllenhaal) is a troubled young man, but not in that cinematic "troubled young man" way. His character builds and transmogrifies, subtly, throughout the narrative. Donnie is nuanced and vulnerable, defiant and submissive. He has a abstracted and unhealthy view on sex (at that age who really has a healthy one?); he stands up for people, but is not a hero. Upon arriving at the conclusion, this kid has been dragged through inner conflict and doubt, pressure and confusion, final release.The film nurtures its' sci-fi roots with references to Minkowski's space-time theory, Einstein's worm-holes, along with other allusions to physics and science. The film draws a sense of time travel via Philip K. Dick and throws in a little Bradbury here, a little Vonnegut there.The prophetic rabbit is equal parts Harvey and Alice in Wonderland, and the time period is wonderfully supported by the 88' presidential debates. Donnie Darko backstops the material in a way that many films are simply too lazy to do. These qualities add greatly to the mystery and nuance of the on-screen action. DONNIE DARKO gives the audience credit and does not pander. In an early scene at the bus stop, notice the way the characters' comments can go from jovial humor, to cold racism in a single breath. Also, the scene in which Donnie calls his mother a "bitch" is extremely well executed.The supporting cast creates a realistic family dynamic; the father, played by Holmes Osborne, is torn between stolid parenting and breaking out into rowdy laughter. In a time of stereotyped teenage images (TV's SAVED BY THE BELL, etc., or the film American PIE and other such pubescent sex-romps), it is refreshing to find such strong and layered characters as the ones portrayed in this film. DONNIE DARKO walks a fine line, but finds the right balance and rarely falters. 9/10</fullReview>

Especially when you take in account that it's the first movie this director has ever made.And it must be great being able to write, portrait and direct yourself without over-writing, over-acting and over-directing. It does contain some nice clues, and there's a lot of social criticism and (I dare say un-American) self reflection, so much needed in nowadays America.However.though I liked it a lot, I just can't see what all the fuss is about. Was it worth all the hustle, talk, secrecy and hype? No I think not.Maybe it has become such a smash hit because it has all the elements to entertain the average public, plus a little extra to let that same audience have a taste of the better none-Hollywood-style-movie. It really doesn't ask that much of the viewers imagination. My advise to those who consider Donnie to be that special movie they've all been waiting for so long: go to the cinema more often and skip the action packed standards. This is cinema it is supposed to be: it is good, it is well thought, it is original. But not worth the hype.</fullReview>

But where does Donnie get off calling his mother a bitch? Or is this meant to illustrate Donnie's tenuous grasp on reality?I am not averse to complex plots, but when you can put about any interpretation on what happens, then I suspect obscurity for obscurity's sake.

		<fullReview>I recently rented this movie after hearing the cover of Tears For Fears song Mad World. This song was so haunting in itself, I had to see the movie. What a gem of a film! This movie stayed in my head for the next couple of days as I tried to piece together what I had seen. Tons of symbolism, and interpretations that all vary with the view. I watched this with two other people, and we all noticed very different details.This movie is not a horror film as I thought it was going to be by the previews, and plot. I though it was going to be more of a drama/horror, as it turns out the movie much more of a sci-fi having to do with time travel. As well as asking and challenging questions of our lives path, and divine intervention. And what happens when in this life we experience love and fear, which are the dominant emotions throughout the film. Also does some great explorations of suburban life in a dark dysfunctional way.The soundtrack/score is absolutely stunning. The use of 80s popular, and obscurities and the old analog instruments of the score add to the entire atmosphere of the film. All of these elements set the mood for the ride.Cinematography is beautiful, and ominous at the same time. Lots of interesting pans, sequences that draw you into the film. Every location feels connected but worlds apart from the look of the various terrains used. The location of the movie helps to setup the mood that continues throughout.Great performances from all involved, I like to see well known actors take small supporting rolls in independent films, it shows passion and devotion to the art they perform.Richard Kelly is a fantastic director/writer. I can't wait for his next film, and hope he continues to write and direct in the style of such directors as Terri Gilliam, and David Lynch. He leaves much for the viewer to conclude on your own. After watching the movie once, check the deleted scenes from the DVD, and you will see why many of them had been left out.This was my favorite movie of 2003, wish I had been up on the original theater release. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

The first 2/3 of the movie were very enjoyable, and I kept waiting for an amazing ending. Suffice it to say, I'm still waiting. Maybe I need to hear the commentary to understand what was going on inside the director's brain. But I found this extremely disappointing. For all those out there complaining about the ending of Signs, watch this movie (wait, they probably have, and they probably think its a masterpiece). Why, because the conclusion is incomprehensible? Oh, you just didn't understand it! I can hear it now. No, I'm sorry. The director had something going, and he blew it. The movie is all over the place, and it doesn't know what it wants to be. A 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is perhaps one of the greatest films of the last decade. Perfectly cast and acted the film portrays the demented life of Donnie Darko. A teenager in high school who is plagued by a bunny rabbit costumed figment of his imagination which encourages him to commit a series of anti-social deeds. This movie is a blend of 80's retro pop culture (but not overbearingly so- an excellent soundtrack really pushes this fact home), sci-fi and suspenseful horror. Don't expect an Evil Dead type gore fest with this film. If you were to compare it to any other film make it The Shining. It many ways I find Donnie Darko to be far superior to The Shining. I would highly recommend this film to anyone and everyone. A must see. I look forward to the directors next film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange but very interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard some great things about this movie before I got a chance to see it and I must admit, it was a little too weird to be excellent. I did enjoy it though, and I thought it was rather well done. Also, the acting was commendable. Still, it was a bit hard to follow because of the strange events. What was interesting was that throughout the movie, I couldn't tell whether Donnie Darko was really crazy, or if he was experiencing some sort of psychic phenomena. The end wraps it up rather nice, albeit dark. Well, the movie IS called "Donnie Darko". I would recommend this to my friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember the feeling you had the first time you read "Catcher in the Rye" or saw David Lynch's film, "Blue Velvet"? Well, this experience should be right up there!Ultimately, this is an esoteric piece that will make you want to re-watch it the second it's over to try and figure it out - á la "Sixth Sense". That said, it's a wonderful coming-of-age story (the likes of Salinger's "...Rye") of a cynical adolescent, Donnie Darko. Donnie is a sort of a comic book high school hero, who tells everybody where to get off in such an intelligent way, that even his parents have to congratulate him on being expelled from school.The twist that will "knock you flat" (as Jan Stuart of Newsday put it) is almost superfluous in light of what the rest of the film has to say for itself. This is almost two films in one: a highly spiritual film about time and space; destiny versus free choice - and one that is very earth-bound about having the courage to be your own person, and about questioning everything before excepting blindly. The two themes are magnificently bound together in a visually stunning, and breathtakingly acted film. Keep an eye out for Jake Gyllenhaal - he's right up there with Toby Maguire.One of the best films I've seen in the past few years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>absolute absurdity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>first time writer/director richard kelly has crafted his film "donnie darko" much in the tradition of samuel beckett. the young donnie darko (jake gyenhaal), who has "intimidating" test scores, leads an alienated audience down a dangerous and disturbing quest for god. like the vagabonds in beckett's play "waiting for godot," darko too waits for something to happen. darko waits about a month.there is a beauty in kelly's certainty, or rather, his comfort in his uncertainty, about the answers to the film's questions. too often, filmmakers seem compelled (maybe by studio philosophers) to solve every enigma man faces. kelly refuses, and instead, presents a challenge to the audience instead of a pacifier.i appreciate the complexity of the family dynamics. instead of painting a norman rockwell painting of suburban dysfunction, gyenhaal and his real life sister maggie gyenhaal, are in many respects, well adapted and healthy teen-agers growing up in the late 1980's.the performances are very well crafted and the delivery is unexpected. if you can divorce yourself from the need for resolution, "donnie darko" can provide an excellent spring board for pondering the unknown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very different film that just misses being cliched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen Donnie Darko (DD), I know why it draws such different views and widespread discussion. DD doesn't give the audience any easy answers while raising questions for the audience. Although there is aspects of time travel, mental illness, teenage confusion, a misguided community and yes, a large evil-looking talking rabbit, this film is greater than the sum of its parts. DD is possibly the 80's teen film to end all retrospective 80's teen films while managing to avoid most of the cliches that surround this genre.Much like a David Lynch film, DD draws the extraordinary and the corrupt from the shadows of American suburbia and makes for fascinating watching. Unlike David Lynch however, this movie has no real loose ends or events that seem to occur randomly. You may ask why this event occurred (especially with the climax) but everything is internally consistent - the real questions arise about the motivation of the characters who revolve around DD.At times this movie can seem to move a little slow, but everything has the feel of measured and deliberate pacing in retrospect. Not knowing what is coming up next is fantastic. Even normal events can often skew far beyond expectations and the sense of "where is this going?" really adds to the atmosphere.As said before, DD still hits some cliches - the bad kid, the teacher who doesn't understand, the parents who try but just can't be there, the misunderstood teen in Donnie himself. No doubt some audiences have mistaken the lack of a definite answer(s) to be a sign of great cinematic depth, whereas other audiences will simply see the film's resolution to be lazy and borderline cheating in using the oldest cliche of all. For me, the enjoyment of Donnie Darko comes not from the destination but the journey the characters take. A very different film that is unlikely to be matched for quite a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this movie, I was reminded of a line from another fabulous movie..."Sometimes, there is so much beauty in this world, I just can't take it"(hope I got that right?) An exceptional movie from all aspects. The acting, from the lead (Jake Gyllenhall-Donnie Darko) to the supporting cast, is remarkable. The direction, the production and the soundtrack are all so incredibly perfect, that I am baffled that this movie did not recieve any award nominations during last year's awards run-in to the Oscars?? Seen a few user comments here on IMdb that compare this film to being the worst film of all time? Wow! Cannot understand if they saw the same film that I and thousands of others saw and loved so much that it is now in the top #100 of all time? I am guessing they were expecting either a Scream/Final Destination kinda slasher flick.. Not sure if I understood all aspects of the storyline, though...It will probably require a couple of viewings before I can finally relish this truly delightful, dark, funny, poignant movie. Something that will remain with me for a long, long time. The DVD version in Australia has the extended/deleted scenes package. In one of the deleted scenes, Donnie and his father Eddie are having a chat and Eddie tells Donnie to be true to what he sees and feels coz the rest of the world who laughs at him are fools, bulls*** artists...Man, I better stop coz there are so many things in this brilliant movie that I could rave on about..non-stop!! This is a must-see for any intelligent individual. A true, modern masterpiece of our times.10 out of 10, 5 stars out of 5, 100 out of 100..U get the picture, right?</fullReview>

It touches on these subjects in a classy yet comical way. A general understanding of space-time is not needed, though, it is taught in grammar school. If you know what a black hole and a worm hole are, and understand how society operates...understanding this movie should be cake... This movie is made to be understood when viewed the first time. If you watch it a second time, try to look for symbolism. It can be a horror for some; everything in the movie can be explained scientifically.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an excellent trip!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few movies that have really gotten under my skin, stayed there for days, and inspired me to think further into the movie's concepts. I had no idea what kind of film this was going to be when I got the DVD. By the looks of the cast, I thought I was in for a teen slasher flick. The name "Donnie Darko" didn't sound too hot, either. I'm so glad I watched this film because it was much different than I thought it was going to be. Its intelligence rivals that of any sci-fi movie. I guarantee most viewers will be thinking about this film for days after they've seen it.The title character, Donnie Darko, is a 15-year old living in a small town in 1987. His parents have suspected he has mental problems and he is kept on some medication to help his problem with sleepwalking. One night, he is summoned out of bed by a distant voice. He follows it to a nearby golf course, where he meets a demonic-looking rabbit. Soon after Donnie has left his house, a jet engine crashes into his home, leaving most of it intact except for Donnie's room. Donnie had cheated death, but why? Why did this creepy rabbit get him out of bed? And why are the townspeople acting so strange? These are just a few of the questions you'll want answered. At it's core, the story is about time travel and parallel worlds, something that has always fascinated me. Richard Kelly, the writer of this brilliant story, takes an old idea and turns it into something totally new. I'm tempted to give more details, but I won't spoil the film here.The cast is full of big names, which is something I tend to cringe at, but the cast works so well in this film, that their starpower is barely noticeable. This was the first time I've seen Jake Gyllenhaal in a film, and I was pretty impressed. The acting all-around was very well done. I especially liked Drew Barrymore in her small role as a schoolteacher. Patrick Swayze is excellent as a nutty self-help guru trying to spread his program throughout the town. With such a small budget, this movie turned out better than most multi-million dollar productions. This film is the ultimate display of love, from every department that went into making it. Mr. Kelly has said that everyone worked for practically nothing, including hundreds of cast and crew. Their dedication and care really shows in the final product and they all deserve to be commended for their effort. Be prepared to watch this film more than once, because it will help greatly in understanding the story. If you have the DVD, play the commentary with Richard Kelly and Jake when you watch that second time. And after that, be sure to visit the "Donnie Darko" website to gain some very important information on time travel and what happened to several of the characters. This film just might have taken "The Sixth Sense"'s spot on my top 10 list. That said, this movie deserves a 10/10.</fullReview>

It started off good, but as the story goes on the plot becomes too complex, and at the end of the film your just sitting there thinking, what?? It could have been alot better if there was more character devolopment and less weird-for-the-sake-of-weird stuff.

Donnie Darko is a truly strange movie, and is pulled off in a viewer friendly way that makes you want to understand it.So, to sum it up, rent this with the expectation of watching it again, because it's no fun thinking you'd wasted the last two hours.Get the DVD and watch the full motivational videos from Patrick Swayze's character.

		<fullReview>This was without a doubt the best film I watched in 2002, not to mention an awesome directorial debut. However to my dismay this film didn't receive the hype it deserved, at least not in the UK. The film evolves around Donnie Darko, an emotionally troubled teenager (is there any other kind?) who is dealing with puberty, suburban life and a rabbit who encourages him into random acts of violence but don't dwell too much. The film elaborates through twists that are far more enthralling than the meager synopsis suggests and gives a refreshing view on teenage life without being patronising or pummelling the opportunity for every sexual innuendo imaginable as we've seen so many times before in this genre. This film left me awestruck and contemplating many aspects of the film and more importantly things to which I could relate. This is a film which will be embraced by cult status with open arms and a DVD I will scramble to purchase.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent mood but not much logic (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film was very moody and offbeat, but had no internal logic. Donnie is saved by Frank, who tells him to flood the school (which infuriates the school bully), to burn down the motivators house (which exposes his child porn ring), etc etc which leads to Frank's death. So where is Frank coming from? Not the future because he's dead (shot in the eye). Not from the past (he doesn't have the wound he got in the future). So what does any of it mean? Frank has no motive to save Donnie since it leads to his death. I understand why (if that's what we're being told) that Donnie chooses to go back and die - but only to save his girlfriend. That could have been accomplished by not doing what Frank said. BTW - in the "improved" future - Donnie is dead and the child molestor is not caught. Not much of an improvement. And what's with the old lady? Does her book add anything to the story - and what was the letter Donnie wrote to her? Was that the letter she was expecting? Everyone has done time travel and loops from the Twilight Zone, to Star Trek, to Babylon 5, and I think they did it better.I'll give it marks for effort but not for the result.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, the acting was excellent.The whole plot twist thing comes down to one of the converstations that Donnie has with Noah Wylie's character, when the teacher's answer to Donnie's Question is "...that would be an act of God."Evil, in the form of Frank, a bad kid (after he runs over Gretchen, all he has to say is, "What were you doing in the middle of the street?") gives Donnie a second chance, like a reverse "It's A Wonderful Life." Donnie does bad things as if to repay Frank, and those bad things have unexpectedly good consequences--maybe because Donnie is a good kid at heart. When he finally realizes that he doesn't belong in this world and that his being there is starting to cause hurt and death to others, he gives in to the act of God, which results in his own death.At least that's the way I see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of those rare films that makes you think and feel and wonder. A tragic love story, a speculation on the nature of time and destiny, a study of madness contrasted against collective insanity; dark, funny, ambiguous and flat-out weird, this one worked for me on many levels. I admire a filmmaker who doesn't feel the need to explain everything, and this is definitely one of those movies that demands repeated viewings."Donnie Darko" abounds in sly references to its many inspirations, among them "Harvey" and -- in a very perverse sense -- "It's a Wonderful Life" (thanks to the missus for pointing that one out to me).Jake Gyllenhall is by turns menacing, tender, heroic and pathetic, and the rest of the cast is more than adequate, with Patrick Swayze in a fine turn as the self-help guru whose perfectly-coifed head any right-thinking human would just love to dent with a 2-by-4.Besides the bearable sampling of 80's music (and I'll admit I'm no great fan of the era) the score is at times faintly reminiscent of the Orff/Keetman pieces used in Terence Malick's first film, "Badlands".The camera work is eerie, sometimes lyrical and often disturbing -- a perfect match for this story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend of mine called and said, "You've got to check out this flick, Donnie Darko. I don't know what I think, and I want your opinion. It has this talking rabbit that really creeps me out."I like creepy films. I checked it out. But, I was expecting to see some twisted Bugs Bunny cartoon. I was expecting to feel like the moldy pretzel I become after seeing a Lynch film. Donnie Darko made perfect sense to me. I was not confused. I was not creeped out. I did not feel twisted. In fact, I'd go so far as to say I felt...enlightened.I was shocked in the best way from the beginning of Donnie Darko through the end. Somehow I immediately knew that it was going to be a great film. It was no twisted Bugs Bunny cartoon, that is for sure. It was beautiful. Seriously beautiful.For anyone who spends a great deal of time contemplating life, death, love, spirituality, all of that happy crappy, this film is basically one of the best life, death, love, spirituality conversations you've ever had. Take your most imaginative, insightful friend on four cups of coffee, give him two hours to rant and rave, and you might come close to having an experience similar to watching Donnie Darko.And the eighties! Ah, if you've been dying for something serious to evoke nostalgia of your childhood (assuming you were a child of the eighties) this is great. So many films set in the eighties are so corny. Sure, the eighties may have been corny. But, I remember a whole lot of seriousness in there as well. The Dukakis/Bush election. I'm thinking "Vote Dukakis" was once written on a marker board on MY refrigerator.Bottom line. Don't be frightened if you hear this is a film with a creepy talking rabbit. It's really not a creepy film. It's a thought-provoking film that reminds the viewer that confusion can be quite blissful.Oh, and yay, America! I mean, seriously, it has been forever since I've seen an American film that really grabbed me. Finally!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"What if you can go back in time, and take away all those hours of pain and darkness and replace them with something better." this to me seems to bring out a theory that i don't think many people have thought of. after watching donnie darko (admittedly missing about the first 30 minutes), i feel that a major focus of the film should be on frank. i urge you all to watch the film again focusing on this line and frank and see if the film does not take on an entirely different pictures of people's selfish behavior. great film. can be interpreted many different ways, which makes it very stimulating. loved it. great mis en scene and cinematography. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So very confused...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS!!! Ok... i finished watching this film less than an hour ago and just got done reading everyones opinions on it and i must say i am more confused about this movie than any other i can recall.First, where does this story come from? because some of you talk about it as though it is taken from an actual event and some of you talk about it like it was a story created from someones imagination.My first set of questions... 1) Is the PoTT real? 2) was Donnie Darko real?If he was real then how was this story written? because if he was real then movie is a contradiction to itself. because in the end it is clear that DD is dead. but the way that he died was that he travelled back in time to make a different choice and stayed in bed, which in turn took his life since he layed in the spot that he knew the plane would fly over...and the engine, referd to by others on this site as engine X, killed him.now, idea 1... Donnie on October 2 gets out of bed and goes to Frank.frank, in a way, saved his life. because if DD hadnt moved he would have been smushed. now, DD goes on comitting these acts that frank suggests and seems to get away with them all untill he chooses to go back in time to die so that he can stop being alone. if this is the case then in the end we are brought back to the beginning where reality starts. if he would have died in that room, even if all of the other 112 minutes of the movie actually happend, we wouldnt have known, because we wouldnt have sen him live them, because he went back and chose to die. ( i know this sounds really bad but its a complex and confusing subject. ) so now we have DD dead because of engine x. now where did engine x come from? in the movie we are shown that it comes from the plane that DD's mother and sister are on. well if engine x really did kill DD then i think engine x would have had to come from somewhere else. here is why. you have to ask yourself why were DD's mother and sister on that plane. they were on it because they were coming home from a big competition of some sort where everyone seemed to be excited. if DD died aprox. a month earlier i dont think that his mother and sister would be on a plane coming back from a dance competition. i just dont think that they would be up to the trip you know what i mean.This is when i get confused...because then you have to ask yourself about religion and all of that... would someone answer there questions...1)why does DD's mom stop crying and wave at DD's would have been future girlfriend at the end? 2) what is the name and artist of that song at the end of the movie i believe it was called Mad World or somthing like that. 3)why does the teacher sit up in the end...what relivance does that have? 4)who is the guy in the red jump suit and does it have a religious referance? 5)what relevance does the chinese girl have and DD's name written on her book? also whats the deal with the ear muffs. 6)when Dres Barrymore walks out after being fired what does she stop yelling and look at the little girl as though they are communication or have communicated before about somthing that seems to be rather important(i dunno about you, but thats the feeling i got when i saw that pause in the movie) 7)Why doesnt DD just go talk to "Grandma Death" and get her opinion on whats going on and her help as well? 8)if frank was real and the whole thoery of time travel is real then why cant DD's little sister see him..and why cant we see him in certain frames while they are in the theatre? ( i know hes supposed to be an imaginary friend but he was real at one time so i am confused)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Done!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, an independent film based on the tragic details of fictional character Donnie Darko's life, mixed with the elements of God's role in life and death, and a book on the Philosophy of Time Travel. The movie, co-produced and starring Drew Barrymore, shows that she has talent that exceeds a "Home Fries" level. Jake Gyllenhaal's character draws you in, and makes you feel how it feels to be in his shoes, have his problems. The sisters and parents are realistic, yet comical (much like many of our own families). The supporting characters lend help in the dark humor and sad drama that surrounds Donnie's life. All these characters are shadowed by one giant bunny-rabbit, who identifies the end of the world. Very well executed film, with many qualities, star cast, great acting, and twist ending. It is a cult classic among my friends and I and everyone I know who has seen it loved it. "Everyone dies alone" -DD</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Art House? Must be seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. What a fantastic piece of work! After 40 plus years it seems to me that US film makers have finally woken up to what French and Italian film makers have been doing for decades. This is the first time I can remember ever seeing a proper American made art-house movie with a reasonable budget. The cinematography is fantastic and the plot remains a roller-coaster even on the second viewing.Many comments have been made about the plot so I won't bother here but setting the film in the late eighties was inspirational. The sound track complements the action and the characters emotions perfectly. Maybe this is just because I am a child of when it was set?I also loved the juxtaposition of the politics of the film to today. The film shows the Democrat school teacher demanding censorship whilst the parents oppose it. Today it is George W. Bush and his Republican administration who advocate censorship and seek to reduce the constitutional rights of the American people to read and believe what they will.This film is a true masterpiece and hits you hard and leaves you reeling on many different levels. Congratulations to the makers. I believe this may be the first true piece of art to emerge from California in the 21st century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Has anyone of you able to unsderstand this film (correctly) without consulting the net, heard the commentary and READ the Philosophy of time travel?!I'm getting the impression the POTT is needed to understand what happened and if that's the case, then I think it's a major flaw. A film should be self contained, not in installments. Were you given the POTT pamphlet when you bought your tickets in the movie house?Why am I the only one troubled by this? :)I really liked the movie but I have to admit, I was stupified. I loved mulholland drive too and I got it almost immediately (though I had multiple theories).we can explain what happened in Mulholland drive in 1 or 2 sentences.... not a friggin' pamphlet.So there....and PLEASE try to explain this to me:What's God's (divine intervention) intention for creating this tangent universe for Donnie? To show him what could've been if he lived or what effects he had on other people's lives?How can this be the case when everyone in his world is freakin' manipulated living? they are not fully themselves the whole time they are in the tangent universe. Heck, I doubt if Gretchen would even give Darko a minute of her time if she weren't manipulated living/or dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Kelly has created one of the finest films I have ever seen. It is wonderfully and skillfully directed and features some of the most amazing acting of recent memory. After "Lovely and Amazing" and this I will bet on Jake Gyllenthaal to be around for a very long time. What a natural and fascinating performance. I am just blown away, and almost breathless after just watching this movie. Haunting, beautiful, smart, funny, and edgy are all words that describe this masterpiece that is now on my favorite movie list right next to "Fight Club," "Mean Streets," "Chungking Express" and "Rushmore." I can't wait to see Richard Kelly's next movie. Hats off to the beautiful and talented Drew Barrymore for producing and acting in this rare and surreal gem. Drew Barrymore is the coolest and most creatively intuitive producer in Hollywood and as a low budget movie maker myself, I find her to be one of Hollywood's saving graces. "Donnie Darko" is brilliant and a must for anyone who appreciates artistic and cerebral films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>exitentialist teen satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is the weirdest movie I've seen in a long time. And I mean that as a compliment. Through the first half of the film, the film switches gears back and forth between being a teenage American Beauty-style High School satire - and being a psychological drama that asks the question "what if Kurt Vonnegut re-wrote the classic film/play Harvey (Jimmy Stewart, 1950)? Ultimately, these 2 sensibilities become further intertwined throughout the running time, crashing together in the cataclysm of the end of the story.Title character Donnie Darko is a horny teenage boy, roughly 17 years old. He has an "intimidating" IQ and appropriately, "emotional problems". Medicated and troubled, one late night, Donnie is drawn sleepwalking onto a golf course green by a mysterious voice and is confronted by Frank, a very scary 6-foot tall Rabbit (suit). Frank tells Donnie that the world will end, and at exactly what moment: in 28 days. . . . etc. Slowly, as this date and time approach, Donnie's tolerance for the hypocracy of polite society dissolves into open hostility for authority, mostly towards his Catholic High School. Appropriately, this dissolution is parallel to that of his apparent sanity, as his visions of Frank become more frequent and vivid, and it begins to appear that Donnie is being controlled by forces beyond him - or perhaps it's the onset of Paranoid Schizophrenia. The satire of this film lies largely in its setting of October, 1988. As such, there are well-written (and well-cast) references to Smurfs, Michael Dukakis, Patrick Swayze, Self-Help videos, Books Banned by the PTA, and Star Search. As well, there are scenes are dramatically scored with the songs of Tears For Fears, Echo and the Bunnymen (heh) and Duran Duran. While this could easily come off as a fetish - a nostalgic hook alone - these elements don't seem tacked-on or parody. This is the "American Beauty" part of Donnie Darko; a social satire of a specific time, age and personal crisis against authority. But that's the sugar to help the surreal and dark Psycho-drama go down. What this movie is really about is up to a lot of interpretation - but such would have to include: faith in God, Time Travel, Reality vs.Sanity, Self-Belief, Fear of Death, and the Apocalypse. Add to that a healthy dose of Religious Parable, and it's one strange, curious trip. Donnie Darko is not a film for people who like their movies to make concrete sense - concluding with a neat red bow on top. There is a lot to interpret, think and argue about here (mostly in the last 15 minutes). The ending is dramatic and undefined, and finally, filled with an sense of kindness, sympathy and resolution. The movie is by no means perfect: There are questionable acting/casting choices (Barrymore), and it can easily argued that the story never really ties up its loose ends. There's a latin phrase used in writing (and this film) - "Deus ex Machina": "God of the Machine". It has come to define what a writer will do when the story seems to have painted itself into a corner; let an "Act of God" sort it all out in the end. There's a bit of that in Donnie Darko. However, sharp writing, elegant and stylized visuals, and solid acting hold all of this together in an effective and intriguing way, helping the audience enjoy the ride while Donnie swirls round and round the drain - only to find that what's on the other side may not be so scary after all. [If you rent the DVD and really like the film, I highly recommend watching the 20 Deleted Scenes. Some are short inconsequential trims, but there are many that change and add imporant elements to the story. Especially if you're a fan of Watership Down.]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So good I'm running out of superlatives.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's right. This has gotta be one of my favourite films, ever, and I've only seen it once. It is by far the most original, most interesting, most intruiging, and in some aspects the best film of the year. See what I mean about running out of superlatives?The plot is pretty basic - Donnie Darko, a scizophrenic teenager, is told by his imaginary friend Frank, who happens to be a giant mutated bunny rabbit that the world will end in 28 days. A lot of stuff happens along the way, but I won't spoil for the people who haven't seen it yet.When you think that this was the director/writer, Richard Kelly's first film (other than his grad film that he made in college), its quite scary to think that he has created a masterpiece, and undoubtedly, a cult classic for the masses. The script is witty and inventive (the 'What's a f**kass?' scene comes to mind), and the direction is simply breathtaking.A must see for anyone - I give it 10 out of 10.By the way - If anyone says this a teen movie, that's only because it's about a teenager - take no notice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intriguing journey into a schizophrenic teenagers soul - but all is not as it seems.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neatly bookended between two superb songs: the (punning) Bunneymen's "The Cutter" and a poignant slow version of "Mad World", is a thoroughly involving and intriguing story. Some of my favourite films create their own world and their own rules without resort to unbelievable fantasy - by careful use of ambiguity and the direct perspective of Donnie himself, as he witnesses strange happenings around him, this film skillfully treads such a line with some flair. Donnie is increasingly fascinated yet amused by his visions and feels the need to test the powers that the giant rabbit demonstrates. It's easy to imagine many teenagers doing the same in the face of supposedly real hallucinations. We are not sure if Donnies visions are real or hallucinatory until he is watching Romero's Living Dead / Scorsese's Last Temptation - (the director paying homage to the latter's ambiguity between vision and reality) - and suddenly Frank reveals himself. From this point on, the story falls into place in a way so brilliantly managed and paced that only in the penultimate scene is everything "explained". Yet, a visit to the IRC pages below, will show that many threads remain loosely tied - and this is one of the films greatest characteristics - the ability to keep you thinking days, even weeks afterwards, trying to get it all sorted out. Be warned that there are three or four ambiguities that stories of time travel always throw up. A fault of the film for many and for me to a lesser degree, was the need to visit the website to get some of the extra angles and plotlines. As such, a directors cut would be very welcome and there would be no need to sacrifice any of the films endearing sense of mystery. One last personal commendation: this is the first DVD that I wanted to "lose" from the local hire store (its only just finished screening in the UK and didn't have a cinema life in Spain where I live). This film was only beaten into second place in the BBC poll of films of the year by Lord of the Rings - 'nough said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of the discussion of "Donnie Darko" has made reference to "Harvey" because of the giant talking rabbit. People are right to think of Jimmy Stewart, but they've got the wrong movie. "Donnie Darko" is more of an inversion of "It's a Wonderful Life.""Donnie Darko," after all, is ultimately the story of a young man who finds out how others would have been affected if he HAD lived. People lose their teaching jobs, others lose their lives. Donnie sees all the pain connected to his actions and ultimately decides to prevent it by returning to the beginning and accepting death â?' which, though passive, is a conscious act of suicide.But we learn something from Donnie's passing that continues the "Wonderful Life" inversion. Donnie's presence, unlike Jimmy Stewart's, is not the critical link in the happiness of those around him. In the closing montage, we see that many of his associates are living with pain â?' albeit a different type than they had while Donnie was around. Yes, he had an affect on those around him, but it many cases it was negligible.There's stuff in here about predestination, too, and a hodgepodge of other topics. You look at the TV commercials for the movie (available on the DVD) and you realize the marketers (Dark. Darkest. Darko) had absolutely no idea how to sell such an unpredictable and thought-provoking film. "Donnie Darko" is not perfect â?' the ending is a little confusing â?' but it's original enough to merit a spot on your DVD shelf, and reason enough to watch for Richard Kelly's future movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie tells the ancient story about self-sacrifice, put into a new jacket. The makers have succeeded well in the interweaving of the storyline in a otherwise out-of-sync story. This makes that only if you keep track of the apparent non-intertwained storyline will make you understand the real clue. The funny thing is that the storyline is told in such a matter that if you keep track of it you're at about the same level of understanding as Donnie is, throughout the movie, resulting in an understanding of why he decides to take the actions the way he does.I expected very little of this movie, and was reluctant to rent it.After i saw it, i bought it, and added it to my cult collection, not the best i have by far, but to good not to have.Zion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mad World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like your films to serve you up a neat, conventionally structured tale from start to finish, with no loose ends, and all questions answered, then `Donnie Darko' is not a film for you. It is an intriguing film. At times it is very touching and tender but then the film will switch and become dark and violent. It is hard to know what will happen next in `Donnie Darko'. Extremes are cleverly intertwined; suburbia, adolescence, friendship, young love, school and family life are contrasted with violence, hypocrisy, mental anguish and confusion. But are they contrasts or do they exist in unison? The layers of our ordinary everyday lives are peeled back to reveal that things are not always as they seem. The film covers many topics but searching for reasons for events in our lives and determining the true extent of our ability to affect those events, is perhaps the most significant. As such, the film could be compared to `Twelve Monkeys' and `Memento' but also films like `Magnolia' and `Shortcuts' which highlight the way all our lives are connected. `Donnie Darko' examines what lies beneath the surface of conformity and suburbia almost, but not quite, as well as David Lynch's `Blue Velvet'.The acting is better than average, the cinematography and soundtrack are both atmospheric and subtle. I found it very hard to keep from humming `Mad World' for days afterward! `Donnie Darko' is funny and sad, clever and mysterious. Like the track `Slipping Away' from the movies soundtrack, it is both tender and disturbing. Not always an easy to follow film and certainly not a perfect film, I found it nonetheless enjoyable, haunting and perplexing. The viewer should sit back, enjoy the ride and draw your own conclusions!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love it or hate it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People seem to either love it or hate it-like Moulin Rouge, American Beauty, Blue Velvet-but there's no denying it's cult power. The film is a convoluted mix of pop culture, philosophy, science fiction, rebellion, and comic books. I'm not sure how I feel about it but I know Roger Kelly has talent and an effective technique that also shows some skill; by contrast compare with Roger Avary's sloppy The Rules of Attraction. He managed to coax fine performances from a cast you wouldn't normally take seriously (Noah Wylie, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore, Katherine Ross) and get interest generated in Jake Gyllenhaal. He's a sexy nerd who could be Toby MacGuire's darker, more complex brother. Mary McDonnell acheives small miracles as Rose and Holmes Osborne does well with Eddie. There's really not a bad performance here. While the film does confuse, I think the key can be heard in the DVD commentary: Mr. Kelly confesses the ending was clear in his mind but allows the viewer to come up with their own answer. It's a tricky thing to accomplish well and while The Fight Club throws its twist from left field-an idea Chuck Palahniuk thought of halfway through writing it-that film was just stylishly satiric pulp. Here, the warnings, messages, and wormholes build toward the inevitable yet it bogs itself down; it finales with the American Beauty montage and a haunting Gary Jules song. Kudos for Drew Barrymore for seeing something here and being instrumental in getting it made. Another round of applause for Patrick Swayze taking a risk and playing a slick-but-shallow guru. And another for Richard Kelly being brave enough to follow through with his vision. Though it's flawed, there's enough here to satisfy a movielover and make one curious in this new filmmaker.</fullReview>

Its very confussing throughout and appears to be going nowhere, however, in the end it all comes together in the way that 'Unbreakable' does and you realise how clever the movie actually is. Make sure you go watch it a second time and you'll be able to see all the blatent giveaways to what is going to happen at the end. But, i won't tell you what happens.

This film would've been much better by making a few changes ie. Erasing Duran Duran audio playback in live film action, hyper filmaphotography (This isn't suppose to be like snatch), and of course getting rid of all the nonsensicle scenes that have no effect on the plot course or whatsoever. 8/10 Thumbs up for a look-see.

		<shortDescription>complete failure...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMDB readers beware!!! This movie gathers a lot of unfavorable reviews, despite the number of favorable ones; psychologically, people are more willing to vote for something they like, then against something they don't. The amount of reviews in favor of this movie does not deny that fact that a large number of people find it a waste of time.Attempts at neat tricks do not make a good movie. I am bewildered at the number of favorable reviews of this movie. Thirty minutes into it, I was asking myself, "Is this all there is?" Let's face it, the perfomances were bad... no other word applies. Mary McDonald did admirably, but everyone else failed miserably.The non-existent plot bores the viewer. The dialogue (script) fails to grasp the viewer's attention. Despite many differing opinions, the soundtrack is weak and nostalgic for an era that doesn't deserve to be remembered fondly.I realize that many people seem to like this film, but then again a lot of people like Brittany Spears, NSYNC, etc.A movie should be able to hold the viewer's interest. This movie does not. It is a failure on many fronts. Without trying to be offensive people, come on... Terry Gilliam's "Brazil" is a great movie. "Fantastic Planet" is a great movie. "Brotherhood of the Wolf" is a fun movie. "Johnny Got His Gun" is a thoughtful, insightful movie. Donnie Darko is a complete failure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based upon the popularity of some other movies on this website (Crossroads, 8 Mile, anything with Adam Sandler...), I can understand why so many people might like this movie: doesn't actually require a load of intellect, does it? Okay, here we go: The actors are all trying too hard to pass themselves off as "cool," and obviously feel that they are "breaking new ground" (not too mention director Richard Kelly!). They aren't. 'nuff said. The storyline-- although a feable attempt at innovativeness-- is unable to live up to its attempt, and suffers miserably for it. The soundtrack: I have every release by the Joy Division; I like Echo &amp; company... But Duran Duran...? What were they thinking? And Tears for Fears? If ever there was a band that needed a little Orwellian "truth and history management" to erase their existence from the face of the earth, it was TfF! James Duvall was awesome in the Nowhere-Doom Generation series. Too bad the one good actor in this movie gets so little screen time( or should I say "face time?"). Perhaps the popularity of this movie (at least on this website) is based on a large number of unsophisticated teenagers with a lot of freetime on their hands who have nothing better to do than promote garbage like this on the internet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a comparison to "Jacob's Ladder?" Are you kidding...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really! A recent reviewer compared this film to Jacob's Ladder (a very good movie). That person went on to use the words "subtle" and "credible" in their review. You've got to be kidding! The best part about this movie is when the ending credits begin to roll! I have never sat thru 2 hours of more unappealing crap than this! How can so many people be saying good things about this movie?This movie is comparable to Titanic in its vainness,Jurassic park 2 in its stupidity, the performances of Pearl Harbor... Need I go on? I see a bunch of references to David Lynch. Hello? Anybody out there? What is comparable to Lynch? Because the movie makes abrupt scene-changes? The only other person with any sense here is the person guy from Holland who said it's "overhyped." (And boy did he hit the nail on the head!) I unfortunately see the word "masterpiece" being used to describe this movie. What's your standard of comparison? Tupac Shakur? Ed Wood (the man, not the movie)? Any movie shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000?I hate to sound self-righteous (or like a Republican), but honestly, are you hopped-up on caffeine and the latest freshman-101 lecture when you watched/reviewed this movie?a) The primary actors give abysmal performances.b) There is nothing "eerie" about this film, despite frequent remarks to the contrary. It is boring. c) The "bad guys" (school thugs) just HAPPEN to show up at the right place at the right(?) time??? d) un-sympathetic, unbelievable characters (and without characters an audience can relate to, how successful can a movie be-- unless you're freaked out on drugs and "...watchin' it for the experience, dude." e) a SELF-imposed comparison to Hitchcock? Stephen King once compared himself to Chaucer, too... Hah! f) Is Richard Kelly hoping his bulls**t camera work and editing will "baffle' us into ifnoring the sorry ending to this piece of trash?I do object to the frequent references to those of us who "don't get it" as being somehow intellectually inferior. Have you ever considered it the other way around?To quote another viewer (6NOV02): "A stupid movie is simply that: a stupid movie." Finally: my recommendations of thought-provoking films: Fallen Angels, Begotten, Un Chien Andalou,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth much time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie did not return on the cost of its rental fee. It doesn't have a good enough story to compel someone watching it to be interested. I can't say that I am stupid: I am majoring in English Literature, which is a second language to me. I approach this from a literary view. I am used to deconstructing a work to bring its most illuminating and sublime aspects to light. I can't see any redeeming qualities of this movie. Mostly, it is boring. I have seen many American movies, and like most of them. Most American movies involve lots of explosions and intrigue. This movie doesn't rely on that, but doesn't have much to offer in any other ways either. I like movies like The English Patient which had a suspenseful love theme, The Name of the Rose which was very mysterious, The Brotherhood of the Wolf which was very Asian-oriented, and Memento, which made someone watching it really use their mind. Donnie Darko isn't confusing, or intrigueful, or stimulating. It is just dull.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great film. After seeing it for the first time I spent about 3 hours surfing the reviews and the fun sites. I had not visited the official site before seeing the movie, so that was where I first went. It answered most of my questions but created more. I suggest to anyone that might suffer from Darkitis to do the same.I particularly enjoyed the films reference to ancient Greek Drama, which is the mother of all spectacles. In the scene where Donnie is being held down at knife-point, he uttered the phrase "deux ex machina". I think such a twisting plot could only be resolved artificially.I hope there will be more work of that level from Richard Kelly once he goes into bigger budgets. He could even do a sequel on one of the so many subplots that are in this movie. Maybe he tried to include too many stuff in it though, thus, causing confusion rather than interest to the viewer.Regards</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. It's been over a month since I first saw "Donnie Darko," and I still haven't forgotten about it. That's how good this film is. It grabs hold of you and doesn't let go."Donnie Darko," much like "Memento" and "Mulholland Drive," is one of those rare films that has different interpretations from different viewpoints - everybody has their own idea as to what this film is all about. Whether it be love, hate life, death, religion, etc. - it doesn't really matter. Apparently, director Richard Kelly took all of the aforementioned elements, mixed them together, and the end result was one of the best films of the past five years.The main storyline of the film is simple. Donnie Darko, a high-school student from your average suburb in October 1988, has reoccuring visions of a six-foot-tall rabbit named Frank, who warns Donnie that the world will end on Halloween. That's the easy part. Now, you have to decipher what's really happening. Don't worry if you can't do that - Kelly unleashes lots of symbolism throughout the duration of the film that can be interpreted in many different ways (although most of the time, it's just downright silly)."Donnie Darko" is also amazing to watch. Kelly pulls out the numerous tricks up his sleeve. Fast-and-slow-motion, sideways camera views, and other special effects make this film even better. Plus, the eighties-themed soundtrack is awesome. As for the acting itself, the performances are better than average (especially from Mary McDonnell, the Gyllenhaal siblings, and even Patrick Swayze).It's worth every minute.****/**** (Four out of four stars)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a Theory [SPOILERS]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to review this because there are enough outlines of what happens on this page already, but I do have a theory about this movie.My eventual interpretation of the movie was that Donnie had actually gone mad and the movie was one example of his reliving of the same month, which in his mind he was doing over and over again. The therapist explaining that Donnie was in danger of completely slipping away backs this up. Likewise, as pointed out in another review here, everything is perfect for Donnie, a fantasised reality. I believe Frank running over Joanie and Donnie shooting Frank is what triggered off his descent and he cannot live with the guilt so he has, in effect, killed off his true self and lives within his mind, reliving the events that led up to the death of Joanie and Frank.It's just a theory, and ya gotta love movies that make you come up with theories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will admit that it took me watching this three times before I got all the symbolism, contrasts between characters, and music. &gt; This movie had no budget at all, and Richard Kelley managed, (because of a disgustingly good script)to secure alot of top billed actors. For a large audience to understand this movie would be impossible, because the American public would NEVER be able to understand all of the stuff going on in this movie. The effects were great, the soundtrack was awsome, (if you grew up in the 80's you would definately like the soundtrack.)Unfortunately, Richard Kelley put this into a world that likes to go to the movies, and not have to actually "think" about what they are seeing. I loved this movie so much that I bought it. I don't like crap movies. THIS, does not deserve bad reviews. See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film of 2002 (and 2001 for that matter)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film really knocked me out - I was hoping it would be good after the favourable reviews it received but I wasnt expecting anything THIS good! The film was one of those rare treats that actually challenges the audience to think about what they are watching and provide their own interpretation. This is why it was a turn off to so many people - much of recent cinema spoon feeds the audience with images, sounds and ideas that mean they can leave their brains at the cinema door. As many people have delved into the intricacies of the plot already, I wont bore those who are familiar with it. The film boldly tackles the issues of the existence of a parallel universe, the existence of God, and time travel, and yet retains a very human element to it. We care what happens to the characters because they are interesting, well observed and developed. Jake Gyllenhaal is mesmerising as Donnie and the supporting cast - including a sleazy Patrick Swayze and a fiery Drew Barrymore - are wonderful too. The direction is original and the subject matter deeply profound. The soundtrack is awesome and the penultimate scene has one of the most haunting songs Ive heard in a long time played over one long camera shot pondering the quiet moments of the main characters. Ignore the morons that say its about a dysfunctional teenager who sees an imaginary giant rabbit - scratch the surface and you will find something far more complex and rewarding than any description someone can give you. All in all, it is a classic movie that will no doubt gather more attention and a growing fanbase in the years to come. Go see it, NOW! 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my take on one of the best movies of the past few years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Full of Spoilers!!!! First of all, forgive me if someone has already said this, or if I'm just completely wrong, but I thought I'd get my thoughts on the movie down before I forget them. Donnie Darko is Jesus. His purpose in the film was to punish the sinners and give everyone else a second chance. We see towards the end how Frank is rubbing his eye, and Swayze is crying as if they know their crimes even though (since we've gone back in time) they don't know they've committed them yet. Donnie is punishing these people by making them relive their lives before the truths came out. He also gives characters like Drew Barrymore and the Chinese Girl second chances. You'll recall Donnie grabbing her by the ear-muffs and telling her that someday things will be better. He himself makes things better by sacrificing himself for everyone else, like Jesus. The orbs that emerge from his body serve as his chosen destiny, as described in the film, and Donnie himself says that they don't allow him to choose, its all part of God's plan. Donnie follows God's plan even though he realizes that this plan leads him to death. Frank isn't God, but the devil. Frank, like Swayze, like the Sparkle Motion girls all serve as temptation and are everything that is wrong with the world. Donnie wants to reveal these characters as evil and the only way to do so is to die. Consider how when Donnie goes to see Evil Dead, the other movie that is playing is the Last Temptation of Christ. this is no coincidence.. and I believe that the two movies are very related if not one being a remake of the other. The director of Donnie Darko took great care to make everything reminiscent of 1988, not just with the relationship of Scorsese's movie, but also with Back to the Future, scenes reminiscent of E.T. (not to mention an actor being in both movies), the snorting of cocaine in high school, Tears for Fears soundtrack, the bush-dukakis debate, etc etc. Is it possible that seeing The Last Temptation of Christ, and consider the character types that bridge pairs of movies, that we can begin to understand what the old woman represents, why she waits for the letter that perhaps Doc from Back to the Future received that ultimately saved his life, and many other strange, perhaps coincidental, and not entirely one-sided arguments that the movie presents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Something I found to be a very strong theme in the movie, but not touched on by reviewers (apologies if someone within the previous 450 odd reviewers has actually mentioned this and I've missed it), is the fragility of human relationships... The love lost through death (Donnie and Jena) / the love never met (again Donnie and Jena) / the relationship destroyed by devotion (at a pinch... Donnie and teacher sacked essentially for a perceived link to Donnie's vandalism) / the friend turned foe (Donnie and Frank). There's more, but all culminate nicely in the final scene with the tentatively knowing wave between two strangers who were perhaps destined to be close but for a twist of fate (Jena and Mrs Darko). and then the same eerie wave between the small child and the viewer, that serves to affirm the universality of relationship randomness and fragility. A very tasty film.</fullReview>

The ending is unexpected just like the rest of the film. I believe the main emphasis is on fate - Donnie cannot change what is going to happen / but makes the most of it.

		<fullReview>Consider this....(If you have seen it, Dont read otherwise) I feel that Donnie died on that night, the first time. THEN, he dreamt his 'perfect month' so to speak. I also feel that Frank is God. Frank showed Donnie the result (Death of his Mom Sister and Girl) of his perfect dream, therefore Justifying Donnie's death to himself. Frank Allowed the 'time travel' to occur for this justification. Kind of like the cigarette you get to smoke before you are executed by firing line. Furthermore, this movie was about resolving the conflict in his life to give him peace for his eternal existence. For example, when in his bedroom and asking his Mother (paraphrase) 'What is it like to have a nut for a son?' she replies...'wonderful.' That is how he would have dreamed his relationship was with his Mother. Other things considered in the 'perfect month' for a 16-yr. Old:-He tempts fate by escaping a jet engine that 'mysteriously' falls into his bedroom. His death, or near death as he saw it, was shrouded in mystery.-He vandalizes his school, stumps the police, and gets out of school for the day to interact with his new dream girl-He gets laid by his new dream girl. The same girl chooses him, by sitting near him in class. (Do we really think a teacher would make that request of the 'new student'?)-He tells his gym teacher to piss-off and subsequently meeting with the school Principal and parents reveals that his high school test scores were 'Intimidating'. (Do we really think Donnie was genius?)-He later finds the wallet of the annoying (to him) local self-help author and burns down his house revealing a child porn ring.Only in his wildest dreams!Additionally, he attempts to resolve his conflicted relationship with the 'fat girl' who likely 'went with' him during the time leading to his death. He really hurt her by 'going with' the much more desirable dream girl.He is happy to die in the end, because he dreamt of how cool it could have been to die. How many troubled teens fantasize about death?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Through the past, darkly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most satisfying moments in Richard Kelly's assured debut is the film's opening sequence, which is so well handled that this viewer left behind any apprehension about how a 26-year-old director would handle what turns out to be a remarkable first film. 16-year-old Donnie is a more than curious character. On the one hand assured and charming, he also suffers from emotional problems and regularly sees a psychiatrist. Fortunately, however, our hero is sleeping on a golf course at the moment a rogue airline engine plummets through his bedroom ceiling. Yet Donnie's absence is not the result of simple good fortune: he has taken to wandering the town at night, acting at the behest of Frank, an imaginary friend dressed in a nightmarish bunny suit. Not content with saving the boy's life, Frank manipulates Donnie into flooding his own school and torching the home of a creepy motivation guru (Patrick Swayze), all the while reminding him that the world will end on October 30, 1988. Inconveniently, Donnie has recently begun a relationship with the new girl in town, who arrives with a fake identity after her step-father tries to kill her mother.Even as his world seems to unravel about him, Donnie starts to close in on the reality that underlies his experiences. Though he can't make his family or psychiatrist understand, he is in fact sufficiently in charge of his environment to be able to manipulate space and time in the film's final act, changing the future for someone he cares about deeply.All of which is fine, and handled in a suspenseful, gripping manner that keeps you fully engaged. However, it remains to be shown that Kelly's contorted story is ultimately explicable. Can this viewer make perfect sense of the outcome if enough intellectual effort is applied? Or are we being suckered into thinking too deeply about a tale that doesn't necessarily make sense?Curiously, Kelly flashes up an Alfred Hitchcock quote before the opening credits, in which the great man exhorts fellow film-makers never to confuse an audience ("if they're confused, they aren't emoting"), but then sets out to prove that he can both confound and entertain his viewers, and even produce poignancy with his film's final moments. But if he ever wants to rival the master of suspense, Kelly will have to make good on his promise, and show us something solid yet extraordinary beneath his own surreal bunny suit.  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film to Ponder (and if you want answers read this)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" is destined for cult classic status. Any film which can so boldly confuse an audience and leave such an open ending is bound for this. In these respects it is very similar to "The Usual Suspects" which also had a confusing plot and an ending so full of holes it resembled a cheese grater. But the great thing about this is that the film remains with you for several days later and keeps you thinking, which is surely what film making is essentially about, or should be anyway.The film spans several genres (teen movie, sci fi, horror) and while many films would fail to hold it all together first time writer-director, Richard Kelly, succeeds admirably. However, Kelly has sense enough not to ruin the film by providing the audience with a perfectly packaged ending with everything nicely tied up. This film is supposed to make you think and is supposed to be open to interpretation - I bet even Kelly hasn't got a concrete idea of what is going on.**SPOILERS**My take on the ending is thus:The Frank character is part of Donnie's imagination but subconsciously is based on a real life person he knows - the James Duval character. Donnie has the ability to see into the future the same way the crazy old lady can - when we see her looking in her mail box she is looking for the letter Donnie will send to her later in the film.When they are in the cinema and Frank takes his rabbit mask off he has lost an eye, at the time we are led to believe this is because Donnie stabbed him while looking in the mirror but it is because in the future Donnie will shoot him in the eye.The reason Donnie suddenly finds himself asleep in his bedroom at the end of the film is that he has used a wormhole to travel back in time to the moment the jet engine landed on the house. At the start Donnie leaves the house at night and sleeps in the hills and on the golf course. Ultimately this saves his life when the jet engine falls on the house - his family say if he had been there he'd be dead. Donnie subconsciously foresaw the future and told himself (through Frank) to leave the house that night.The jet engine fell through a wormhole in the future, the same plane we see Donnie's mother and sister on at the end which is about to crash. The whole idea is that we live in a parallel universe - while the Darko family are asleep in the house in one dimension in the past, they are also on the crashing plane in the future. The same way that as I am writing this article now I am also sitting on the toilet two weeks ago, riding my bike ten years ago, sitting at school 20 years ago, sitting on my potty 24 years ago and doing something else 10 years from now in the future. Get it? No. You see Donnie realises he should have died when the jet engine fell on the house; the fact that he didn't has had a huge effect on the future i.e. the Patrick Swayze character gets arrested, thus the teacher can't take the girls on the trip and Donnie's mother has to and she ends up dying in the plane crash. In order to prevent his mother and sister's deaths Donnie travels back in time to sacrifice himself. When Frank (Donnie's own subconscious) says the world is going to end he means for Donnie, Donnie's world will end because his mother and sister will die. That is why he's smiling at the end, even though he knows he is going to die, because he will be saving the lives of his mother and sister. Yes it's that simple.</fullReview>

Well, yes, it breathes some fresh air into the fantasy reality premise.But, when it came to the all-important climax, I felt that Kelly's sure touch failed completely. I simply didn't understand the ending. After Donnie sees the skies turning wormy over his home town and Mary McDonnell feels the bump in her airplane ride, I lost the plot.Why was Donnie still in bad when the engine hit his house? Why was he smiling? What, in fact, was happening?The fact is, I don't know.Frankly, I rather suspect Kelly pulled a fast one, hoped we were so bound up in the extraordinary images and stories, we would fail to grasp this gaping hole at the centre of his film.It almost worked, but ten minutes from the end, I thought I was watching a great movie. As the credits rolled, I wanted my money back.Did I miss something?Was 'Donnie Darko' just a shaggy dog (or rabbit) story?I want the facts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film goes for almost 2 hours, and towards the end I began caring less and less about what strange stuff was going to happen next. But I'm glad I saw the movie...mostly.Lots of strange things do happen in this film, and for anyone tired of main-stream "normal" American movie stories, Donnie Darko should satisfy. I enjoyed the surreal atmosphere, and mysterious path the story followed, although sometimes it would lose focus a bit, with an odd scene here or there that seemed to work against the flow. Apart from a few nice visuals, there isn't a lot to say about the cinematography either. So important to a movie like this, but very reserved, static and "safe" was my perception of this film's visual style.I suppose that somewhere along the path, the movie lost its creative and mysterious charm. At least it does have some charm though, it just wavers. And I think I like to be challenged more by movies rather than have everything handed to me on a plate. That said, it does offer enough to keep you thinking about and discussing (and criticizing) afterwards.One last thing. I agree with my friend who said she's seen that rich upper-class American leafy suburban street in movies one too many times. Does everyone over there live on streets like this?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the fact that its been on video for nearly 6 months now, a tiny movie house in the East Village in NYC continues to show Donnie Darko at midnight each Saturday a'la Rocky Horror. This makes perfect sense. Donnie Darko has acquired a cult following among hipsters everywhere who vibe off of the numerous late 80's pop culture references and bizarre, Blue Velvet Lynch era storyline.If your Thursday nights consist of hanging out in Alphabet City pulling on a Bass Ale with a pack of Camel Lights while Joy Division blares from the nearest jukebox, this is your type of film. Everybody else, beware. Did I mention what a fantastic movie this was?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film did my head in!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is the name of the teenage hero of the film. One night, a jet engine falls from the sky and lands through the roof of the Darkos' home ?no one knows where from and Donnie encounters a rabbit-headed figure, Frank who informs him that the world is coming to an end in twenty eight days.Days pass accompanied by more bizarre events which builds up the audience's anticipation of what will happen when the time runs out. We learn early on in the film that Donnie is taking medication which hints that day to day episodes may be tricks in Donnie's mind. What makes the film stimulating is the fact that you cannot be sure whether events are real or the result of Donnie's state of mind.You get the sense that throughout the film, Donnie is a trapped soul (whether it be in a time warp or a dream I can't decide) where teachers and adults such as the Patrick Swayze guru character want to simplify everything in life into two extremes: fear and love. You also have Drew Barrymore as Donnie's English teacher who invites the new girl of the class to sit next to the boy she finds the cutest. The romance which develops between Donnie and his new classmate is nice and helps to lighten the tone of what has already developed into a pretty dark film. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a likeable performance as the hero and displays good comic timing and laidback personality ?he reminds me of Tobey Maguire in many ways. He is not an actor I am familiar with but he looks to be a promising future star.I went to the cinema seeking a film that would be unpredictable ?what better film to choose than a film where a boy meets a human-sized rabbit and the world is meant to end in less than thirty days. When the 28 days of the story had run out, I was left with no logical explanation to what I had seen. I left the cinema very confused, this film did my head in! </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why soooo complicated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start my rant let me just tell you that I loved Donnie Darko - a truly great film.Let the rant begin....This could have been such a popular movie at the box office - why was'nt it - because it's just soooo complicated.To enjoy a movie you have to understand the plot - for me, any movie is basically trying to tell a story to Joe Public - not a bunch of NASA time travel investigators !!I don't want to have to read umpteen books on time travel &amp; log on to numerous web-sites just to try and understand what the hell a film was all about....OK - there may be a certain groups of people who may like to do this (geeks ;-) ) - but I like to see a great movie, understand what it was all about, then go for a beer &amp; discuss it - not head off to the library and loan books on freekin time travel.I think the movie does tell an interesting story don't get me wrong but.... it fails if 95% of the audience walk out thinking what the hell was all that about !!!Rant over...Cheers, Rich.p.s. If any movie directors want to pay me megabucks to review their films to ensure they do not flop then please get in touch....p.p.s. No Meg Ryan films though - bleugh... ;-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is an amazing film debut for Richard Kelly. I look forward to seeing more of his work. I would recommend that you watch this film three times as soon as you get it. The first time, you'll be shocked. The second time you will begin to appreciate it. The third time it should hit you that this is an instant cult classic. If you have the DVD, be sure to read the Philosophy of Time Travel book, as it will help to iron out the details of the story that you miss. Some people have attacked the movie because of the story. Trust me. If you like movies with complicated, but fulfilling story-lines, Donnie Darko is for you. Contrary to what some have said in their comments, the story is complete and rewarding. The acting is good overall, although some lines aren't delivered well. The principle characters are very convincing. GO SEE THIS MOVIE or it will be your loss! Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cult classic to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantasy, schizophrenia, love, death and with a bit of time travel thrown in for good measure. This movie is unique if nothing else. And yet it is a lot else. I don't think I have ever seen a more thought provoking film in my entire life, and judging by some of the postings neither have many people.You really have to be on your toes for this movie, its very much a case of blink and you'll miss it. However, I didn't blink and I'm still not sure I caught it, the plot is ludicrously complicated and unimaginably contraversial. Parallel universes, tanginet wormholes blah blah etc etc, I could go on forever (and many people have) about the science of this film and the philosophy of time travel, but I don't think thats the point of the film. Its meant to be weird, its meant to be bizarre and most of all its meant to leave you with your jaw hanging open thinking "what the ****"For a film of such a low budget, the cinematography is excellent, the contrast of light and dark working to extremely good affect when helping the audience to decide which time is real and who is already dead. In some parts it is genuinely quite terrifying and has a creepy feeling to it that many modern chillers lack. The hideous bunny costume in the cinema was one of the most realistically chilling scenes I have ever seen, whithout being an unpleasant expirience.Whithout doubt, this is not for everyone. A lot of people will find the lack of and explanitory ending or indeed a clear plot unsatisfactory, but many people like this and I am amongst them as it gives the viewer a lot to think about and discuss afterward. However, I would still advise everyone to see it just to prove how powerfull cinema still is. Its superbly shot, and has some cracking good humor in it which brilliantly sets of the creepiness. Not only that but its got a great soundtrack as well. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be absolutely honest here, I will not pretend that I have completely got the ending of this movie yet, but it hardly matters. When I eventually purchase the DVD (and I will) I will have plenty of time to consider, judge, ascertain, puzzle over, screw my brow and check out exactly what was going on. The IMDB boards for `Donnie Darko' also look fascinating. All I will to say at this juncture is `What a wonderful film'.A fantastic, brilliant piece of filmmaking. David Lynch channelled through John Hughes, and all credit to the person who linked those two gentlemen in my mind in their previous post about `Donnie Darko'. Fabulous. Dazzling ideas aplenty. Marvellous. Puts to shame the drivel that Hollywood foists on us from a great height on a daily basis.How old is Richard Kelly? He is 27 at this writing. Jesus!

		<shortDescription>Not just a simple Sci-Fi flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, this film is a meticulously constructed sci-fi thriller, but given the setting in 1988 at the height of the Cold War, for me it was about the possibility of death falling out of the sky, just as the jet engine falls out of the sky and into the Darko family's life. Just as the "Virgin Suicides" perfectly captured what it feels like to be a 14-year-old boy, I felt this film did a wonderful job of capturing what it felt like to be in high school in the late 80s. To me all of the sci-fi trappings were just a metaphor for the uncertainty of living in this time. The genius of this film, though, is that no one interpretation is definitive--it's vague enough that you can put your own emotions and ideas into it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where would you place Donnie Darko on the Fear-Love spectrum?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Warning Many Useful Spoilers**I honestly don't remember puberty being so emotionally orpsychologically distressing. And it wasn't but Donnie Darko is afilm that effectively uses hyperbole and metaphor to tell a storyabout the coming of age of a suburban teenager. Donnie (Gyllenhaal) is a seemingly disturbed individual withemotional problems ? he sees a therapist and takes medication.One night a menacing voice of an imaginary rabbit commandsDonnie to get out of bed and leave his house. The rabbit tells himthat the world will end in less than a month's time. When hereturns home he finds his room destroyed by a jet engine.Donnie believes the imaginary rabbit ? named frank ? saved hislife and now feels obligated to obey his will. As such the Rabbittells him to commit destructive but imaginative crimes, but thesecrimes have positive consequences. After flooding the school hemeets the love of his life, Gretchen (Malone). The theme of the main plot in this movie is elaborated in theCunningham (Swayze) sub plot. Cunningham is a cheesy self- help spokesperson who preaches that one can only be happy andfulfilled if we overcome our fears and embrace love. This is thedilemma that faces Donnie and it is his true test of maturity.Donnie's emotional problems, which blow-out into paranoidschizophrenia, is simply an exaggeration for the confusing anddifficult emotional hurdles of puberty. Donnie is in denial of thefinal hurdle: the choice of love over fear. In so doing, his fearsswell, which become personified by Frank the evil Rabbit. The story becomes convoluted and circular with the integration oftime-travel. Yes I did say time travel. Donnie becomes convincedthat not only can one travel through time but that one can also seeinto the future. This plot seems completely ridiculous but itbecomes instrumental to understanding the ending and, indeed,the whole movie. Professor Monnitoff (Wyle), Donnie's scienceteacher, makes the point clearly: we do not have a set path ordestiny, rather we are given a choice of many paths to take.Thus, Donnie is given two paths. The first, to be ruled by fear andlet fear destroy everything dear to him. This is the path that isshown by the film. That is, his fear, personified by Frank theRabbit, rules his life and inevitably leads to the death of the twomain loves of his life: his girlfriend and his family. Or he canchoose to die alone in his bedroom by a stray jet engine. ButDonnie is not alone and never was. It is once he realises this thathe comes of age, faces his fears and chooses death. Donnie Darko is magnificent film driven by a strong theme andcomplicated plot. But lets not forget the superb cast. In particular,Gylenhaal, as the emotionally confused and troubled teenager,and Malone, as the depressing and vulnerable love interest, arecompletely convincing. McDonnell after her stint in ER is now firmlyentrenched in the superficially pretentious mother typecast. It iscertainly an impressive supporting cast with Barrymore and Wyleplaying teachers at Donnie's school.Richard Kelly must be considered a writer/director for the futureconsidering this is his debut. It is certainly a slick film withinteresting camera angles and effective editing. What is thegreatest achievement of this skilled director is his ability to createan appropriate brooding mood. The scenes with the rabbit ?particularly the cinema scene ? is eerie and tense. I can't fault this film but it is not for all to see ? an inevitable cultclassic. It is esoteric, complicated and thematically driven. Thecast is and direction is brilliant. A cocktail of ingredients rare toHollywood.All in all 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a confusing adventure. There are a few oversights that become apparent as you watch the film, and even more you will only notice upon hearing the director's commentary track on the DVD. They admit to breaking their own rules for time travel, but I cannot fault them for that. The film is well-crafted and wonderfully directed. The cast is excellent all around, except for Drew Barrymore who is simply not believable as a teacher. Richard Kelly does many interesting things with his film, transporting us back into the late 1980's without dwelling on the time period. You never really think of the time period or the location.

		<fullReview>I'm not sure where to classify this film. It seems to defy all attempts. I initially saw it classified as horror/suspense, but I neither felt myself horrified nor on the edge of my seat. I almost felt some kind of weird kinship with the main character (played brilliantly by Gyllenhaal), and finished the movie in a fairly cheerful mood, which seems completely unexpected to me. I could feel my mind trying to make sense of content and realizing that there really was no point in trying to drag a concrete *thing* out of it. It simply is what it is, and you almost just want to laugh. So, if anything, it might be a dark comedy. But there's drama, too, and a serviceable young romance, and a little bit of action. Plus artful imagery and an almost Memento-like plot, at least in its feel. Not sure I'd recommend this film, but it's not bad, either. If you're into teen angst, 6-ft.-tall invisible rabbits, and a bit of dark comedy, you'll probably like this film.</fullReview>

Donnie Darko probably deserved more than attention in 2001, but I hope more people will see it.The story in short: After a jet engine comes out of nowhere and crashes into his room, Donnie begins hallucinating. He begins to have chats with a creepy, giant rabbit. Severe depression? Psychosis? Is he dreaming? The suburban world in which Donnie lives in is nothing short of the world we have gotten accustomed to - bullies, the lonely overweight girl, the pretty new girl, the self-righteous school teacher who worships some narcissistic self-help guru. I'm not going to give away much more of the story, you have to see it in order to enjoy it. Really surreal and entertaining, the movie makes you wonder if he's going insane or if he's really discovered some "other world".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Up there with the likes of 'Ghost World'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the favourite viewer films from this year's Melbourne International Film Festival, and it's not hard to wonder why. Donnie Darko is in similar territory to the brilliant 'Ghost World', but has the added element of some incredibly twisted and mind warping ideas. Is it Donnie's medication that makes him see a big talking rabbit, or is there the distinct possibly that the imminent doom this talking rabbit expels is indeed true. Is it possible to travel in time?Some truly bizarre scenarios are in store for those who take the challenge and watch this film. Who would have thought that Patrick Swayze could be funny and Drew Barrymore could give a credible performance? Jake Gyllenhall (who's a bit of a Tobey Maguire clone) gives one of those 'once in a lifetime' performances as Donnie. Donnie Darko for me rates up there as one of this year's best films. A beautifully twisted tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much to think about.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a tough movie to describe without giving too many details away. I ended up seeing it based on the recommendation of a friend, who also did not set it up very much, but rather said I should just give it a try. I'm very glad that I did! It's one of the better movies I've seen in a long time.Ostensibly, it's about a kid, Donnie, in his mid-teens, living in a generic 80s suburbia, with some emotional/psychological issues that manifest themselves as the collective guide through this bizarre unfolding of events in the movie.The feel of the whole movie is very surreal and trippy, and yet accessible at the same time. It keeps you wrapping your head around the issues facing poor Donnie, and much like The Sixth Sense, you'll want to go back and watch it again to catch the little things you missed before, do some consistency checking, and wrap your head around the whole thing a little more. It seems like there are key elements left up to the viewer to decide about the details of the outcome, but the more I chewed over it, the more I felt like the conclusions were certain, and I just had to put all of the pieces together as evidence. In that respect, I like it better than The Sixth Sense. The latter has an explanation for everything at the end, but Donnie Darko merely presents a host of information throughout the movie--much of it subtle and low-key, yet important nonetheless--and lets the viewer figure out the details of how it all connects together.What puts this movie over the top for me, however, is that in addition to the twisted, surreal main story line, there is no small amount of social commentary on the sterility of suburbia, and the disenfranchisement of kids in the face of teachers and parents that have in many ways lost more of their sense of reality than Donnie has. There are a host of brainwashed adults and disconnected parents that make you wonder how any of these kids are heading in the right direction; and indeed, many of them are not. Of course, that just adds a dynamic backdrop of characters to the detailed interplay of the story, which serves to make this movie even more wonderful. This is the kind of movie where every action and detail tends to have significance, and the complexity of the characters interwoven into the bizarre plot makes you respect the attention to detail and consistency that much more.When I first saw Donnie Darko, I was intrigued, and yet willing to believe that the setup was a bit haphazard. When I saw it again, I realized just how meticulously the movie had been put together, in every aspect, and it gave me a powerful respect for this film. 9/10 stars from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great movie of questionable design. if you're a theoretical physicist, get bent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, alright. The people complaining are right: the treatment of theoretical physics in this movie is terrible. But who cares. The acting is universally solid, and exceptional in some cases. Patrick Swayze didn't blow me away, as he appeared to for many folks here: he played a slick scumbag for 95% of the movie, then cried with his face hidden in one scene. This shows better role selection, perhaps, but is not conclusive evidence of any great dramatic talent.Richard Kelly's strengths are natural plotting, dialogue, and attention to detail. The use of a very specific date in the 80s would be a cheesy exercise in cashing in for most filmmakers, but here the time and place is captured in a manner comparable to Richard Linklater's Dazed &amp; Confused.*spoilers* What I am not as convinced of is that Kelly coherently understands his own plot. I've seen the film a few times and listened to the commentary track &amp; deleted scenes -- in his commentary he talks a lot about the jet engine needing to be returned from the "parallel universe" in which most of the film unfolds. While I can understand this interpretation, I think ultimately it's a bit lame, and in particular brings up the issues of satisfying relativity that so many other posters have been complaining about. Declaring Donnie a "superhero" with special powers also doesn't do it for me.But Kelly repeatedly encourages his audience to interpret the film individually, so here's my take. A deleted scene involved Frank revealing himself pretty clearly as being an agent of God. I think the events of the film are a private justification -- from God to Donnie -- for why Donnie has to die. It's almost like God wants to prove to Donnie that the world isn't as terrible as he suspects -- despite the fact that Donnie is going to have to give up his life to save others.This interpretation brings up some questions -- is it better that Cunningham's proclivities would remain a secret? Doesn't the agent of God revealing how Donnie's presence in the world is destructive also the one who prompts him to much of that destruction?But I do think it's more satisfying than some of the jet engine nonsense.</fullReview>

I'm so glad I was wrong, Donnie Darko is a brilliantly written and directed masterpiece. In the same way that A.I. left me feeling depressed for days afterward, this left me thinking about what really happened. I can see that this film will take a good few watches before I am anywhere near undertanding it. The sci-fi/fantasy elements combine almost perfectly with the suspense. Watch it, now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a return to thought-producing films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally found out about this film when i was browsing around on the web looking at independant films; then i went to the donnie darko website- which is scary enough. i meant to go see it but things came up- finally 18 months later i finally rented it and was completely blown away. i watched it the next morning again and was still fascinated. of course this is only my opinion and i know some did not like it as much. The reason i thought it was so great was becuase of how amazing the idea was to me. Everything, from the cinematography, the story, the acting, and the soundtrack(amazing) made me think there is still good films being made, because, quite honestly, im sick of people asking me to come with them to see Sweet HOme Alabama! , or XXX.THe 80's motif was done with such precision, i couldnt help to feel like i was back in 88'. The themes of the time were also present, not to metion killer music to boot. This film made me want to find all my old echo and the bunnymen, and "the church" tapes.The whole time travel idea is a bit far fetched, and i read that some people didnt think it was possible the way they explained it, but does it really matter?- This film is FICTICOUS! who cares if its not possible?- And as for the visual effects, i thought they were great. for the budget richard kelly was on, he did an execellent job. it didnt matter that they didnt look the same quality as "star wars", they were good nontheless.THe balance in the story was great as well. i read someone found the film in different sections at different places- it is hard to classify this film- but thats what made it so good. the scenes with "sparkle motion", and the gym teacher were histerical, not to mention when donnie bitched out patrick swayze. Then, they are the scenes where donnie goes out at night when frank tells him to- creepy to say the least. ... i could go on and on- but by this point its enough- just make your own judgement on it after you see it-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I saw a preview for this movie when I rented some horror movie and instantly knew I had to rent it. Donnie Darko is seeing things. Rapidly it seems as though he is losing his mind, yet he remains lucid and clear-headed. Jake Gyllenhaal is an amazing actor. The way he looks at the mirror when he is talking to Frank is bizaar and hypnotic, almost making me want to touch the TV screen. When I rented it, I watched it two more times before I returned it, the clerk at Blockbuster almost had to rip it out of my hand. Everything about this movie is amazing. There is not one thing that I didn't like about it.SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!!!Patrick Swayze as a pedophile, who knew! I almost peed my pants when the news reported a "kiddie-porn dungeon" in Jim Cunningham's secret room! I cried when Donnie is holding Gretchen after she died, looking at that huge black cloud telling her that it's going to be okay. The music, score and soundtrack, is surreal and hearing Joy Division's "Love Will Tear Us Apart" was especially nice. Good movie, good music and good actors......I give this movie a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although "Donnie Darko" is not without flaws, it represents a fresh voice in contemporary filmmaking. The picture is unique, unlike anything I've ever seen before. It is a triumph of atmosphere, acting and casting... especially for Patrick Swayze. Its' slick, elliptical story is the most exhilirating since "Memento" and will have audiences talking for months. I recommend this flick to anyone that is sick of the same old traditional fare that Hollywood relentlessly spills upon us. Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ya I saw the movie, even bought it, and as the cover says it flattened me. Superficially it is quite simple. But with a deep look, it is clearly more than just weird. It explores concepts that not many people have the ability to fully comprehend, including myself. Fate, time travel, predestination, and everything in between. I'm not going to give you a movie summary, because I don't think that's fair. See the movie, take it for yourself, but realize that if you think you get it then you're nothing but a lost little child in a boundless dark forest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I read all the comments posted, I find it hard to imagine that people did not like this film. If nothing else, it makes you think. Too many movies are being released today that just use explosions and nudity to entice an audience. It is rare to find a movie that poses such deep philosophical questions, and, at the same time, does it in a well-written, well-acted manner. The casting is fantastic, and all the actors (particularly Jake Gyllenhaal) do wonderful jobs at getting this sometimes funny, sometimes scary, and always dark story across. The cinematography is very unique and absorbing and the music fits perfectly. The movie is visually interesting, but more importantly leaves you with much to think about and figure out. Definitely a must see if you enjoy movies that engage your brain. "Two Thumbs Up"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 'off' mixture of 80s surburban bliss and strange things...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful first film for Richard Kelly.. I'll admit, I disliked a few elements upon my initial viewing, but fortunately the good far outways the bad in this case.Jake Gyllenhaal really does a number in his role as Donnie, questioning his sanity, whether what he's seeing is real or not, and where this ultimately leads him. He's basically just a normal kid with some strange things happening in his life, which makes it even more compelling. Jena Malone, I really liked her in this role, but then, she's cute and hard not to like. I especially liked her in Life as a House (which I saw before American Beauty, and enjoyed more, though AB was good it certainly couldn't outdue Cider House Rules for the oscar!). I thought she could have been given a tad more to really hit home with her connection between her and Donnie. Donnie's little sister, I felt her part was completely useless and hated her little 'dance group' subplot -one of the elements I wished was replaced with something that'd actually help the story along or was at least entertaining. Donnie's Father, his best moment was cut (you'll see it on the dvd), so he just exists in the film pretty much with a mildly entertaining exchange between him and his wife. The older sister was just there, did a couple things, and that's it. Overall, I'm glad many of the family scenes were cut because they just for the most part got in the way of the more important elements of Donnie's journey.Everything in terms of effects feels appropriate, nothing seems overdone, and many of them even look cool.. the story when it further envelopes Donnie in it's webwork of sci-fi/fantasy/insanity is where the meat of things lie, and some great little moments throughout (can we say Smurfs?).The first time I saw the 'bunny', per say, it looked kind of ridiculas to me, but everytime after it just fit right in (even go so far has creating a slightly spooky vibe in some scenes). Jim Cunningham's plotline works well, Patrick did a great job in the part, and some of the minor subtext he instilled in the part made the role even more. I didn't feel Drew Barrymore's presence was overused, could of put a tad more in the film on her relation with the kids, but time constraints did make a better film. The other characters all seemed to do their parts accordingly, everything seemed in place.The music, ah, one of the best parts of the film, which further creates the 80s nostalgia and brings the haunting moments of the film up to the level they needed, including the Mad Mad World song, which I loved the montage that went with it (I thought this was the most effective part of the film, personally, that and the intro segment).Well shot, some cool little camera tricks and movement throughout. In the end, it's a movie that deserves a second viewing. Despite a couple annoying or offputting subplots, there's just so much to enjoy and be entertained that I can easily forget the minor bad points. Oh, and get the dvd, and read the Time Travel Book (which is from the film), and if you can't see that print, get glasses. You don't need to, but it helps to explain and make better sense of the whole concept, plus it's just a cool quick little read.Other features on the Dvd certainly live up to the price, with several extended/deleted scenes with commentary for each.. as well as 2 commentary tracks (1 with the director and Jake -a good listen, and the second by members of the cast which was clear are only paying attention to the film in at glances and are mostely sitting back and having a good time among friends).. There's also production stills and a music video for Mad Mad World.. and if you get the soundtrack, know this.. the score is worth it, I just wish they'd extended each piece because they sound disected (it helps to listen to them shuffled), but the 80s music is all amiss.. though you do get 2 versions of the wonderful Mad Mad World song..I most definitely recommend this film for anyone wanting something not quite like anything else..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In one week I had six different people suggest this movie to me. When I finally saw it I was unable to think of anything else for days afterward. If a hundred people saw this film, there would be a hundred different interpretations. It wasn't clear cut, they don't give you all the answers, and they confidently assume that you will understand. It was in turns funny, confusing, intuitive, and you can't help but to empathize with the characters, even as Donnie commits acts of 'malicious violence'. Suspension of disbelief is definitely required but, unlike every other movie involving aspects of time travel, this one didn't cause the 'logic centers' of my brain to implode. Jake Gyllenhaal puts out a startling performance, and stands out in a film rife with amazing performances from the entire cast. I loved this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So what was the point?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the movie, some parts twice, went over all the deleted scenes with commentary which filled in a lot of blanks. I figured out the time travel and deus ex machina thing (which was actually set up in a deleted scene).But my final analysis was: so what? The bunny saves him, a bunch of stuff happens, and then he goes back in time to die. All the bad things he exposed or tried to prevent in the middle of the movie will still happen.Some people are saying he sacrificed himself to save the world. I have NO IDEA how you would get that from the events as depicted in the film. Maybe from the director's commentary, which I didn't listen to, or just someone's hopeful interpretation.Anyway, the acting was good, except maybe from the parents who seemed disinterested (I know they were supposed to be, but not that much). The direction was good, pacing was good, mood was very good. Suspense was great, it definitely draws you toward the conclusion. So everything was great until the ending.I enjoyed going back over the movie to piece together the clues, but after all that, I still feel like I missed something. If I have to make up my own ending I might as well make up the whole story too, and save my 5 bucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't understand why so much people like this movie. The storyline is stupid, confusing, uninteresting, uninspiring. The acting isn't interesting, even the music isn't matching with the period they showed, not that it isn't possible that people in 1987 listened to early 80's music/end 70's music, but with all the dates i think it's pretending to be music of that period. The spooky rabbit is the stupiest thing i've ever seen in a Horrormovie, i presume that rabbit is a joke, otherwise it would be really stupid. The end is stupid and too easy as well, i think there isn't thought about how to make this movie. The only exciting parts are the good songs from Echo and the Bunnymen and Joy Division, as well as when two of the main persons are in the cinema and you see the beginning of the Evil Dead movie(which is a good movie) but that hasn't got anything to do with this movie itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is not for the weak. It gradually gets darker or darko in this case. Just when you think it is going to toggle back to being lighthearted, it will plunge into black. It is too late at that point to turn back even if you want to. You will be disturbed.To be honest I'm not certain what the meaning of this film is since it plays out a lot like a David Lynch film with many random images, weird pauses, and bizarre scenes. If you like Lynch, you will like this film. It will make you think. The question is whether or not you are ready to think about some of the things that the film forces you to think about.

		<shortDescription>childish, faux-deep and good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So when I watched Donnie Darko once, I loved it. When I watched it again, I detested it. I initially enjoyed Kelly's elliptical ending, his cute observations of late 80s coming-of-age, his seemingly cryptic but solvable message. I particularly enjoy movies that make you actively decipher a meaning, truth or mystery - metaphysical detective fiction transferred well to celluloid. But viewing number two left me cold and angry. When you look at DD's website or view the DVD, you can easily find the pages of the Philosophy of Time Travel book. When Donnie chooses to go back in time to reset the negative aspects his life has caused, I was hoping for some sort of grander meaning, greater importance, or defter allusion to some existing school of philosophical thought. What Kelly gives us is a manufactured philosophy that he then ties his characters to. I don't know... I feel jipped. There's a difference between Donnie Darko and say, Mulholland Drive, another movie that involves heavy deciphering. MD has a neat payoff for the investment of time and detective work. At the end of Donnie Darko, it's like, who the hell cares? A few more quick beefs: Wyle and Barrymore characters useless. And this doesn't really count, but the DVD's inclusion of the Cunning Visions infomercials with `audio commentary by the director' is just plain snobby. Kelly has a propensity for easy targets: in this case, the low-budget commercial video maker. Ooh, make fun of amateurs - hilarious. Unlike other young writer-directors, such as Paul Thomas Anderson, Kelly seems to want to use satire not to make valuable characterizations, but to show the audience that he is above that sort of behavior. It just seems a little childish and spoils the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie's not crazy. He just sees a giant rabbit that tells him to dothings. As the film moves on you begin to piece together what is reallyhappening here, and more than likely you'll need to do a bit of thinkingand re-thinking, viewing and re-viewing to really make it all cometogether. And even then you may have questions. Movies like this aregreat. Some people don't like to think too much when seeing a film, andthat's fine. This film is for those who love to figure things out.Jake Gyllenhaal is mesmerizing. His slanted little smile, his sweet yetcynical demeanor. I just love Donnie, he's excellent. Hard to believehe's also The Bubble Boy. And having his real sister (who was so cool inCecil B. Demented) play his sis is also great. Cheeseball SupremePatrick Swayze plays what he should always play - a humorous parodycharacter - and should never make another pic where he is the LeadingMan again. You won't figure this movie out for awhile, and that, to me, is fun. Ifthat's not fun to you then you might not enjoy it so much. The finalscene with the song over the various characters' "resolutions" ishaunting and sad.Perhaps when people are doing things that seem destructive or crazy,they are just working on a different plane.

		<shortDescription>A dark and quirky black comedy that is a pleasure to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adolescence is a tough time for a lot of people. For Donnie Darko it's more than tough. Donnie is a perceptive and highly intelligent young man, but he is also moody and troubled to the point of having to go to therapy and take drugs to control his anger. He comes from a good, if conventional home and goes to a good, if conventional school, but he just does not fit it. Donnie's problems are a part of his personality and in the course of the movie we see how he tries to deal with them. Just how big those problems are becomes clear when, just before a jet engine mysteriously smashes into his room, he has a vision of Frank, a demonic rabbit who tells him that the world is going to end at the end of the month. And things just get weirder from there.?Donnie Darko' does not fit neatly into any genre of film. I would describe it as a combination of black comedy and teen drama. Fans of ?The X-Files' will enjoy the dark, surreal mood of much of the movie and though it will definitely not appeal to everyone, I found it both funny and moving. Jake Gyllenhaal does an excellent job of playing Donnie, a role that requires him to be likeable, charismatic, pathetic and frightening, sometimes all at once. His romance with Gretchen Ross (Jena Malone), a new girl at school with problems of her own, is one of the highlights of the movie, as are the scenes with Patrick Swayze's terrifying motivational speaker and Beth Grant's evangelical gym teacher. But the most memorable part of the movie, and the one you will most want to talk to people about, is the ending. It is hard to discuss it without giving away what happens, so I will just say that it makes sense, in an ambiguous kind of way, but I still found it a bit unsatisfying. Nevertheless, ?Donnie Darko' is an excellent film and just the thing to get out if you want to watch something offbeat that will make you both laugh and shudder.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but original first-time film may be destined for cult status.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Kelly, a 26-year-old first-time director, has made an ambitious and offbeat, complex, but, alas, not wholly successful, movie about a 15-year-old at odds with his school, his world, and, as it turns out, reality itself. His parents and sister, in a bit of a change for the coming of age genre, are friendly and helpful. An ominous tall alien `friend' with silver head, grinning teeth like a skull, and rabbit ears, who pursues Donnie and calls himself Frank, is less helpful. Donnie's sensitivity and brilliance remind one of Salinger's menagerie of precocious teenagers from Holden Caulfield to Seymour Glass, but they didn't engage in time travel or set fire to buildings. They didn't look as normal as Donnie, either, or have a fellow misfit as a girlfriend like Christian Slater in Heathers. Donnie Darko has too many agendas and tips its hat at too many genres. It sure does deserve credit for keeping you guessing. Donnie is led by Frank to walk by night and hear apocalyptic warnings. At school he simply seems independent minded, outspoken, and bright. Why is he doomed? What's the big piece of a plane that crashes into the Dark house? Why's it such a cheerful family and why does Donnie smile so much, and how's he so high functioning if he's on medication and sees a therapist who hypnotizes him and eventually diagnoses him as schizophrenic? Kelly takes us on a wild ride. The actor playing Donnie, Jake Gyllenhaal, is talented and has presence. His strange speech under hypnosis is brilliant. He has a knowing, sly, inward quality and his smile has a nice scary edge. Some of the school characters ? the gym teacher who preaches a cheap psychobabble cult and the cultist quack leader she promotes to the students, played woodenly by Patrick Swayze, are overdrawn and shrill, but the family and therapist are reasonable, if not great. Why does the movie, which is so strange, feel so conventional? There's no strong emotional focus for the boy's disarray as there is in Ordinary People. The raw material is hackneyed ? the ordinary middle-class white family, the nice private school. They have some amusing, surprising lines toward the beginning, but then the wild spiral toward doomsday cuts off the smart social observation. Drew Barrymore, done up to look like Julianne Moore, does a nice edgy turn as the risk-taking English teacher who gets fired for teaching a Graham Greene story that supposedly inspires kids to a major act of vandalism. The other students, Donnie's pals, his girlfriend, and a pariah fat girl, aren't very well differentiated or amusing. A plethora of special effects including digitalized ectoplasm evoke the teenage horror flick, which doesn't help set Donnie Dark apart from schlock. And that's really too bad, because the movie does have quite a few surprises and some originality. It seems destined for minor cult status. But it's like an American Beauty gone wildly wrong and not sure of the risks it takes: at the end it takes them all back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie came highly recommended from friends, who almost universally praised it, and also almost universally had the same comment:"It's great, you'll love it - but I can't really explain it."This wasn't to say that the movie held any deep dark secrets that would utterly spoil it (like Sixth Sense), or even to say that it was so muddled and confusing that it didn't make much sense. No, this comment was made because Donnie Darko isn't a movie that lends itself easily to a one-line synopsis. It's not a film that's easily classified or cataloged. It's just not like anything else on the video shelves. And for that alone, it's worth the rental. Or heck, even the purchase.Written and directed by first-timer Richard Kelly and set in a small town in 1988, Donnie Darko is the tale of a disturbed teenager (Jake Gyllenhaal, in the title role), who has an epiphany of sorts when he sees an imaginary six-foot tall rabbit. Already undergoing therapy, Donnie's troubled life takes a turn towards the bizarre as Frank the bunny leads him along a quest for meaning and faith, as well as venturing into the theories behind time travel. Along the way, he finds a love interest in Gretchen Ross (Jena Malone), who becomes intertwined in his quest and has some of the same dark and poetic outlooks on life that he holds so dear.Not a simplistic film by any means, Donnie Darko challenges the viewer at every turn and never once underestimates their intelligence. In fact, upon watching the deleted scenes on the DVD, most of the cuts were made either for time or because they explained the premise too clearly - Kelly states that he didn't want to do the thinking for his audience. As a result, you are gifted with an intriguing story that unfolds in dozens of directions at once, each holding meaning and purpose - if you choose to look for it. This attention to detail is quite rewarding, as little tidbits that seem like throwaway lines and scenes build in importance and pay off at the end. The score is haunting and effective: The instrumental score by Michael Andrews is mixed with 80s classics from Echo and the Bunneymen and the Church that are more than just cool retro songs thrown into the mix. Lyrically and emotionally, they perfectly fit the scenes they're backing - they have purpose just like all the other details in the film. The final montage of the film is set to a blend of these two musical sources - a cover version of Tears for Fears' 'Mad World' done by Andrews and vocalist Gary Jules. It's brilliant and understated. Quality acting work is turned in here by the two young leads and also boasts a strong supporting performance by Mary McDonnell as Donnie's mom. Good visuals, a strong script, and a well-conceived and executed ideal bring Donnie Darko into the pantheon of indie classics from recent years. Kelly is a filmmaker worth watching in the future, and Donnie Darko is definitely a film worth watching right now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the movies I see that I can't totally understand at the end give me an unsatisfied and negative feeling toward it. Not Donnie Darko. The movie was very funny in some parts and dark and strange in others. There were also many aspects of Donnie's character I can relate to well. Even though I couldn't totally piece it together to fully make sense (only the very end, really), it really didn't matter. I enjoyed it and that's what matters. A definite recommendation if you want a thinker. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko tells us in a strange kind of way things about the future. Not in a typical sci-fi way or an apocalyptic movie with a pregnant Demi Moore.Donnie Darko, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is a high school student who has an oversized demonic bunny as companion, who tells him things about the future.Donnie has to take medication and sees a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to discover why the oversized bunny leads him on to these sleepwalking trips. Many times he wakes up on different places. Sometimes somewhere on the road, other times on a golf terrain.One time he has luck. Late at night, everybody is a sleep, instead of his older sister. She just got home after a date. Suddenly when she closes the door, a loud crash is heard. She holds her hands to her ears and falls on the floor.The next day. Donnie wakes up somewhere else, when he got home, everywhere around his house are police lines with neighbors standing around the lines, while a big truck removes an engine away and the FBI questions the Darko family. There is much unexplained. For example, no airline is reporting that an engine is missing from one of its jets. Where did the engine come from?Just like Mulholland Drive, the movie gives you allot of intriguing mind puzzles, and you keep wondering what is happening.This set-up and development is fascinating, some will not like the ending and others will think is terrific. It's up to you what you think about it.But I tell you this, Richard Kelly is very talented, especially at creating a disturbing atmosphere out of the materials of real life. His mysterious engine is a brilliant. He sees his characters as persons, and never reduces them to typical characters. And he has this also to thank to the actors, who all gave a great performance.For a film debut this is a very good start. A very good start indeed.Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in ice. From what I've tasted of desire I hold with those who favor fire. -- Robert Frost</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would only ever watch this movie again to hear the Smurf conversation.Sure, the rabbit (Frank) is creepy. And yes, Jake Gyllenhaal is both surprising and intriguing as Donnie. Unfortunately, both the story and directing are crap.(Spoiler) This bothers me (among other things): Donnie was played out as a horny boy who kind of ended up in his relationship with Gretchen, and basically just wanted to get in her pants. But then, he suddenly feels that going back in time and dying is worth saving her? Yeah, okay. He was troubled and horny. They should've just left it at that.Blaming coincidences in the end of this movie is almost like Star Wars blaming every unexplainable event on `the force'. I understand that not everything is explainable both in life and movies, but come on people. In the end Gretchen waves at his mom?!? They never even interacted in the first part of the movie. Seriously, it's not artsy, it's mindless.I like movies with a good story, or at least a good message. Therefore, I DO NOT like this movie. Devine intervention, unlike what the director states, is totally unrelated to the actual story. Rent the DVD and listen to the commentary. Richard Kelly can't even explain most of it.I'll admit, the cover is cool.</fullReview>

In all serious, bad mouthing this movie truly shows some critics are not very big movie fans.I mean c'mon, truly this movie is an instant classic.This movie is set in the 80's and the motivational speaker(Patrick Swayze) is a little superficial when of course in this movie they keep proclaiming the fact that the range of emotions a person feels falls somewhere with Love,Anger, and Hate; Which in 80's Teen Books used in the classroom actually in all true life stated this!?!? So please when some of you critics state that these characters aren't realistic you do the research first.Above all, This movie is worth renting and seeing, maybe even keep it a day late or two 'lol'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Version of "Harvey"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brilliant film that is more in the vein of "The Sixth Sense" and "Final Destination." The film is seen through the eyes of the title character, an out of place 16 year old boy who has hallucinations of a sinister looking 6 foot tall rabbit that tells him to do things such as vandalizing his high school.The other characters seem detached and involved in their own worlds to even notice or even begin to realize the strange dream like state that Donnie Darko lives in day to day. The film wisely doesn't explain any of this and the viewer is left to wonder if Donnie is mentally ill or he actually is seeing into another dimension and is madness actually being more aware and ignorance considered the norm.Another strange aspect of this film is that it is a "period" piece taking place in 1988. There are '80s songs on the soundtrack and a haunting version of "Mad World." Jake Glyehenhall does a great job of portraying Donnie as does the supporting cast including an uncharacteristically subdued Drew Barrymore who also executive produced the film, Patrick Swayze and Katherine Ross who still has the same screen prescence she did in her older films such as "The Graduate" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."This is one of the more original, unusual films I've seen recently. I have to admit that I was expecting this to be another slasher film like "Scream" or "I Know What You Did Last Summer" but was pleasantly surprised to see a film that chose to take a different path than most.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this film and I'm not sure what to think--I'll need some time and reflection. A couple things I am sure of though, the film felt very much like a David Lynch project, and Jake Gyllenhaal did a great job (am I the only one who thinks he looks like Tobey Maguire?) Many of the reviewers who liked this film mention how good the acting was and include Drew Barrymore in their accolades. Barrymore was awful in this film! I have nothing against her personally and I have never noticed anything negative about her in other films, but her acting here was bad. She delivered her lines with no feeling, like she was reading them in a monotone. It was so horrible I started to suspect that this was deliberate to somehow make a point or add something to the overall feeling of the film. But now I think it was just bad acting on her part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, I was really intrigued by this movie. I thought it was an interesting division between comedy, horror, and just plain drama. One of those movies where the ending keeps you talking about it for days to come. I was surprised by the acting... Jake Gyllenhaal did a superb job as Donnie Darko, and with back-ups like Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore, the movie drew you in to the characters. I thought that it was a great idea for a horror- type theme, even though the director did not go that route. The bunny was the freakiest thing I have ever seen, and what made it worse was that it didn't DO anything... reminds me of the stuffed animals I used to be scared of when I was a kid, because, in the dark, they looked like monsters. A good film overall, but just slightly strange the way it flip flopped back and forth between happy and just plain scary... 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, disturbing and amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I don't pretend to completely understand this film (the whole film and especially the ending is open to interpretation) it blew my mind as few others have. Not every film, and hardly any of the cliched crap that comes out of Hollywood studios these days, can make one both think so hard that the brain starts to pound and feel deeply the pain of its characters. Perhaps I liked it so much because as an alienated (but not schizo) teen I know what it is like to create a reality outside the of the mundane and unimaginitive real world, but I think this film has so many depths to it that just about anyone with a brain would be able to garner some value from it. "Donnie Darko" is certainly an off-beat movie though and a melange of genres seamlessly woven together to create a work of arresting originality and vision. It explores so many metaphysical issues--fate and free will, alternate realities, time travel, the possibility of a God, as well as the less original theme of suburban dysfunction. Yet although it's heavy on the philosophizing, it's also a mordantly funny movie, rife with pop cultural and political references particular to the time in which it is set, the eighties.The performances are uniformly fine. Jake Gylanhaal (sic?) turned in such a nuanced performance--why would such a talented young actor consent to appear in a piece of dreck like "Bubble Boy?" Jena Malone, as his love interest, is terrific and even Partick Swayze is quite good. Drew Barrymore turned in a good performance, although her character wasn't an essential part of the film.I must agree with those who hail Kelly as a genius and I can only hope that he doesn't take the same route as Christopher Nolan, who while not yet a hack seems to be edging toward the banality of the Hollywood formula movie. I don't buy a lot of movies and I don't like to see a lot of films more than once, but this one I'm putting on my Christmas list.</fullReview>

With a score reminicent of AIR's 'Virgin Suicides' work mixed with some interesting 80's tracks (Echo &amp; the Bunnymen's "Killing Moon" is a brilliant opening track, the school sequence set to Tears for Fears is stunning, and the closing track are all amazing).

		<shortDescription>the eerie and sarcastic tone of the film stuck in my head for days</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wonderful film is soothing and disturbing at the same time. I guess it depends on who you identify with. The strong catharsis the film is leading towards was the most comforting ending I've experienced in a film in a long time. There may still be hope for all those who don't fit in and wonder if they are really the only sane ones among all those who are really just afraid of you. When society says you are negative or weird when you know that you're the only one who can actually deal with the truth. This is perfectly illustrated by the role of Patrick Swayze (comparable to the role of Tom Cruise in Magnolia)as the clean cut instructor on living with fear, his oversimplified "philosophy" of human emotion. No wonder he is metaphorized as the Anti Christ! I thought the film was filled with references to eighties teen films, ranging from Back to the Future to Carrie, but with a bitterly sarcastic undertone. The sneering cynicism at all those values Americans claim to hold so high it rises above them, was excellent. To a European audience some issues raised, like banning Graham Greene's books, are probably ridiculous and out of the question in Europe. To totally grasp some of these issues I guess you need good knowledge of American white middle-upper class society. Overall the film is very original though at the same time it definitely fits in the line of the new genre of American films exposing the other, darker, if you will, side of supposedly ideal suburbian society, like American Beauty and Todd Solondz' films have done. Donnie Darko leaves you paralyzed and confused but it also made me feel wonderful. The fantastic elements are beautiful and daring. I was so sure that Donnie's hallucinations were real, that they were merely a higher step to the essence of being. It's a beautiful film in many ways, I didn't even mention the beautiful camerawork, adding to the dreamy atmosphere. I'm glad to see some new talent has risen again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watch this movie without any preconieved notion of how it will turn out. This is definitely for the section of filmgoers who thought "Vanilla Sky" layed out all of the answers too blantantly at the conclusion. All of the performances are top-notch. I loved seeing Katherine Ross in a new quality film even if she is given very little to do. Jake Gyllenhaal is commanding and impressive in his performance as the titular troubled teen. The chemistry between Jena Malone ("Stepmom") and Gyllenhaal is one of the highlights of the film along with the small, intimate performances of Donnie's family members (Mary McDonnell, Holmes Osbourne, Maggie Gyllenhaal) and his teachers (Noah Wyle, et. al). My only complaint is the lack of development of Drew Barrymore's character. There is nothing for her to do in the film and the scenes focusing on her always foreshadow more of her involvement in the plot, but, alas, this never comes to fruitation. "Donnie Darko" is a very good film, it is very reminiscent of "American Beauty" and "Memento" in some aspects, and slightly reminiscient of "Vanilla Sky" in very few. I enjoyed the film immensely and will definitely watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing--and that's the bottom line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie really quite good. I wouldn't go so far as to gushingly give it 10 stars, but 8? Or a strong 7? Easily. Unfortunately, Donnie Darko has polarized people into taking a strong position about the film without really giving it a lot of thought. The film's biggest problem is that it doesn't want to pigeonhole itself into any one genre--I've read reviews of Donnie Darko where it is described as science fiction, psychological thriller, coming-of-age story, or all three, rolled into one. While this genre-bending is also one of the film's strengths, it puts off some people who want a clear picture of what they're dealing with. Donnie Darko is a highly detailed work of imagination, which does make the viewer work a little more than the average film.To be sure, the film's plot could confuse some people. If films like Pulp Fiction, Memento, Mulholland Drive, or Brazil just confuse you, then Donnie Darko may be more work than it's worth. Personally, I admired the circular nature of the plot; it added to the overall tone of the film.And what a tone it is. 80s icons like Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze pierce the surreal moodiness that seems to follow Donnie. Comic performances from Beth Grant and Jake Gyllenhaal (in the title role) keep things very lively. Adding to all of this are the special effects; while they aren't elaborate, they perfectly evoke Donnie's dilemma, and by extension, our own: Is Donnie crazy, or is the world coming to an end?A little 80s nostalgia (not the over the top sort in The Wedding Singer or That 80s Show), an eerie sense of what's about to happen, and a fantastic performance by Jake Gyllenhaal make this worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not that good either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie on basis of the very positive reviews found here, and I must say that I was more than a tad dissapointed. It isn't THAT wonderful, original and allover good movie. Didn't find it that interesting to be frank; I expected something more original than this, and it could have been better, if, for example, the rabbit was better done and had more depth. It could have been really interesting, if it actually interfered more, took Donnie inside it's universe instead of just dropping into his. But I guess this wasn't necessary for the plot or anything, I just missed something like that. The ending wasn't an eyeopener like in the Sixth Sense, it was more like, yeah, ok, so that was it. Fair enough. I voted this film a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark delusion or supernatural vision?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film and Donnie's 28 day nightmare leave you asking the same question: dark delusion or supernatural vision? More impressive than the wonderful story and great acting is that I still don't know the answer to these questions. And I won't know, either. Unlike Vanilla Sky, Donnie Darko feels no need to completely explain itself.For 28 days, 5 hours, 12 minutes and 42 seconds, Donnie lives a nightmare of violence he doesn't remember, visions he can't escape, and frightening coincidences that lead him to believe the end will come right on time as predicted by his new friend, Frank -- a dark vision of a rabbit.Donnie is convinced that Frank saved him from certain death, and that he is being lead by God's timeline. However, we know that Donnie has not been taking his anti-psychotic medication. Which is the true source of Donnie's uncanny coincidences? Do they exist only in his mind or is he on an inescapable course guided by fate?Don't take anyone else's word for it, and, whatever you do, don't listen to any steely-eyed rabbits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-=- spoiler alert -=- I have decided to add this comment after reading so many reviews from PAID FILM CRITICS and IMDB reviewers who just didn't get the film. In this movie, Donnie gets a chance to NOT DIE in his bedroom at the beginning, when the jet crashes into the house. He is allowed to live further into the future and he gets to see what would have happened. He is also exposed to the possibility of time travel; he chooses to take this option when he sees how his life (and the lives of his closest companions) will turn out if he stays on the planet. So he goes back to the day when the jet crashes into his bedroom; this time he makes sure he is THERE, in his bed, that night. -=- End of spoiler. -=- If you didn't understand this the first time you saw the film, watch it again. (And specifically listen to the lyrics that are playing when he falls into his bed at the end, smiling.) I didn't completely get it the first time either, and I figured out that -=- DIFFERENT MOVIE spoiler -=- Spacey was Kaiser Soze in The Usual Suspects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if this even got a video release here in the UK. Which is a shame, as it is the perfect antidote to the glut of insipid teen movies that continue to be churned out and shipped over here. Donnie Darko says what a lot of us probably think about conformity and social institutions. I have one slight criticism in that (spoiler) Patrick Swayze's character turns out to be a child molester (end spoiler) When he was really established as being bad enough already without the point needing to be hammered home like this. I was glad I saw this thoughtful and charming film though. The song "Mad World" at the end has stayed with me for weeks afterwards.

		<shortDescription>Not just a weird movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people seem to feel that, just because this movie has plot twists and is cryptic, that it's being 'weird' just for the sake of being weird. I don't think this is true at all.*Warning: Spoilers Ahead*Here is my interpretation of the movie: Frank represents life. He brings Donnie many good experiences, like love for instance, but also bad things, like an unescapable destiny. Donnie knows that he is going to die when the world ends, just as we all know that we will die someday. But rather than focus on the good things Frank brings Donnie, Donnie chooses to focus on averting the inevitable, and fails to enjoy the experience itself. His desire to find the 'meaning of it all' from Frank is analagous to our own desires to find out the meaning of our own lives. Patrick Swayze's character represents the antithesis of Donnie...he is in denial of destiny, and chooses to live life in ignorance (and teach others to do so) in order to gain 'control over fear'. The moral of the movie, I think, is that there is a happy medium...accepting your ultimate destiny (death), but at the same time, not focusing on that, and enjoying the experience that life gives you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story progresses nicely, aided by some nice camerawork during the "music videos". By 'nicely' I mean the story is good by itself and also for the questions it makes the viewer ask about the intentions of characters and by extension, the director himself. But all this evident time and effort runs out of steam. The conclusion of the movie feels like a cop-out - the director is great at making promises and expressing possibilities to the viewer, but then seemingly shrugs his shoulders and hides behind a cowardly, non-sensical ending. I appreciate movies that attempt to live from their ambiguity; this one goes so far though, takes such pains to disorient/amaze/taunt/play with the viewer, thats its strange ending leaves one feeling abandoned and bullied, not fulfilled and thankful. And the impact (on all its levels) of the airplane piece in the opening scene is done much better in the movie "Sexy Beast" with the boulder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fantasy, mystery, romantic science fiction movie so has something for everyone. The pace is slow but never plodding and has an impressive cast for a no budget film.Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal: October Sky) is a 17-year-old school kid with more than his fair share of problems. One of three children in a middle class American family he finds it difficult to communicate with the other members of his family. A problem so up-setting to his Mother (Mary McDonnell: Independence Day) that she has placed him in therapy. Then to top it all off one night a demonic bunny rabbit name Frank saves him from certain death and delivers a mind blowing message to him. The rabbit continues to visit Donnie and sets him to task carrying out acts of thought less destruction, or are they. The only bright spot in Donnie's Life the arrival of the new kid in school Gretchen Ross (Jena Malone: The Book of Stars). Donnie soon becomes romantically involved with Gretchen. A kindred spirit perhaps, well she dose have problems of her own to work through.Is there a point to Donnie's evening escapades? What part dose Frank play in them? And who is the old lady in the middle of the road? All questions are answered and if your sharp enough you may even get the answers yourself as the clues are in there. However I was a bit slow on the up-take and had to watch the movie again with the directors commentary to fully understand it. Before you get worried that this sounds to deep for your idea of an evenings entertainment. Others have watched and gotten most of it first time. This film sucked me in. I didn't now what to expect but was extremely impressed by the whole package.Jake Gyllenhaal shows that he is already an actor of considerable talent. Despite only having eleven movies under his belt he his showing a wealth of maturity. All the cast turn in good performances and what a cast. Patrick Swayze: Ghost, Drew Barrymore: Charlie's Angels, Noah Wyle: ER and Katharine Ross: The Graduate.Richard Kelly has set the bar pretty high for himself now. Not only did he write and directed this movie. But it is his first ever project. Kelly has come up with the most original story in sometime. He has put together the complete package. Interesting characters well shoot scenes and an enjoyable sound track. Notable amongst which is Garry Jules version of the Tears for Fears song Mad World.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of the mainstream American movies I have seen in the past months, this is surely one of the most surprising.The nice suburban setting made me wary at first, expecting another of the countless exposes on the problems of people who have nothing to worry about except the excess of luxury.But pretty soon I got swept up in the mystery of this boy who is somehow doomed. The story is pretty thick and the music is outright annoying at times. Still, the acting is good. Especially the guy playing Donnie is terrific. I also liked the way the movie evades overt moralism and instead lets you judge for yourself. This is only partly true, but if you compare this film to 90% of other Hollywood teenage films (Life as a house stands out as a particularly ominous example), it certainly is refreshing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Donnie Darko with mixed apprehensions about the completely unbelievable plotline I had heard of. A demonic bunny telling a kid what to do. Yeah. That sounds like a great flick. More like B rate trash.But I was surprised in a wonderful way. Donnie Darko is one of the best movies I've ever seen, if not the best. It hits home on several points too, well, dark for movies like American Beauty. Even my favorite film, Fight Club, was geared more towards living a boring life than a depressing one like Donnie does. Yet it comes across as funny in some parts, tragic in others, and still remains very familiar to some of us. Especially a teenager who has seen his share of troubles. All in all the plot didn't drive me away and nothing should drive you away either. I'm not a fan of Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, or Jake Gyll...you know who. But this film was wonderful in more ways than I can say. Go out and buy this movie now. It's an unsung classic that shouldn't be missed but should be seen many times over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing all the hubbub about this film from friends and recommendations on the this site, I went right out to Best Buy and bought it. I was kind of disappointed the first time I watched it, actually. Firstly, because of the inane "humor" at the dinner table scene; secondly, because I thought the rabbit just looked dumb. Anyway, on the second viewing, I really caught more things that I didn't the first time. Yeah, some of the special effects are on par with your standard made-for-tv movie fare, but after watching Disney's abysmal Dinotopia effort on ABC, I can see as clear as day what sets this film apart from the usual overambitious low-budget stuff. The plot was engaging and complex, the throwback to the late eighties was done flawlessly, and Donnie Darko was an interestingly novel idea for a hero. So yeah, it grew on me I guess. It has that "cult movie" feel at times. And I kind of think the rabbit's cool, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets at some core issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked American Beauty, Magnolia, and Vanilla Sky, you would probably enjoy the similarly-themed Donnie Darko. The main strengths of the film lie in its stylish direction, haunting images, and effective soundtrack (both the original score and 80's pop tunes). Though the sci-fi musings about time travel provoke some thought, the final resonance of the film lies in Jake Gyllenhal's performance as a young man who wants to know what we all want to know - namely, that we are not ultimately alone in a universe bereft of meaning. Mary McDonnell (as his mother) and Katharine Ross (as his therapist) turn in fine supporting performances as people desiring to help Donnie through his inner struggle. I must commend my high-school classmate Richard Kelly on a job well done. He seems to have developed sympathetic insight into the core issues common to us all. As I recall Richard in the memory banks of my own 80's suburban Virginia childhood, such sympathy was not readily apparent to me then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Puzzle missing the picture and several pieces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to confess that I was not as "into" this movie as I'd hoped to be. As it was wrapping up, I kept looking at the timer on my DVD player to see how much longer it was going to continue. It was not that I did not enjoy myself, I did and my friend and I had an interesting discussion about it afterwards, but I just got really bored as the movie hit the home stretch. That final climax just didn't do much for me.I must warn viewers of the film that it is not an entire story. In order to understand the film you must read the book of time travel written by Kelly (on the film's website or included in the DVD special features) and read through a lot of the other stuff on the website in order to "get it." Sadly, after going through the rigamarole of watching the lengthy film and poring over the website/special features for a couple hours the given explanation still has flaws - big ones.Kelly has cited 12 Monkeys as inspiration for this film, but I feel like "Blair Witch Project" is a better model. He has created this snippet of a story (made it into a film) and then uses a webpage, interviews, etc. in order to finish telling the story. It is a shame really. This film is very close to being able to stand on its own. Kelly comes really close to pulling off a tremendous film, but falls tragically short.Of course, this is a film that should rank high on people's "to see" list, but I feel that its inclusion in the IMDB top 200 is a bit of an overstatement. Sure it has got great acting, a relatively well-established, though young, cast, good writing, an original plot and nice cinematography but it just does not have a plot that will hold up to numerous watchings. Here's a test to prove it: read that book that Kelly wrote and put on the dvd and website so that you understand how he explains the film, what is actually going on...he's rather explicit. Then watch the film again and see if what happens fits with the "model" he presents in the book. With some things it fits so seemlessly it is amazing. With others, Donnie's insanity (or lack thereof), Donnie's first experience with Frank, etc...you will notice that a great many things just do not gel.Sorry to burst people's bubbles, but once you know what Kelly's explanation was, you'll realize how it pales in comparison to all of the imaginative, exciting and complex scenarios that viewers have given to it. It is a good film, definitely top 75%, but as more people read what Kelly was doing in the film through his explanation, I think this movie will drop down to the realm of Boogie Nights and 7.5 land...that's not a bad place to be for a first-timer either. Looking forward to Kelly's future works...I'm sure I'll wait for them to hit DVD, but I'll definitely watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know what to expect from this film when I picked it up in the video store. From the cover and the summery, I thought it was some kind of teen slasher-horror flick. Wasn't in the mood for one of those, but it had piqued my curiosity. This movie keeps you guessing and then re-guessing exactly what is going on. Just when you think you get it, the plot seems to veer in a new direction. New things just keep getting thrown at you, but not in way that is frustrating. You have NO idea what's going to happen next. What's the Red Herring and what is truly important to understanding the meaning of this movie? Is there a Red Herring?, is there a meaning?-well there is, but i still don't think i understand everything. Drives you crazy in such a good way. My sister and I were intrigued-there were NO snack or washroom breaks during this one. There is a dark humor present in most scenes. The whole tone of the film is very dark and simultaneously touching and beautiful. It was so great to see a film that was so obviously not catering to Hollywood's genre film standards. I would have no idea how to categorize this one. Jake Gyllenhal makes Donnie so real, mysterious, and wonderful. You really care about this character. Great acting all round. I've never seen anything quite like this. I totally recommend it-especially to own. It's one of those things that leaves you wanting more. You notice and understand more as you watch it again and again-Like Fight Club or the Simpsons. Wish more films would involve you and engage your creative mind like this does. Just see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had no idea what to expect from this movie. I work at Blockbuster video and rented it on a whim because it was free and I knew it had a troubled guy in it who saw visions of a very scary rabbit. My family is collectively a big fan of the old James Stewart film Harvey, about a drunk who has a gigantic rabbit for a best (imaginary...?) friend. The tidbit I knew of Donnie Darko seemed like a modern twist.Though there is little to connect these two movies beyond their plots involving visions of cuniculine monstrosities, I thoroughly enjoyed Donnie Darko in its own right. It is a movie that is hard to describe: very funny in places, but the humor is at times downright morbid, dark at best. It is a movie that will keep you guessing to the end and beyond, but it does not leave you dissatisfied...like a roller coaster that is full of twists and turns but ultimately brings you full circle, it could be watched many times before you 'get it' completely (if that is even possible). Some may not like this about a movie, at least not about a movie as dark as this or one that contains hyper-natural (I daren't say 'super') elements throughout. But if that description alone does not deter you, or even piques your interest, you will probably find Donnie Darko to be a humble surprise.Unassuming, unapologetic, and well-named, I'd rate Donnie Darko to be an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a beautiful movie with many after thoughts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie that has many symbolisms and touches upon several areas of subjects: time travel, divine intervention, science vs divinity, and self revelation. The story itself is very interesting and ties its knots pretty well. Some people might think, "What is the point of this movie?" after watching it but if you do catch all the details in symbolisms and dialogues, it will make you want to rewind to key parts to participate in the story itself. The way that this movie used the concept of time travel and the parallel universe was very interesting. It makes little hints in the beginning regarding the time travel and the parallel universe and wraps it up pretty nicely in the end.Donnie Darko's room is filled with many symbolisms giving a hint of self revelation and divine intervention. Jake gives Donnie Darko a wonderful character where in the end, you understand what he went through and makes you a participants of his surroundings and interactions.Second theme of this movie is the system and the parents ablility to understand their kids. The family relationship is shown through greatly through his father and mother. The relationship he has with the shrink is excellent. Donnie's actions in school is looked down by kids but is admired by the teachers who are trapped within the system that they work for.Overall, this is very interesting movie to watch and have lengthy discussion over if you are willing to get underneath the time travel and parallel universe and also willing to pay attention to little details.</fullReview>

With the help of a giant talking rabbit, Donnie survives the crash of a mysterious jet engine into his bedroom. The rabbit tells Donnie the world will come to an end in 28 days.Over the next 28 days, Donnie sees how his surviving the accident directly affect people around him such as his girlfriend, a motivational speaker, a teenager named Frank, and teachers at his school.Unlike the happy ending of "It's a Wonderful Life, Donnie realizes, as the tragic events unfold, it would have been better had he not survived the accident after all. Using a time travel technique taught by a mysterious local woman, he goes back to the time of the accident and makes sure he doesn't survive.The film is well-written and cast perfectly. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance of the doomed Donnie was nothing less than brilliant.Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, the really picky folks can hunt and peck at the flaws all they want to rationalize why they don't think this is so great, and, yeah, the flaws are there. Some scenes arguably don't belong, the "science" involved is certainly questionable, and so on. But c'mon, picky people, it would be wonderful if all films were this good. Some films can be and are great even if flawed. And this one I found engrossing, dark, sad, and beautiful. And extraordinary. You can argue whether or not some of the techniques employed haven't already been done before (the techniques for which David Lynch has become [in]famous come to mind, but they only come to mind; it's hard to pin down how exactly they're highly similar), but this film is still very unique and original. Get past the nitpicking over details and judge the story as a whole; that's what made this special for me. (E.g., something about the word "sacrifice" used in ads for the film, as it relates to the story.) It's rare that I see a film that makes so strong an impression on me, but I will indeed let some time pass and give it a second viewing to see how well it holds up.In the meantime, I'll give it a 9 out of 10 (and I don't give out 9's very easily).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie is thought-provoking, but also real confusing. in one respect, the uncertainty about what exactly is going on can be annoying, and you might feel a bit unsatisfied at the end. however, leaving the film open to interpretation is a good idea.i think the most important thing about donnie darko is its insight into humanity, not the way it looks at time travel.......maybe reviewers who called it a science fiction flick missed the point a bit. the core characters act well and it is easy to relate to the film's cynicism.even if there are more plot holes than time loops this is essentially a very interesting film and should be seen by anyone who is bored of predictable 'mainstream' films. peace</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant.Amazing.Donnie Darko is a labyrinth of a film. Each time you view it you take a different path and pick up new gems... you see new facets of previous gems. Full of the rich, layered, meaningful symbolism and imagery you would expect from a Peter Greenaway film (Drowning by Numbers; The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover), Darko is a deeply moving, rewarding experience that gets better with each viewing. There is always a new detail to notice, always a fresh new viewpoint from which to experience the film.Writer and (first time) director Richard Kelly is the new wunderkind to watch, the next M. Night Shyamalan to break onto the scene.Incredible performances from a great cast and slick, awesome special effects (incredibly, done for $$ equaling the catering budget of most Hollywood movies) round out one of the best films I have experienced in an age.Darko is the first film I bought on DVD... after which I went out to buy the DVD player I've been putting off buying for years. There was just never such a commanding reason for me to go DVD before Donnie Darko.-Shane G</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Richard Kelly's 'Donnie Darko' (2001) is 'Back to the Future' meets 'Final Destination' with a twist of 'Sixth Sense.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS! Rebellious highschooler Donnie lives with his yuppy, republican bourgeois family in quaint Middlesex, Iowa during the decline of the Reagan era (1988). Donnie's intelligence is `intimidating', but he has mental problems and visits an expensive psychiatrist, whose prescription Donnie neglects. Upon taking the pills Donnie encounters his imaginary friend Frank, a large, demonic rabbit. Frank saves Donnie from a mysterious 747 jet engine that demolishes his room, and Frank also informs Donnie that the end of the world will occur in 28 days, 6 hours, and 42 minutes from October 2nd, Halloween morning. The countdown towards tragedy commences, and Donnie's world becomes increasingly uncanny. He meets and `goes' with troubled new-girl Gretchen, and his hallucinations become more psychedelic. He has visions of time-lines (translucent spherical arrows that lead his family and friends into the future) and Frank influences him to commit acts of anarchy against his repressive private school and its manipulative counselor, Jim Cunningham. A costume party on the eve of Halloween leads Donnie and Gretchen to their nightmarish destiny, but horrified Donnie then travels back in time to remedy this tragedy with a sacrificial act of love.The complex plot twists of Donnie's clairvoyant and telepathic dream are framed by the story of the final day in Donnie's ordinary life, and the film, as a whole is a sub-textual criticism against the hypocritical nature of republicanism in the late 1980's. Just before bedtime Donnie reluctantly takes his prescribed drugs while his father sneaks to the living room for some late night Bush, Dukakis debate coverage. George Bush Sr. tiptoes around and stumbles upon the issue of appropriated drug money in Panama, and Donnie stares at the American flag in his bedroom as he dozes off. At this point, supernatural elements appear and are articulated by superb cinematic techniques. A peculiar wide-angle shot portrays a school bus from behind, that seems to be laying on its right side. As the hit eighties song `Killing Moon' begins the camera rotates clockwise, tracks backwards, and pans left in one fluid motion as Donnie exits the bus. This shot is very disorienting for the viewer and symbolizes the temporal leap forward of Donnie's uncanny premonition. Then, three brilliantly choreographed long takes capture the essence of Donnie's conservative private school, an institution that reflects the repressive ideology and hypocritical nature of extreme capitalism amidst the post-Reagan era. The principle turns his head away from a bully snorting a key bump in the hallway, and outside five staff members are lined up in a way that represents an inverted bipartisan political spectrum. Motivational counselor of love and fear, Jim Cunningham represents the extreme cruelty of conservatism and is thus cast to the far left of the frame. Opposite Cunningham is the very liberal literature teacher, played by the lusty Drew Barrymore, to the far right frame. Frank influences Donnie to burn down Cunningham's house, which leads to Cunningham's arrest as a child pornography ringleader. Jim is hypocritical and manipulative, and his many exploits have yielded great economic success. Fast motion photography and fluxuating clouds constantly remind the viewer of the `worm hole' that Donnie has entered, but a camera rotating counter clockwise with speedy reverse motion photography brings Donnie back to his bedroom post-tragedy, and back to the frame story. On the morning of October 2nd Donnie awakens with hysterical laughter as he remains in bed reflecting on his dream. He is then killed by the mysterious 747 jet engine.</fullReview>

I've seen "Donnie Darko" 3 times now, twice normal, once w/ directors commentary. Hell, the first time through, I had no idea that Frank, the giant bunny rabbit, was Donnie's sister's boyfriend (although I did notice the car in a couple of scenes). There are a couple of misconceptions in other peoples comments that dearly need to be cleared up:1) The movie *is* about time travel and *is* a work of science fiction. Rather poorly explained, it may seem, but the makers of the film had these intentions as shown by the choice of some of the deleted scenes which they felt made the points over obvious.2) Donnie *was not* sick!!! At least, in so far, as he was not having the daylight hallucinations. His medicine was placebo, water pills. He was slightly disturbed, and he did burn down the abandoned house he mentioned to Gretchen, but he was far from crazy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spoilers, but explanations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is in response to all of the reviews that said that Donnie Darko had nothing to do with time travel, or that the time travel theory was flawed. I am sorry, but watching Back to the Future forty times does not make you a time travel expert. Yes, I know Back to the Future was mentioned in the film, but it does not use that one specific theory to explain traveling through time. If anyone has done their research, time travel has hundreds of different theories. The interpretation I received from the film was very different than others in its genre. It did not copy all of the other time travel movies that enforce the idea that when we travel into the future it's only one of many possible futures. Instead, it gives the impression that even the future is planned out, and that there is no way to escape fate. When Donnie was talking to his teacher. The science teacher said he couldn't discuss time travel anymore or he would get fired. It was due to the fact that they were discussing the possibilities to defy God, which is inappropriate in the religious school where he worked. The twenty-eight days that the movie spans are just a loop hole between when the jet engine on the airplane hits a worm hole and travels twenty-eight days into the past, where it smashes through Donnie's bedroom. The countdown wasn't counting when Donnie shoots Frank, it was the space in between when the engine enters and leaves the worm hole. That is why there was no explanation for where the jet engine came from. yet those twenty-eight days had to take place in order for time to loop and continue down the path it does in the end. Whether Frank was a messenger or a hallucination, there was no way that Frank could stop Donnie from dying in his bedroom. It was God's will. The biggest example of this is when Frank first appeared and moved Donnie out of his bedroom. Even when Frank tried to change fate it only worked out with the same consequences that it had without Frank.I hope this explains some of the misconceptions that people have been having about the movie. If not, watch the movie again, and maybe think about what you just saw. A lot of times that creates logic, which helps explain the "flaws" in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't really sure what to expect when i first popped in "donnie darko" i had seen the trailer on "don't say a word" and i thought it looked like a pretty cool horror flick. When i finished watching it i was amazed and stunned by how great the film was. Jake Gyllanhaal who i thought was pretty good in october sky and not too great in Bubble Boy really suprised me. Gyllenhaal shows how great of an actor he can be given the right material. I also liked Jena Malone's performance, who was also great in Cheaters. The cast, which also included Patrick Swayze and Drew Barrymore did a great job in this film. What i thought was the best thing about the movie was just how tense and realistic the mood was. I wish this film had came out thatrically so it could have gotten more exposure. I understood that this movie was director Richard Kelley's debut. All i have to say to him is keep up the brilliant work. The movie never stalls. Right from it's opening scene to the credits it is filled with drama, suspense, horror, comedy, love, hate, and insight into one boy's mind. SEE THIS FILM AT ALL COSTS 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is disturbing, amazing, fantastic. I've just seen it once, but I'm going to have to watch it again and again. It is about a mentally troubled 15 year old, and his life in the 1980's contemporary America. Donnie Darko is his name, and he's made a new friend: Frank - the giant bunny rabbit.Frank is telling Donnie that the world will end in 28 days.Richard Kelly has made a modern masterpiece. There can be no doubt about it. Incredibily filmed, well directed. DONNIE DARKO keeps switching between surreal horror and a intense drama. Thanks to the suburb looks and action of Jake Gyllenhaal, you really care about this boy, and what is happening to him.It's like there is something definitly not right, in this right world of jesus-freaks, surburban comfort and that fat girl from school, noone will ever talk to. Donnie has been seeing stuff, and lately... Frank has been telling him to do things... Dark things.I find myself without words now. This film is one of the best I've ever seen.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way better than the average "adolescent angst" flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love films that poke fun at people with hidden agendas, with simplistically schematized views of the world, or whose self-respect comes from their jealously guarded reputations. It's not the main theme of Donny Darko; but, the central character is adroitly used as a foil against this background. He suffers from none of these social afflictions. The young Mr. Darko, exceptional in many different ways, is both troubled and gifted; the two, it seems, often go together. It's hard to tell whether Donny's `gifts' are derived from his mental problems, for which he needs therapy, and medication, or if his mental problems are a product of his gifts.One of the reasons that the movie works so well is the way it plays with the possibility of alternate realities. It's like this: there are over ten dimensions, and we have access to three. Our senses, therefore, miss most of reality. Donnie Darko, however, has access, not specifically to another dimension, but to another reality. Is it the product of mental imbalance; or, is his `mental imbalance' the product of an unusual gift? `There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in your philosophy' is the over-quoted line from Shakespeare. But it actually fits here. It's not possible to put Donny into anyone's box, least of all the `life line' boxes in which his Catholic high school tries to shove him.One of the things that endear me to this film is the sensitivity with which the main character, Donny Darko, is treated. He's not a brash, swaggering, posturing, overcompensating young man, as is often the case in movies about adolescents on the cusp of manhood. Shy and somewhat retreating, he's not the type to cover his Adlerian sense of inadequacy with typical compensatory tactics. So it's a comical irony that this young man, seemingly so ill-adjusted, is in many ways healthier than his `normal' peers.It's a gem of a movie, the likes of which comes along once in a great while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw a trailer for this movie back in December of 2001 and I didn't think much of it, passing it off as just another one of a slew of terrible "horror" movies that have come out in the past. Then last week my friend tells me that it's one of his top five favorite movies, so I decided to give Donnie Darko a fair shot. I watched it, and though I didn't understand a lot of it at first, I thought it was really well done and keeps you guessing all the way to the end.I went to bed and all night into the next day I kept processing the movie over and over again, trying to figure out the stuff I didn't get at first. I decided to watch the audio commentary, which helps a ton if you watch the movie but don't get some of it. Richard Kelly wrote a great screenplay with a lot of the story coming straight from your interpretation of what happened, something few screenwriters have been able to do throughout a movie, not just the ending. I would put this screenplay on par with Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, another movie you don't get at first but it just grabs you and makes you watch and think about it to create your own interpretation of it.After watching it three times in two days, I don't put Donnie Darko in my top five, but I agree that it's a brilliant, beautifully haunting movie that didn't get enough respect. Backed by an equally haunting and emotional soundtrack, it is a movie that shouldn't be watched just once.By the way, classifying it as horror isn't giving it any justice...Don't think you're gonna get scared if you watch this movie. It has it's moments, but it's not horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I live in an area where you have to drive at least 100 miles to see a film that isn't mass-marketed. I think that truly sucks. Oh well, I guess that why someone invented the VCR and someone capitalized on the idea of renting out movies. I believe those ideas came into effect in the 1980's.That is where the film is "Donnie Darko" begins. Set in 1988, this films takes through a segment of the life of a mentally warped teen named Donnie Darko. For some strange reason, he starts seeing this rabbit that makes the little bunny from "Monty Python and The Holy Grail" look docile. From there, Donnie takes a mysterious trip that eventually culminates in a conclusion that is left open for one to decide what it means. What really grabbed me was the plot and story of the film. It is a very intricate puzzle that will mess your mind up after you watch it. Richard Kelly wrote and directed a beautiful mental puzzler that will leave you asking many questions. Jake Gyllenhall did extremely well as Donnie. He probably had one of the best performances in the year 2001. I was stunned how well he could go from straight-faced to psycho in point three seconds. Drew Barrymore, Jena Malone, Noah Wyle, Patrick Swayze did well in rounding out a perfect cast. The special effects weren't in your face and the ending seems correct depending upon what point of view you take.In the end, "Donnie Darko" is my type of film. I love puzzling plots and deep themes. If that is your type of film, buy or rent it on DVD. 10 out of 10!I also recommend: Fight Club, Dark City, Memento, Jin Roh, Ghost In The Shell, Akira, Vanilla Sky, Ghost Dog: Way Of The Samurai, The Ninth Gate, Rosemary's Baby, Reservoir Dogs, and Zero Effect</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exquisite, hallucinatory exposition on time travel and teen angst.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A near-perfect gem. Almost every frame of this brooding, beautiful film is to be treasured. First-time filmmakers should take notes - this is easily one of the most ambitious and original debut feature films I've seen in a long time.For those exhausted with the cliches of the hackneyed time-travelling sub-genre, take courage. Richard Kelly crafts a meditation on the nature and time (and ultimately, what it means to be human) from this strange tale of teenaged, suburban malaise. The cast is uniformly excellent, particularly Jake Gylenhaal, whose Donnie Darko is a quietly smouldering adolescent inferno. As his dementia unfolds towards a casually messianic end, he discovers the redemptive properties of time travel, and the painful but exquisite beauty of a teenaged wasteland.Do yourself a favour and see this. For all of its narrative puzzles and headtrip stylistic flourishes, you won't be disappointed. Nor will you see a more original American film all year. Weird and absolutely glorious.</fullReview>

Donnie Darko is just.. special.I fear that people reading about this movie will properly choose not to see it as the plot sounds almost foolish - but man are they missing out on something.</fullReview>

I mean I laughed , I cried , I smiled . It was a movie that made you think... it wasn't one of the many that are out these days that throw the plot right out in your face ... you had to think . And i love that . Donnie couldn't have been portrayed by a better actor ... I mean this movie is surely ONE of the BEST . And there is nothing i can write here that can summarize the greatness of this movie . All I can write to the reader is , " If you enjoy watching a great film with great characters . And have something much more than a simple mind . Than watch this film . " Not that the simple minded wouldnt ENJOY this film ...they just may not GET IT : )</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie like a dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Donnie Darko yesterday at the '18e Festival van de Fantastische Film' in Amsterdam and I am glad I did! Movies like this one are too rare in this world, although it fits in the 'mind screw' movie trend of the last few years. (see Memento, Usual Suspects, Sixth Sense, The Others)Not everything immediately makes sense after viewing, and maybe it never will, but that doesn't matter at all. The movie is like a dream. Scenes seem to melt into one another and there's this constant feeling of hidden meaning and symbolism. The sound effects, the music, clever use of slow-mo and minimal but good digital effects draw you into the twisted world of Donnie, played perfectly by Jake Gyllenhaal. The movie is a lot funnier than you might expect, there were a lot of giggling viewers and at least 4 laughing-out-loud moments! In the movie, every character has its place and is developed well. Donnie's family, his friends, his teachers... they all form his weird but believable universe. I predict that Jena Malone (Donnie's girlfriend Gretchen) and Jake Gyllenhaal himself will have a glorious future in the world of film. This movie is a mix of the dreamy teenage melancholy of 'The Virgin Suicides', the psychological terror of 'Jacob's Ladder', the criticism on American society of 'American Beauty' and the complex plot structure of 'Memento'. And then to realize this is a DEBUT of writer/director Richard Kelly! I can't wait for future projects of this guy.The applause at the end of the film wasn't precisely impressive, but what do you expect with an ending like that...10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko"- a beautiful, haunting film. Although the ending leaves the entire experience open to interpretation, the journey through the film itself is what's important. I wanted to hold Donnie, and tell him it would be all right. But Donnie would be gone before my arms could close around him, even though I could feel him against me. Darkly illuminating. Terrifyingly warm. Hopefully fearful. Dark, Darkest, Darko.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is by no means a perfect film, but it is engaging and thought-provoking. it also spends a lot of time on character development, so you actually grow to empathize with the characters--unusual for a sci-fi film.to fully understand the film, you should go to the film's official website after seeing it. particularly helpful are the excepts from "the philosophy of time travel. the film certainly still works without any extra information, but it works better if you know what was in the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really quite enjoyed this. Ive never scene a movie that didnt try to fit into a genre like this before. theres elemenst of fantasy, sci-fi, horror, comedy, drama, satire, hell simply because the tears for fear song and cover were placed so well I'll points for a musical! One might think it would turn out to be a mess, but it pulls it off.Flawed? Well there were some. The bully's, for example. Or the amount of time on drew barrymores character.I heard some people complain about the poorly represted wormholes, but this is a fantasy and it would have slowed down the movie as well as lessen that fantasy element to further go into the techniqualitys.My only complaint is that where there is some level of interpretation to it i think that the director should have left it to the viewer. I liked the movie enough to sit through the director's commentary track. Kubrick wouldnt talk about 2001, and you dont see lynch explaining his movies. Oh well, next time i'll just avoid the commentary. Anyway, i guess its his choice.great movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i can't quite understand how someone could see this film, and not get quite a buz. there's a lot to get. i don't agree that there's nothing behind the plot - or that it doesn't hold ground to its own ideas. it belongs to that area of 'gilbert grape' and 'welcome to the dollhouse' cinema. sure there's always more ambiance to feel, but i can't help think that most of what r. kelly wanted to convey to the world got said. or at least eluded to. there's something about the gen-x's that's being birthed in cinema and here's a good example of that birth. anyone see 'series 7' ? Donnie Darko's social commentary is more subtle, but just as right on. between the choice of two extremes, art lies somewhere in the middle. and that's about as much hope as any one can ask for.</fullReview>

This is a horrifying and disturbing film yet it is very funny and has a sound track that doesn't seem like it should fit although it does and it does that really really well, who'd have thought 80's bands would sound so good?Donnie Darko is an intelligent, sex driven, depressed and yet at times very normal student who is haunted by visions of a deep spoken bunny rabbit. It sounds childish but it is really chilling.High school films are generally cheesy funny films but this is a seriously dark film that is like many many films in some aspects but unique for its storyline.Go out and see this film, right now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually don't buy DVDs on a whim, but I was out shopping a couple days ago and decided to go on a dvd spree. Bought 5 total, Donnie Darko being one of them, I had seen a preview on a rental a week before. I wish I had got to see this in the theater. Sorry to rant but i'm sick of hollywood's hype of these poor quality films lately, lacking in not only talent but suspense and surprise. I haven't seen a "truly magnificent" movie since... well ok I liked Memento, but not nearly as much as Darko. Hopefully this movie will break this "the media likes it so i'll like it too" mold. *end rant*Now that that's out of the way, this film had every sense in me on a frenzy. The cast was superb, the plot was original, although i must admit it felt like Final Destination meets Carrie toward the middle of the film, but the ending... WOW! was all i could say. I hadn't viewed an ending that shocking since The Sixth Sense, and since that movie it seems movie ending have taken a downward slope to downright predictable (*COUGH* Domestic Disturbance *COUGH*) The writers did a tremendous job of keeping a grip on the viewer throughout the movie. It felt like a racehorse chasing a rabbit.... oh yeah, that brings me to the demonic bunny. What can i say, other than I want to be Frank for Halloween!This film makes me wonder about why it wasn't hyped at all, I never saw a trailer, commercial.. nothing, except when it went to video. Maybe the screeners chose the wrong demographic to show the film to? Especially with a cast this star studded. Jake Gyllenhaal of October Sky fame was on the mark with his character, he reminded me of the Ricky Fitts character in American Beauty.. 'nuff said. Patrick Swayze plays the pretty boy self-help dork I always saw him as :P Drew Barrymore played an excellent "teacher you always wanted" in that she didn't teach by the book, she wanted to expand the mind. Jena Malone (Cheaters) plays the "new girl" love interest to Donnie.This movie has become an instant classic, and is at the top of my never-ending DVD rack, I suggest you see it, and tell your friends you saw it, and tell them to see it... and so on... Or you could just show up at their doorstep in a demonic bunny costume :)</fullReview>

What can go wrong with that? Also, Jake Gyllenhaal (who played Homer Hickam in October Sky, another good movie) did a great job playing a totally messed up teen with visions (especially when he talks about Married with Children).

		<shortDescription>great movie, confusing ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a great film. It's filled with interesting characters(how can you hate a film with a six foot rabbit), snappy dialogue(Smurfs.) and a mind bending story. However, the first time I saw it I was extremely confused about the end. I still liked the film but could not figure out just what the hell happened (I know for a fact I'm not the only one). So, when it came to video I rented the DVD and watched it 3 times, twice with commentary, and I believe I have finally figured it out. So if you wish to know more read on, if not go rent the film, and then read on.****************SPOILERS*********************There is a tear in the time space continum and a parallel universe is created. This happens sometime around when the clock strikes 12 before the engine first falls through Donnie's roof. However, this universe is unstable and will collapse in one month. So god(or some higher power) sends Frank the rabbit down to be a messenger, for Donnie has been chosen to save the world. Donnie even possesses superpowers when he sleepwalks(thats how he got the axe on top of the dog's head)and the storm that forms at the end of the film was created by Donnie himself. All the things Frank tells Donnie to do has relevance, The burning of the house is to insure that his mother's plane is at the right location at the right time so that Donnie may rip off the engine, thus creating a portal through time, and send every one from that parallel universe back to the first one before it collapses. At the end when the characters lie awake at night it is because thay have fait memories from their existence in the other life. The death of Donnie's girlfriend is insurance on the part of god, to make sure he in deed goes through with it.If you did not get this from the film, I don't blame you. It took me 4 viewing to understand. But don't take myword on it, watch the commentary for yourself.If you have any different theories though, I'd definately like to hear them.</fullReview>

It's a got a part to it that resembles teen angst and makes me laugh to think I like it 'cause that's a while ago. But, as a whole, this movie touches multiple levels at the same time. It's not just Donnie, I mean it is, but it goes much deeper than this. All I'll say is that this is one of the best modern movies I've seen in a long time. In an age when a movie is based on how extreme it is, this manages to be effective on pure emotion. There's one gimick in it that rubs me the wrong way, but I'm sure once I see it a few more times, I'll understand why it was used. "11 out of 10" I'd give this movie if it was possible.</fullReview>

He sees a vision of a large rabbit, who starts convincing him to awful things, and has eerie predictions. Donnie begins to speak his mind, regardless of who it hurts. This was the most bizzare movie in years. It's American Beauty meets The Twlight Zone. Jake Gyllnhaal brings the Donnie Darko to life. When the cameras start rolling he is Donnie. He was really good. The lovely Jena Malone(best remembered from Stepmom) is also good has Donnie's love interest. She is a very descent actress. And the rest of the cast do well also. This movie has a lot of surprises.

		<fullReview>I'll skip the obligatory preamble of how wonderful this movie was, and go to what I appreciated most: the nudges and hints the plot gave the viewer, almost as breadcrumbs to entice them further into Donnie's world. There were countless elements in the movie that suggested causality, or equality, or some sort of relationship without ever telling the viewer their exact role in the plot. I found that to be both refreshing and engaging. There were times when I thought that perhaps even the writer would not be able to explain the point of everything in the movie, but in the long run, it doesn't matter. This movie gives you something to experience and ponder rather than describing it blow-by-blow and resolving every loose thread in the plot. Even if one were to think that the writer had only loose control of the plot, the end result is the same -- wonderment, fascination, and an experience that will last far beyond the two hours of the movie's running time. Thanks for such a unique and fantastic movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko was awaited at the last Brussels Fantasy, Sci-Fi and Thriller Festival this year, as one of the "must see". Recommended by Robert Englund (member of the jury), it revealed to be one of the top movies of the Festival, with Avalon and Ghosts of Mars. I was really surprised with the high quality of the story, as for me, stories about deranged teenagers or usual psychotics are mostly boring or not based on medical facts. Donnie's character is clearly out of space but most of all out of time. The world is weird and Donnie is not at his place. And that makes this movie something that has its own place in every fan of unconventional and poetic movies. And for those who think that Donnie Darko ain't frightening, just imagine how you would feel if a shrink tells you that your son has an invisible 6-feet tall rabbit as best friend, at 16 year old....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some films like "Mulholland Drive," that confuse you, and irritate you. In the end, you sense that they are just incoherent and stupid, thus you dislike them. Donnie Darko confused the hell out of me and I loved it! I like the music, the cinematography, the performances, the direction, everything. The movie challenges you and you don't mind, because you know that there is a greater meaning there. Unlike the typical David Lynch garbage.I understand that this was the first film made by this director and I believe that. I have always felt that Directors tend to have all of their heart and soul into that first film, usually because they have been writing and modifying it their whole lives. They hold on to it and refuse to let anybody else have it, like a first child. I know that was true with Singleton's "Boyz n the Hood" and Anderson's "Boogie Nights."Be advised that this film is confusing and you might have to watch it a few times, ala "Memento." Moreover, don't be shocked when you find yourself picking up new things each time and enjoying it even more. However, don't think that this will help clarify matters, it hasn't helped me much. But I still love it! Don't get me wrong, I understood about 95% of the film, however the very last 5% just put me in a tailspin.The story deals with every aspect of genre. There is romance, horror, drama, comedy, mystery and science fiction. I guess what I respect so much about the film is just how much thought and effort went in to it. It is a very ambitious movie. Which begs the question, why was it not a bigger hit?I will watch it again and someday, possibly understand it fully. Well, I did understand most of it and then the ending just threw me. Oh well, the answers are out there and I will keep looking for them, and enjoy doing so. **** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" is that rare of things: a film that invites deep thoughts to ponder over its presented ideas. Jake Gyllenhall (mark my words, he is the next Edward Norton) is the critical center of the film and it is completely on his shoulders as to the tone and success of the film. He does not falter once, turning in a performance that is both comic and chilling. I cannot praise this film enough! In 1999 we had Fight Club, the breathtakingly brilliant and underpraised film that will gain its proper audience in years to come. Now, in 2001 we have Donnie Darko which if all is right and fair in this world, will gain the cult following it so rightly deserves. This is a film that you do not watch - you experience and let rattle around in your head for days afterward, asking yourself "Is that what that meant?", "Did this mean that?" It's a delight when a film actually toys with you and makes you think rather than deadening the emotions and assaulting you with vapid content (any Michael Bay movie). I loved Donnie Darko. And if you truly love films, you will too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What this movie essentially breaks down to is "Drew Barrymore" executive producer. From here on out you're at fault for renting or viewing this movie with that knowledge. Her talents for choosing a movie to produce may perhaps transcend in the field of utterly moronic, horrible writing and loosely tied together plot of this movie. The movie is the concoction of a after school screenwriter corp. given a hefty budget and a bag of weed, and my friends, the weed does not connotate anything deep or mildly abstract in the way of higher enlightenment. This movie is a montage of asinine one liners and badly tied together "hints". I literally felt as if someone had tapped into my spinal cord and drained out the bone marrow during the course of the "movie". This is a indi movie, my friends, yes, except no one told it, it had a mildly big budget, decent actors, and a mildly big budget bad script. Who is Richard Kelly related to, who lost the bet? Was this some sort of costly "what if" gag set askew by Drew Barrymore walking in mid joke and thinking it was a great idea? Did I mention Drew Barrymore attempt at being a serious actor is about as futile as Stephen Hawkings dunking on Shaq. The movie does have some highlights, though, I think we'll have to wait for a directors cut to see them, wait, no, Richard Kelly directed it also, nevermind. If someone tries to intrigue you into a conversation about how deep and original this movie is, know this person's gene pool has traces of urine, and or knows squat about movies. Though this one should really strike well for the high school Goth crowd who now have new variations on the word Dark (Darko) to work with. Finally the Crow costumes will stay in their closet for one Halloween. To everyone of you who met with the distaste of viewing this atrocity, join me in a minor class action suit, which will go towards helping Patrick Swayze get a decent role with whatever the minute settlement will amount to, and if there's anything left over, someone to slap some sense into Drew Barrymore that not all her characters are to be the same. It's not the same person different variable dollface.to sum up, this movie was bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A choppin' great directorial/writing debut by Senior Richard Kelly. This is what Hollywood should be pumping out all the time rather than the unceasing flow of hyped-up war "dramas" that it currently markets. It's a fascinating story that's horrendously off center (which is good) but this movie is constructed so that it not only appeals to real film lovers that are accustomed to and/or even enjoy cinematic indifference to normality, but it appeals to people who like dumb movies so that even they could like it! It widens the audience and keeps the... off centered-ness... It's quite enjoyable! Jake whatever his last name is gives a fine performance of a teenage boy who talks to an imaginary bunny rabbit named Frank. See it see it see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most unique and moving directorial debuts since Sam Mendes with American Beauty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first film for Richard Kelly this is a very original screenplay about a young man played by Jake Gyllenhall who although very intelligent also mentally unstable. At first glimpse of this movie you see the distraught and confused awakening of Donnie Darko. He is forced to visit with a psychiatrist by his parents. The mother has a little bit of her son in her, smart and not afraid to provide a sarcastic comment here or there. The father is basically normal, interested in his job and politics but snickers at most swear words said by his children. Sibling rivalry exists between Donnie and His sister (actual brother or sister), which doesn't seem all that realistic but it doesn't really hurt the film. One night after having arguments with the family Donnie is woken by a large bunny named Frank. He is engrossed by the rabbit to a golf course where he has a conversation with him and as the story progresses keeps coming to him. Frank starts to tell Donnie to commit crimes and Donnie does all of the things Frank Tells him.What i thought the most interesting part of this movie was the real vision of the human mind and the thought of being happy. Although you walk away confused, happy, sad, mad or whatever you may feel it does change you. Some might speculate on the end for quite some time because, it doesn't really provide much closure of any kind and doesn't clearly show what Donnie wants. I gave it a 8/10 for its rare tenderness and vision of reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an amazing film! Beautiful and frightening, funny and sad and deep all at the same time. Terrific performances, a haunting score, and most instrumentally, a thoroughly original storyline that blooms into multiple interpretations before your eyes. It's had a slow time making it into the public's consciousness but this film will undoubtedly become a major cult classic of the same stature as BLUE VELVET or BEING JOHN MALKOVICH. Kudos to all involved. I can't get that wonderfully icy cover of Tears for Fears's MAD WORLD out of my head! DON'T MISS THIS FILM.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is easily one of the most eloquently quirky movies I have ever seen. An emotional hodgepodge of ideas and feelings and characters - it's as if director Kelly emptied his whole soul into the work. (I just hope that he's got some more magic in him.)I watched this film in my apartment on DVD knowing absolutely nothing about it. The lady at the rental store actually laughed at me (she kept plugging Training Day). And so, the movie opened with strange twist after twist for which I was hardly prepared. (The cover art makes the film look like a teen slasher movie.) But after the first 20 minutes I was hooked.There is a very fragile voice (Kelly wrote it too) in the subtext of the film that is extremely unique. Clearly a movie for a new generation, perhaps? There are plenty of elements for an older audience (Patrick Swayze is hilarious - his performance initially reminded me of Tom Cruise's character in Magnolia), but the heart of the movie is a dark, bitter pill that some may find difficult to swallow. Without giving too much away, the film reveals a science fiction backbone (which I found completely absorbing), but nicely ties up every tiny piece of the story. Not everything is clearly answered, but I prefer movies that simply leave footprints instead of stamping it all over your face.Not to cliche such an original piece of filmmaking, but to the curious - I'd pitch this as American Beauty (with the loopy, troubled, and tragically memorable characters) meets The Virgin Suicides / Groundhog Day. If that's possible.The music was fantastic, Kelly's style is like Diet David Fincher, and the performances (especially lead Kyle Gyllenhall's) were nothing short of inspiring.Hard to believe this film was made for less than the cost of an episode of "Friends." God bless Drew Barrymore for paying for this thing. (Never thought I'd say that.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very much an acquired taste; you will either love or hate it. It is not for everyone as it is a very dark and brooding film. I, if you hadn't guessed, loved it. It has many, many layers of subtext and I won't lie, it is somewhat hard to follow and the ending (not a spoiler) may very well leave you confused, as it is very open to interpretation. Thus it may require more than one viewing to get the complete picture of this film. It is extremely slow paced, though it is not a setback, it is not for those with a low attention span. It is a refreshingly original film, with a great musical score, while it is mostly very simple it fits well with the movie. Jake Gyllenhaal gives an absolutely astounding performance, which makes the movie worth watching alone. As does Mary McDonnell, who I found to be extremely likable. The rest of the cast also delivers great performances, though for the sake of time and space, I will not acknowledge individually, they are all nonetheless great.I find the realistic, yet ultimately satirical portrayal of the self-help guru subplot is a very interesting and great part of the movie. It pokes at the extremely self-righteous who are so easily brainwashed by anyone with a nice appearance and views that are so generalized that they can fit theirs that they become so involved and so impassioned by such fluff that it is absolutely nothing when it is subject to scrutiny. So much so, that you may be angered by how easy it is to generalize ideals, package them, sell them, and get inordinate amounts of money off of the weak (isn't that right phone-in psychics?).This movie is a dark and evocative masterpiece. Interestingly, it is not exactly possible to be justly classified, as it is very transcendent genre-wise. One minute it is a gothic romance, the next a teen coming-of-age story, the next a twisted psychological drama, then a time-travel sci-fi thought maker, then a family drama, and then back again. I highly recommend this movie to any movie lover or anyone interested in broadening one's horizons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This might be the best movie I've ever seen and I've seen the best. Every film I've seen since Donnie Darko has seemed small and insignificant. Next to the questions about existence raised in this picture, paired with the astonishing directness and clarity with which they are raised, a film like Fight Club or American Beauty just seems to be beating around the bush. If you watched it and don't get it, don't sweat it. Put the film out of your mind for a year, then go back and watch it again. If you still don't love it then, come back to it in five years. This is THE film of my generation thus far. The first motion picture of significance to come from a young director since Aronofsky's Pi. I love being entertained just as much as the next guy, but there's nothing I love more than having the existentialist side of my brain courted with such passion and creativity. Listen to the cast and crew commentary on the DVD...much different from the usual "I'm about to fall asleep" commentary we get on many DVDs.Just trust a fellow film enthusiast on this one. If you don't love it now, give this movie time. In our self-help, apathetic, Oprah-worshipping day and age, Donnie Darko is going to become more and more relevant. Personally (excuse all the hyperbole) this movie is going to loom large over my entire writing career. The bar has been set.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What in the world or out of this world was that all about? I like to think of myself as a semi-intelligent man but give me a break?I was really intrigued by this movie. I had not really heard much about it except from the people that submit their comments on here. Most of them gave very good reviews. Then I saw who was in the movie: Jake Gyllenhaal who was wonderful in October Sky, Mary McDonnell of Dances with Wolves fame, , James Duvall from GO!, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore (who also produced). Wow! The story from what I could gather was a kind of thriller, mystery, fantasy, sci-fi kinda thing? and it is. Just don't ask me what it was about. I'll admit, it had me hooked from the get go. You've got people waking up in strange locations, things falling from the sky, a weird old lady that you just know has something to do with what's going on and one creepy nightmare bunny rabbit thing that seems to be orchestrating the whole thing. Ok, good so far. You've got some great special effects, a cool eighty's sound track, intriguing characters. Getting better by the second. And you got this story that seems to be unraveling painfully slowly but you like it that way because you really want know and understand why: did that stuff happen towards the beginning and who or what is the thing that we've been seeing for the last hour and a half?? ? I'll just bet that old lady knows!?. Ok, Now I'm really hooked.I like lima beans. Do you like lima beans? I know they have nothing to do with this movie or my comments about this movie but that's as far as I CAN comment because I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MOVIE WAS ABOUT! Strangely enough I still feel like I should like this movie. I don't know why. But I do. Perhaps I'm going mad. Please, please, please, if somebody out there can tell me what in the world this movie was about I will be eternally grateful. Then perhaps I can sleep again at night?. Bottom line: If you liked ?Being John Malkovich' and you like being confused then you will may like this movie, however, this is a darker, dramatic movie. If that means anything. That's my take, What's yours?</fullReview>

Donnie Darko is a viewing experience that will be different for everyone. That's the real beauty of it. It's a story about people and the human condition, and how you react to what happens in the movie may say a lot about who you are as a person.See it for yourself, and watch it with an open mind. Don't worry so much about understanding it when it's all over. Focus more on how the film makes you feel. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

To me, the film was a neat wrap and explained everything nicely, nicer than one would expect. Donnie's obsession with time travel and portals is the map to the film's ending. And I think it asked the question "Are people who ask the real questions considered emotionally disturbed because they aren't pre-occupied with the nonsensical questions we're supposed to be concerned with" A few bouts with Quantum Physics won't hinder the viewer of this movie but the ending seems to follow the film's logic in an orderly fashion. Credit everyone involved from director to actors for delivering the tale with just the right heft and intention. Remember, what if you could go back and make everything beautiful...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of 2001, why did nobody see it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a fascinating, complex movie that you could easily walk right by in the video store. Don't. The packaging is ridiculous - the movie didn't garner much attention at the movie theater, so in order to boost video sales, they've made it look like a typical teen horror movie, complete with ubercheesy tagline - "Be Afraid Of The Dark."In reality, Donnie Darko is like what Rushmore would be if it were made by David Lynch. Set in October of 1988, for reasons I have yet to figure out, we have the protagonist, Donnie Darko, a suburban teenager who may be schizophrenic, or a time traveler. He receives messages from a man-sized demented rabbit named Frank, who tells him that there are 28 days, 6 hours, 48 minutes and 12 seconds (roughly) until the End Of The World.There is an inspired use of 80's hipster-pop songs, but this is done sparingly, to make the scenes more memorable. One that sticks out in my mind is the day after Donnie's house (more specifically, his room) meets with a strange fate, we see a surreal, slightly eerie montage of Donnie's private high school, shot in varying speeds, accompanied by Tears for Fears' "Head Over Heels".The characters are so undeniably nuanced that it should put American Beauty's one-dimensional family to shame. We're introduced to the Darko family at dinner, when the daughter announces that she's voting for Dukakis (remember, '88). From a normal movie, we'd expect the typical conflict between uptight suburban parents and liberal college-bound daughter. Instead, the parents pretty much shrug their shoulders,and the conversation denigrates into vulgar namecalling - which amuses the parents, not horrifying them. I wanted to peg them off the bat as "typical movie Republicans", real white bread, conformist conservative types. But the movie won't let you do that. Later on there's a scene where Donnie's mom sublimely puts down a heady school teacher who wants to ban a "controversial" book. But the effect is less of triumph than of a subtle tedium with the rest of the imbeciles in the PTA.The acting is superb and really makes the movie. Jake Gyllenhaal (sp?) has a big, open face that he uses to his advantage. He is totally believable as that most tiresome of movie stereotypes, the troubled genius. He really deserves to be a bigger star - he is very talented and I hope to see him in more movies like this one and less like Bubble Boy. He's a real cutie, too, in that antihero way that reminded me of Jason Schwartzman from Rushmore. The actress who plays his mother is amazing - it seemed like she was always holding back and I spent the entire movie really trying to figure her out.I don't think I totally know what the movie is eventually about, but I see it as a sort of demented "It's A Wonderful Life," where Jimmy Stewart finds out that the happy Bedford Falls is really a dream and that the world really would have been better if he hadn't been born. It's an odd sort of existentialist film, and I certainly could be wrong in my interpretation, but that was what I first thought of. The darkness of the theme made me gasp in its audacity.Maybe I'm biased. I can't help but love a movie in which Joy Division's "Love Will Tear Us Apart" is played in a sex scene. Beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a (gulp) great film. I hate to admit it but after the film was over and my life started again I couldn't help but to continue to have thoughts and feelings for all the characters. It's wise in how it treats all the people like people in the real world stuck in a movie, it helps us to really understand why these people do some of the things they do. However I grow tired of the whole MEANING OF thing, and the time travel thing was a leap, but it works. In order to enjoy this film you have to accept that there is a God and path you are meant to take, or like me, you have to let the fantasy of the movie take you in and let go of all rules. Most films won't let me forget reality because they aren't very good, this is a good film so I can. My problem and the ONLY thing in the film that keeps poking me is, well DONNIE. Donnie is a person who questions everything he's being taught and told. He reviews ANYTHING that is said to him, the movie goes so far as to have Donnie end a debate about the Smurfs. This made me wonder WHY in the middle of the movies, when Donnie could see his "path" before he took it, why didn't he try to avoid it and go in the opposite direction. They almost answer this question but the teacher stops the conversation when he says,"I can't talk about this anymore, I could lose my job." Which was true because another teacher loses her job due to her opened ways to the students.Donnie Darko wasn't the smartest film I've seen, but it's obvious it was VERY well directed, perhaps a little short and under explained at parts, great music, and amazing actors. I felt energy from a Todd Solodize or Paul Thomas Anderson film. Donnie Darko is a great film, that's really fun to watch, and maybe tries to be more meaningful and self-impressed than it actually is.DONNIE DARKO ***1/2 (out of ****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, humorous...ORIGINAL!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most films these days consists of recycled plots and stale characters. "Donnie Darko" takes immense exception. This film is dark and disturbing, yet hilarious at times. This is not just another cult movie that film-nuts can throw into their collection and keep secret to the average new-movie renter. It deserves to be seen by anyone because it is original. It truly is something new and unique. The concept of this film seems very uninteresting...A delusional teenager has visions of a giant scary-looking bunny rabbit who tells him to committ acts of violence. Please don't be turned off. Give "Donnie" a chance. You may not take a great life lesson from it, but if anything you will be entertained. The film offers some great original dialogue (including a conversation about the sexual nature of "Smurfette", the only "female" smurf in "The Smurfs" cartoon.) and some good old fashioned strange scenes. You don't have to be a Tarantino or David Lynch fanatic to enjoy this one. I'm sure the "cult" movie lovers will eat this film up, but it really is a sharp movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a film that you could see many times and not understand it. That is if you don't have problems. If you have seen this movie, but have never had emotional problems, then you will never really understand what the movie is actually about. Those of you that have emotional problems...you understand perfectly what I am saying. Donnie is a teen that is afraid of being alone.(I would be extremely surprised if you caught that the first time you saw the movie). Frank is another story. See the movie and maybe you'll figure it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Compelling Film, Under-marketed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got to see this last night. Living in Raleigh, NC basically means any movie that is cool, interesting or though provoking will never be released here...so when I read about this, then heard it wasn't coming here I knew this was something I would have to see. Picked it up on DVD last night and was blown away. This is another film in the Lynch, Fincher, PT Anderson vein. It will require multiple viewings to fully appreciate it but despite having seen it just once I can honestly say this film is an incredible work. The direction reminds me of PT Anderson which of course reminds me of older Altman and Scorcese...long tracking shots sync'd to music just so. The images are strange (ie, the rabbit and some of the sky shots)...and the pacing is Kubrick (title cards telling you the days of the month that progressively decrease in their duration: ie, Oct 2 followed by Oct 15 or something to that effect, then later it is like Oct 29, 6pm, Oct 29 8pm)...The advertising for this was almost as bad as Vanilla Sky's love story/Peter Gabriel crap...they portrayed this film as a horror movie about a giant rabbit. It is not. It is so much more meaningful touching on horror, sci fi, and themes explored in American Beauty. I had a small problem with Patrick Swayze as the self help guru. Since elements of the film reminded me of PT Anderson, Magnolia's Tom Cruise character came to mind everytime I saw Patrick trying to do his self help schtick. Thankfully he is such a minor character that this does not detract from the overall film. I am off to watch it again now with the director's commentary. FYI, for an added treat go to the website and take a head trip inside Donnie's mind...one of the coolest sites I have ever been on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to start. Coming into this movie with the plot outline I read really led me to a totally different place, but after seeing the movie I am thankful it went the way it did instead. It is truly amazing. I have not felt so in awe after a movie since Fight Club. It is just so beautiful. The camera shots, the scenery, everything is so beautiful. The mood is set so well. The plot is mind blowing, really really mind blowing. So much information to process, so many mysteries, so many thoughts it is hard to say anything but wow. I am lost in my chills and my hollow stomach, and I feel thoroughly satisfied. You can not watch this movie just once, it just wont let you. The experience watching this movie is one of the most gratifying experiences I have ever felt. I love this movie. There is nothing quite like it and probably wont be for a long time. 10/10 ...beautiful...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant and inspiring fresh film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko does what so many films try, but fail in today's cinema. Be fresh and original. From the opening scene when we are first introduced to Donnie waking up on a mountain road, to the ending sequence that doesn't quite answer all your questions, but gives you enough information to come up with your own conclusions the film just takes you in and manages to effectively involve the interest of the viewer. The is the freshman effort from newcomer writer/director Richard Kelly. One rarely expects such brilliance from a first time director, let alone screenwriter. Instead Kelly uses his lack of experience to produce a film with a completely different feel and sense of story from any other that this humble reviewer has ever seen. I look forward to much more great things from him. As far as the cast, well Jake Galynhaal as Donnie Darko, well lets just say I couldn't imagine anyone else taking this role. I'm so glad that Jason Shwartzman (originally up for the lead) ended up ditching this film for the lukewarm slackers just so Jake can grab the reins here. Also the part was originally intended for a younger actor around the age of 14 or 15 and although Jake is definitely not that young the film still works, because he manages to convey this form or youth and personality that while coming off quite young, I couldn't imagine a younger actor pulling off. The rest of the cast is fantastic and perfectly cast. I must say I love the beautiful Jenna Malone in this film. And for some reason Noah Whiley (while having a small role) really stands out in my mind. The score and soundtrack are perfect. The music used for this movie is all circa late 80's (the film takes place in 1988) and while I was about 8 or 9 when the film happens I found some great songs I remembered from my childhood along with some I've never heard of before but fell in love with instantly. Theres an establishing stylized scene towards the beginning of the film where they first introduce Donnies school all played to the song "Head Over Heals" by Tears for Fears. It is easily my favorite scene in the movie and I now LOVE that song. To sum things up, you MUST see and own this film (on DVD of course!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is dark, strange and flawed. The film plays more like an episode of The X-Files or The Outer Limits than anything else, with an interesting premise and story that is needlessly drawn out to full film length. Therefore, we get characters that are nominal to the story appearing only to add more screen time to the film. For instance, Drew Barrymore's and Patrick Swayze's characters are so irrelevant to the plot, their big name attraction only serves to deter from rather than help the plot of the film. Donnie Darko, played well by Jake Gyllenhaal, is a high school kid suffering from auditory and visual hallucinations, somnambulism, indifference, teenage angst, etc. In other words, he's a mess. He also has an invisible friend named Frank, a twisted-looking rabbit, who tells him at the beginning of the film that he has certain amount of days and time left before the world will end. He also commands Donnie to do certain deeds before that time, all of them involving illegal activities that I won't describe here. And then we have all the rest of the characters who seemingly exist only to provide as "fillers" in the film , neither helping nor adding anything of value to the core of the story. That's a shame, because the story itself is suspenseful, ominous and engaging. It's not a big-budget film, and I also liked that aspect of it. Still, Donnie Darko is not a bad film. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie darko was wonderful peice of film. It is my favorite movie of all time, along with the great movie Dancer texas, pop. 81. Go see it if you havent. Its with breckin myer.. Anyways, Donnie darko, (DD) is... I dont think there is truly any word that would do this film justice. All star cast, great cinematography. It focuses on the morals, of human beings, the angst of being a teenager, and schizophrenic. DD is great, and it is a shame why it did not have a bigger release, topped out by the so called "blockbusters" like.. Pearl harbor and monsters Inc. I didnt like any of them. Movies is on of my passions, and I know a truly awesome movie when I see it. This movie mixes black humour, drama, scifi, and great direction to meld it into a blend of everything you could possibly want in a movie, while making your skin crawl with its dark backrounds and awesome script. Other teen horror flicks such as soul survivors, urban legend among them, are put to shame by DD. A favorite quote, possibly the scariest and darkest and eeriest, is while Donnie and Frank are sitting next to each other, in a dark movie theatre. Donnie, with a crazy, mysterious look on his face, looking at the screen, says "Why do you wear that stupid bunny suit, frank?" And frank, in that horrific, calm, soft voice, says "Why do you wear that stupid man suit?" Whoa, that sent chills down my spine. GO SEE IT</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a wonderfully crafted film about a disturbed teen that is haunted by a giant, nightmarish bunny rabbit. Not exactly your run-of-the-mill plotline.I loved the dark tone and color palette, and I thought the story was rendered extremely well, especially considering the eclectic bunch of themes covered. Several big names appear (Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore, and Noah Wyle) but they were all supporting cast.If you're into teen angst, time travel, and the apocalyptic delusions of a hell-bent Easter bunny, then this is definitely the movie for you. Certainly worth your while. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film at the London Film Festival in November 2001 after noticing that it had a short theatrical run in the US. This generally spells straight to video in the UK and i had to see this on the cinema. I have to say that no other movie has provoked such strong feelings of emotion from me in my life. I watch many films, and i was beginning to feel that i was immune to the effect of the cinema. Boy was I wrong. This film reminds me of why i love movies and it invites me into the world in the film. I want to be part of it and know the characters. I have never known a film which can be happy and sad at he same time and the use of music accents the emotion in this film. I LOVE IT.

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of 2001.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon watching the trailer for "Donnie Darko", one expects another simpering, stupid teen horror flick. Upon actually seeing the film(which was very hard for me to do, given it's extremely limited release), it is a rare piece of film art! Next to "Mulholland Dr."(which I thought was the year's best film), "Donnie Darko" is one of the very best films of the year. It's completely original, exciting, funny, dark, scary, and above all, beautiful. It's a shame that this film wasted away in obscurity while idiotic pieces of drivel like "Pearl Harbor" and "The Fast and the Furious"(just to name a couple) scored. This is one of those rare films that leaves you with not only a lasting feeling of "wow, I never saw anything quite like that before!", but also deeply moves you and stays with you long after the end credits finish rolling. You've probably already have some idea of what "Donnie Darko" is about, so there's no need for me to analyze it. My review is meant to give my overall impression of the film. If you don't know anything about it, then see the film with an open mind and surrender yourself to it. The suprises and imaginativeness of the film will be even more fun and enthralling this way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish there were some comment that I could write here that would really do this film justice, but that simply isn't possible. It's rare that I see a film in the theater that makes me go through the range of emotions that I did with this film. But more than anything my predominant feeling about the film is jealousy: Richard Kelly has made the film that I would have made if I were a genius of his calibre. Why aren't there more movies like this being made today instead of the typical hollywood drivel that gets rave reviews? Donnie Darko is fun, strange, dark, and beautiful. A geek's sci-fi comedy romantic masterpiece. IOW, perfect.The film operates on many different levels but when you peel back the science fiction and dark comedic exterior you find a story about life, loneliness, and what's really beautiful in the world. At it's center it conveys a message similiar to the one hashed over so many times in movies like American Beauty, but with so much more style and essense. Perhaps it affects me especially because I was a child of the 80s... Or perhaps it's just a beautiful film that most people will probably never have the chance to see. It's a travesty that this movie hasn't had a wider release. But it certainly touched me, and is easily one of my favorite movies of all time. Thanks guys.Btw, the soundtrack rocked my lame ass. Joy Division, Tears for Fears, Duran Duran.. great stuff :-). And an incredible remake of Tears for Fears 'Mad World', which seems to in an odd way be the basis for the whole film..."And I find it kind of funny // I find it kind of sad // The dreams in which I'm dying // Are the best I've ever had"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"So do you believe in God now?" his therapist asks him. "Not if everyone dies alone," replies Donnie. Is each person ultimately alone? This movie takes you into the mind and heart of a person who has realized he's alone. Most movies take you to the other place, to the place where people are not alone, where the hero, facing dangers with courage, strong in the knowledge that in the end he will defeat the enemy and win the girl and be taken into the bosom of the community and loved and cared for and never be alone again. That's the fantasy we pay for, because real life is the opposite. In real life we are not the hero, we do not win true love, and the world does not take us into its bosom and care for us. Comments on the movie suggest this is about a schizophrenic teenager, but that is not actually what the movie says. His therapist says that, but as things unfold it is not clear whether Donnie is halucinating or seeing a deeper reality. In fact his visions seem to come when he takes his medicine (which he's being hounded to do), so maybe it's his medicine that's making him see things. But is it madness or something else? Quantum physics maybe?Well, that's a detail. Really it's the mystery of human existence: no one is inside our skin but us; reality is how we perceive it, human mythologies and science notwithstanding. How did that happen? Of all the horrors perpetrated upon living beings by God or the cosmos or whatever, what could be more horrible than to condemn each being to its own reality? Then again ... would could be more beautiful? When it's *your* time to die, do you want to be surrounded by those you love, by their pity and fear, be forced to comfort them as they contemplate their own inevitable end? Again in a session with his psychiatrist, Donnie tells her what happened with his pet dog. "It crawled under the porch," he says. "To die," states the therapist. "To be alone," says Donnie. The creation of a movie about that (at least that's what I thought it was about) seems very ambitious. Yet there are no vagaries, no discontinuities, no flashbacks or other trickery, and the story unfolds quite logically, at times with Donnie appearing demonic, at other times humorously, but always with an assortment of interesting characters that each fit into the plot like pieces of a puzzle. Wonderful acting by all the cast. Just think how far Drew Barrymore has come since ET. That's weird too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seriously flawed movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is being praised by critics and audience members alike. When I first heard about it I was very excited; it sounded as if it would be an off-beat and breathtakingly original film. But when I finally got the chance to see it I was extremely disappointed.The basic plot of Donnie Darko is very unique and there are some bizzare and original touches throughout. The overall execution,however, is, simply put, not very good.One of the most prominent flaws of Donnie Darko is its humour, an aspect of the film that, as far as I can tell, was designed to support and contribute to the strange atmosphere that the filmmkakers attempted to create. The humour, though, in my opinion, is terrible. It is, more often than not, juvenile and in no way, clever. For example, a scene that is supposed to be funny but fails miserably, is the dinner scene near the beginning where the humour is based around Donnie Darko and his sister swearing at each other. This type of comedy, which is often vulgar and which would be much more appropriate for the teen comedies released in recent years, characterizes much of the movie; it never becomes offensive but is just terribly unoriginal and completely lacking in wit.Another major flaw of Donnie Darko is that it falls into so many standard cinematic cliches. There is the horribly contrived aspect of the movie in which Donnie and his fellow classmates study a story in school that mirrors the themes and situations being developed within the film. There is nothing wrong with including a work of art in a movie that somehow connects to what is taking place on screen--in fact, it can sometimes be illuminating (in this case it is not)-- but in Donnie Darko, this is done in such a standard and unoriginal way; the classroom scenario has been done in countless other movies. Even more detrimental to the movie are the scenes that take place between Donnie Darko and his therapist. These scenes are sometimes laughably bad, especially when Donnie is hypnotized. But worse, these scenes utilize cliched and ridiculously silly psychobabble that so many movies employ. The psychological aspects of the film and of Donnie Darko's character are supposed to be extremely important to all that takes place; unfortunately, they are not developed properly at all during the scenes in which they should. These are just a few examples of the traps that Donnie Darko falls into.There are, admittedly, some parts of Donnie Darko that should be commended; the plot, for example, takes some interesting turns.However, the humour in this movie seems so out of place and and there are countless cliches that should have and could have been avoided. Because of these flaws, among others, Donnie Darko never achieves that off-beat and original atmosphere it seemed to want and ends up being a very disapointing experience.</fullReview>

If you have a brain that is capable of processing thought, and doesn't require a movie to completely spell out itself in simple terms, you will understand. You get out of it what you want. You can go many places with the interpretations of this movie, and that MAY require you looking beyond the surface a little. With movies like Vanilla Sky that make pathetic attempts at being a surreal feeling movie, its good to see something like Donnie Darko show how it is done (WITHOUT Cameron and Tommy).Josh</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Turning Point in Film History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no doubt that, like Velvet Underground's first record, this film will be more or less ignored on release and then, ten years from now, cited by most major filmmakers as a primary influence.Richard Kelly appears to have poured so much of his own heart and soul onto the screen, filtered through some type of madness, that the occasional rough spot and awkward silence only ads to the impact of your film experience -- you sort of cling to every tiny moment of mundane he gives you just the way that a person experiencing the type of madness poor Donnie Darko would do and then, bam, you realize you've been sucked in!And please ignore the reviews out there that say this film is about (a) a bunny rabbit, (b) time travel, (c) the end of the world. That is sort of like saying "Blue Velvet" is about a murder.... This movie is about being young, being confused, and being aware suddenly that you've got to put down that self-help book and find a way to actually connect to people (before you die).And, yech, I know this review isn't really doing the film justice -- I just hope I've intrigued you enough to go out and take a look at it.Okay, best wishes, Sondra</fullReview>

Jake Gyllenhaal did a perfect job of portraying Donnie Darko, a character everyone refers to as a wierd teenager, but I viewed him as a rather normal down to earth being with typical teenager problems, but only with the rather strange ones that begin happening to him, as if god it-self picked him out to fix a paradox in space-time(yeah, just see the movie).

Also during the scenes when the movie wasn't being to dark or unnatural it was filled with great dialogue and excellent acting from the entire cast. I only wish that this movie would have been able to reach a bigger audience so everyone could have some type of opinion on this movie. I think it could be viewed in so many different ways.

		<fullReview>This is one the worst films I have seen this year.The plot rambles on and on through the realms of banality and goes nowhere until the last twenty minutes then leaves you with a feeling of deja vu...Groundhog Day? X-files episode Monday?If you don't walk out of the cinema within the first hour, you will find that all the plot has been draped over a shamble of a film with some parts completely irrelevant, such as all the parts that Drew Barrymore plays, all the scenes with her in could have been deleted and the film would not suffer. Sorry Drew, this was not your best film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unless Hollywood is saving every single decent movie for release after Christmas, this is the best you're gonna get for year 2001. That's not faint praise, however: this movie delivers on so many levels it's hard not to like it. If there is an AMPAS god, may he (she) bestow Oscars to Jake Gyllenhaal for Best Actor (he's that good), Richard Kelly for Best Director AND Best Original Screenplay (written at the age of 23, no less), and Best Picture to Donnie Darko...the only movie in 2001 to make me laugh, cry, and jog my intellect. In a word: WOW.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing cross-genre debut that combines recent favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film really gets inside of you and stays with you after you leave the theater. You'll find yourself lying in bed at night thinking about it, for many reasons. One, because it tackles MANY issues, some biggies too - time travel, destiny, and the existence of God. It's hard not to be challenged by this film. And two, because it is extremely confusing the first time you see it. I don't think you can make a fair judgement on this film until you've seen it at least twice. It is often compared to films such as "Rushmore" and "Fight Club" and most often "American Beauty," which was my favorite film until I saw "Donnie Darko." I feel that Donnie Darko succeeds where American Beauty did not. Don't get me wrong, I love AB, but all the characters except Lester and Ricky seemed one-dimensional, a little superficial, a little cliche. Here in DD we have a large cast and we delve into the characters more personally. DD is quite ambitious, however, and in its attempt to cover all basis, we do feel our minds a little stretched and in some cases a little let down because it does try to do too much. However I can put that aside in relation to what it DOES accomplish, and in such a beautiful and imaginative way. Go into it with an open mind and listen to every word. The soundtrack, comprised of 80s classics, is engaging, combining "Tears for Fears" and "George Michael" favorites. There is a remake of "Mad World" by Gary Jules (originally by "Tears for Fears") that is just absolutely captivating. An incredible sequence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to relieve my aching bladder about 20 minutes ago, i was in the bathroom of a movie theater and Donnie Darko had just ended. This girl in the stall next to me was yabbering to her friend, "Oh, that movie was So Good!! It was like a.... um... (thinking 'really hard' here for something profound).. dark, twisted American Beauty!"My, my. How profound. Always good to impress your friends by repeating what all the critics are saying.I enjoyed Donnie Darko, but I'm not sure it just wasn't because I got to stare at Jake G____ for two hours. (yum) A lot of the effects used were kinda schlocky, and the ending made you think the director wanted it to be one of those movies where something big and crazy happens and the audience leaves with their lifes changed and ready to save the world. (American Beauty?) But it wasn't like that.. the plot was really contrived at times, and you're not sure what the director's trying to say with all of it.It just seems like a real shame that Richard Kelly had to mix all the supergood character-interaction scenes that he is obviously good at with a gargantuan plot attempt that was just way out of the movie's reach. Cheers to the director on the dementia stuff, though. See this movie, watch it for the dialogue, watch it for the 80s references, close your eyes at the Drew Barrymore parts (ick) and watch Jake Gwhatever rock the house with his believable acting and unbelievable hotness. I'm off to buy Bubble Boy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko isn't the kind of movie I can explain with great clarity to people when asked what it's about, so I am not going to even begin to explain or spoil it here, but it was definitely worthy of my money.I had the privilege to watch this Film this weekend in Las Angeles. Lately my good movie watching streak has been amazing, such as Mullholand Drive and some rented DVDs I'd been meaning to rent for a while. Donnie Darko is like the dessert for a whole week. I really appreciated the multi-level angle this movie was going for and accomplished with astonishing talent.

		<fullReview>Jake Gyllenhaal deserves an Oscar nomination for his understated work in this truly original movie. I also thought Holmes Osborne, Mary McDonnell, and Katherine Ross were excellent. The writer/director is obviously a major new talent and I thought Donnie Darko was intriguing and thought-provoking, while others seemed to have found it mystifying and confusing. (Don't listen to them!) The blending of genres into something brand new was exciting and I can't recommend this movie more strongly. Some weak supporting performances (Drew Barrymore especially) don't do much to detract from the film's merits. Along with Our Song and Hedwig &amp; the Angry Inch, this is at the top of my list of the best films of the year. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ONLY MINOR FLAWS IN THIS ORIGINAL GEM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE BULLET AND THE BOTTOM LINE - this is the usual run-of-the-mill boy meets girl, boy falls for girl, boy introduces girl to his imaginary 6 foot tall evil rabbit buddy with a metallic skull-like mask. As if making it in the world of the late 80's American zeitgeist while dealing with girls and evil rabbits weren't enough, he also has to deal with self-help gurus, terrorist classmates and seeing Katherine Ross as a middle aged therapist ("middle-aged" being a polite term for frightfully older). DONNIE DARKO is a film that will have trouble finding an audience because it challenges them with both a mentally disturbed protagonist and the big boogieman of studio zipperheads - the ambiguous ending ("...audience because it challenges them..." being a polite way to suggest that fans of "Touched By An Angel" are likely to be confused by it). DARKO is a thought provoking film that joins MEMENTO on the too short list of smart and entertaining films released this year.What's new about this story, besides the Harvey-as-the-Terminator, is that writer and director Richard Kelly sets DARKO in the last months of the Reagan Era, October 1988. George Bush (the original, not the sequel) is seen making some later to be embarrassing debate statements about his good friend Manuel in Panama who couldn't possibly be involved with drugs and money laundering. While it does have the de rigueur period soundtrack and cultural icon references, Kelly does his best to keep them in the background. So, even though Tears For Fears provides the music for a montage and the now forgotten children's game of Hungry, Hungry Hippos is the punchline to a therapy session, the kids attend a private school that thus keeps the clothes and hairstyles subdued. In fact, probably the most remarkable thing about DARKO is how tightly Kelly keeps both the overall tone and his protagonist's performance reined in to maintain a restrained quality to them.The Donnie Darko of DONNIE DARKO is very much, without-a-doubt slipping into dementia. There are no coy games being played here as in K-PAX of whether or not Donnie is seeing the things he thinks he is seeing. By not giving in to the Hollywood impulse of having the mentally disturbed character either capable of incredible human insight that has him tossing off bon mots of wisdom or a cute crackpot who says funny nonsensical non sequiturs, DARKO allows for something much more human. And unpredictable, which becomes the source of DARKO's tension. As likeable as Donnie is, there is always the foreboding sense that he is liable to really go off the deep end any moment. Given the countdown gimmick in the film, it is inevitable that something is going to happen. Which is to say, Kelly has a lot riding on the actor inhabiting the title character.Seldom do performances deserve the heaps of praise they are swathed with, the part being so showy that the appraisers confuse the uniqueness of the character with the gifts of the actor (Dustin Hoffman in RAINMAN or Al Pacino in SCENT OF A WOMAN just to name two Academy Award winning ham-fests). This has less to do with the actual performance than the reviewers desire to be the one to find the "next Brando." Much harder to appreciate is the skill to pull off a nuanced character who manages to emote on a broad range with subtle shadings. Being able to do this while portraying a mentally disturbed boy without resorting to scenery-chewing histrionics is a rare feat and Jake Gyllenhaal should be on the very very short list of noteworthy performances this year for doing it. Two years ago he showed his chops in his first starring role in OCTOBER SKY and DARKO confirms that that performance was no lucky fluke. If the part was bigger, Drew Barrymore would also deserve any awards she will probably garner for what is arguably her first real adult role of the English teacher Ms. Pomeroy.The young-bold-teacher-with-radical-new-ideas is not exactly a cinema first, but Barrymore plays it so completely free of inappropriately ennobling tics that it seems fresh. It's not so much the part but that it is Barrymore playing it that the surprise here. Another former child actress moving to older parts is Jena Malone, most recognizable from STEPMOM. As the love interest, she does a lot with the little time Kelly allows for her. Looking down the road, it is easy to see Malone segueing to leading lady roles. This is not to suggest that the rest of the cast is dogmeat for all do more than well enough. One of the few stumbles that Kelly makes is Kittie Farmer (Beth Grant) a preachy teacher and book banner who is at first blush a cliché. At one point she wears a very 80's religiously sloganed t-shirt. But surrounded by such unique characters Farmer comes across like people who do in fact act like clichés.A lot of the film's strength comes from the fact that these characters surrounding Donnie are given a real human depth, most notably the Darko parents who are given the rare-for-fictional-parents facet of unique senses of humor. Unlike other Hollywood worlds where the parents are portrayed as the likely source of a disturbed child's mental illness, the Darkos are seen as real people doing what they can to help their son. There's a pathos to this depiction of the realistic randomness of dementia. All of which goes towards making DONNIE DARKO one of the original gems of filmmaking to come out this year. It is not a perfect film, having an awkward third act deus ex machina and developments that hint too strongly towards a supernaturalism that is out of place. But these are minor complaints for such a unique film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Throughout the film, you can see many of Kelly's influences (like "E.T.", "American Beauty," "Alice In Wonderland" to name a few) and realize he does not simply subject the viewer to one school of film. He presents his philosophical/spiritual/political views and asks for viewers to bring theirs to the table as well. The ending is not "neat", meaning viewers are left to sythesize and delve into themselves rather than relying on a nice/neat Hollywood-style ending to do it. If you are looking for "simple and easy" and completely Hollywood, DO NOT see this movie. However, if you want to view something worth while, something that will leave you to ponder your own philosophies, something that is truly Smart and Rare, "Donnie Darko" is the film to see :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With movies like Corky Romano, 13 Ghosts, and On the Line hogging all the theatre spots (at least in my sorry excuse for a city), Donnie Darko was a very welcome change of pace.I won't get into the details of the plot, as you can read other reviewers comments, but I will however point out a couple details that others got wrong...Number One - Time Travel is NOT a subplot. This is the point of the whole movie. Everything that happens in this movie revolves around time travel. (Except for the quite entertaining conversation about Smurfs maybe...)Number Two - The rabbit is neither satanic nor is it six feet tall.Okay, now that that is out of the way...You will enjoy this movie if you are not an idiot... Wether you put in the effort to figure out the whole time travel thing or just sit back and enjoy the characters and dark noir ambience.For those who enjoy fluff -- go see N'Sync attempt an acting career.For those who have taste -- go see one of the very few worthwhile movies of the year. (This one and Mullholland Drive...)P.S. If you are having trouble understanding the time travel stuff, check out the film's official site where you can read some excerpts out of the "Philosophy of Time Travel" book in the movie. It pretty much ties the whole plot together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nearly Useless Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is an emotionally disturbed teenage boy in a mildly dysfunctional upper-middle class family. He is pursued by an imaginary "friend", Frank (someone in a bunny suit with a metallized head), who disturbs his sleep (and soon, his waking hours) to commit acts of mayhem in preparation for a mysterious "end" which is coming in 30 days. Donnie also haps into an interest in time-travel, as he begins to visualize wormholes opening up out of people's chests. The film (and Donnie) bundles along toward an supposedly apocalytpic end, though without revealing anything deeper in the characters, their relationships to each other, or anything resembling an emotion which rings true, with the exception of self-sacrifice. Ridiculous (as in, inviting ridicule) elements of the film include "bullies" at the upper middle class private school who wield knives -- a past-time which would typically invite discipline in the real world. The teenage boys are all cruel for cruelty's sake -- as evidenced by their frequent verbal assaults on people such self- absorbed kids would otherwise not notice. The interest in time- travel is gratuitous, and justifies itself circularly as a plot device, but has no deeper meaning for the film. At best, Donnie realizes redemption by committing his ultimate act of destruction, which is the seed of a creation -- an element foreshadowed early in the film. Nonetheless, a film which lays out its own interpretation within it -- common self-reference -- ain't much better than dull. The movie is a must-see for anyone closely following Jena Malone's career, and wondering what Ms. Barrymore is doing with her Flower Films shingle. After viewing, one might continue to follow Jena Malone's career, and to wonder what Ms. Barrymore is doing with her Flower Films shingle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is just the type of film that flies in the face of people who say such things like "That type of movie could never be made now." Controversial, if for no other reason than it's timing, Donnie Darko defies moviemaking reason. It's complicated, dark and by no means leaves you feeling any more comforted by the end.I think the beauty of this film is compounded by the fact that it's arrival was completely unheralded and so, therefore, I will be brief without thrashing out too much that might be considered 'hype' or a 'spoiler'. Director Kelly has sculpted this film with the same suburban veneer and buried menace that Lynch had in BLUE VELVET. Consider it this year's AMERICAN BEAUTY if the indie world dug it a few feet deeper and scraped all the shine off it.This film will haunt you...it's managed to be frightening, dramatic, but, seemingly more importantly, able to channel a sense of dis-ease and loneliness that has been hard to identify on film. You are at once sympathetic and adoring of the protagonist and, yet, find yourself completely afraid of what he might do next.Once again, in the wake of so many recent tragedies and the given anxiety of the culture, one wonders how this gem snuck through</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko is derivative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is? what? That's what the filmmakers want peopleto be asking each other. An air of mystery surrounds the adcampaign. Is Donnie Darko a troubled high school boy? Is he thedemonic, shadowy character depicted on the poster? Is he a hero,or a loser?Elements of all those things are in Donnie Darko, who ispersonified by Jake Gyllenhall ("October Sky"). Gyllenhall is thereal standout here, managing to portray this difficult, mostlyunlikable character with commendable depth. And "depth" is what this movie thinks it's all about. What liesbeneath the veneer of American suburbia? Donnie is in psychotherapy, and even though he takes medication he still hasdisturbing hallucinations involving "Frank", a big bunny-man wholooks like a cross between Harvey, the Jackalope, and Satan, andwho tells him the world will end in 28 days. Donnie's lacklusternew girlfriend, Gretchen (Jena Malone, "Stepmom"), is living undersome sort of witness protection program ("Gretchen" is not herreal name), hiding from her psychotic dad, who stabbed her momfour times in the chest. Donnie's clean-cut science teacher, Dr.Monnitoff (Noah Wylie, "A Few Good Men"), secretly believes intime travel, and the possibility of such via random wormholes. JimCunningham (Patrick Swayze, "The Green Dragon") is a freakishlyloving, kindly, and understanding self-help guru, whose fancymansion seems very out of place in the small, middleclass town.There are lots of interesting characters (and some not sointeresting due to underdevelopment) and the plot does raisesome thought-provoking questions. Too bad it answers them fartoo quickly. I saw the ending, which I imagine was supposed tohave major impact, coming almost right from the beginning (oneline of dialog could have been deleted to prevent this). I told myselfthat maybe it didn't matter, since this film is obviously intended forteenagers. But that's not fair; "talking down" to an audience isnever an excuse for not paying attention to detail. If this movie was intended to be your typical teen flick, I'd cut it a lotmore slack -- but the director (first-timer Richard Kelly, who alsowrote the screenplay) wants you to believe Donnie Darko is "thestory of Holden Caulfield, resurrected in 1988 by the spirit of PhillipK. Dick." Therefore, it must be held to a higher standard thanAmerican Pie 2.There seems to be no reason to set this film in the 1980's (exceptthat it's the era in which the director himself was a teen), and thereare lots of strange things with dates that don't pan out. The 28days thing, for example -- is that supposed to signify the menstrualperiod? After all, blood is spilt on the 28th day. It's never reallydefined, though.Although it claims to be very original, much of Donnie Darko isderivative. First there's the six-foot bunny following the maincharacter, which no one else can see; then there are absolutecopies of the water-creatures from "The Abyss" floating around;and there's the absurd, but oh-so-hip Tarantinoesque dialogsection, in which Donnie and his friends discuss whether or notSmurfette is getting it on with the other Smurfs.Photographed by Steven Poster (who won an ASC Award for hiswork on Ridley Scott's "Someone to Watch Over Me," and whosework is usually quite good), Donnie Darko is not only dark andharshly shadowed (Drew Barrymore, who plays an Englishteacher, looks like a ghoul in one bright sunlight / deep shadowscene), but there's also an awful, dull flatness to it all. One scene,apparently shot "day for night" is particularly bad.There are certain elements in Donnie Darko that work, and thereare some flashes of meaning here and there. Richard Kelly mightbe a director to watch for -- maybe Donnie Darko is just a roughdraft. But it's much too rough to be anything more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not My Cup of Tea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I'm in the minority here. I know that this movie is a cult classic and has gotten rave reviews; that's the reason I watched to begin with--well that and the fact I thought it was a time travel movie."Donnie Darko" was not my cup of tea. This is where I'm told I don't get it, it's too deep for me and then I'm called all kinds of pejoratives. This isn't the first movie that I opposed the majority on and it won't be the last.I saw a dramatic unfolding of the life of a mentally disturbed teenager. And it seemed that every character was formed through the lenses of said character. Everyone was odd. Comically odd. From Donnie Darko down to Cherita Chen. And characters like Cherita Chen seemed purposeless. If that's appealing then color me unimpressed.I know, this was a movie I didn't get and I'm fine with that. It was dark, the humor was strange, and in my opinion it lacked a true message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't really know what to expect with "Donnie Darko", but I'd had it be recommended to me a few times, so I decided it was a good idea to watch it! What a got was a really great sci-fi film that really stuck with me.It is a very well made film, with great acting, directing, etc., but it is more than just a well made film. There's something about the story, structure, and, overall, final product that is really twisted, disturbing, bizarre, and dark. Although at times it was a little light hearted and funny, it really has a big impact on the audience emotionally and psychologically, and some scenes are particularly intense and frightening.If I were to pick one flaw, I guess it'd be that the special effects looked fake at times, but it seems like they were the best the filmmakers could accomplish, considering cgi wasn't as developed in 2001 as it is now.I'd highly recommend this fantastic movie.</fullReview>

Perfect cast, directing special about the movie over and from all sides, creates strange situations here to there, the goal of the film gives a goalkeeper, old feeling reinforces this film.

		<fullReview>This movie was to me one of the best movies of 2001. And it's even in my top 30 all time / all genres movies. I must have seen it four or five times by now and I still enjoy it as it was the first time. I thought Jake Gyllenhaal played his role as the delusional Donnie Darko beautifully. You almost feel sorry for him during the whole movie even though you know the outcome after seeing the movie so many times. It still grips you to see the life of the struggling young guy and his imaginary friend Frank the evil crazy looking bunny. You might have to watch it twice to understand and appreciate Donnie Darko fully but it is certainly worth doing it. I will never get bored of this movie, that's a fact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko is a mind blowing tale of epic events.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon watching the first few minutes of this movie, I have to admit, I was really bored with it. However, for one to really appreciate the movie, one must go along with the progression of the movies plot and carefully understand what the situation is at any given point in the movie. In the beginning, Donnie Darko, is seen as a mysterious character, always evading his death. The viewer will see instances of where he arises from his sleep to meet with a strange figure in the form of a rabbit. The movie then gives us a time table of around 28 days for something significant to happen in relation with Donnie Darko. Only until the end of the movie, are we given a clearer picture of the plot. However, even after finishing this movie, one might decide to look up more about the movie as for many, it is not so quite clear what the movie was based around. I know I had to do this.</fullReview>

There is a constant struggle between fear and love and the lines are blurred in a way that makes the viewers think. Each plot development makes the story even more intricate and complex, but this movie is meant to be pondered and will take several viewings to be completely understood. The special effects in this movie add to the disorientation that it is supposed to convey. This movie deserves an 8/10 for being a very fresh view on bipolar disorders.

		<shortDescription>A very trippy ride.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie does a great job of getting you very focused on the curiosity the plot presents. For example, the ending showing the beginning scene of the movie playing out differently brings up two important questions. For one, did the events of the movie actually play out or were they just the result of Donnie's "mental illness". The second question that comes to mind would be the specific problems that Donnie's mental illness present. As it's never specified throughout the movie what it actually is and what it does to him also is never actually specified, just heavily hinted at through strange and unusual imagery. The characters are well done enough to serve their purpose, which is to further the story and more or less guide Donnie along his path. Donnie's actor portrays the character well, fitting the appearance required to be this awkward yet strong willed teenager. In conclusion, I believe this movie deserves a 9 out of 10 of being so capable of drawing in New viewers while also being entertaining for people who have previously watched since it's so thought provoking. The only flaw I could attribute to the movie is the lack of answers the movie has but that also adds to it in it's own way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Requiem for life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing I want to say about this movie is that I do not know what to say about this movie, and that is exactly why I am writing this review, my first ever. It's as if the director tried to put Mozart's Requiem in moving images. To me, at this exact moment in my life, the movie represents a painfully, beautifully painted study in philosophy, astrophysics, love stories, societal conditioning, self-reflection and what it means to truly care about life and not living it passively but leaving your mark on it. It also destroys the idea that things are black and white and encourages one to look deeper for meaning, explanation and even toleration.It is not about a troubled teenager, it's about you and me.It is not the kind of universally appealing movie, like The Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile, it is more akin in it's aspirations to the likes of Kubrick's 2001, Tarkovsky's Stalker. If you liked this I strongly urge you to watch those and vice-versa.I still have a long way to go in discovering cinema, but I just couldn't keep my hands off the keyboard and not write this, because it truly is a rare work of power, and art, that manages to touch one both emotionally and punch to the very core, and also leave you thinking, analyzing and philosophizing long until it ended. Art that can scar both your heart and your mind, is true art. Of course, we have to suppose that the viewer is capable of doing that, and let's face it, not everybody goes to a movie with this attitude. Don't fool and disrespect yourself by watching it with anything less than an attentive, truly open mind. I can now truly say I have a favorite movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Warning! Plot Spoilers ahead.*Donnie Darko is one of those movies which will leave you dumbstruck as you try to figure out its meaning.The mentally disturbed Donnie, who seems like a relatable, normal teenager at first, experiences a series of bizarre events which lead him to discover his hidden mental powers. He experiences supernatural events, which some may wish to interpret as hallucinations, that cause him to unconsciously commit crimes. The dark scenes depicted in the movie do not have a single interpretation. They leave an impact on the viewers mind and provoke deep thoughts.The borderline horrific scenes of Donnie's visions of a large, scary bunny rabbit add to the overall effect of impending doom. Donnie tries to fight to prevent the end of the world, but ends up dying from an accident which had occurred 28 days ago. This leads the viewers to speculate about the time shifting aspect of all the supernatural events.You will be spend hours trying to theorize which interpretation of the movie is apt. The scenes will come back to you as you slowly realize their significance. I myself spent a significant time googling theories about the movie, to satisfy my thoughts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People were not kidding when they said you have to watch this movie twice to enjoy it. But that means that the movie is no fun watching the first time, because you need to memorize stuff that does not make sense at first. To me, this is like doing homework. I do not enjoy doing homework. Also, if I have to sit through a movie without enjoying it, then what is the fun in that? To be able to brag when I finally get the movie? The parts that didn't need memorizing were packed with jokes and philosophies that I already heard and saw many times before. Which doesn't motivate me either to watch this movie for another time. Especially since the spoilers told me that I would have been wasting my time anyway because the moral of the movie is quite bland and overdone. If I want to spend the time of 2 movies watching movies, then I'd rather pick 2 separate movies that are actually fun watching the first time. If a movie can not get it's point across the first time being watched, then it's badly written and the emperor wears no clothes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Felt Everything..!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm actually quite surprised that this movies isn't rated as a thriller here on IMDb, because the combination of a dark and twisted theme, a creepy ominous soundtrack, and Jake Gyllenhaal performing at his very best; literally kept me on the edge of my chair during most of the runtime. Donnie really is a good-hearted boy, and not long into the movie the only thing you want is for him to be okay. That is why I especially enjoyed following the developing relationship between Donnie &amp; Gretchen. It seems like Gretchen becomes a sanctuary for him, a place where he can truly open himself up without feeling like there is something wrong with him (like in therapy). It's a part of the story that really touches me deeply, and so torrential are my feelings that when Gretchen died, my heart simply fell apart.And then everything changes, when moments later the entire storyline collapses around you, and the reality of the movie is suddenly changed to another, back at the beginning. When the movie ended I felt, well I felt: Sad that Gretchen died and confused of the changing time line ? Happy that Gretchen didn't die after all but on behalf of the family powerless over the tragedy that struck them ? Angry at the bullies, but relieved that nothing happened to the rest of the Darko's ? Wondering of how grandma death was involved in this, and devastated by the death of Donnie himself, and hence him never experiencing his life with Gretchen. All in all ? I felt everything!After watching Donnie Darko for the first time, two things popped into my mind. First ? Wow that was intense! Second ? I need to watch this again! After all this, I guess I don't need to point out that the acting of course is flawless ? Sound, music and cutting were done perfectly, and the story is written with so much subtext that it will take me many more views before fully understanding what I'm watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A life in the Eighties slips through the cracks of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is an extremely effective movie, I've loved it since it first came out. It's hard to pinpoint the theme... is it a horror movie showing how a boy briefly escaped death? Is it a rebellious, "fight the system" movie as Donnie stands up in school against a lame teen talk TV show host? Is it a movie playing with modern parents' worries about imaginary friends? Maybe it has no real theme, just a story, a story that manages to make very little sense at times but still be interesting, tragic, funny and exciting all at once.The Darkos are a typical suburban family living in Virginia in 1988, but Donnie Darko is the black sheep of the family and treated like a burden. Because he has schizophrenia and violent episodes, he's on medication, which he's recently stopped taking (these days teens aren't allowed to do that, Prozac is a big one forced on 'em :( ). Between his goody two-shoes sister, clueless parents and pathetic classmates and teachers, Donnie has no friends whatsoever and spends much of his time reading... until one night he meets Frank, an anthropomorphic bunny rabbit and imaginary friend who saves him from a horrible death and alters Donnie's brief following days forever.There isn't much to say that other reviewers haven't already brought up, other than this movie is awe-inspiring and thought provoking and incredibly disturbing. The soundtrack was excellent, the acting cast was great and the movie really managed to capture the nostalgia of the Eighties. I don't think Donnie Darko is horror so much as science fiction drama but it's been called horror from time to time. It's a really addictive and exciting movie that everyone should see at least once in their lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko, is perhaps one of the better films that was released in the early 2000s. It centres on a troubled teenager in the midst of his latter college years. He is awakened by a mysterious character known as Frank (a 6ft bunny rabbit) who saves his life. Throughout the film, Frank tells Donnie he must do certain tasks in order to save humanity. I think, the beauty of this film is solely due to the underlying theme of religion combined with science, or science fiction. Whilst, the director has highlighted how troublesome high school can be for some people. It drops subtle religious hints throughout the film suggesting that Donnie could ultimately represent the saviour. Furthermore, although the directors knowledge of science may be all but perfect, watching the movie it is hardly noticeable. Watching the film for the first time I didn't rightly know where the ending was going, having given it some thought and reading up on the storyline it was encouraging to see how creative this movie really is. If someone asked me what this film is essentially about - 'Time Travel' I would highly recommend this film as it provides not only a superb amalgamation of religion and science fiction. It is ultimately a good watch with lots of action, suspense and humour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie darko is a movie about a boy who has mental issues and has trouble relating to most people in his everyday life. He has a history of mental problems, mainly leading to aggressive acts and from the beginning of the film you get the sense that Donnie is a bit different to most boys of his age. A series of events occur in the movie and the story is very complex to understand but nevertheless very intriguing. From watching the movie many interpretations can be formed which is very interesting in itself. It is almost impossible (in my opinion anyways) to understand the purpose of each element in the film from a first watch. The movie depicts itself as very mysterious, and almost dark and creepy, with a talking bunny rabbit that is difficult to find an reason for its existence. The movie is definitely worth a watch for any viewers that like a movie that requires complex thinking and analysis and is a masterpiece once you understand all the parts to the puzzle.</fullReview>

So it wasn't until my 3rd viewing of Donnie Darko that I realized what a fantastic piece of art it really is. The score is perfect, the acting is superb, and some of the lines are hauntingly resonant. You will want everyone you know to watch Donnie Darko, just so you can talk about it with them for hours afterwards.

		<shortDescription>A Mad World Indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko, is, without a doubt, my favorite film, and in my humble opinion, the absolute best film ever made. While the effectiveness of something like this is entirely subjective, I believe the appeal, message, and quality, are universal.Donnie Darko is a teenager whose way too angsty and moody for his own good. He's temperamental, volatile, and kind of a prick. He's a guy with some 'emotional problems', a therapist, and some pills. However, he isn't the typical angsty teen, he's a teenager who has visions (or 'daylight hallucinations') of a man in a large bunny suit who tells him the world is going to end. And thats where I'm going to stop. Upon first viewing, its best that you don't know a single thing about it going in. Watching this movie and being able to appreciate it is more akin to an experience rather than a viewing, an all-consuming, all-engulfing, journey into immersion. As you follow Donnie down the 'rabbit hole' (Ha ha) you might just change your outlook on basically... anything really. It is one of those movies, a film like Fight Club, Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind, American Beauty, Eraserhead, and K-PAX that makes you do a bit of self critiquing once you finish it. You sort of re-evaluate yourself and your opinion and knowledge on the world. Its an absorbing and haunting movie that by the end, had me in tears, and the best part is I can't even say why. Its such a transcendent film, its a damn shame Richard Kelley hasn't made another decent film since.Bottom line, whether you'll love it or hate it (Its a polarizing flick), Donnie Darko is easily in the my list of top 5 movies you HAVE to see before you die.</fullReview>

Frank then leads Donnie into performing numerous acts, and the viewer doesn't really know why until later on in the film.The story is actually quite convoluted, and if given too much detail as to why certain things happen in the movie it may ruin the viewing experience. For some, you will understand most of what is happening throughout the movie - some however, will likely be lost and won't unravel what the movie was really about until watching it over again.In my opinion, the greatest asset the movie has is the complexity of the story, so if that isn't your sort of thing - you probably won't enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a very mad world and not necessarily in a good way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is one of the biggest cult films of recent times and it really doesn't seem bothered about a coherent storyline. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a troubled teenager who keeps seeing a bunny man and has 28 days to save the world. Don't ask me to explain it any further. It's not meant to make sense. The film mixes horror, thriller, comedy, drama and science fiction with impressive skill and it is a well made movie. But it's not that well made. I didn't quite get the love for this movie. It's OK and nothing more in my opinion. I liked a few things about it, but it certainly wasn't enjoyable. Jake Gyllenhall gives an underrated and superb performance as the troubled titular character, while Richard Kelly does very well for a first time director and writer. The direction is quite good and the film's total refusal to stick to conventions and fit into one genre are to be admired. The film has a certain haunting quality to it, but if you think about it, all that happened in the whole story was that Donnie got crushed by a jet engine. That's it.The main issue I have is the plot. Many think it's smart, but in my opinion, it's a lazily put together genre mish mash with loads of ambiguities to try and cover up the fact that the film really isn't very smart. It's certainly a head scratcher, but the film didn't connect on an emotional level. The teen drama has it's touching moments, but aside from that it's totally a style over substance film. Random things which don't serve any real purpose keep getting put in for no real reason, and at the time the film feels like nothing more than a 90 minute music video to the undeniably brilliant theme song, 'Mad World'. It didn't really engage me, and it lacks heart and structure. It's definitely an interesting movie more than a particularly good one, and for some reason everyone thinks its the smartest cult film ever (That would probably be The Wicker Man) instead of saying that it's the pointless enigma that it is. If you do explain the film, there really isn't an interesting answer to the puzzle box that is Donnie Darko. Many say you have to watch this twice. I don't want to see it again.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever tried Sudoku, Brain Training on the Nintendo DS and watching Countdown all at the same time? Sounds like a difficult task right? Well that's exactly the level of head scratching, thought provoking, sweat inducing experience I had while watching Donnie Darko. I have literally watched the film three times and I still don't understand one iota of the mind bending Rubik cubeness of this film. What does it all mean? Because I literally don't have a clue! Donnie Darko is one of those few films that I have found completely impossible to distinguish whether it is so far out the box that it is actually the box itself type of master piece, like Stanley Kubrick's 2001 Space Odyssey or Shane Carruth's Primer or is merely utter rubbish masquerading itself as an intelligent and unique film, such as Minority Report and Oblivion ? Ummm I wonder what both films have in common? From what I can decipher from Richard Kelly's (director/writer) story line, is it is based around this character Donnie Darko ? sound like a superhero right? Well that character is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, which I'm pretty sure every mother, daughter and girlfriend already knows who he is. The guy has been know to have demonstrated time and time again that he posses a lot of range as an actor, appearing in films such as Zodiac and Brokeback Mountain. But in this particular film he once again plays against all heartthrob type casting by playing a genius teenager who knows everything there is to know about the Smurfs ? make him President right? But at the same time he is a very troubled young man, one of these troubles manifests itself in a 6ft tall bunny named Frank who tells him that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and twelve seconds. So for the rest of the film he tries to unravel the mystery around the strange occurrences plaguing his life. Along the way the bunny that only he can see, keeps popping out of now and telling him to do stuff such a flooding the school and setting someone's house on fire. But don't worry it's not all doom and gloom, there is some really cool science stuff revolving around time travel and all its possibilities for you SCI-FI enthusiasts and there is also a love interest in the form of Gretchen and beautiful girl whose life is riddled with misery for all you romantic types. The film is also riddled with a abundance of acting stars, such as local author Patrick Swayze, cool and mysterious teacher Drew Barrymore and high achieving older sister Maggie Gyllenhaal ? and yes they are related in real life. Okay now we got that out of the way, what works in the film? Well the acting performance are all subtle, no one is playing to outperform anyone else's, instead the main cast all remain true to their idiosyncratic odd ball characters which makes them all so endearing and likable. My favourite performance was Jena Malone's, who was able to build a character that at the drop of the hat can be strong and fierce one moment, then sweet and fragile the next, which was why it was always a delight to see her come on screen. Another aspect of the film that I loved, was the way the film never wants limited itself to just the one genre, instead it was constantly evolving and changing; one minute its wacky and funny shown best in the family meal scenes, the next its sci-fi awesomeness in the scenes between Donnie and the sciences teacher and it suddenly becomes sweet and lovely, illustrated best anytime Gretchen and Donne are together. but what I didn't like in the film was the way they had such captivating and interesting characters, mainly being Drew Barrymore's teacher character who I felt could have added so much to the narrative yet was given such a passive inconsequential role. I also felt that Richard Kelly should have added a lot more in depth meaning to the piece, because it seemed all to shallow and lacking in any real direction and strong ideals to convey. Okay sure I still don't know if I loved or hated it, so all I can say for certain was that I enjoyed watching the film and would strongly recommended anyone who is in the mood for something unique and off beat and with plenty of amazing acting gold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What if you could go back in time and replace all those hours of pain and darkness with something better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first heard of Donnie Darko when i saw a review for the film by Jonathon Ross on the BBC. I was immediately fascinated by what i was seeing. 'Frank' in his 'stupid bunny suit' and Donnie in his 'stupid man suit'. So, when the DVD was released i had to get it. Returning home i gave a brief outline of the film to my parents. 'It's about a guy called Donnie who speaks to this giant bunny'. Anyway,it was enough to intrigue them and although apprehensive they sat down with me to watch the film. We sat through Donnie Darko enchanted by the beautiful imagery and mesmerising score. From 'Donnie' to 'Gretchen'. And Tears for Fears 'Head Over Heels' to Joy Divisions 'Love Will Tear Us Apart'. The film just oozes a style and sophistication barely recognisable. The film is a fascinating portrayal of life and has a serving of every film genre. The love story between 'Donnie' and 'Gretchen'. The horror between 'Donnie and 'Frank'. As well as a helping of quick whit comedy and drama that I can associate with everyday life. Drew Barrymore is fantastic as Donnie's English Teacher. And Beth Grant also shines as the infuriating 'righteous one',Kittie Farmer. In fact the whole support cast are genuinely individual and believable. Patrick Swayze as 'Jim Cunningham' is a character that shows evil and deceit stretches through all walks of life. Regardless of social status and reputation. Donnie's caring parents and his turbulent relationship with his older sister 'Elizabeth' (a relationship I compare with me and my twin brother). It's because Donnie Darko makes it so easy to believe the characters that the film is a good account of how 'normal' people view others as 'strange' or,'weird'. The film gave me the chance to make up my own mind as to what it meant. After endless discussions with family and friends,Donnie Darko still lets my imagination run wild. Being a keen fan of Horror and Steven Spielberg films I like the references to 'Evil Dead' in the 'Portal' scene and 'E.T. in the 'Cellar Door' scene. It is without doubt in my top five films of all time and films of this calibre come around all too rarely.The film emphasises to me that as a Race,our existence depends on acceptance and equality for all. While at the same time showing a togetherness in times of need and hurt. Donnie laughing at his own fate at the end of the film emphasises this to me. In my eyes the films acceptance depends on what you believe in. What is fate? What is real? What is fake? Why do we dream? Why are we here? Do you believe in deja-vu or,a parallel Universe? Or,how about Portals? The fact is we all have our own ideals and beliefs and I see a lot of mine in Donnie Darko. Through life comes death and through dark comes light. That is what the film means to me and that is the way I see life. Donnie Darko is a refreshing take on the way we view life and death as individuals. It is indeed a 'Mad World' and video is a form of escapism. Without films like Donnie Darko what would we do? Go mad i suppose. With films like Donnie Darko in it the world is a better place. Richard Kelly is a legend and I know that with his very existence on earth that there is so much to look forward to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear of Responsibility</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the first eight hour shifts I pulled at my first real job in a hospital kitchen. I was 16. The stark reality of the monotony, the adult supervision, and the volume of the workload blew me away. "So this is what life is like for adults," I thought to myself. There was no fun or entertainment involved, and when I finally finished, the only thing I had to look forward to, was doing the same shift again the next day.When you're a teen, you watch the world of responsibility that your parents and teachers inhabit and it scares you to death. So you take a stance of rebellion and consider them suckers and hypocrites. They have lost their passion. They don't know what real life is about.But you do. You're not sure what it is, but it isn't work and bills. You are on the inside of some kind of cosmic truth. You feel things deeply. The world is mysterious, threatening, twisted, and potentially enchanting.Donnie Darko is afraid of the world. He has stared into the future and it terrifies him. The life lived by his parents and teachers is a window onto a nightmare. Add to that mixture an older sister who takes life with a grain of salt and is heading to Harvard for a load of responsibility.She mocks his melodramatic spaciness and his dependency on psychotropic drugs. He's a freak and she is normal, and he knows it.Having said all that, I remember being spooked by reality like Donnie. I liked the way the film has him sleepwalking and waking up on a mountain road. I lived near an area like that, and I can almost picture myself doing something like that. That was an awesome opening.I'm not sure why this film was set in 1988, but I read that the writer was 13 at that time. I guess he is hearkening back to the beginning of his own teenage journey. The injection of 80's music fit well. Another reviewer felt that grunge would have been better, and that the film should have been set during that era. But I liked the contrast of a dark character in a still bright and optimistic period. Nice use of the song Mad World at the end.Since most viewers themselves do not know what the movie was officially about, I wonder if the actors were told. Either way, Jake Gyllenhaal was impressive as the tortured teen. I think he escaped potential clichés and made it his own original work. The rest of the performances were forgettable.I find Virginia beautiful,which is where DD was set, but this one was actually filmed in Santa Clarita, California. It looked great.The mountains and the suburbs were lovely.I choose to see the old lady as a scary depiction of another thing that Donnie and teens like him fear. That is aging and death.Interestingly Katherine Ross came out of obscurity and showed up as the psychiatrist. She was the love interest of the original alienated young man in "The Graduate" from the 1960's. She also played the lead role in the terrifying original Sci-Fi "The Stepford Wives" in the 70's.The actor who played DD's dad looked just like the guy who played Katherine Ross's dad in The Graduate.In the midst of all his confusion, he's still a teenage boy.He needs a girlfriend for both supportive companionship and to temper the relentless assault of the male libido. So they threw in a love interest for him to bounce off. It seemed like he was more into his own problems than hers. Although given the ending, he must have cared more than he showed.I don't want Donnie's character to be considered a hero by new teens discovering this film. He's not.He's a self-absorbed, irresponsible, and sometimes cruel individual.Just for the record, I grew up in a suburb like the one in DD, and there were loads of wonderful hard working adults and conscientious kids. People did volunteer work, went to church, studied music, built things in their garages and respected their siblings. This is contrary to the suburban life depicted in American Beauty and Donnie Darko. I see the bunny and the plane engine as hallucinations that stem from a combination of his immense fear of both life and death, and his use of anti-depressants. Time travel is attractive to someone who can't deal with the reality of their present time. If only I could go back in time or forward, I could find the world in a better condition, or escape my own reality.There is great danger in young people indulging in pop culture that depicts life as pointless,doomed,and unfair. It often breeds a nihilistic malaise that can last for years and affect one's maturity.This is your wake up call: Like Jackson Browne so poignantly noted in his famous song The Pretender, you do what you have to do, and then you "get up and do it again." Our suburban parents, neighbors, and teachers are the real heroes, as are our soldiers. Don't spend too much time pondering the nature of life if it is going to stop you from living. Find a perspective on God and get busy. If not, may God help this self-indulgent, nihilistic generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revisiting Donnie Darko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked Donnie Darko initially. It had a memorable soundtrack, dreamlike visuals, and a few strong performances. Mary McDonnell and Beth Grant stood out as Donnie's mother and Kitty Farmer, respectively, and many of the other characters, including the rest of Donnie's family, were played well. It was both nostalgic and timely in its portrayal of high school angst and oppressive, anti-intellectual conservatism given the sociopolitical climate at the time I saw it. There was a kind of a perverse satisfaction in watching Donnie rebel against Mrs. Farmer, Jim Cunningham, and the rest of their kind. Furthermore, the plot had a superficial cleverness as the chain of events unfolded to reveal a fate we already knew. I also saw Donnie Darko before I knew of its cult status, so its bizarre mix of humor and creepiness seemed novel and compelling. After watching the original again, I still appreciate these qualities, but I'm more aware of its limitations. At times, Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, and Drew Barrymore are simply trying too hard. The quintessential valley girl acting the part of an edgy English teacher is hard to accept, while the relationship between Donnie and the new girl feels hollow. At best, she shares his flair for histrionics and an emotional honesty that would have embarrassed most of the kids I knew in high school. Donnie and Gretchen are unrealistically na?ve, and while Donnie may chastise his teacher for attempting to reduce the gamut of human emotions to a simple love-fear dichotomy, he crumbles when his therapist's analysis of his inner demons is similarly reductive. The film tries to turn teen angst into some metaphysical struggle, so Donnie's quest to get into Gretchen's pants suddenly becomes faith- affirming. I wouldn't have a problem with this if the superhero angle was told with a little self-deprecating wit, but most of the film's humor is at the expense of its worst stereotypes while equally limited characters are given a weight they don't deserve. Noah Wyle, who is otherwise credible as a high school science teacher, readily embraces the fantasy logic of Donnie's world as if Stephen Hawking made it all unequivocally believable, and I expect the audience is meant to accept the director's notion of an alternate universe with equal relish. However, the arbitrarily convoluted rules governing the plot are only interesting in their lack of clarity. I agree with fans who think it's more fun to let your imagination wander and critics who argue the film's incoherence is not an attribute. While God and fate are mentioned in passing, the film dodges the big philosophical questions to the extent that objecting to the implications of the ending becomes difficult. Regardless, nothing that transpires in the film is substantive enough for Donnie to reach any great epiphany. Instead, he is merely going through the motions like a pawn in some Rube Goldberg contrivance. So much for being a superhero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brain teaser movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A kind of strange movie that keeps you wondering from the beginning till the end of the movie what is happening. The young Donnie Darko impersonated by Jake Gyllenhaal is a boy who has visions of a bunny that manipulates him to commit a series of crimes. As the plot thickens, especially at the end we understand that all these actions (crimes) were committed for a specific reason. These actions were determining the future. The future was represented like an aura through people and only Donnie Darko and an old Lady with the name "Roberta Sparrow" or also called "Grandma Death". The end is kind of misleading.One possible version is that there where different universes and in a every universe based on every single action there were different consequences. The other one is that Donnie Darko changed the time events and he got himself killed to deter the death of other people.</fullReview>

The acting is really good as well, I almost cried for a second there at the end, and the protagonist is amazing to the point where I want to watch some more of him.There's something else to it, this is not the kind of movies where it finishes and you've got it all figured out. You have to stop and think about some things, what do they meant and stuff. I even had to watch it 3 times to try to catch all the details, 'cause everything is meaningful. What I also like about this movie is that there is so much more around it, it's not just a film, there's a book, there are/were hidden clues on the Internet that get you even deeper into the story and that's really something.

		<shortDescription>Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer / director Richard Kelly has created here what can only be described as an instant cult favourite type of film, one that may drive some viewers crazy, while endlessly fascinating others. What it's like is a puzzle, a puzzle made of quirky, offbeat pieces, some of them with a very high degree of unreality. This viewer is not quite sure WHAT to make of it, but believes that, no doubt, it will be the kind of film that will prove to be continuously mesmerizing on repeat viewings, with elements that he may not have picked up on the first time. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the title character, a moody, troubled high school student who starts experiencing hallucinations. Chief among them is a demonic "rabbit" named Frank (James Duval) who informs Donnie that the world will be coming to an end within a month. Taking place in 1988, with the Dukakis / Bush presidency race serving as a backdrop, this goes to great lengths to contrast the many aspects of Donnies' life. What is real? What's illusion? Certainly some viewers will have an incredible time examining all of the details and clues. Hell, even when this film is over, it's not necessarily providing a cut and dried explanation for everything. Kelly utilizes every filmmaking trick at his disposal, and does very well at keeping things suitably enigmatic. He also gets strong performances out of his interestingly chosen cast: Jena Malone as Donnies' new girlfriend, Drew Barrymore (also the executive producer), Beth Grant, and Noah Wyle as teachers, Daveigh Chase and Gyllenhaals' real-life sister Maggie as Donnies' siblings, Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell as his parents, Katharine Ross as his psychiatrist, Patrick Swayze as a self-help guru, and Seth Rogen (in his film debut) as a thuggish schoolmate. The use of soundtrack music is eclectic, and the visual effects are a collective knockout. As a horror fan this viewer had to also enjoy a viewing of "The Evil Dead" within the film as a story detail. All of this is nothing if not ambitious, slowly and steadily working its way towards its conclusion, incorporating ideas such as time travel into its provocative mix. It may not be for all tastes, but it's bound to get people talking, which of course isn't exactly a bad thing. All in all, it's well worth a look for adventurous film lovers. Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a sad world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Kelley's artistically cultivates a character study, teen drama, and a sci-fi thriller intertwining these elements with intriguing results. Donnie Darko doesn't get along too well with anyone; but he does manage to find a sympathetic friend in Gretchen, who then agrees to date him. Donnie does have a friend named Frank - a large bunny which only Donnie can see, and it's unclear whether Frank is a friend or foe. He has a compassionate psychiatrist, who practices hypnosis as a means to unlock hidden secrets. An engine falls off a plane landing onto Donnie's room when he is not there. Both the event and his escape may have been caused by supernatural forces, but we are unsure if the accident actually occurred because of Donnie's psychological issues. That the film includes elements of science fiction, horror, and dry, dark comedy makes it not only eminently fun, but also somewhat disturbing to watch. Similar to David Lynch's "Blue Velvet", the film explores the everyday, munde and the unspoken immorality that lurks in the shadows. Impressive directorial debut for Richard Kelley and and a fantastic performance by Jake Gyllenhaal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Want to Know What This Movie is About, Then Read On</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie I didn't really know what to think, but as the years have gone by, I've come to like it very much. If nothing else, one has to appreciate the concept and thought provoking nature of this material. A kid basically somehow finds some type of wormhole to where he travels back in time, he time travels is what he does, and the genius of that time travel makes this movie all the more worth watching. Would we forget if we time traveled, if we traveled back in time? Or would we remember? Could we travel forward? If we did travel back in time or forward in time, would it be planned and on purpose, or would we travel back or forward in time by complete chance/on accident? As if it were all just a dream? This movie poses all of these concepts and questions. The creators vision is that Donnie Darko forgets that he travels back in time. That Donnie Darko traveled back in time by complete accident and chance as if it were just some quick snap of the fingers, waking up from a dream or waking up from your therapy session with the Hypnotist. Donnie Darko doesn't know he's traveled back in time, he just believes he's in the present as if nothing ever happened, but yet Darko keeps seeing visions of a Creepy Dark Bunny. He sees this Bunny as if he's seen this Bunny before, Deja Vu, just a creepy dream or remnants from the time travel left in some odd peculiar quadrant that keeps flashing before him? A very thought provoking and creepy movie. This movie will keep you on edge and leave you feeling settled but unsettled at the same time. Of course as the movie progresses, Donnie Darko discovers that he has time traveled and eventually he will sacrifice his life for his loved ones' lives. He kind of sacrifices his life in a different, but sort of same way that Ashton Kutcher's character does in The Butterfly Effect. Donnie Darko kind of has that 2001: A Space Odyssey feel to it. And Also, who doesn't think that there are wormholes right around the corner that we don't know about, right in a forest or in our backyard. I think for the fantasy, sci-fi lover, these thoughts have been thought in our minds before, and really who knows if we're right or wrong. There could be wormholes anywhere really. Who really knows. Anyway, If you like 2001: A Space Odyssey, then you'll probably take a liking to Donnie Darko as well. Also, Patrick Swayze is terrific in this movie in a very weird and disturbing role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie, but also something else entirely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" is a curious one. All of the ingredients for a notable movie are there (a fine cast, superb soundtrack, great writing), and it sure does jam enough stuff into the story: jet engines, tangent universes, superhero themes, there's even a teen movie nestled under all of this. And it all comes together to make something unique and absorbing; eerie, darkly funny, brimming with a strange mix of charm and sadness.And sure, you can sum this up as a cult movie with an intricate puzzle of a story - but for me, this is a world of its own. I find myself getting sucked into this movie, just fall right in and get lost. This is primarily because it brings '80s suburbia to life staggeringly well. The marks of the period aren't littered all over the place like cheap props, but are sewn into the fabric. The touches are subtle but wholly effective. There's just something about this movie that puts me right back there as a little kid in 1988. I look at this and see a (jaded) middle America of the time, and not the Long Beach locations. It's really something when you can evoke a time and place like this and the filming locations don't poke holes in the illusion. Simply put, watching this movie is an experience (for me, at least), which goes a long way in explaining its high replay value. And then there's that soundtrack (which is an unbelievable assemblage of songs), but on the matter of that Gary Jules cover . . . I imagine that, were I to hear that song for the first time outside of the film, I'd probably hate it in favor of the Tears for Fears original. But I know it for the last few minutes of this movie, and it beautifully accentuates the mood during those closing moments. "Donnie Darko" and "Mad World" are inseparable, and as such, it's a tremendous song. This whole movie is fascinating.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was just a UNIQUE movie, that didn't make sense, then it did, then it didn't, and at the end, it sorta makes sense but only Donnie Darko will ever know what really happened! It really made me think and I enjoyed it but really hoped it made more sense to me at the end. I guess that's the legacy that this film will leave.Obviously he was the main character, I just loved Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) because Jake acted very well and Donnie was just a strange boy and I wanted to figure out what was going on with him, why he was taking medication, why he saw the bunny rabbit and why he thought the world would end! Very creative but weird. You either love it or hate it! simple as that, it is a strange but fantastic film. Jake Gyllenhaal was superb in this movie. It would have been very hard for the director to try create the storyline and piece together the actual movie and it is credit to them for doing so successfully!I would recommend it to people who like strange but good films. People who can handle watching a movie without ever really fully understand it. There is a chance the movie will leave you stumped, or will leave you figuring out what happened an hour after you have seen it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ingeniously Imaginative Psychodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An ingeniously imaginative psychodrama, mixing science fiction, teen love story, satire and many other themes. Truly ambitious for a débutant Director, but as someone said 'ambition and imagination trump mediocrity any day of the week'.Many may find it confusing, bizarre or illogical. And even after watching, viewers might come to different conclusions. But there is only one intending story and concept. It's one of the very few movies which required a double viewing and the director's explanation to completely grasp the concept and really enjoy it. The correct order of viewing, understanding and enjoying it would be: 1&gt; see it once, 2&gt; read the explanation on 'http://www.donniedarko.org.uk/explanation/', 3&gt; watch it again. It's completely worth it! The concept is brilliant! Once you understand the whole intended story, it sweeps you off your feet leaving you almost speechless. You'll be in awe how every single thing in the movie falls into place.Jake Gyllenhaal truly stands out in the amazingly rich cast including Maggie Gyllenhaal, Mary McDonnell, Katherine Ross, Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, Jena Malone, Noah Wyle.The soundtrack is amazing too - goes quite well with the twisted dark fantasy. It starts off with 'The Killing Moon' by Echo and the Bunnymen (the director's Cut uses 'Never Tear Us Apart' covered by INXS). Both are quite good, but I personally liked the Director's Cut soundtrack. The movie ends with the amazing cover of 'Mad World' by Gary Jules.This movie is not for everyone, definitely not for people who watch movies just for the sake of entertainment. Recommended to those who love intelligent &amp; puzzling movies with brilliantly new concepts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko and his troubled bunny visions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨28 days... 6 hours... 42 minutes... 12 seconds. That... is when the world... will end.¨ Donnie Darko is Richard Kelly's first feature film and considered by many to be by far his best work. This dark and mysterious movie has reached cult status among many film lovers thanks to its original and eerie premise. I on the other hand, just recently watched it and didn't enjoy the movie all that much. This isn't my first Kelly film, since I saw The Box a few years back and really hated that movie so I was hoping Donnie Darko would be a lot better. It was better thanks to the performance from Jake Gyllenhaal and the atmosphere set up by Kelly, but it still didn't work for me and once again I was disappointed with the ending of the film. Richard Kelly also wrote the original screenplay for Donnie Darko and at times the movie seemed to be heading into very interesting territories, but it just never managed to stay that way and ended up drifting everywhere. Many things that happened didn't make much sense for me, but that is the way science fiction films work, some love it while others hate it and consider the events taking place to be impossible. For a movie dealing with time travel and such I think Back to the Future is the one to be put on the pedestal. Too many elements in Donnie Darko are just pointless in my opinion, but those elements are perhaps why many people consider this film to be a masterpiece. Donnie Darko is a divisive movie which some will love and others hate. You will just have to watch it and make your own judgment.In the beginning of the movie we are introduced to a young and troubled teen named Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) who wakes up in the middle of nowhere one morning and drives his bike home. Donnie lives with his parents Eddie (Holmes Osborne) and Rose (Mary McDonnell) and two sisters Elizabeth (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Samantha (Daveigh Chase). His family is worried about his behavior and he is sort of the outcast in class as well. He has therapy sessions with Dr. Lillian Thurman (Katharine Ross) and confesses to have an imaginary friend named Frank who is dressed up as a demon faced bunny. Frank has told Donnie that the world will end in 28 days and he also makes him commit a series of vandal acts. Dr. Thurman is afraid that Donnie is suffering from severe psychotic disorder. One morning a jet engine falls from the sky right into Donnie's room, but Donnie was saved because he had slept walk to a golf course that night following Frank's instructions. Donnie believes that Frank is some sort of messenger from the future and begins to ask question to his teachers in school about time travel. He also begins to date a new classmate named Gretchen (Jena Malone) who has also gone through a very dark past. As the apocalyptic date approaches, Donnie tries to find a way to change things.This dark science fiction drama has a lot of missing pieces that the audience is forced to put together by using their imagination (unless you watch the director's cut which is a lot more explanatory). The film doesn't seem to follow similar premises from other movies, it is original and sometimes it feels like nothing really is happening that is connected with other events. That is the feeling I got with Donnie Darko, that it was a very disconnected film and hard to encapsulate at times. It's as if the movie doesn't know what it really wants to be. The characters aren't really interesting either, the only true character that is given depth in this film is Donnie Darko and his behavior is really bizarre at times. Gyllenhaal's performance was great, but that is the only thing I enjoyed about this movie. Kelly has had a difficult time trying to follow up his work from this film since his next two films have failed and not reached the same cult status as this movie did. Donnie Darko could have been a masterpiece if Kelly would have found a way to piece everything together at the end, but it left me with a sour taste.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far from perfect, but not a bad film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is strangely polarizing. It seems that most people either loved it or loathed it, and I don't consider myself in either group. I saw this movie for the first time years ago and didn't remember most of the details, so I decided it was time to watch it again and see what all the fuss is about. The version I saw was the director's cut, so I can't speak for the original.First off, I'd like to praise the acting. Most of the actors in this film were spot on, particularly Mary McDonnell as Donnie's mother, Rose. The only performance for me that didn't quite hit the mark was Jake Gyllenhaal's, but I think that's just a matter of personal preference, not a flaw in his acting. Drew Barrymore was excellent as the English teacher and I've always been a fan of Maggie Gyllenhaal's.One thing that really stood out for me in this film is how well the relationships between the characters were written. I found them well-developed, genuine and very enjoyable to watch, particularly those of the Darko family. Obviously the sibling relationship portrayed by the Gyllenhaals was spot on, but I also very much enjoyed the interactions between not only Donnie and his parents, but between the parents themselves.The negatives in this film come largely from the supporting characters and from some of the writing. I felt that most of the characters in Donnie's school were very two-dimensional and the dialogue between the young characters felt like it was written by someone who couldn't quite remember how they spoke in their teen years and gave it their best approximation. The banter between the teenage boys was stiff and not quite believable (and there was one line in particular directed at a young female character that I found offensive and unnecessary).I did enjoy the way everything plays out and comes together in the end. Though any story that deals in time travel is bound to have plot holes, I felt the plot was fairly well-executed and didn't leave any glaring inconsistencies.All in all, I found Donnie Darko to be quite watchable and reasonably intelligent, but with room for growth in the filmmaking.

		<fullReview>The ultimate question in life for every human being is, "What happens at the end?" "Donnie Darko" is a film that I fell in love with from the initial watch. I found myself trying to break the film down. Trying to understand it. What does all the subtext mean? There has to be something right? What I found after watching it multiple times and reading dozens of reviews is that it means something different to each and every viewer.Donnie becomes somewhat of a superhero to me throughout the film. He's incredibly intelligent, catches the eye of a cute new girl, and more or less fights evil throughout the movie. Richard Kelly, lets YOU decide if he's mentally ill, or somewhat of a Christ incarnate, or something in between. It's your own beliefs, rather, imagination, that makes the film make sense to YOU.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting ideas...but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is truly an art-house movie, and art-house movies aren't really my thing. Sometimes I just really don't like them, such as 2001: A Space Oddysey, or the Tree of Life. Other times I like them, but find them so over-rated such as last year's Drive. A lot of these films have a similar problem, they are much more Style over substance, and I don't have a problem with that, I enjoyed Transformers, and Roland Emmerich is one of my favorite directors. But with these films, the style just get's boring. I don't want to watch two people sit motionless for twenty seconds, or watch crap float through space for five minutes, or cut to dinosaurs for twenty minutes for no reason. Yet Donnie Darko doesn't really have that problem.There actually is quite a bit of substance here. The film does have some really good ideas, like how Donnie's visions all come together near the end, and how he criticize therapy. And like a lot of these other art house movies, it looks great, I like how the music tells the story at times.However there are two problems I really had with this movie. One was that some of the characters, don't act like human beings. And the other was the ending. Warning, this has spoilers, so don't read on if you haven't seen the movie.I know the ending wasn't supposed to be clear. However, what I get out of this, and from what I heard, Donnie chose to die, because he knew that if he lived, a chain of events would lead to the death of his girlfriend. Uh, I don't think so, Donnie knows how she will die, he was the one who took her to the house where she was killed. So just don't take her there, you know what happens now, there is no reason to. And how does that work, will the world just go ahead 28 days, then the tornado will send everyone back who won't remember, and it will just keep repeating? Donnie Darko has some great ideas, and looks great. But some character problems and a disappointing ending lead me to like this movie less than a lot of people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the movie your watching has a scene where a crazy guy hits an evil, six-foot tall, apocalypse predicting bunny with his car, and then shoots a clown, you know it's, at the very least, interesting. Donnie Darko is a dark, and often frighten film, peeking into the mind of an insane teenage boy. Warning: Don't expect to watch this movie and not be confused and weirded out. This is one of the most strange, yet elegant story ever told on film. By the end, you find yourself wide-eyed, and trying to process what you've just seen. The only reason I don't give Donnie Darko a 10/10 is because, apart from the main roles, the acting is not as good as it could have been. Not saying it was bad, just that it wasn't as good as it some the actors were capable of. Jake Gyllenhaal puts all of his skill into his performance and it shows. Donnie Darko is an excellent film and consider my rating as a 9.5/10. It is very good. By the way, look for Seth Rogen in his first film role as a high school bully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dannie Darko is a good movie that keeps your mind busy for while.At the first scene Donnie(Jake Gyllenhaal) was asleep in the middle of the road,It want to show that something goes wrong with him ,I mean he is a sleepwalker.Then the scene that he saw a bonnie rabbit that told him world will be destroyed in 28 days and ... and then the jet's engine that fall on the Donnie's room while he is sleeping in the next golf course.You'll never understand where did that jet's engine came from. Then you see Donnie that is at the school in the English class with it's beautiful teacher and he saw a beautiful girl then they fall in love with each other.Then in his way home with his father he saw a old woman that was standing on the way,she is an old school teacher who wrote a book about the time traveling.You see Frank(rabbit) who repeatedly appear and order Donnie to do things ,director wants the viewer to think that he is a schizophrenic, especially by the psychiatric that said he is aggressive schizophrenic, but actually he is not,then he was thinking that he saw signs that are the keys to solve whole the problem.He committed some crimes then the director wants to draw our attention to a book that solve the whole enigma.The jet's engine situation in fact was for next 28 day and happened without any reason so to fix this Donnie went the tangent world and he did some things with some help of Frank to make things right in this world. At the end of the movie Donnie decide to stay at his bed room and die to save his family and his girl friend -as the book said his experience hunted him in this world- his family and his girl friend just had some memory that was unclear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will be short and sweet.1. DO NOT watch this movie without reading Wikipedia after. It is kind of a double package. You will get confused otherwise and will scratch your head after the movie. Those who claim they absolutely got this film were definitely high on something. You can go that route also, but make sure your imaginary friend does not clash with the movie's imaginary friend.2. DO watch for its acting, cinematography and killer 80's music and somewhat underdeveloped/not as defined, potentially could have been awesome if expressed better story as well.3. DO find the main actor actually hot. First time I can say that about him (sorry Jake).That is all. Enjoy.</fullReview>

It manages to inspire hope, love, dread, laughter, and tears at different points throughout the movie without making you feel least bit like there is a contradiction between those states. The scenes with Frank (especially the one that takes place in the therapist's office against the backdrop of a conversation about the end of the world) are quite frankly some of the scariest things I've ever seen in a movie, as they literally made my skin crawl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko through a Christian Lense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Donnie Darko can be looked at through a Christian Perspective. The first Christian undertone I see is the philosophical argument of human's free will. If God exists, he must have a plan for the universe, a path for everyone to follow. If we are following a path that God knows from start to finish, then we should be able to jump to any point on that path because it already and always exists. Donnie is able to see his path and the paths of other people. In the movie, Donnie can see a watery substance that protrudes from a person's chest and he can see where it is going. It really makes people think about free will in a different way. What if we could see our own "watery substance?" Could we change our direction or would the substance somehow keep us from doing that? Another big issue is the separation of Church and state. This theme is very prominent in Donnie Darko. The best example is a scene between Donnie and his Science teacher. Donnie and his teacher have many conversations about the different theories of time travel. One particular conversation they have certainly depicts the restraints of separation of church and state.Dr. Monnitoff is not able to continue because to answer Donnie's question would be admitting there is a God, and that is just not school appropriate. Donnie is left having to figure out the problem himself, even though the person the government put in place to educate him could probably be very helpful.Finally, the most obvious parallel to Christianity is Donnie saving the world by dying. Donnie does dodge the death bullet in the beginning when his imaginary bunny friend lures him to a golf course so he doesn't get crushed when the plane engine crashes into his house. However, it was not the way Donnie's life was supposed to go, so in turn his life goes crazy until he realizes he was supposed to die in the crash. So in the end, Donnie finds a way to go back in time and he sits in bed laughing as the plane engine crashes on him. Some people say that he is laughing because he finally figured out that there is something to live for, but death was not the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about a boy who is dealing with a very vivid imagination and what seem to be mental problems. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie Darko who throughout the movie is coerced into doing things by a 6ft. tall rabbit named Frank. In the beginning of the movie Frank tells Donnie to follow him and ends up saving his life because while Donnie is following Frank a jet engine crashes into Donnie's bedroom where he should have been. Donnie's survival triggers a snowball effect. He feels that he must listen to what Frank tells him because he saved his life. This movie was not the type of movie that I usually enjoy. For me, it was hard to follow and figure out what was going on. Sometimes those turn out to be the best kinds of movies but this one did not stir up any emotion from me. It almost reminded me of the Butterfly Effect in the fact that with one alteration all of fate was changed. This was not apparent until the very end of the movie when everything came together.The techniques that were used to shoot this movie I felt were very gracefully done. For as dark and depressing as this movie was, the angles and scenes were very fluid and elegant. The lighting throughout the movie also assisted in creating this effect. For example almost is every scene of Ms. Pomeroy's classroom the lighting seemed very hopeful; whereas for example in Dr. Thurman's office scenes it was always dark outside thus illustrating the darkness within Donnie. I can see why this movie would be enjoyed by so many people but personally it didn't do anything for me. At the end of the movie I found myself to feel more down than I did the whole time I was watching it, which is hard for me to imagine. I went into watching this movie with an open mind and actually very excited due to the great cast that was in it. Without using too much of a spoiler, the end really makes you think how that city was better off. With Donnie alive and following the advice of Frank or dead. It also made me wonder what reality was real. Did he imagine all of those things in a dream and then really die or did he go to sleep and dream that he died that day. I think that is the main reason for my review being so negative. When I am done watching a movie I like to feel closure, not be left with more questions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best 80's Movie made in 2001.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would label "Donnie Darko" as "The thinking person's "Twilight". For anyone looking to rent or buy this movie, I would suggest getting the original version on DVD. Watch the movie in it's entirety and then watch the deleted scenes. A couple days later, view the entire film again. Then you can get a grasp of how many levels this movie was made on.In the meantime, you'll be thinking about it often.Every now and then you'll see a movie that has such a great cast that you can't pick out just one superb performance because they're all top notch. This is one of those movies. Jake Gyllenhall and Jenna Malone portray their characters with so much realism, you're pretty easily drawn into their relationship as a teen couple, both dealing with troubled lives.Mary McDonnell plays Donnie's mother with such empathy, that you feel as sad for her as you do Donnie.The one thing I noticed about this movie that I haven't seen posted a lot is the Messiah-like undertones. If you pay attention to when Donnie does something under the control of Frank, he always has his hood up looks "Satanic".At the end, Donnies realizes that he must sacrifice himself so those dear to him ( his mother and Gretchen especially) can live. IN other words, he crucifies himself. If you watch the deleted scenes, you can see what I mean.One of my all time favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) has schizophrenic episodes. Or are they real episodes? There's a story about an aeroplane crashing into a house, a giant rabbit and time travel but there's no point in describing the story. The writer obviously didn't think about what he was writing and the director didn't bother making the film easy to follow.This film is watchable but don't expect to understand it. You sort of realize what is going on towards the end but it is all a rather confusing mess. Hence, it is not a good film. Once it finishes, you just think "What was that about?" and it doesn't make sense. Unless you have written the peculiar time-travel theory that the film aspires to. A whole heap of nonsense really and not as effective as it would like to be. Still, it kept me watching but I don't think it needs to be seen again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that crept up on me. It takes one time to sense the rhythms of this film and to accept the strange apparitions that dominate it. As the closing song, "Mad World," typifies, the central character can only accept his demons and, in doing so, have a scintilla of joy. This is about a different kind of altruism, unstuck in time, that some of us wish we could have. Donnie is a popular guy with all kinds of possibilities. He is loving, smart, and eccentric. His family has him seeing a psychiatrist because his actions due to misunderstood visions have caused him to act violently at times. They love him and want him so badly to sort things out. He finds a soul mate, but she has her own demons and never fully understands what is going on. I can't say much because a first time viewer needs to be kept completely in the dark. I would like to watch this again to see things unfold with foreknowledge. It's one of the most intriguing movies I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An instant cult classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Donnie Darko' is a deeply complex time travel mystery which will confound and intrigue viewers. It rewards multiple viewings and is ingeniously intricate. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the titular character, a medicated youth who is suffering delusions. Or is he? Jake, a sleepwalker, is visited by the bizarre vision of a man in a bunny suit. The 'bunny' advises him that the world will end soon. I was expecting the 'bunny' to be a comic figure, but it is actually genuinely frightening.The great thing about 'Donnie Darko' is that everyone has their own take on the film, and an attendant explanation for the strange goings-on of the narrative. This is a challenging and unusual film which requires a high level of concentration. Who knew that Jake Gyllenhaal and Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays Donnie's sister, Elizabeth, would go on to become A list stars? As another reviewer observed, you will either love or hate 'Donnie Darko'. It does not give up its secrets easily, and requires work on the part of the viewer. The soundtrack is wonderful, featuring such artists as The Church ('Under the Milky Way'), Echo and the Bunnymen (appropriate!) ('The Killing Moon'), Joy Division ('Love Will Tear Us Apart'), and Gary Jules ('Mad World', originally a hit for British popsters Tears For Fears). The film is set in 1988 and features great period detail.Personally, I much prefer the theatrical version to the Director's Cut. Ironically, the Director's Cut was meant to explain things that were not clear in the theatrical version. I found it even more confusing! 'Donnie Darko' embraces a strange and troubled character. The hero of the film is not some Hollywood cliché, but a possibly delusional young man who is witty and immediately likable. A great performance from Jake, as usual. If you are looking for something superficial and easy to follow, then you have come to the wrong place! But if you are willing to concentrate and take a strange, unpredictable journey, you will definitely be rewarded.</fullReview>

His acting made the movie for me. The movie is sort of confusing, and you see things you didn't realize after you watch it a few times. There are lots of subplots, one of which involves Drew Barrymore who is a school English teacher. The set is fantastically done and very pretty. I honestly can't think of any bad things about Donnie Darko. The directing, acting, lighting, soundtrack--no complaints from here! If I had to say one bad thing about it it would probably be how confused I was after watching it for the first time. It's an amazing movie that you can definitely watch a couple of times and still be interested in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One night I was browsing threw channels, bored as hell, and I come across a peculiar movie on of all channels MTV. Jake Gyllenhaal is in an completely empty movie theater, beside him a snoozing Jena Malone, while only a seat away is a way is a man in a demonic bunny suit. I have hundreds of other choices. but I chose this film,which was half over and that I knew very little about. And yet I could not look away, and loathed every commercial between each segment. After that brief encounter I went to my local f.y.e. and bought the DVD, the director's cut to be exact. And ever since, this has been one of my all time favorite films.the atmosphere set up by the ominous way it's shot is just heart wrenching. Every time I watch it I can not take my eyes away for even a second. Richard Kelly is just a f*cking genius. it mixes so many genres, among them sci-fi, thriller, horror, even a teen drama I suppose. It's all blended together so excellently, it feels like a genre all its own. Heightening and sharpening this is just great, ominous, dark and gripping cinematography that definitely gives off the feel of a horror, but it is laden with so many other aspects. the choice of setting, both in time and place, allows the soundtrack to fit in quite well. Let alone the great songs, the score by Michael Andrews is just haunting and embodies the film perfectly.And the cast is so damn great! Everyone was so perfectly attuned to their character, and they all were were so enjoyable to watch. Whether it be Beth Grant as the conservative Kitty Farmer, or the other performance I enjoyed so much, that of Holmes Osborne as Mr. Darko. Patrick Swayze was awesome and funny, and Jena Malone played the very intriguing Gretchen Ross. The images of Frank are probably some of the most terrifying and memorable shots I can recount.Jake Gyllenhaal will forever be Donnie Darko to me. His performance is so similar to a phase we all go through in our lives, and undoubtedly some of us still struggle with it daily. Audiences will just feel so connected with these characters that they become real, which explains why many a fan read the book and probably believe this film is truly non-fiction. Despite the perplexing story I can almost see myself in his position.There are so many ways to interpret this film I could write three reviews really. It is obviously many things wrapped in one. Some view Donnie as a symbolic Jesus, while some others a complex story of 'possibilities'. I view it primarily as Donnie Darko's journey to enlightenment in a world he fills isolated both physically and spiritually. Along his journey Frank is guiding him towards the ultimate crusade to save all of mankind in more ways than one, destroying the chains of conservative philosophy, seemingly religion and fate itself, which is displayed threw Drew Barrymore's character and others. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is willing to think deeply about what they are viewing, and those who want mediocre predictable trash will not find it here. I also recommend viewing the The Director's Cut, though regardless it will take repeated viewing s to fully grasp it all.So, with all that said, I only have one question: Oh, please, tell me, how exactly does one suck a f*ck?" Good old Donnie Darko</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some will find it intriguing through its title character and his charisma, others will find it to be bizarre, me I found it to be both in a good way. It's conclusion will shock, and baffle most, leaving with the question of what happened. Donnie Darko (Gyllenhaal) is young high school student of Middlesex, with a troubled past, requiring him to take medication, and see a therapist on a weekly basis. In the wake of his most recent sleep walking incident, he has visions of an evil rabbit named Frank, who proclaims that the end of the world is coming within 4 weeks. I know, not many people will think of a rabbit as the so called evil that'll haunt a person. Usually dudes as disturbed as Donnie will imagine more crazy stuff, like ghosts, and even demons. Donnie's life is sparred in the wake of mysterious jet engine that fell into his room, as he yet again sleepwalked. You'll think, lucky bastard dodged a bullet, well trust me he won't be so lucky in the end. Among the 28 days that Donnie waits for the end, the life he lives gives viewers quite a view. Many things transpire in his school life that show viewers the kind of person Donnie is, and what could be his drive towards his death. His anger is manifested through his intelligence, his low opinion of fakers and hypocrites, as well those who are simple minded. Jim Cunningham (Swayze) a self help film promoter of "Conquering Fear" proves to be another faker, with dark secrets of his own to force Donnie hands. The Middle Sex High school gym teacher Mrs. Farmer (Grant) a simple minded honest to God and clearly a weirdo, pushes Donnie to insult her lack of education. Basically Donnie's anger is expressed further as he sees the worlds around him to be the unlikable way lives it. In fact there are few people Donnie actually respects. Donnie's supposed hallucinations grow into a further obsession with the concept of time travel. Reading up on the subject, viewers will never fully understand what he hopes to gain through the knowledge of time travel. Maybe he might use it on the last day to change the past. Nobody knows for what reason. It all becomes clear as the 30th of October, as his girlfriend dies, and the end is reverted back to the beginning, revealing that he'd already been reading the very exact book on time travel. His near death experience is repeated, only with the slight twist of his own death to top off the film's ending. I can't say the film's direction was very clear, despite being very amusing through the personal views and interpretations made by Gyllenhaal's character Darko. His performance is riveting, in the very disturbed nature that defines him, and often pushes him to his reverted predetermined death. He was not suicidal, however, his chance to find more too look forward too in death seemed to interest him more than the very world that disgusted and even challenged his nature of understanding. He is indeed a very strange and bizarre character. He will seem to many like a complete mystery in the paranoia in which he constantly acts on. But none the less his often popular, and then creepy manner of expression question the film's true goal. The film itself is a fantasy film that captures the times of the 80's through it's slow musical montages, and questions the very insecurities of other characters, particularly those that either experienced cruelty and doubt. Farmer, Cunningham, Cherita, and Gretchen, all these characters through the film's ending montage represent their depression. I can only see the purpose of that long glance for showing that just like Donnie, these characters experienced their own forms of weakness, only for Donnie to solve it, in not the most reasonable manner, but at least with a final and unchangeable result. The movie is just very weird for my understanding because I just taking my best guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Movie of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko, I actually could not believe that I have never written a review of one of my favorite movies of all time. I actually first saw this movie more than seven years ago and immediately fell in love with it. It is a movie that I proudly own and will never get tired of watching. This film has so many themes but principally teenage angst, social isolation, hallucinations/schizophrenia, time travel, metaphysics, parallel universes, and how choices that we make each day in life affect us. All set in the backdrop of a beautifully American, Virginia suburb in the heat of the 1988 presidential elections. Donnie Darko is a modern masterpiece of thought-provoking and emotionally haunting film-making. Genre: Sci-Fi/Drama/Fantasy/HorrorThe Good I never really liked Jake Gyllenhall, but this is by far his best work as an actor, his role as the title character takes the cake. Donnie Darko is a boy suffering from "Schizophrenia" and he sees hallucinations of a dreary giant bunny rabbit that warns him of the end of the world. He narrowly avoids a really strange incident that starts off a chain of events that will change his life forever. The human emotion displayed by all the characters is amazing. You will relate to the whole range of emotions in this movie. Donnie Darko is someone I can relate to very well as a boy who understands the deeper meaning of the Universe yet feels lonely and spiritually isolated because no one sees life in his level. His family is your typical suburban household in which no one seems to truly understand or get along with each other, but who nevertheless love each other. Another character Donnie Darko reminded me of was Holden Caulfield from "A Catcher in the Rye" as the boy who exposes the phoniness of the adults, especially self-help guru Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze). Along the way of Donnie trying to explain his hallucinations we encounter several very deep questions such as the "philosophy" of time travel, the meaning of love, choices we make in life, predestination, parallel universes and how genuine people are. The soundtrack of this movie really stands out "The Killing Moon" is a haunting track and then Head Over Heals by Tears for Fears and Mad World by Gary Jules leaves you absolutely loving the film. The best thing about this film is that you can watch this movie over and over again and still pick out new details from the movie and storyline, and you can even interpret the ending and themes in a variety of ways. The setting is perfect as well, as the movie takes place a seemingly perfect American suburb in October 1988 amidst the heat of the Presidential elections. The Bad: Nothing was bad about this film, except maybe the typical movie goer would find this film a tad weird or hard to understand. But this is why I love it.The Ugly: Roberta Sparrow as the crazy old lady with wild hair who holds the secret to time travel. Overall this is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. Some might compare this movie to "Butterfly Effect" but "Donnie Darko" did it earlier and better. Richard Kelly is an absolute genius filmmaker, I think he can officially be called a prodigy with this film. This is a movie that I can never stop watching just because it makes you think each time you watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatness of the Theatrical Release</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko, a dark and gripping story about a troubled and somewhat disturbed teenager and his friend Frank who tells him that the world is going to end in 28 Days, 6 Hours, 42 Minutes and 12 Seconds. Now what makes this movie great in my opinion is the overall mood and vagueness surrounding this movie. You're constantly thinking and wondering, trying to figure out a logical explanation for the events that happen. It is a movie that still leaves you thinking and wondering long after the movie is over.This is why i Highly Recommend watching the Theatrical Version. This version unlike the Directors Cut leaves you stunned and shocked at the end, and leaves everything wide open for your own interpretations. It's this version what makes this movie so great. The Directors Cut explains a whole lot more about the different events that occur in the movie. It explains mostly everything what in the Theatrical Version is left up to the viewer to interpret. In my opinion it makes the whole movie a lot less appealing, by taking away what a big part of what makes this movie so great.By my opinion only watch the Directors Cut if you've seen the Theatrical Release a few times end still don't understand any of it. I even recommend doing some reading about this movie on the web before even thinking about the Directors Cut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is the first, and perhaps the best motion picture of the young director Richard Kelly. With an interesting cast, that includes new Hollywood faces like Noah Whyle, Drew Barrymore, the Gyllenhaal brothers, Jena Malone and Seth Rogen with more experienced artists such as Mary McDonell, Katherine Ross, Patrick Swayze, Beth Grant and Holmes Osborne, the movie was produced with a low budget and shot in a very short period of time.Now, we have Donnie Darko: The director's cut, a DVD that includes 15 more minutes than the original film, which represents the real work Kelly and his crew did. Set in 1988, the movie narrates the story of Donnie Darko, a troubled teenager that suffers from schizophrenia. One of his hallucinations, in the form of a giant rabbit called Frank, tells him that the world will come to an end in exactly 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds.This singular event is accompanied with the fact that a plane motor falls in Donnie's bed at midnight (he's saved because Frank's appearance). Since then, the facts of the history and the situations the characters are in, seem to drag them to that imminent end. Kelly shows Donnie's world, with his parents (Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonell), his sisters, his psychiatrist (Katherine Ross), his teachers and girlfriend (Jena Malone).Donnie Darko tells a complex but well worked story. Understood in first moment as a psycho-thriller, the film combines effectively elements of comedy (with acid sarcasm), drama and science fiction. The 80's background is also greatly accurate, in its political and social context, where we can see Donnie as a teenager looking for the truth, affected by two visions of the world: one of the annoying teacher Kitty Farmer (Grant) and the hypocrite Jim Cunningham (Swayze), that represent the most conservative side of the American way of life; and the other, represented by teachers Monitoff y Pomeroy (good performances of Whyle y Barrymore), young and in-conformist characters at the school.With outstanding and realistic special effects, a precise direction and an open final, Donnie Darko is a great surprise and an interesting and unclassified movie; a sort of gem in the American film industry: a total win for its director, who was awarded with more than 10 prizes for the film, mostly in independent film Festivals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dude, It's Destiny........ but Deeper!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a film about a disturbed adolescent who is searching for his placement within the universe. A series of events leads Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) on a quest to correct an error that he caused in the world. Because Donnie Darko dodged his destined death, he envisions that the world will cease to exist in 28 days. Donnie Darko becomes desperate to fix this dilemma, so he follows the guidance of an imaginary friend. The messenger, a creepy rabbit named Frank (James Duval), becomes Darko's adviser throughout the film, instructing him on how to correct the glitch in the universe. The film Donnie Darko implies that if time and actions are predetermined by a metaphysical force, then any disruption of an imminent destiny will adversely break down and destroy the universe. Donnie Darko shows that an individual can not cheat their own destiny. In order to illustrate this theme, we must examine the visions Donnie began to have after the engine of the plane crashed onto his empty bed. At first, the visions began like warnings. Frank would appear to Donnie and advise him that the world was coming to an end. These scenes typically took place when Donnie was alone, usually while he was in his bedroom or bathroom, gazing into his mirror. Because destiny is a personal matter, it was appropriate for these scenes to take place in a bedroom or bathroom, using close up shots, while he was tending to personal hygiene. The deep-focus shots of Donnie, with Frank in the background, gave the impression that the only thoughts going through Donnie's brain at the time were thoughts of the tasks that Frank was demanding. The mirrors utilized for their camera effects during the tripped out scenes can also be used as a symbol for self reflection. Self-reflection, with Frank's guidance, eventually led to Donnie's self discovery. It can even be determined by Donnie's scenes in solitude that in order for him to cleanse himself fully of his crime against humanity, he needed to visualize the completion of his tasks. In order for Donnie to visualize being successful in his quest, he needed to self reflect on what brought him to this point. Mirrors serve as a motif throughout the film. The lighting used during the self discovery scenes and during the scenes with Frank was low-key. The dimness in these scenes was necessary to set the emotion of darkness and uncertainty. The film Final Destination employs a paralleled theme in its interpretation of destiny by a supernatural design. Final Destination starts off with a similar account of an adolescent avoiding his own death. Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) had a realistic premonition about a plane, which he was a passenger on, crashing with him and his friends aboard. Moments later, after waking from his dream, he causes a substantial commotion and gets his group kicked off the plane. While watching from the airport window, the group witnessed their plane crash and burn. Throughout the film Alex continued to have visions of each one of his friends dying right before their deaths occurred. He then realized that it was their destiny to die on the plane and forces beyond his power were going to cause those deaths to occur. All of the friends die in the film; and the world remained in sync because their fatal destiny would prove unavoidable.On a grander scale, destiny can be somewhat of a grim theme to explore in film and in life. Donnie Darko shows us that a catastrophic event will occur if there is a single hiccup in a destiny's design. However, Final Destination suggests that there is absolutely no escaping a fatal destiny because that destiny will hunt you down and slaughter you! After examination, no matter which arena the theme is presented in the result of the game is: DESTINY-10/ HUMANS-0</fullReview>

Except the creepy bunny Frank. He's a very cold character with his mind extremely focused, yet reluctantly calm. The atmosphere is quite well made and the plot manages to keep a interesting level until the end. It's easy to see why so many people like this movie so much. It might be somewhat overrated, but is still a very good film.It's worth multiple views, and that's what makes this movie count</fullReview>

She was right, I didn't, however about 3 weeks later, I came across an article on the top films of the decade, upon further thought, I went out and bought it. It's a great film, the strange darkness that underlies in every scene is superior to anything I have seen before. Okay it's really weird and it doesn't make much sense, but that I one of the reasons why I liked it, I liked the way Richard Kelly adds a small amount of dark humour when dealing with the characters.

		<shortDescription>Top 10 of the 2000s!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost forgot about this film! Maybe because it came out at the beginning of the decade, or maybe because it doesn't have a real big name cast and is populated with a healthy assortment of newcomers, or maybe because it is perhaps one of the WEIRDEST films that I've ever seen! A lot of maybes. But there is one definite. DONNIE DARKO (2001) is an incredibly involving, often hilarious, and monumentally provocative film. I saw it not long after it came out due to it's instant cult status. I really enjoyed it the first time I saw it, but because it was the early part of the decade, I didn't figure that this would be one of the films that would end up being the BEST of the decade. Now, when I think back, this film is EASILY among my personal top 10.DONNIE DARKO stars newcomer Jake Gyllenhaal (in a sorely underrated and brilliant performance). Gyllenhaal is the titular star and gives one of the most complex, thought-provoking performances of the decade. In retrospect, he should have been nominated for Best Actor. He carries the film as good (better I say) than many older, established actors have carried more acclaimed, awarded works in the decade. A very realistic portrayal of a "schizophrenic" personality.Donnie is a disturbed, suburbanite high-schooler in the mid-1980s and at the film's outset, survives a plane engine crashing into his bedroom as he was out sleepwalking during one of his schizo episodes. The FAA has no idea where the plane part emanated from. A strange "bunny" named Frank acts as his guide throughout the film, telling Donnie that in 30 days, the world is going to end. During this 30 days, while in total awake mode, in addition to Frank, Donnie starts seeing these creepy watery-looking visions that come out of people. Also, there is this cooky old lady, Grandma Death, who wrote a book about time travel, that lives on the outskirts of town that is a key figure in the proceedings. Donnie investigates and finds that time travel may be a possibility.There is actually debate about what is going on during this strange month that Donnie experiences (1) Is it an alternate universe that has opened up due to the plane engine creating and travelling through a rift in time? (2) Is it Donnie's hallucination? (3) Is it a vision that bunny Frank is showing Donnie of what "would have happened" had he not returned to his bed and gone back to sleep? I also think that the conclusions of what would have happened are ambiguous as well. Will it really have been the end of the world if Donnie hadn't done the heroic thing? Or would it just mean that the world would have branched off into an alternate reality? Or was all of this just one of Donnie's hallucinations that he had during that night? Of course, at first viewing, I just thought the whole thing was weird. Upon repeat, thought, I understand it a lot more. Even without a total grip on the sci-fi aspects of DONNIE DARKO, the film is filled with many universal, human truths. If anything, DONNIE DARKO is a life lesson and a journey more than a sci-fi film. Donnie is so evolved from his peers (and even his parents and teachers) that he seems like an otherworldy being at times. This is part of the film's magic and charm. Donnie is almost "godlike" with a sense of himself and the world.The excellent supporting cast includes newcomer Jena Malone as Donnie's girlfriend, Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell as his parents, Maggie Gyllenhall (Jake's real life sis) and Daveigh Chase as his sisters, ERs Noah Wyle (in a terrific, understated role as Donnie's science teacher), Drew Barrymore as his English teacher, veteran Katharine Ross as his pyschiatrist, Beth Grant in a wonderfully hilarious performance as Donnie's gym teacher Mrs. Farmer, and last but not least the late Patrick Swayze in a revelatory performance as motivational speaker Jim Cunningham. I also think that Grant and Swayze should have received Supporting nominations for their work in this film.The ending of DONNIE DARKO packs one of the biggest emotional punches I've ever experienced in a film. By the time I was done watching it, I felt I was on a higher plane, right up there with Donnie Darko!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, funny, creepy, and full of questions to wrap your brain around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko has something to do with time travel and something to do with fate. The fun of the film is that it asks a lot of questions and doesn't provide many answers. It creates a strange mythology that boggles minds upon repeat viewings. The fun of watching the film is that people find themselves developing many theories. Any film that achieves cult status involves a certain mythology, like we've found ourselves in the middle of something grand and we're only given a glimpse of whats actually going on. Donnie Darko is a well crafted "hero" of sorts. To what end is up to the viewer to decide. He's horribly flawed yet has a huge burden to carry as we approach the closure of the film.What is often overlooked about this film is the deconstruction of 80s suburbia. "The end of the world" is often mentioned in the film and Donnie Darko's character is often unraveling those uncomfortable truths about a hidden facade of safety in suburbia. His family looks perfect in the very beginning til they start cursing and discussing politics at the dinner table. What kids are learning at school is questioned by an ignorant parent, while they question vandalism at the school. The local clean cut celebrity Dr. Cunningham has a dark secret. Suddenly their world becomes a little unsafe, all thanks to Donnie Darko. All this is done with a dark, and devilish sense of humor.I didn't care for the director's cut as much. The fun of this film is in its mythos and lack of explanation. The sci fi fantasy of the film is great as well as the suburban satire. Read too much into it, you might enjoy it less. To me though, the film seems to be a happy accident, as Richard Kelly, in all his indulgences, hasn't reproduced this kind of magic. It's a special near perfect film that loses its enjoyment with too much analysis.</fullReview>

A release date has not been announced, but a Fox spokesman said the studio is looking to have the film in theaters late next year.Associated Press" My response to this news: (and please pardon me for quoting meself) "Richard Kelly already effectively did this with "Donny Darko", the "Harvey" for the 21st Century. I don't have a lot of faith in SS not making something sappy starring the new Jimmy Stewart, Tom Hanks. Yuck!"

		<fullReview>It's taken me 5 years to finally "get" this movie and now I don't know how (although I always liked it), I never really fully appreciated it before. Talk about waiting for the penny to drop! It has to be watched in it's entirety with a completely open mind. If you are one of those people that makes up their mind about a film after a few minutes, Donnie Darko is not for you, but then you'd also be missing out on Mulholland Drive, Twelve Monkeys and other genius mind bending work of celluloid art that will pass you by. Your loss. Where this is unique (amongst those other greats) is in it's sheer complexity and that is also where it will lose viewers, but if any film ever deserves to be repeatedly viewed, analysed and savoured, all for the ultimate goal of simply understanding it, this is it.It may take repeated viewings, much debate and many years (as in my case) to understand it all, but Donnie Darko is an absolute work of art that should be seen by everyone who loves clever and thought provoking film.Utterly phenomenal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is purely about personal interpretation. I think that subjectivity plays an important part in any film, but Donnie Darko makes this its strength. Whether you like this film or not, you won't be able to find anyone with the exactly same opinion. Some people think that certain things did occur, when others may differ in the reason they think that made those things occur.It is a highly enjoyable movie with really interesting characters. A strong story and a clever script along with good performances make this film very original. It is a shame that nobody put attention to this film when it was released, but that often happens to really good movies (for example Fight Club).I recommend this film strongly, even if this film is not for everyone since it's a little confusing at first and many people will lack the focus to enjoy it until the end. I was included in that group before. My cousin had rented this movie and I was hesitant since I didn't hear anything about this film so I had really low expectations. But when it ended I was blown away by its magic. I'm grateful that I got the chance to watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director's Cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Kelly wrote and directed this opulent modern vision. It comes straight from his own mind and heart, and it doesn't stop coming until it can only be called his. When such a collaborative thing like a movie can converge as predominantly the ideas of an only fraction of the amount of people who contribute to a film's making, whether or not it is great, you have seen the work of a powerful filmmaker. It is definitively original. Even if it were not so inventive a story, Donnie Darko would still be original because it can most certainly be said to have originated from its maker.It only makes sense for Kelly's story to revolve around a Nietzschean superman in the most close-to-home and identifiable way. A swarthy Jake Gyllenhaal plays the title character, a troubled teen and unassuming madman. Or a superhero. Of course not in the customary mold but nevertheless an individual who makes the ultimate sacrifice to save the world within the view of more recent generations as he shakes the algorithmic fabric of everyday life in his reactions of disgust and vitriol to the hypocrisy of the status quo of his environment.In its refiguring use of time and its uniquely transcendent effect on a single central character, it is deeply reminiscent of Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five. But really, there are different ways to read the fundamental interpretation of the film, though there are many. Kelly is deliberate, though not exactly subtle, in his use of hints through references to Graham Greene's The Destroyers and Richard Adams' Watership Down, the latter apparently new to the Director's Cut. The direct presentation of passages from The Philosophy of Time Travel book give us intermissions to decode the sometimes oddball occurrences in the plot without allowing them approval to go to the extreme and hammer us with infodumps.But while the speculatively supernatural facets reveal a ambitiously vivid imagination, Donnie Darko affords a parallel in its savvy depiction of the real world, the key to which is how the most motivated forces of Donnie's life propel him towards the references I previously mentioned. Kelly portrays what it feels like to be in high school, no matter where you are. In encapsulating the confusion and suffering of high school, he provides observations what could lead young people to acts of violence against their peers. Aside from the right-wing religious dingbats who rail against Donnie's own personal belief system, not to mention those of the tired and repressed characters around him, Kelly shows the casual cruelty of other kids, the posses, the kids who don't fit in, the snail pace and the occasional inspired points in time.Gyllenhaal makes Donnie the ultimate onslaught to adults: Brilliant and inquisitive. Gyllenhaal's performance is acidic, sensitive and beneath it all, crushingly sweet. Kelly familiarly relates Donnie's family life. The scenes between Donnie and his sisters, one of them played by Jake's real life sister Maggie, scream their acquaintances with our own observations throughout life. The parents are truly caring but are often at a loss for how to handle their son. The first scene of dialogue is a cleverly subjective way of looking into a fiscally conservative household who doesn't realize how socially liberal they are. One scene, supposedly newly restored to the Director's Cut, with the father who condemns most people for being full of ...it and commends his son for being a challenge to them, is welcome and reveals another dimension to the older character. And alternative dimension is definitely a prevalent theme.The film ponders the perfect modern query: What if the universe as we know it, not just as we respectively conceptualize it, indeed isn't as we logically perceive it? In making the everyday as complicated as the cosmic, Donnie Darko has the fortitude to endures as a koan to many even in its sensed audience. Kelly headlong facilitates uncensored expression of the universal conscious with broad parody and satire with purposeful psychodrama and reveals action and events no one could foresee but him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko (original, not directors cut)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very rare film, one that doesn't come out that often and in many ways is not as aware of how big it actually is and how close to the truth about realities. In the film, each reality has its own time line and events that must happen within it, because time is predestined and has already happened in a sense, all events that occur are going to play out exactly as they are meant to, however, if something occurs that changes a reality in the slightest amount, a divergent realty will be entered by the characters involved. As we see in the film, because Donnie isn't killed by the jet engine Frank and Gretchen are killed in what appears to be a random set of events but is actually set up to play out exactly as they should, and Donnie is urged to push into a divergent reality by the rabbit, where he burns down the perverts house, thus enacting a separate chain of events, and breaking the water main at the school which allows him to walk Gretchen home. When we see Donnie killed by the jet engine at the end, we are then at the beginning of another reality, where Donnie and Gretchen hadn't met, yet we see some familiar essence exists between the higher energy connection between Donnie's mother and Gretchen. Before Donnie is killed by the jet engine, he is laughing because he has realized he doesn't ever really die, just splinters into divergent realities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling, intelligent, fresh, and deliciously weird...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to place DONNIE DARKO in a particular genre; while it is hard science fiction at its core, it contains all the elements of a dark and brooding psychological thriller, done in a uniquely fresh and quirky way. It has become a cult hit over the years, especially among Science (particularly Physics) fanatics like myself. Richard Kelly in his directorial debut has created a monster here, as this film has sparked (and will continue to spark) numerous intellectual and scientific (and philosophical) debates the likes of which Kelly himself will not be able to comprehend. And therein lies the majesty of the film...My advice to potential viewers would be to obtain the Director's Cut DVD which goes some appreciable way to actually explaining the events that transpire by making references to the literature material featured in the film. The original version does very little to explain what happened and will have many viewers scratching their heads trying to understand the implications of the ending.Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect as the delusional, unstable, and troubled Donnie Darko, and after seeing this performance, it is difficult to picture Jason Schwartzman (who was originally cast) as the lead. Jena Malone and Patrick Swayze also provide useful support to our beloved protagonist. While Drew Barrymore was arguably the biggest star at the time, some of her scenes are not really necessary and take something away from the movie. In fact my only real complaint about the movie is its ~110 minute run-time; the film was in need of a more ruthless editor to cut out some of the 'redundant' scenes in order to make the movie more tense and gripping.This film is unique, compelling, smart, funny at times, and ultimately rewarding, and contains some brilliantly-used special effects to keep viewers enthralled. It is not a movie that viewers will be able to watch just once; as they will find themselves coming back to see things they missed before. In fact, Film4 lists this as one of the 50 films you should see before you die (#9), and rightly so.I give this movie 3.5 stars (out of 4) and 9/10. It should enter my Top 100 at around #94. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate Sci-Fi film with true realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko (Gyllenhaal) suffers from visions of a rabbit called Frank who orders him to commit a series of crimes and tells him that the world will end in 28 days time.The Sci-Fi genre has always been open as to what is out there in the universe, discovering new and exciting worlds and dimensions, and an ideology which today is still being experimented with is time travel, which is explored beautifully in Richard Kelly's absorbing and open Sci-Fi drama.Can time travel be achieved? With all the evidence collected in this 2001 film it seems so, and the persistent view, looking at all the possibilities such as worm holes and vessels carries all the way through to an open and stunning climax as we follow one of the most interesting characters of all time.Jake Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain) leads in only his second major film as Darko, a distant teenager who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and Jake creates a modern day teenage icon, a simple enough guy who lashes out at the world and stands by his own beliefs, and not to mention the Halloween costume is one of the best in cinematic history.Jena Malone (Into the Wild) Barrymore (E.T) Swayze (Dirty Dancing) lend great support to with their character's personalities and opinions.This is an opinionated film with plenty of ideas to engage you into thinking mode. Kelly helps add an extra dimension to this film by including modern day issues such as religion, teenage rebellion, and fear.The use of God mixed with the complex idea of time travel achieves a dark but colourful imagination and controversy to the narrative.Darko's actions against the school and bullies is a conflict between his beliefs and the schools rules and is especially significant to the overall picture, and Kelly's direction for the first vandalism "They made me do it" is terrific in achieving that drama and black comedy.The use of fear being negative and love as positive is a great reflection on human emotion and behaviour, and goes a long way to shaping the characters and is a terrific reflection on modern day rules and Darko proves a point in that emotions simply don't fall into these two categories, inviting audiences in to his world and sharing his opinion.This film justifies the drama genre through these realistic issues, and dives deep into the fantasy genre with Darko's visions of a rabbit that can see the future. Frank is the ultimate fantastic fantasy creation, a simple but highly effective symbol, as is this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Uh, where do I begin? This movie has perhaps leaded me towards insanity! Like a few other comments I have read, I agree completely that this movie does not have only one way to be interpreted. I literally have thought about this movie for hours going over each detail and scenario that it could follow. If only I could ask the director himself, Richard Kelly, what exactly he is trying to get across to everyone (from his point of view). I have come up with 3 possibilities that are , I admit, very debatable (and hopefully will be retorted to me!)... (1): This movie is about how Donnie is a substitute of God, especially since the subject of God and atheism and agnosticism were brought up on several accounts. And since Donnie is God-like, he is therefore some type of superhero that ultimately saves the world from Frank's predetermined "Oblivion Date" by sacrificing himself through time travel. He realizes that with his existence, he is only doing damage, and well, death, to the ones he loves. This view, however, of course overlooks details that would possibly sway someone to think otherwise, which brings me to? (2): Donnie is the opposite of God, and is perchance "Satan-derived" simply because we see him perform mischievous acts throughout the movie. Frank seems to be leading Donnie through all of this, and Frank is perceived to the audience to be evil because he is dressed creepily and speaks of death. But isn't Donnie producing these hallucinations in the first place? Which would make him some sort of root of the evil? Even though he's unaware of what exactly is happening to himself ? at least until the end, when he decides to sacrifice himself? Yet if he's evil, why would he do such good in such a selfless act?... (3): Is it all a dream? Since Donnie does go back in time and in a sense "erases" what we, the audience, have seen for the past 132 minutes, the story is just a possibility, something that maybe has happened and no one knows about it because of what Donnie in the end did. Kelly is proposing that time travel is perhaps possible, and therefore he opens a doorway to another dimension where the phrase "What If?" becomes monotonous. That, people, defines the genre: fantasy. And the word Destiny comes to mind.All in all, I love the movie. It was a "Cellar Door." I forced half of my friends to watch it! And thereafter we had a minimum of an hour of discussion on what we thought this movie meant! All of the details, themes, motifs, ..everything. And I still see much more every time I watch it. ..And if someone is uncomfortable with me sectioning all of the little details together to make "theories" of what the hell this movie is about, you can always just look at the movie altogether, messy and uncoordinated, but somehow alluring and thought-provoking, a movie that you probably will not forget. And that, movie buffs, would take days to ponder over. When do we start!?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gotta say, this film is simply incredible. I have a lot of words that pop into my head when thinking of Donnie Darko. Here are a few: mesmerizing, captivating, unique, intelligent, odd, masterful.The film is all about a suburban teen in October of 1988 named Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal from Zodiac), who is highly intelligent and a little strange. After cheating death when a jet engine crashes through his bedroom, Donnie begins having visions of a demonic looking rabbit named Frank. Frank shows Donnie visions of the future and sometimes tells him to commit crimes.Here is the real review: the cast is a whole bunch of stars. You have Drew Barrymore (Scream), Jake Gyllenhaal and Patrick Swayze (Dirty Dancing) that are probably the most well known in the cast. Daveigh Chase (The Ring) and Maggie Gyllenhaal (The Dark Knight) are also in the film. Richard Kelly also makes his directorial debute in this movie and proves to have a true talent for film-making in this strange but very good tale. The character of Donnie Darko is also kind of the male version of Carrie White (from the Stephen King novel and the Brian De Palma film), he is an outcast with a destiny in life.The film is a good mix of several different genres. The film has the Scifi element of incorporating time travel. It also has a horrific qualities when you see Frank. Also, last but not least, the romance of Donnie and his girlfriend, Gretchen Ross (Jenna Malone).The bottom line is that Donnie Darko is one great movie. It has a well-deserved cult following. I HIGHLY recommend that you watch it.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderfully Made Film with a Flawed Premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to say first that I really enjoyed this film...for the first 100 minutes, I thought it was the best I'd seen in years. My problem came with the ending. Although there is more explanation in the director's cut of "Donnie Darko", it does nothing to change the fact that this is three different films, but the ending picks one (science fiction) and renders the other two possibilities (a religious parable or a film about teenage angst) moot. That said, the acting is great, the writing is sharp, the editing is crisp...one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I understand why many younger people feel so passionately about it. I am a few years older than the director (I graduated high school in 1983) so I also appreciate the generational quality of the film.My problem is, for the first 90 minutes of the film, I thought I was watching a really fantastic film about a young man who might be schizophrenic, with all that entailed for his family and friends. I began to wonder if the religious allegories might be more appropriate. Then, with the ending, it suddenly became nothing more than "Groundhog Day" or "Memento"...a better-than-average Twilight Zone "alternate universe story". I might have suspected this at the very beginning (when the jet engine should have killed Donnie) but thought this was a leading to something grander than the old "you have a month to get your life in order" scenario. I really did like it, but I have to give a strong negative for this cheated feeling I had after. This is what always results from a "deux ex machina", which Donnie actually mumbles at the end, his tormentor's knife at his throat. "What the f**k did you say?" the bully responds, and I groaned to Mr. Kelly, the director, "thanks for telling me NOW." Too bad. My complaints are much more eloquent detailed by Lawrence Person, who reviewed the film for Locus: http://www.locusmag.com/2003/Reviews/Person04_Darko.html</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I could give this movie a 20 I would.Donnie Darko was at first a movie I was not interested in.Usually, movies that involve parallel universes are full of non sense and make ridiculous statements.Donnie Darko paints a familiar picture with space and time.A frightening, yet beautiful script which fits in with unforgettable acting.This movie gave me quite a scare. To think of the end of the world coming so soon, is very frightening. Intertwining characters with anxious teenagers, Gretchen and Donnie, as well as Cherita and Barrymore, all characters, big or small, all play some role in this play, (Obviously)There are no "nobodies" in Donnie Darko. I was surprised to find that this was Kelley's first film.If you are intellectual enough, this movie is not as much of a challenge to grasp.If you are looking for a simple movie, Donnie Darko is most definitely NOT for you.I am probably repeating myself, but as a final statement, this movie is twisted, disgusting, amazing, realistic, and extremely raw, but for a single word: my summary, beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I ended up renting Donnie Darko about a year ago, seeing it at the store. I had heard of it before, and just blindly decided to rent it after seeing the cover. Once the movie began and all the way till after it finished, I knew it was definitely something special.From the 6-ft bunny rabbit, to Jake Gyllenhaal's spell-binding performance, to the freaky plot and thrilling, intertwining story, to Richard Kelly's imagery and imagination, this is personally one of the greatest movies of all time, a massive achievement in film of the 21st century. For movies like Pirates of the Caribbean and Spider-Man to rip up the box office and have such great success, with independent flicks like Donnie Darko to be pushed aside is unbelievable and horrible to see.Although dark, psychologically trancing, mind-fillingly creative, Donnie Darko has made a major impact on the many who have watched it. A classic cult-hit teen movie. If you watch it, you will have to watch it again. An addicting, awe-inspiring tale of unparalleled psychological thrilling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no way I can write something that will give you an idea of how truly amazing this movie is. It can't be crammed into one category or tried to be explained at all, but it's for sure a movie you got to watch before you die. Donnie Darko is a journey. That's the only way I can think of it. The most beautiful one ever imagined. The main character's doubts, confusion, intelligence and blunt innocence will make sure to keep you hooked. Jake Gyllenhaal couldn't have done a better job. From his body language to his light stutter and distant eyes, while he is in front of those cameras, he is not himself anymore. He IS Donnie Darko. In a way you will only understand once you've watched the movie. It's simply genius. it'll knock you out. And after you've watched it, you will never be the same. 11/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko. I think of every movie I have ever watched, this one has stuck the most, and has certainly stayed in my mind for the longest. I am almost ashamed to admit that I spent the better part of three days watching this film. Eight times in three days.When I first saw Donnie Darko, I was a little confused. Was it a teen drama? A black comedy? Sci-fi? Or just a trippy indie flick? The answer is really what Darko is about. It's perception. It's every aspect and genre of this movie that makes it so perfect.The performances, to begin with, are pretty much fantastic. Jake Gyllenhaal proved that he wasn't just a pretty face by portraying the best interpretation of a NORMAL teenage boy I've ever seen, even disregarding the extra issues Donnie had to deal with. He has a love/hate relationship with his bratty sister (spot-on performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal), an up and down, constantly developing love for his mother and father, a need for acceptance and understanding, love, sex, knowledge, and normalcy. He's incredibly creepy and sometimes even mean while remaining likable, relatable and making the audience feel for him, but never come too close to pity.Mary McDonnell delivers and amazing part as Donnie's mother, who's careful involvement in Donnie's life seems believable and makes us all wish we had a mother like that as a teenager. The always wonderful Jena Malone makes us wonder why she stays with Donnie yet completely understand why she understands him. Holmes Osbourne, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wyle, Katharine Ross and Beth Grant are among the many underrated actors involved in Darko.The only performance that was not spot-on was Drew Barrymore as Dr. Pomeroy, the smart, bold English teacher. She seemed to be trying, but the truth is she didn't quite make it.The combination of music and stylism contribute to the atmosphere of the film. It stays true to it's name with the ever contrasting color schemes. In the bright classrooms of Donnie's catholic schools, there are kids and teachers in colorful eighties clothes, but the mood quickly changes as Donnie is sent into Frank's world. The lighting dims, Donnie's "other" side emerges, and the entire mood of the film changes effortlessly.The pop tunes are unexpected and still manage to fit perfectly, and the ending selection of Gary Jules' cover of the Tears for Fears song, Mad World, is haunting in the truest definition of the world.There is no question that Richard Kelly put his head and heart into writing Donnie Darko, and although it can become discouraging when, especially after watching the Director's Cut, Kelly believes the ambiguous, mysterious POINT of Darko is meant to be a strictly sci-fi view, we can all continue to watch the film and imagine the many different interpretations.Donnie Darko is the most connective film of the 20th century, perhaps long before that, and probably long after. The fact that it's sometimes difficult to put together the pieces just proves that Donnie is the embodiment of every average teenager: the world isn't always easy to understand. Life isn't always in black and white. And at times, it can seem very, very dark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A highly intricate multi-genre success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can't really classify "Donnie Darko." It's not really a horror film though many parts are told that way. It's not really science-fiction although it is focused on time travel. It's also not really a drama because it has several humorous parts. All that considered, it's not surprising that the film fell under the radar and developed a cult-classic reputation. The reason being that whoever had the task of distributing this film would have a hard time figuring out how to advertise it. But for film lovers, that doesn't matter, because no matter how you identify "Donnie Darko," you're likely to at least deem it a good if not great film."Darko" takes place in the Maryland suburbs and centers around the life of its title character and his family. Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a troubled teen with a troubled past that only gets worse when he starts sleepwalking at the beg and call of a giant bunny named Frank who tells him the world will end in 28 days and leads him to commit a series of crimes. Along the way, Donnie finds himself learning about time travel, wrestling philosophically with his teachers and he becomes involved with a girl named Gretchen (Jena Malone from "Stepmom"). The film makes out to be a character study of Donnie but eventually becomes much more than that.Gyllenhaal is excellent as the intelligent but clearly off-kilter Donnie. The schizophrenia is portrayed all too well by the actor of course with the help of Richard Kelly, who really creates a believable distinction between normal and deranged Donnie. Mary McDonnell as Donnie's mother is also very good as is his sister, his also biological sister Maggie Gyllenhaal. Even Drew Barrymore as Donnie's English teacher stands out in this film.While the acting is good, this is clearly Richard Kelly's film. He has without question put an incredible amount of thought into this project and it really shows. While the time travel aspect of the plot is pretty out there, Donnie is definitely portrayed as a realistic teen in a realistic family with normal family issues. At no point do you feel forced to come to terms with the ridiculousness of the premise. You are pulled in by who and what Frank is and the film delivers on that end as well. Rarely do supernatural characters come down to earth like Frank does in the film. Kelly's juxtaposing sequences and fades make the film a very effective mood piece as well. At first you're expecting something more out of the horror genre, but eventually that simply becomes part of the many moods that makes "Donnie Darko" so unique.Perhaps the film's only true weakness is that thematically it feels a bit jumpy and cluttered. There is a lot going on and a lot to think about and it doesn't seem to feel connected from scene to scene. As the film ends you begin to think about the many different ideas raised and not one clear thing comes to mind. While it does make it rather rich for discussion, it's hard to come away with exactly what Kelly was trying to say. Perhaps the biggest idea is the very clearly established continuum that runs between extreme fear and extreme love. Those ideas echo throughout everything although sometimes clearer than others.Perhaps the genre that it is assigned (independent) serves "Donnie Darko" best, but the film clearly demonstrates in ability to cross lines and appeal to everyone, mostly through its intricacy. You can tell Kelly knew exactly what he wanted in every shot and what little hints and trivia he wanted to drop throughout the film. "Darko" goes to show that films about people at their core, regardless the genre "assigned" them can affect people and impact a wide audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In an ordinary world we could peer out of our quaint kitchen windows and find gentle bunny rabbits frolicking in our gardens, munching on our freshly mowed green grass and nestling under bushes. However, in the world of 'Donnie Darko the bunny rabbit is quite a different animal! Richard Kelly's cult film 'Donnie Darko' presents a demonic, human-sized rabbit, who announces to a mentally-ill teenager that the world is doomed to end in 18 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds. However this is only before the adolescent is lured from his bedroom at midnight, narrowly escaping death from a crushing jet engine that crashes into his bedroom. Donnie spends the movie on a journey to self discovery, embracing his schizophrenic state and differentiating between what is reality and what is fantasy. Set in 1988 during the presidential elections 'Donnie Darko' is centered on a teenage boy named Donnie, played by Jake Gyllenhaal who suffers delusions from schizophrenia. Confronted by this rabbit, who promptly informs Donnie that his name is Frank on his village golf course, Donnie feels it is his responsibility to save the world before it ends on Halloween night. Frequently skipping his medication Donnie's delusions become more frequent and more vivid, giving him the added responsibility of deciding what is real and what is not. Director Richard Kelly pays homage within the film to countless other famous flicks like Back to the Future, The Last Temptation of Christ and E.T which also features Donnie's English Teacher, actress Drew Barrymore. Both written and directed by Kelly, 'Donnie Darko' is the budding film maker's first full length film however he has directed two short films in 1996 and 1997 called 'The Goodbye Place' and 'Visceral Matter'. In spite of his lack of experience in the film world, respectively Kelly's 'Donnie Darko' has achieved and maintained a legendary cult status among viewers. Whether this is due to its appealing cast, engaging story line or eye questioning special effects is anyone's guess. Made clear through the film it is evident that Kelly possesses a fetish for time travel, the supernatural and questions of faith. With the dream soundtrack of any 80's teenager that is sure to satisfy all tastes 'Donnie Darko' features a variety of 80s classics. These include Joy Divisions 'Love Will Tear Us Apart', Tears for Fears 'Head Over Heels' and Duran Duran's 'Notorious'. They are a continuous reminder of the films 80's setting as well as a reflection of the teenage angst felt by Donnie. With a slim budget of $4.5 million you wouldn't expect much from this first time director. However I shortly found an understanding for its renowned cult status after watching the film for myself. Not very popular with critics upon its release in 2001 Donnie Darko found a large fan base when it went to video and DVD release, remaining in the hearts and minds of all those who've had the pleasure of viewing this cinematic masterpiece. Actor Jake Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain, Bubble Boy) does an excellent job portraying the warped teenager, revealing the sexual frustrations of male adolescents, the relentless desire to belong and a boy's search for the answer to life's questions. Oscar nominated actress Mary McDonnell plays his concerned mother and his own sibling, Maggie Gyllenhaal (Secretary, Mona Lisa Smile), portrays his rebellious older sister. Donnie's love interest is played by rising star Jena Malone (Life as a House, Pride and Prejudice), who's character has a sordid past and the chosen pseudonym of Gretchen Ross. Dirty Dancing stud Patrick Swayze is the mortal enemy of Donnie playing a self help guru with dark secrets who comes to Donnie's school preaching the idea that emotion is simply divided between fear and love. Donnie disagrees, thinking it's a monetary ploy and in his rebellious wisdom is elected by Frank to see to the demise of Cunningham and reveal him as the fraud that he is. Interestingly Donnie's high school nemesis is played by Jake Gyllenhaals real life friend Alex Greenwald, singer of 'The OC's' memorable theme song 'California', and his trusty side kick is played by the recently famous Seth Rogen star of 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' and 'Knocked Up'. Kelly intentionally wanted this film to mean different things to a variety of viewers. He himself admits, "Maybe it's the story of Holden Caulfield, resurrected in 1988 by the spirit of Phillip K. Dick, who was always spinning yarns about schizophrenia and drug abuse breaking the barriers of space and time. Or it's a black comedy foreshadowing the impact of the 1988 Presidential election, which is really the best way to explain it. But first and foremost, I wanted the film to be a piece of social satire that needs to be experienced and digested several times." Therefore leaving this film difficult for discussion. Those who've seen it and loved it have merely recommended it to others and spread to others the phenomenon that is 'Donnie Darko'. 'Donnie Darko' embraces a variety of genres like sci-fi, romance, and thriller as well as a few of chuckles for the comedy lovers. This apocalyptic tale offers something for every viewer, which could be a potential explanation for its countless devoted fans, who apply the woes of Donnie Darko to the unexplained occurrences in their own distorted lives. As the films tag line quips, 'Life is one long insane trip. Some people just have better directions'.</fullReview>

It's too bad movies like this are so rare and unpopular.It was a deep movie, made you think, made you theorize... It's a great film for the intelligent stoner, or for watching with a group of close friends, and then discussing theories about the "philosophy of time travel".And this movie really made me feel for the main character... And I rarely feel that strongly about a movie character.I couldn't stop thinking about this movie for like 2 weeks after I saw it! If you like movies that make you think, see this one...

		<shortDescription>A promising story tarnished</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i sat down to watch Donnie Darko i wasn't sure what to expect. I'd heard it had a huge cult following and was about time travel but bar that i was in the dark.As the film cracked open it was clear to me why the movie's got such a cult following. It's just not really what you're used to seeing in a film. Donnie is a bright but moody teenager who also happens to be very likable, in itself an unusual thing as such potentially re-hashed characters rarely come off well. Donnie's dad is another superb character who will crack anyone up as he fails to reprimand his children after making up brilliant new swears. Actually i'd say the best thing the film has to offer is a shed load of impressively quirky and original characters.Also if you're into a bit of a mystery thriller (like myself) then Darko will have you by the short and curlys. With weird numbers and stranger people turning up left right and centre you can't help but wonder how everything will end up fitting together... sadly that's where the film falls on its ass.Maybe the promising start raised my expectations to high, but those of you hoping for an intriguing ending will be greatly disappointed. I won't go and spoil you but suffice to say things are answered in the one of the blandest and least satisfying ways possible. Another niggling problem for me is how alike the film is to Butterfly Effect (or vice versa as this was made before Butterfly). Both films look set to be time travel thrillers and end up as dark comedies revolving around a mentally unstable young man. The thing is The Butterfly Effect really gets the ending (in the directors cut anyway) right. It just works. Unfortunately Darko's ending feels unpleasant and rushed.But i think really you've got to decide for yourself whether the poor ending makes up for the otherwise brilliant performances put in by all involved.At the end of the day i had to gun for a 7/10 a cracking story spoiled by a badly formed ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>regardless of the confusion or impossibility... you cannot not deny the messages this film sends...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I'm commenting on the original version of the film not the director's cut. It's pretty pathetic to read so many 10/10 reviews by people who love the movie for the mere fact that it confused them. Here are the more meaningful things I've gotten from the film: 1.) Gretchen's determent of kissing Donnie. she claims she wants it "to be at a time that shows her how beautiful the world can be". This moment happens when Seth and Ricky remind her of the horrific past regarding her step-father stabbing her mother. She runs out of the building crying, Donnie catches up and tries to calm her. She then kisses him. Thus implying the essentiality of balance; this world is perfect imperfection.2.) Time travel / God has a plan. everything moves along a set path and you CAN change your destiny and NOT betray it by traveling within "God's" channel. Although far from fully understandable, the notion is none-the-less truly thought-provoking. You think of the Bible and how God's actions from earth's creation to throwing down Lucifer are subject to time, space, and linearity... theoretically meaning, God would too have a channel like us.3.) Donnie goes to Grandma Death's home to find the "cellar door". As he is held down by Seth with a knife to his throat he says, "our saviour" and "deus ex machina", referring to his wishful thinking that Frank is coming with answers. Frank saved Donnie's life and helped him save others as well... When school is canceled because Donnie flooded it, a girl says, "The boys locker room is flooded and they found feces everywhere." ...Think boys locker room and Jim Cunningham. To sum this one up... Frank unintentionally killed Gretchen. Donnie then kills Frank despite all Frank has done for him. So Frank is the victim who is showed no remorse, yet he is selfless, proving so when he travels back in time to say sorry to Donnie. That's just beautiful.Even with all the moving messages this film sends, it does have one flaw... Chronologically, the "jet engine fiasco" happens before Halloween (Frank's death). So Donnie would have died before anything that involves himself with Frank or Gretchen takes place. This flaw is easily overlooked by the compelling narrative and self interpretation left to the viewer. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Theatrical Version: 10/10... Directors Cut Version: 8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review of the Director's Cut version only.I own both versions, and while I thought the load of new scenes were amazing to see, the original theatrical version is definitely the definitive version of this film, and I advise anyone not to watch the directors cut version first.The extra scenes are good, but these scenes should definitely have been left out of the movie, as it throws the pace of the film off balance, some scenes don't add that much extra. Whilst some scenes are amazing to see, I still don't think it is best if you see them the first time. Also the soundtrack has been changed, in an irritating way. Same songs, just they appear in different places in the film, I don't feel it works as well.Both are definitely worth seeing though, but I recommend you see the shorter theatrical version of the film first, or perhaps even 3 times through before you tackle the directors cut (which ultimately raises more questions, yet kills the lust to be asking them).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched Donnie Darko and found it so similar to Butterfly Effect. Donnie travelled back in time to save his girlfriend who was killed on a car accident, a friend called Frank who he shot in the eye after he ran over his girlfriend accidentally, and his mother and sister who would be killed in a plane crash.The idea of Time Travel fascinated human beings from the beginning of time! When the time was born we all knew that we would stop seeing it grow at some point.Many people imagine time as a line. They draw a line and point somewhere in the middle of it as the current time, then they place anything before now as the past and anything after now as future.This film gave me a feeling that time is not really on a line, it perhaps loops back on a circle, or may be it is not even restricted to two dimensions.The reason we do not understand how to go back and forth in time is because it is really no back and forth option. Imagine yourself at some point over a horse saddle?The point that sits both at maximum and minimum. Move to left or right and you will fall to a lower state, move forward or backward and you will move to a higher state?you are at your optimum states, so there is no way out.Would you change your death day, if you knew your death would save the lives of people you love?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is by far one of the best films I have seen in recent years. Its complexity although confusing at times makes you watch it again and again, and each time you watch it, you understand and respect something more about the film each time. I thought the ending especially brought a tear to my eye and reminded me of the butterfly effect another good movie. It's beautifully directed, written, acted and put across and I just can't go no enough about it. YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE! Great performances by Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal and Jena Malone who upon seeing this movie I will certainly be looking out for in the future. Donnie Darko isn't just for the emo audience as people suggest but for every teen who has problems in their lives which lets face it , most teens do</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is great and the director did a great job because you can see how this movie had a David lynch touch and the soundtrack was ESPECTACULAR it was precisely put where it should have been putted. anyway I've seen both the original and the directors cut and I liked better the directors cut and i think thats the one everybody should rent cause it helps you understand the movie better. This movie is about possibilities and what the real fear factor is and it helps understand what is the beautiful notion which is time. people who found this movie bad is because they probably because they just didn't understand it or they are just living in their own bubble of fear, anyway this movie is too smart for some people because it is great and its something that is going to be even more appreciated in the future provably up to 1000 years, anyhow what I mean is SEE IT!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have to watch it alone and watch it carefully. This movie has a great philosophy and I like that kind of philosophy. At first you think that authors are trying to say something about Freud's desires but than you realize that everything you see is different. You realize that what they show as time is very close to your idea of time and the way it changes. Donnie Darko is just a normal kid... I would actually like to be acquainted with him. I am a teacher and I pray to have such a student every day - this Donie Darko is very intelligent, asks a lot of questions - such men are identified as genius: they are open minded, curious and they have to pay for that with something (this case is somnambulism). At the end of my watching the movie I realized that I have a lot of questions not revealed... for those who care - just write about that in the letter to me. But these questions are only there because they should be. The story is not finished and you can think over what is going to be in the aftermath over and over. Life is what makes us wondering - and the plot of the movie in this case is close to life - despite the fact that this is philosophic sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" was recommended to me two years ago, and I finally watched it tonight. I would suggest watching it with friends, because watching it alone made me feel terribly lonely.The movie is the opposite of funny, uplifting, and rational. There's arguably no blood, no guts, and nothing too shocking. The hook, instead, is the plot, which I know I'll never figure out entirely. I also think the acting was superb, and must expose a bias in mentioning that Jena Malone was astounding in this movie.As a rule I avoid psychological thrillers, and although I've seen "Fight Club" and the likes, my favorite movies are "Spirited Away" and "The Princess Bride".After tonight, Donnie Darko has taken that spot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'I'm afraid that you'll tell me that this is not a work of fiction'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is without doubt a thought-provoking, moving and beautiful film within the confines of its surreal obscurity. I think I'm quite certain of the impossibility of understanding it or being satisfied with one viewing, it deliberately doesn't point to the clues which help you piece it together, and only once you know how it pieces together can you go back to search for the clues- a skillfully carved puzzle that leaves you unsure whether it can all be pieced together at all.The film almost serves as an extra-worldly experience for the introspective viewer; it will raise deep questions about the reality you live in with its potent cinematography, music and screen writing. It does all this whilst simultaneously entertaining you with a humorous political and social satire of the Reagan era.Donnie is the classical epic hero placed in a modern setting, displaying his heroism in a highly unconventional scenario, which makes the film all the more noble and tragic, as not only will no one ever know what he does and what sacrifices he makes, but he will forever be remembered, officially, as a merely troubled, psychotic teenage vandal.This heroic aspect of Donnie's character is summarised by a poem Donnie reads out in class one day, which analogises his heroic persona with that of a more traditional hero who "will deliver the children back to their doorsteps / And send the monsters back to the underground / I'll send them back to a place where no-one else can see them / Except for me / Because I am Donnie Darko" Incorporating ideas of parallel universes, time travel (in the Stephen Hawking sense) and manifest individual destinies, the story singles out Donnie by following his visible and pre-written destiny as he plays his role in preserving the universe. Branded a paranoid schizophrenic by the outside world, we the viewers know his so-called hallucinations are more than just the mind games of mind altering neuro-chemicals. And in this way, as well as many other ways, the film softens conventionally solid boundaries of the universe and our understanding of it in more than a grossly fantastical Stephen King fashion. A far cry from the light-hearted Hollywood comedy and cheery 'chick flick', this is not viewing for the faint-hearted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great boy. Portrait of schizophrenia. Madness/thought-provoking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes bad, gorgeous boy (Jake Gyllenhaal), troubled, needing love, lives in a town called Middlesex in the company of his good-looking friends, an imaginary bunny rabbit, and a menagerie of persons representing all that is weird about rich, Republican, religious, pop-psychology-and-snake-oil, middle America.Watchable numerous times and you still do not get to the bottom of it, this film appears to be a portrait of schizophrenia. Donnie is not the only schizo character, however: there is at least Grandma Death to consider for certification, and we must wonder at the 'normality' of much of the surrounding middleness.Your reviewer has seen at least two versions of the film. The first is recalled as having captioned quotes from Grandma Death's book at date divisions. The second gives less insight into the contents of the book. The reference to Stephen Hawking's Short History of Time had the reviewer reading that book and subsequently having to live with a brain that has been turned inside out. And then there's the time-travel aspect of the film. You see, if Donnie never left his bedroom when he smiled ecstatically and turned his back to us, and his mother was at the house to witness the accident, then who was it on the plane with Sparkle Motion? Sanity demands an answer.Initially experienced as 'disturbing' and not a DVD to buy despite the boy, one now regards this film strangely differently, music brilliant, deep by its portrait of trouble beneath the looks. A great addition to the collection of worthies.</fullReview>

I love the director's cut, and its funny scenes (such as the beginning dinner scene.), and also the way everything ties into itself. It's about time travel, oddly enough. There's a lot of language, I have to say - but it doesn't lessen the greatness of the movie. Donnie and his imaginary friends are really quite interesting. The ending is amazing, and kind of unexpected. Jake Gyllenhaal (I actually think that this was one of his first movies? Not sure, though.) &amp; Drew Barrymore are both fantastic, as is Donnie's girlfriend, whose name I'm not sure of. Great movie. Definitely suggest it to those of you who enjoy creepy and strange stuff. :)</fullReview>

Seriously if you have seen the edited version go and get the directors cut now. It explains alto more of whats going on and has some parts that I thought were key elements to the story.

Moreover, why did the girl Gretchen not recognize Donnie at the end? Anyway, Donnie's life is a bit complicated for me.He has a good understanding of physics which leads him to read the book given by his teacher.He also searches the answers for dying alone.I guess this is related with the reason of his death at the end.

The second time you see it, you'll be left either in awe or anger. You'll either love it or hate it. Why? Because there really isn't any secret hidden meaning behind the story.I recommend this film to anyone likes science fiction movies, anyone who likes movies about teen angst, and anyone who joy enjoys the art of film. If you're looking for action or a film with a moral, this isn't it. It you're looking for a film that keeps you guessing and makes a strong emotional impact, rent this film immediately.</fullReview>

The story line is solid and logical yet it throws you curves. You may try and guess the ending but it keeps you wondering until the end.It is not super scary but has enough to spook you if you watch it late at night.

		<fullReview>A great film, I really enjoyed it. The narrative is based around the life of a mentally troubled teenager called Donnie and his inability to come to terms with the problems and turmoil of the world around him. I felt this was a very engaging and clever plot as the film is trying to communicate the message of how hard it is to connect and understand the thoughts and feelings of teenagers today. This allowed me to relate to the character of Donnie and enabled me to understand what he was experiencing. This gives the film a real personal feeling, which made me feel like I was going through the exact same emotions as the characters, especially Donnie.The casting was superb. Jake Gyllenhal was faultless playing the role of Donnie. He managed to capture the real essence of Donnie's negativity towards life and his vulnerability to the outside world that he doesn't understand. Recognised figures in the acting community such as Noah Wyle, Patrick Swayze and Drew Barrymore put in distinctively esteemed performances to give the film an extra edge and separates it from other cult classics. The only downfall to this film is the complexity of the ending. Although it ties in with the films highly complicated and sometimes bamboozling storyline, the ending poses a very confusing finale to what is a great film. However, this may also work in the film's favour as it just adds to the mystery, provoking the audience to want to watch again so they can try to come up with a conclusion to the elaborate finish. I personally love the ending. Though it can be perceive as sad, I thought it was the perfect manner to finish off this thoroughly entertaining masterpiece. All in all, Donnie Darko is an overly elaborate, dark and yet ingenious film and one of the best I have ever seen. The characters are believable, the narrative is captivating from start to finish and it leaves you with that feeling of confusion, intrigue and desire to watch repeatedly that makes the film of the highest quality. Superb film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Completely delirious flick (something you could expect with a schizophrenic hero :)) that tackles more subjects than I thought possible without having the plot collapse under its own weight.Against all odds this little UFO of a movie does a pretty good job of it. It managed to move me from the first to the last scene. The director achieves a subtle balance of humor and seriousness, quietly unfolding the crazy plot without ever overdoing it. The movie is never patronizing or pretentious, as it could have been for the aesthetics of the pictures and deliberate obscurity of the script.Surely the surprisingly good performances from young and talented actors, very pleasant typically 80's soundtrack and ironic glance at the post-Reagan transition contributed to the effect of the already efficient mix of teen angst and sci-fi.That is certainly cult movie stuff. Well worth a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was just plain weird. When I started watching it, I thought it was a horror movie. But it is more like a head trip. You don't know exactly what is going on until the end of the movie. After I watched the movie, I still couldn't get my head around it. I had to go a couple of websites to get an explanation of what was going on. Here is what I have come up with. Donnie Darko is saved from death by following six foot tall talking, walking on two legs rabbit, named Frank. Frank gives him a message that the world is going to end in 28 days, and the rest of the movie gets weird after that. The movie was purposefully obscure and didn't give the viewer a lot of need to know information. I like weird and confusing movies, so I gave it a high rating. But if you are not into weird and confusing, you should leave this one alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if this is against the rules or not, but this is my all time favorite movie. I just love everything about it.The story is undoubtedly the best part of this movie. I don't want to give any of it away, but still help you understand it. This story is as creative as it follows an almost Meet Joe Black type storyline, and does it 4 times better. The great thing is that the movie is actually really funny, but it is all dark humor, but it is all hilarious. However, it's not a comedy, and actually has a very deep story of the teen years, being different, and loving someone. I won't say that it has an exact Romeo and Julliet type love story, but it's pretty similar. For everything else, it has all the things I like about a Quentin Terrantino movie, and it doesn't sacrifice anything else.The performances are some of the best I have ever seen. This is Drew Barrymore's best role, at least what i have seen her in. Very Different from what you normally see, but it's outstanding, and incredibly well done. Jake Gyllenhall was fantastic to say the least. There are maybe 3 people who I think could have done Donnie Darko the right way, and he is top of my list. I could go on on all the other characters, but I'm sure you get it.In short, go see this movie. Go rent it, and then go buy it. And if you're like me and like a movie that makes you think, you must see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is an entertaining, well thought out film with a mysterious aura and a sense of mystery and foreboding throughout. These rare and difficult elements that have been woven into this film combine with several other things creating something memorable.There is a healthy mix of rather dark humour early on as we witness our hero swearing at and around his family which integrates with the amusing one-liners he is using them with. This is combined with the suspense which builds and surprises which crop up now and again very early on in the film. You are left guessing and attempting to work things out from the very first frame. The feeling that everything is, in actual fact, normal is very much present as there are no complicated settings, nor are there unfamiliar characters. Everything is everyday and familiar, in fact the closest thing there is to any abnormality when it comes to the setting is the time of the film takes place which is in the late 1980's.This clash of an everyday world setting but mysterious aura throughout works very well as we attempt to work out what's going on but at the same time, realise that the mysterious element is still there through the character of Donnie. One other thing is that the rest of the characters seem to act 'crazy' in their own unique way. Everyone has a fault and everyone has a goal; whether it be a schizophrenic trying to work out what's going on, a pervert trying to 'heal' people or even if it's an obsessive person bent on making sure a certain music band containing young girls is a success over everything else. Each person is searching and we, the audience, are searching with them. We are with them through their highs and lows and Donnie's therapy sessions act as checkpoints for this journey as we go deep into his mind during hypnosis. This little technique acts as a good suspense filler too, but it often also produces a few laughs. This is very clever.Throughout this film, there is a definite element of confusion. I was never 100% sure as to what was going on but this is healthy as films like this demand a second viewing anyway. We ask ourselves: what do the dreams mean? Why is all this happening and what's causing it? This, to me, made me feel like the film was coming together like a puzzle and every time a dream came along, it was as if I'd suddenly found a piece which linked up several others. The film unravels in this way and it's not too demanding yet at the same time, it doesn't insult the viewer.With wonderful music throughout, using both popular tracks from the era and instrumental music, along with a clever manipulation of the speed of the footage; both fast and slow, Donnie Darko is a very clever film and well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>INCREDIBLE MOVIE,so hard to understand!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the cover of the DVD i stayed amazed,i passed to another world, surrealism in a pure dose,a world in another space,maybe a 4th. dimension,the soundtrack takes us to a journey through those years, What can change our world? Is our willingness or after all it is written in the stairs?(as John Lennon said),all the actors played so smartly the game:Gyllenhaal with his grainy,bitter face,Drew and her fatal sexy-tenderness,Swayze a mild-mannered deceiver,Katherine Ross(i didn't see her a long,long time ago)made the point,Maggie was OK,and i'm still feeling there are so many mysteries that aren't unveiled.In my head will always remain 'till the on the times that unforgettable image about those girls dancing on the yard of the school under the progressive tones from "Head over Heels " a state of minded-son, caging you with that astounding sound created by Orzabal-Smith AND THEIR MAGIC KEYBOARD. Please,better watch this supernatural movie to enter in a new dimension,my life won't be the same after this lost link of the celluloid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great mix of black humour, time travel and 80s parody.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film isn't for everyone, and isn't the sort of movie you can watch just once and understand. But the thing is, it's worth unravelling just so you can understand. Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) is the epitome of disturbed teenage angst, and many other characters directly parody stereotypes of American suburbia. While the film seems to be, at first glance, just a bit bizarre, repeated viewing will let you understand the cleverly interwoven themes of time travel and mental illness. Once you feel you know what has happened in the film, you soon realise that everything that has happened could well just be a figment of Donnie's fractured imagination. The film confronts with ideas that challenge our perceptions of normal, and that's why it's so great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful, interesting, intellectual, creepy- a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that Donnie Darko was a really good movie. I saw it a few years ago when it first came out, then I watched it again recently and it's one of those movies where you notice little things the more you watch it. I really enjoyed the symbolism in this movie. I think Donnie represents an ordinary person, just like you and me, trying to deal with the hypocrisy, beliefs and overall difficulties of society. In the movie, there were those conservatives like Kitty and Jon Cunningham, who try to rule the society with their mumbo jumbo about fear and love and everything being bad for everyone. Then, of course, much like real life, Jon is a total hypocrite, who dabbles in the kiddie porn business.This movie is pretty suspenseful, you don't really know who the bunny is, although he makes for an interesting character. Donnie's character is full of surprises, very interesting and intelligent, you tend to feel bad for him. It is really interesting how the story unfolds. I must say that I found myself googling Time Travel after seeing this movie. I highly recommend it to the intellectual movie goer, who isn't looking for something strictly entertaining.</fullReview>

I went into the movie knowing nothing more than the fact that it was considered a cult classic. I basically turned it on because there was nothing else on and I saw it on the on-demand menu. Anyways I am extremely glad that I did watch it. It was definitely one of the best movies I had seen in a long time. I enjoyed it thoroughly. If you are reading this and looking for any possible answers to some questions that you may have about the meaning of the movie than I'm afraid that you are out of luck. I have no answers yet, just my theories, and those are far to raw right now to even consider sharing. If you read this to dissever whether or not you should give the movie a shot than I must tell you YES! Try it out for yourself, it is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

Though a very mind boggling film it turns out to be a very well made thought provoker that will truly exercise your mind and make you think "what just happened?". Well if you want to find out fully you will have to get the directors cut of the movie which will tell you all about the movie from the director himself. I have read all of the blogs and comments and they have helped me extremely. I understand more of what i did just by watching the movie.

		<fullReview>This is an amazing movie filled with a unique script with even more unique ideas. The whole movie is about a boy who is going through therapy, having to take pills and such. One night, he's awoken by a six -foot tall bunny, who tells him the world will end unless Donnie decides to do what he says. Besides, the bunny saved his life. The whole movie is a little confusing, unless you see it as everything having a meaning. It makes you wonder how God feels. The movie is amazing, thought provoking, and makes you wonder about what matters. Not for all tastes, but for many. Before you judge it, pretend it's a good movie and watch again, you'll notice things you didn't before.Rating: *** (of 4)Entertainment: ***** (of 5)</fullReview>

Pay attention people...you might find you missed the whole movie while you were pretending to be Ebert and Roeper. This movie is not slow at all.

		<fullReview>There are movies that you watch and walk away from entertained. You feel good about the movie, glad you spent the money to see. There those that you wish you could get at lest the time you spent in the theater back. Then there are those that change your life forever. They change the way you look at things. The world feels different when your done watching it. For me Fight Club was one of those movies. The Matrix (first one, first time) was one of those movies. This is one of those movies. I can't recommend this movie enough. Forget cult classic, this will become a classic, period.This movie made me forget that he did Domino. This movie was way better. The big name cameo's don't overshadow the lesser known talents through the film. Donnie is a fully developed 3 dimensional character. It's rare to find these days. I honestly didn't think I would like this movie when my friend handed me a copy. I'm glad he did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The End of the World..... in Middle America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not exactly a feel good movie; aspects of Frank Capra's finest, but Jake, the lead actor, is not exactly Henry Fonda; more his angry, nerdier, grandson. The film's more akin to the allegorical brilliance of Lindsey Anderson's 1968 masterpiece, "If", set in a British public school - or private school, as it would be called on the other side of the pond.The existential elements of time travel, concluding with the beginning, postulating that destiny can be determined by knowledge of what the future holds in store, are far from original, but first-time Director Richard Kelly's skill in placing different genres - science fiction, teen-high school ephemera and lifestyle gurus, knowing something less about life than the average Yankee pitcher knows about cricket, gives it an interesting atmospheric aura, together with the Edward Scissorhands-style depiction of an enclosed American small town environment. As someone originally from Middlesex, UK, this Middlesex in the States is quite recognisable and the fast tracking of day to day school-scenes add to the overall feel of quirkiness.Ultimately it is a fable looking at a paranoid schizophrenic with teenage angst in an innovative fashion, but the rabbit from the future does not induce any perception of right and wrong, good and evil. Not a good idea to release the DVD in Guantanamo Bay.Overall, compared to big budget formulaic dross stuffed down the throats of most contemporary cinema patrons, it leaves you thinking, contemplating and yes - even worrying a little. What if Dukakis had won? No, that really would be a parallel universe. Maybe a better one, actually.Donnie Darko needs an Orwellian aspect to it or in a European cinematic context, a little more surrealism. But it was worth watching and damned good to discover Drew Barrymore was Executive Producer. A film like this, with a variety of contexts, enabling the viewer to use their own perception is well worth seeing. And the cult status it has achieved is well deserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really, I would vote this an excellent movie for several reasons. It has a good storyline. Many movies, especially contemporary ones, will have a really good message overall, but not a good story to follow in the meantime. This story helps with the understanding of the message as well as keeping the viewer interested. Now there is a lot of symbolism in this movie, not to name specifics, but all of it can add up to be confusing. I don't believe it possible to watch this movie one time through and fully understand it. It is a strange movie. I think it's more like a book than a movie. It contained a lot of symbolism, and it was a good topic to discuss with other people who had seen it to see what they got out of it. It really is a good movie, but you have to be in the correct mindset to watch it and enjoy it. The reasons that it is a 9 and not a 10 I have already gone over. You can't understand it in one go. It could have been written a little more clearly. And Donnie's character should have developed more than it did. This seemed to be the biggest change in his life, but it wasn't quite there.</fullReview>

The one that I am referring to says the whole movie is a dream except for the end where the engine comes through Donnie's roof. I think that kind of summarizes it. But anyways, I realized that this theory couldn't be right because when it shows all the people waking up it shows Frank who just dropped Dinnie's sister off moments before the engine fell through Dinnie's room feel for his eye as if he just had the dream that he had been shot in the eye. I also don't understand how he is already home unless the shot of him is later than everybody else's shot. Does anybody hear agree?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies i've seen in the 21st Century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of good movies over the past few years after the new century started, but there are very few that i'd like to call "the perfect movie" since the "last perfect movie".Donnie Darko, i'm very proud to say after all these years, is still one of them. And it pretty much still is to the day of this writing, I have not yet since seen a movie yet to surpass its amazing quality, superb (and up and coming) cast, intelligent storytelling, and high replay value compared to recent releases in video, DVD, movies, etc.The story of a highly disturbed teen and his friend "Frank" written and directed by Richard Kelly is one of the more compelling stories caught on film. Even better is that its casted perfectly (starring now A-list Jake Gyllenhaal), has an incredible score, has very clever and witty dialogue ranging from '80s pop culture references to time travel philosophy, and its pacing is perfect (which is the rarest thing of them all).Like I also said earlier, it's also one of the few movies that had a story that you had to watch more than once in order to get it...and also one of those movies that made you WANT TO see it again and again on top of that. Not since the original Matrix did I willingfully want to watch a movie to understand its story AND enjoy it every single time upon repeated viewings.It's a great movie that should be watched by many, if not all. The ending (considering if you don't listen to Kelly's interpretation) will leave you guessing and debating. Inspirational to modern filmmakers, this is one that deserves its time under the spotlight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The use of fast motion, hallucinations and embedded text makes this one a cinematic treat. Don't ask me to give away the spoiler as I'm not sure who did what to whom even with multiple viewings. Great 80's sound track and cultural references. The Donnie Darko character is well developed and reminds me of a young Dustin Hofmann in the Graduate. Not quite bewildered to the point of slowing down the plot. The only disappointment is that there are no animals in the film. The one animal portrayed in the film turns out to be a man in a bunny rabbit outfit. (or is that just a dream sequence?) This is probably the only film ever made with an Oingo Boingo song backing up a critical scene. Most everyone in the film drives badly,smokes and and drinks. The individuals who promote family values in this story turn out to be the real evil doers. Sort of like the way things are panning out in real life in the early part of the 21st century. No animals were injured in the making of this motion picture. (Except for the evil Rabbit).</fullReview>

But, as I said, if you are interested you'll discover a new plot line every time you see it. It's deep and has strengh enough to make you want more and more. It has good actors and is cool to see Gyllehaal brothers being brothers in the screen. I recommend it to all those people looking for something unseen in the current Hollywood.

		<shortDescription>What a mindtrip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Kurt Vonnegut's novel Slaughterhouse-Five, the protagonist Billy Pilgrim meets an alien race from Tralfamadore who can see a lifespan in the form of a line moving from the entity's beginning to its end. This view, called the fourth dimension by the Talfamadorians, allows them to piece together every part of a life and know the past, present, and future of all living things.Director Richard Kelly seems to be a devotee to the Vonnegut story, piecing his first film, Donnie Darko, into a story that defies much of the three-dimensional boundaries set in stone by the modern living. As the film slowly peels away its story of Darko and his suburban milieu, the audience can easily imagine a future that could involve marrying a woman like Valencia Merble and a 1976 demise similar to Billy Pilgrim's. Even the character of Kilgore Trout and his sci-fi writings have been recreated in an absentee old lady called Grandma Death (Cleveland) who wrote a book on time-travel.Donnie Darko (Gyllenhaal), of course, is not Billy Pilgrim in many ways -- the setting has left World War II and moved into the Reagan era and Valencia Merble has become a more likable youngster named Gretchen Ross (Malone). Darko is a dark young man whose actions have frightened his parents into sending him to a psychiatrist (Ross) and pushing him on medication for his mental condition. Donnie, of course, is distraught by his parents' ineffectualness for his feelings, especially in his mother (McDonnell), who tries desperately to relate to her son.Set in October 1988 (the Bush-Dukakis election remains a constant background story), the film delves into Donnie's belief that the world has only 28 days left before destruction. A six-foot rabbit with a skeleton mask named Frank has told him this and he is intent on making sure he can understand as much as possible about the world and correct a few problems before the 28th day. This involves everything from a budding romance with Gretchen, an obsessively doting teacher (Grant), and a pretentious local self-help guru (Swayze). There are many Holden Cauffield phonies roaming around this suburban sprawl and it is Donnie Darko's task to put them in their place before the world ends.Calamity serves as a major device in the film with equal attention set upon time-travel and the Tralfamadorian ability to look across one's life like looking across a timeline in a book. Richard Kelly's film works on many levels to produce a satisfactory tale of sadness and resolve in a misbegotten mind. Rarely do films come along that yearn to not only entertain on a simple level, but also painstakingly pit the characters in worlds not necessarily farcical, but not too realistic either.The film's dark side will remind many filmgoers of American Beauty, though Kelly's resolve to turn the film to absurdness at times may hearken a little closer to Being John Malkovich. This is a movie where the downtrodden appeal serves a greater service to the surrealism than the melodrama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This fun movie will make you think but it has enough clues for you to figure it out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just watched Donnie Darko. I must have watched parts of it half-asleep on a red-eye flight, because I had this funny deja-vu feeling about lots of scenes. This only helped the effect of the movie, as you can imagine. I offer below my own personal interpretation of this quirky movie.In my opinion, this movie definitely has a messianic theme. If you notice when Donnie is leaving the movie theater, we can see that "The Last Temptation of Christ" is showing in that cinema. Why is that important? Because in that movie and book by Kazantzankis, there is also a time-loop involved, after Christ avoids death on the cross and goes on to have a normal life. The result is complete chaos, after which Christ goes back in time and dies on the cross, thereby sparing the world from destruction. Just like in "Donnie Darko." (Edit: this messianic role is reinforced when Donnie's girlfriend say that his name sounds like a super-hero name). In "The Last Temptation of Christ," it is also open to interpretation if Christ really climbed down from the cross, or if everything was just a vision, a last temptation. Again, just like in "Donnie Darko." By dying in the freak accident, Donnie saves the world. (Edit: There's a thread on this interpretation running on the Donnie Darko IMDb Board, previous to this comment, at http://imdb.com/title/tt0246578/board/thread/41699057).Another clue is the title of the book, "Philosophy of Time Travel." It is not "Physics of Time Travel," or "How to Build a Time Machine." Time travel is never a clear-cut reality in this movie, instead, it's the philosophy behind it that is important. Are we in control of our destiny? Do we have true free-will or is everything pre-determined? Another clue for this is the opening song, "The Killing Moon," by Echo and Bunnymen. If you listen to the chorus of that song, that's exactly this theme it addresses (If by "he", you interpret "fate").A somewhat similar quirky movie with philosophical undertones is "Being John Malkovich". I wish there were more of these types of movies, they are great fun and thought-provoking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did what a lot of people have done after watching this movie: I watched it again. Between the "Director's Cut" and the original version, the commentary tracks and outtakes, I have absorbed this work repeatedly. It's endlessly fascinating. Richard Kelly has done what Joseph Campbell has said a good storyteller must do, which is to take a myth and dramatize it. The myth Richard Kelly used is one he himself created. Just as Yeats had a construct of what he called "gyres" informing his poetry, Kelly has his timeline. I would say that the timeline helped him flesh out a primal story. Studying the backdrop to DONNIE DARKO is obviously legitimate (as are studies of Yeats's gyres) but, in order to be moved by this work, the viewer does not have to have it charted out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deus ex machina, eh? It's pretty much the staple theme. There's a bit of social commentary, but it's more exaggerated than the 80's I lived through. And it's more social observation than commentary.I don't see the point. The plot is developed for its own sake. If you try to reduce it to something solid, without the layers of requirements to resolve the tangent universe, it comes down to some book written by Roberta Sparrow.I agree with the other guy. Why would this film be in the top 100? It's a long winded explanation of what takes most English teachers 10 minutes to spit out. Deus ex machina. But not exactly. It's more like creating a PROBLEM rather than a solution.Why would this problem exist? Who is Roberta Sparrow? How did she come to write this book? These are the real questions. They're left unanswered of course. And I guess the puzzles are intriguing enough to carry the film. The puzzles were distractions to me, nonsense games that are never quite resolved.I like the movie well enough. I like it better the more I see it. But it's still just an okay film. Twelve Monkeys is a close relative, much superior. Even The Jacket is better.This movie cannot possibly stand on its own, which is another problem. Explanations and questions are all over the net, which is both really fascinating and absurd at the same time. You need a fictional book inside a fictional movie to decipher a fictional phenomena with a set of arbitrary fictional rules. Shrug. I like that some explanation reference Ground Hog. That movie, a very distant cousin, was much better as well!</fullReview>

IT IS truly tragic that films like these are passed over as another scifi thriller. i need to share the word on the wisdom of this film i cannot stress that enough. see it, vote a ten on it. because it deserves to be #1 on the IMDb top 100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the fact that this movie has such a great story. When Donnie Darko smiles in the beginning of the movie you know you are in for it. I love the music in this movie. I have always liked the 80's pop culture. You see the hair styles and hear the music it is like being there. You feel for Donnie hearing the way he feels about his facing the fear of being all alone. You want him to be right, to figure it all out. When you reach the end of the movie, you just want to watch it ALL OVER Again! I watch Donnie Darko The Director's cut at least once a day. I love Jake Gyllenhaal's performance of the troubled teen. I just do not think he was all that troubled. I thought he was cool. The over all movie is sad but amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Immediately in my top 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure I've ever come across another movie quite like "Donnie Darko." It's part science fiction, part teen flick, part a twisted version of "Harvey," and underlying all of it is this perfect sense of what it is like to seek and sometimes find truth while most of the world is skating by unaware that such a thing even exists. How odd and wonderful that such a bright and honest movie can still get made.Jake Gyllenhaal is utterly perfect as Donnie; in fact, the entire Darko family is just beautifully portrayed. The more I watched the movie, the more attached I grew to Holmes Osborne, who so clearly has that streak of anarchy that encourages Donnie to speak his mind regardless of ridiculous social expectations. *SPOILER* Hands down, my favorite moment in the film comes when Donnie's school is forced to sit through a self-help guru presentation. While everyone else either buys into Jim Cunningham's bull, Donnie stands up and challenges what he knows is untrue.Cunningham: Son, it breaks my heart to say this, but I believe you are a very troubled and confused young man... Donnie: You're right, actually. I am pretty- I'm, I'm pretty troubled and I'm, I'm pretty confused. But I... and I'm afraid. Really, really afraid. Really afraid. But I... I... I think you're the f*****g Antichrist. Brilliant.</fullReview>

To escape to happiness only unseen figures refuse to blind us with the constant mirrors of present reality and the Illusions they create in keeping us from Our dreamt perfect ending and future story of living for a good. It is very hard to describe but every time i want to analyze the message from this piece I'm only left with the image of mirrors. Mirrors feeding illusion of what we are hiding the only lived moments tha make whole life times. Mirrors and more mirrors...any one else lost with the omnipotent echoes that the ego supplies its stock of sane reality when looking in the mirror.....How am I...what was I...what will I...playing out realities missed years ago still feeding fresh dreams of who Ill be in the end. Also the vague touch of Pelias and Melisande by Maeterlinck....the beginning the end that supplies the mystery in the final pages. Theme; there is a comfort in the dark because it does not lie. No manipulating the past to fulfill a necessity of a sane present...where the dreams of childhood and after life never change, no illusion to reflect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love Donnie Darko. I first saw the movie about a year ago and bought it the next day. It has amazing acting by Jake Gyllenhaal and many other amazing actors and actresses. Jake portrays a teen dealing with some mental issues which include hallucinations about a six foot tall bunny rabbit named Frank. Donnie {Gyllenhaal} starts waking up in odd places and then discovers that weird events are happening around the town of Middlesex. He thinks that time travel somehow has an effect on his life. Some other amazing people in this movie include Jena Malone, Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wyle, Drew Barrymore, and Beth Grant. I would definitely call Donnie Darko one of the best phsycological comedies of my time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie last summer after finding it on sale for like, 2 pounds 99 pence !! At first I found it total crap but then when I thourght of it, I think the confusion give it a erie effect which is what Richard Kelly wanted- a mysterious, erie cult movie. After researching on donniedarko.com , the movie plot line seemed to string together. I think the best quote in the movie was when Donnies therapist asks " What did you want for Christmas that year?" and Donnie replies: "Hungry, hungry hippos !!" Even though it would seem like "Frank" is just added to the movie in order to create a random spooky effect, this six foot tall bunny rabbit plays one of the most important roles in the movie - The Manipulated Dead. In order to understand what I'm mindlessly ranting on about here, you would need to have checked out the official website. The manipulated dead are people that have died in a tangent universe and try and help the living reciever (aka Donnie) return the misplaced artifact back to where it belongs./</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangeness can be great...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I saw this film a few years ago for the first time. I bought it at a Best Buy for $9.99 because Drew Barrymore was in it (Jake wasn't a big star yet). The first viewing of it, I liked the style and the abstractness of it. It was quite strange and aside from the strangeness, I just didn't get the point of it the first time I viewed it. However, I don't give up on things so easily so I have re-watched this movie several times since and I have concluded that this is one of those films that people may not appreciate upon the first viewing. Punch Drunk Love is another one of those films that invokes the same feeling. Anyway, this movie is way philosophical and a treat for people that are looking for depth over fluff. Jake does a great job in his role. What can I say, this movie is full of things that make you ponder. Oh, the soundtrack is very '80s without the overbearingness of the '80s. I dunno, I just think this movie is such a treat every time I see it. Jake should be recognized for taking risky roles and always succeeding. Drew Barrymore's presence in this film is almost non-existent, so don't think that she has a big role. Final thought: is Jake's character really dead at the end of the movie or is it a bad dream?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's easy to understand why this movie floundered at first: Something that works so well on so many different levels can leave marketers catatonic with fear. Is it about a technology "indistinguishable from magic," (Clarke) or psychotic delusions or drug-induced hallucinations? It manages to mix drama, humor, social commentary, horror and a Passion Play mysticism into a crucible that is filled to its brim. Although it has its own style and set of (many) themes, it falls into the same category as films like Memento and Pi, which stick in your mind and make your brain itch until you realize that you just need to see them again -- preferably with a few friends. Once just wasn't enough and the third viewing is often even more rewarding than the second.</fullReview>

Jake Gyllenhaal makes an excellent performance as the troubled Donnie.

All in all, Donnie Darko is a very interesting and intriguing movie. Storyline is very mind-boggling yet mysterious and great! The tag line which is 'Life is one long insane trip.

		<fullReview>I had read a lot about Donnie Darko in magazines and heard a lot about it through mainly my cousin how was telling me how amazing it was and how I much see it. So upon his recommendation I sat down to watch Donnie Darko thinking that I was going to be just another overrated teen movie. Oh how I was wrong.I think this movie would have to be up there (in my top 5) for original movies. It was compelling from the off with Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) waking up on the side of a mountain and from there he leads us through his weird world(s). It's worth mentioning that Jake Gyllenhaal was excellent in this film. He handle's the lead of Donnie the superbly intelligent but superbly troubled teen with the real class that only a good actor can give. I hadn't heard anything of Gyllenhaal before this film but I'm not surprised that I have heard a lot more since.The rest of the cast do there parts well and add to the web of intrigue that build's up before the films climax.The real good point to come out of this movie is the Writer/Director Richard Kelly. He has proved himself competent at both writing and directing and I for one am really looking forward to seeing what he does next.</fullReview>

Especially some inserted texts "explaining" time travel.

I don't recommend watching it when you're completely miserable. Maybe when you're in an alright mood looking for a different view on living... on life. The movie impacted me a great deal and i have yet to stop thinking about it. After i watched the movie i went out and purchased it and it's still in my DVD player.

		<fullReview>First of all, I desperately wanted to watch this movie not only after reading the reviews, but especially because I am a "gyllenhaalic", Jake's fan. As soon as I bought the movie on DVD I watched it over and over again.An excellent story...a great cast...a work of art! This movie isn't a commercial one, with -lets say, ordinary subjects-, almost same action, same plot, predictable ending... It isn't for people that prefer common stories, because they certainly won't like it, in case they "take this risk", of making an exception and choosing this movie for the disadvantage of other hundreds. It is worth it only for those who are willing to try something else, something new, maybe something beyond their expectations. Don't be so skeptical, don't underestimate this movie. Watch it without trying to predict a climax, a "better-suited ending". It's impossible. You will be astonished! It can't be described, not within a common way. After you see it, at last, you will definitely have to watch it once more. Every single time it touches you in a unique way. You react as if it were the first time you watch it...You discover different possible explanations, you rediscover every gesture, every line resounds in your head like an echo, trying to find out, subconsciously, what it really meant to say, to express, to demonstrate.Jake's schizophrenic role in the cult-movie "Donnie Darko", a visionary teen movie about suburban alienation and time travel... Donnie isn't an average teenage boy, with the characteristic problems of the age in question. He is a troubled young boy that is saved from death by a six-foot-tall bunny rabbit, named Frank. This imaginary friend of his (or maybe a messenger of God)tells him that the world is coming to an end in about a month. Donnie doesn't put in question his mental sanity -although his life was "sustained" by pills and therapist (psychiatrist) support- but he only lets himself being guided by this overwhelming state and by his so-called friend, "defender", "boss" and "adviser", Frank. Instead, reason is the one that makes his mind blurry and makes him doubt about his capacity of choosing right from wrong. It also makes the audience wonder what is really going on, which one of the actions takes place in real life, in Donnie's imagination, after traveling through time within God's set path...All the other characters are not that developed as unique individuals, thus the main one is emphasized, but they help to create the plot, contributing with their own story...They are starring in their own more or less important problem/tragedy, becoming famous for events they didn't want to be part of. "I guess some people are just born with tragedy in their lives." Donnie's inside fight between right and wrong, good and evil, reason and insanity, solitude, and the guilt that torments him, they all end within 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds. He doesn't want to be all alone, to die alone..these aspects scare him, because he succumbs to the path of fear after knowing the moment when the world was coming to an end. And he felt -and he actually was- useless, because he couldn't change his destiny, he could only know it, see it and accept his death..The last song from the movie, the one while certain moments of the characters' existence are slide-showed -in the same time Donnie dies-, describes with details their statements, not only at that moment in time and space -past, future or present-, their emotions, their precious memories of their simple, pitiful, insignificant, boring, common and casual lives that get complicated because of their recent brush with mass-destruction..."They just want to know what happens when they tear the world apart."...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened to this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I missed a lot of good movies when they came out in 2001 and 2002. But what happened to this film? To me it production values seem first rate, so why so few screens at release? Well, perhaps like a few other great films this one was destined to gain a cult following, and judging by the 68,000+ votes here at IMDb it sure has.The film opens with Donnie sleeping in the middle of the road up in some hills. He wakes up and rides his bike, apparently a long way home. It's never really clear why, but this film events are supposed to have occurred in October of 1988. Donnie's family is well to do, with a lot of connections and living in a very nice neighborhood.Next we get to see the Darkos at dinner, where sibling rivalry is exposed. It's also clear that despite any political stance the parents have allowed their children to be open minded. It seems to be this same night that Donnie meets a new imaginary friend, who leads Donnie out his bedroom and house. It becomes apparent that Donnie sleepwalks, and this explains Donnie sleeping in the middle of the road.This seems to begin the adventure of Donnie Darko, and the most important part of his life. Events occur that will change the course of Donnie's life, family, and friends. I don't want to spoil the movie for you as Donnie explores his changed life, mental illness, struggles with friends and enemies, and ultimately the end of the world.The story can be confusing at times, so make sure to follow the film as closely as possible. It's a very good movie with some good points and some not of so-much-to-be-concerned-with fun. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i first watched Donnie Darko when i was about 14 years old, i was with a lot of my friends as i have having a birthday sleep over. at first i grew tired of the film and became easily distracted by my friends. but what i do remember is the ending of the film and thinking "what the hell just happened?" a few year later i saw the DVD for the film in a shop for cheap. needless to say i brought it straight away hoping that with a few more years of wisdom and an empty room i would understand the film. i watched it many times before i even fully understood what was happening. after this i still kept watching and discovering many secret philosophies and hidden meanings within the film. i was taken over by the film. after my parents worked out my obsessions for the film they decided to buy me the directors cut for Christmas. i was glad of this as i wanted to know what was going on in the directors head when he made this film. but before i did this i decided to watch the film with the added scenes, i wasn't expecting much but from this but i thought i would give it ago any way. i am glad that i did this, the added scenes and passages from Roberta sparrows book answered so many of my questions and helped me to understand so much more about the time travel aspects of the film and the meanings behind certain actions. along with this the added scenes opened up so many more questions and ideas within my head. the directors cut just takes the film to a level of deepness that is never ending. even now when i watch the film for the 100th time i an amazed by the story. enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here is what I thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie is a teenager with psychological talent / issue that most don't have. He sees things in life completely differently than most of the people that surround him. I also sensed some struggle in his mind regarding existence of greater power in the universe. (While he is talking to his shrink, she calls him agnostic rather than atheist.) Roberta Sparrow is another individual with similar power perhaps greater than Donnie knows it all and the book is about time travel for such individuals such as Donnie. Donnie can travel through the time as he discovers the ports through everyone's chest (as shown in the movie). I took that as; every individual is an event with a specific time stamp. Time is human created and if you assume that it does not exist then only thing exists is big vacuum of universe. There has to be short cuts to travel where you came from and to where you can go. As the movie shows Donnie's discussion with one of his teachers ... there can be more than one ways the life can be interpreted or directed. It is only possible when you know which direction to travel. Frank is artist (?) who draws rabbits and will happen to wear rabbit costume on the night he will get killed by Donnie (in Donnie's life) they both don't know each other. At the end, my conclusion for this movie is: You can take life in the direction you want. The way to do that is to acknowledge the greater power in one's life. Time travel is not possible in today's world but movie shows that Donnie was able to direct his life in completely different direction starting from the point when plane engine crashes into his room. He is saved from that incident by greater power for a purpose ? he is the "living receiver". He only gets the messages from Frank the rabbit. Roberta Sparrow knows about these living receivers and manipulators in the time travel philosophy. At the end, after he kills Frank (the unknown guy) and his girlfriend is dead he chooses to go back to the event which he knows would kill him. He perhaps has no option or he thinks that's the best possible option for his life. A very good movie that generates thoughts!</fullReview>

The subject matter of the film is Frank, a 6 foot demonic rabbit, that is about all I am going to say regarding the storyline. This film is spectacular, there are virtually no special effects, just good old fashioned brilliant acting, and a delightfully original story line. No matter what you may have previously heard about this film, it is a must see, to miss out on it should be a crime. I know I am being vague, but I want you to have the pleasure of discovering everything there is to discover about this film by yourself. Once you have watched it, you will be eager to watch it again.

		<shortDescription>A very different kind of teen love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the only film made over the last 10 years or so since 1995 that I've watched twice, even though it was made for teens and twents and not a middle aged twerp like me. I've always loved off-the-wall sci-fi, all the way from the Epic Of Gilgamesh to Micromegas to Harvey to this, a much neglected modern classic.Basically it remains a well made, languidly photographed love story chockful of teen angst, cynical of the present (1980's) but still full of hope for the future. Oh, it also has the continual butting-in of a metal-rabbit-headed teen from 28 days into the future and a tangential Universe complete with wormholes - but Donnie Can Save The World! Thought-provoking is hardly the word for this film! The DC runs in at a precious and often visually stunning 122 minutes plus 6 minutes credits and a beautifully remastered and tinkered-about soundtrack (Joy Division are now at the Party). The incessant '80's pop music (original recordings) play an important role here in setting the right ambiance - never did like Echo and the Bunnymen though!Overall, although undisciplined in places abounding with non-sequiteurs and pretentious arty-fartiness this is a marvellous film - if you can't like it or even be slightly impressed by its cleverness it's your loss!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've got it!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've got it!!... At least I think I have. The reason why the bullies and Cherita are set up behind Donnie in some shots could be symbolic of the angel and the devil on his shoulders. Generally, whatever is good is shown on his left side and whatever is evil or threatening is on the left. For example, in the lifeline exercise shot, the bullies are on his right shoulder and Cherita is on his left. This also relates to the lifeline exercise in which fear is shown on the right side of the line and love on the left. Cherita, who obviously fancies Donnie, could also portray her role as an angel through love and the bullies are maybe to do with what Donnie should fear. When Donnie says to Jim Cunningham that he's an antichrist, Gretchen is on his left side and the bullies are on his right. This cant just be a coincidence? Oh god now I even sound like Donnie, I really need to find a new movie to be obsessed about! Anyway, let me know if you agree with my interpretation. Holly x</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is simply amazing. It provokes so much thought and so much heart felt relation to Donnie. This film takes the idea of time travel, schizophrenia, love, death, and fear into a single movie that is guaranteed to move you. The historical references in this film are just perfect, and the movie also relates to other movies throughout the film. Perfect casting, amazing cinematography, wonderful directing! Such a good movie for any night, it makes you laugh, definitely makes you think, makes you want to cry a few times, it is just so good. It's creepy and fun, interesting and cautious, perfect and messy. It is written so well and directed just as amazing, especially for a young director's (Richard Kelly) third film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can honestly say that this is the most brilliant film that I have seen to date. It is absolutely breath-taking...at some points it gave me goosebumps as it was so emotively powerful. I thought that the ending was thought-provoking and tragic, as well as being really quite ingenious. The whole cast were fantastic. The music chosen was highly effective, and the plot was perfectly crafted. Did anyone else think that Jake Gyllenhall should have won something for his role in this film? A recommended film for anyone to see! In some ways I wish I hadn't seen it, so that then I could have the sheer pleasure of getting to watch it again, that's how amazingly brilliant it was. I too am amazed that it was the director's first film, and I hope that the rest of his films are of the same exceptional quality. What more can I say? The most perfect film I have seen in my life.:D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most complex thrillers of our time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is one of best movies of our, and possibly, all time. To the dull or weak minded, it will seem boring and without point. The plot contains very deep and very complex meaning. You may find yourself, as I have, watching it time and time again, revealing more and more of the puzzle. The whole picture simply cannot be seen the first time. This complexity coupled with the intense eerie mystery of the movie itself make it grounds for history books in cinematic quality. This movie is severely underrated and deserves more than my words can provide. For anyone considering watching this movie, I highly recommend it and would strongly urge you to watch it multiple time to appreciate the full quality of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is on my top 5 list of all time. This is one of the few movies that I can sit there and get more enjoyment when i see it over and over again (which is rare in my case). I didn't want to see this movie after i saw bubble boy. I was surprised by the performances. Even Patrick Swayze and Drew Barrymore did a great job. Every movie I've seen them in is usually Hollywood garbage (Charlie's Angels, Black Dog, etc.). Granted, they probably didn't get paid that much doing this movie.This movie is great because you can come to your own conclusions about the story. After the movie you can talk to your friends about what you believed just happened and what was hard to understand about the movie. You don't get these conversations after seeing 'Van Helsing' ("I wonder why this movie was ever made").A lot of people will not like this movie because it requires you to think, which is fine by me. This movie has a huge cult following as it is and doesn't need everybody to enjoy it. The look of the film is amazing. The film represents the weird emotions of high school and youth, mixed with science fiction. You're on the edge of your seat to see what will happen at the end of the film. You get all the clues of why events are happening and you still don't understand at the end of the film, but you take these theories for the next time you watch the film.I hope more movies like this come out with a similar look and imagination. There's only so much pointless Hollywood action movies i can take (just seeing the endless commercials on TV is enough). I highly recommend this movie to people with an open mind who are not afraid to think for themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2 Ways to take this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two ways to look at this movie. The first would be to look at Donnie and think of a rebellious teenager. Where all the actions in the movie didn't actually happen. He just dreamed them the night before the accident and nothing happened.Then you could also see Donnie as a hero trying to save his girlfriend from death by going back in time.I hoped this helped people look at this movie in a different way and to consider all the possible reasons for Donnies actions. Either way this was a great movie that deserves to be near the top of the great movies list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time Travel = Thought Provoking but does not Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has some merits and coming from a relatively young writer/director that's really nice to see. However this film is in no way nor anywhere near a masterpiece. The word "masterpiece" has been cheapened if anyone actually considers this a masterpiece. I have to get something out of the way right now. The very nature of Time Travel at this stage of human development can't be anything but thought provoking. But just because a film is thought provoking in some way does not qualify it as a masterpiece as many here seem to believe. Donnie Darko is a reworked and slightly offbeat hodgepodge of many familiar themes with an added sci-fi twist. In fact this film borrows from many modern films several ways and even a few older ones as well. In some ways, however, the retuning is relatively fresh and for that I'll give credit to the young writer/director. However, and again, just because someone retools stereotypes or inverts them or what have you that does not automatically gain masterpiece status for the film in question.If memory serves this has been commented on by other reviewers but... David Lynch has explored non-linearity etc. much more effectively, skillfully and beautifully IMO than was done in Donnie Darko.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie blew me away and i have watched it many a time without ever getting bored or sick of it. There are so many different perspectives or ways of interpreting the movie that every time i watch it i discover something new. Casting was perfect as Jake Gyllenhaal brought something to Donnie that perfectly captured the hopelessness and irony of todays youth and his creepy smile that appeared at the most inappropriate times such as when handling the gun and when carrying the axe really caught me by surprise and made me cringe and then giggle my ass off.The plot is generally a boy Donnie has emotional issues and is awoken by his friend Frank, who reappears throughout the film and is saved from death. From here random events lead to Donnie believing he may have the power to affect time and possibly the future. However cryptic and involving this superhero-like drama storyline is what most enthralled me was the sideline stories that took snide swipes at modern society and our insecurities.Such examples of this were the paranoid soccer mum, who screams censorship at the top of her lungs, daytime TV preacher celebrities, self-help and psychiatry (the first hypnosis scene had me rolling in the aisles).However all this social comments do not crowd the film but add level upon level of intrigue and mystery to a complex enough cinematic experience.I would not recommend this to people who generally like simple movies and expect a horror movie because this is so much more than that it cannot be classified so simply into a genre. To true fans i would also recommend the directors cut as it raises even more issues and brings others to light such as "the manipulated dead" and the workers. Great movie which is largely considered a try-hard independent film that is not cool because it is too popular but do not fall for that rubbish, this is a true modern classic that really forces serious thought and interpretation as every person who i have watched it with had a different perspective on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DONNIE DARKO: The Director's Cut The first time I saw Donnie Darko, I was very distracted. I was drinking a lot of Heineken with some friends at this girl's house...she had a boyfriend?who was working at the time?and I had the hots for her. She insisted we watch Donnie Darko, a movie she loved. I'd heard of it, but never had a chance to see it, as it played in theaters for about twenty minutes.So the first time I saw it, I didn't get it. I enjoyed the writing ("How exactly does one suck a f***?"), the performances?Jake Gyllenhaal mixes creepiness and coolness effectively, creating a thoroughly believable, somewhat disturbed dude-?and writer/director Richard Kelly's visuals, the centerpiece of which is obviously Donnie's new imaginary pal, the six-foot rabbit named Frank, (with a head that looks like Rob Zombie's idea of the Easter Bunny). Now, the DVD Director's Cut has restored about twenty minutes of footage. Now, I couldn't exactly tell you which scenes were cut originally, but I do know that certain gaps in the first version have been patched up...as well as they could, since like most sci-fi/fantasy phantasmagorias, it runs on its own version of logic.The film opens with Donnie sprawled on the side of the road as the sun comes up. It's a weird opening; he looks like a car hit him. But Donnie just...likes to do strange things. His WASP-ish parents have sent him to a psychiatrist?he burnt down an empty house, he tells the new girl, Gretchen, (Jena Malone), "can't drive until I'm 21, that sort of thing." His parents are played by Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell, and they're two of my favorite characters in the movie. His dad, Eddie, seems like he's been in the suburbs so long he's not even jaded...Donnie's stunts, like telling an empty-headed teacher to stick a ridiculous assignment up her ass, simply make him laugh. And Mary McDonnell is a great actress...Donnie's mom is a genuinely good lady, and tries (only half-heartedly) to be the disciplinarian: "I don't think telling any woman to forcibly insert an object up her anus is something that should go without consequence," she tells her husband. "I think we should buy him a moped," he says. "I think we should get a divorce," his wife says, and they both start laughing.At the outset, Frank the giant bunny rabbit tells to Donnie to follow him out of his house, and gives him a countdown: in 28 days, the world with end. Donnie smiles, Gyllenhaal's wicked little grin reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's in The Shining. He wakes up on a golf course and when he gets home, discovers a jet engine has somehow smashed through his house, landing in his room, right on his bed. Had his imaginary friend not lured him out, he'd have been flattened.In the days that follow, he woos the new girl, Gretchen, enrages the braindead teacher who is enamored of a shallow, Brylcreemed self-help guru (portrayed by, improbably enough, Patrick Swayze), and Frank makes him...do things. Drew Barrymore and Noah Wylie have small parts as married teachers at Middlesex (brilliant name), the private school that is sort of bane of Donnie's existence while at the same time providing him with the opportunities to display to everyone around him just how full of s*** they all are. ("You know what you say to people like that?" his dad tells him at one point, "F*** You!") At one point, Wylie (who seems to only take movie roles wherein he plays a somewhat distant, cold bastard...he must know he's good at it) shakes his head as he grades papers and says to Barrymore, "Donnie Darko..." and they just smile knowingly.I might not have been QUITE as quietly whacked as Donnie when I was in high school, but I'm pretty sure I inspired a few lively teacher's lounge discussions. I like Donnie Darko the character a little more than the movie itself, because he's as weird as I am. The difference is, he's the middle child, and I'm the oldest. (Jake's older sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Donnie's older sister Elizabeth, and Donnie has a little sister, Samantha, who's part of a little girl dance troupe, "Sparkle Motion") In fact, I think the most interesting part of the movie isn't the time traveling, paradoxical weirdness but Donnie's case-study as one of the most extreme cases of Middle Child Syndrome ever.Still, the Director's Cut goes a long way to actually explaining how Donnie can see long, gelatinous tendrils growing out of people's chests, leading them to their destiny (they look like the water-alien's in The Abyss, actually)...and if you haven't seen it, well get going and check it out, because it takes a lot of time to explain. Still, when I see it, I'm always reminded of a certain girl...and while at first, I thought the ending was a little blah and contrived, I feel differently now...now, I think it takes the movie into a different realm, one where we might ask ourselves what we might sacrifice for someone we loved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko, a small review.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is by far one of my favorite movies, it has a capturing and somewhat complicated(but not too complicated) storyline not to mention the gorgeous Jake Gyllenhaal who plays Donnie Darko, a young boy about 16 or so with a mental illness. He see's a big rabbit, Frank who tells him the world will end in a certain amount of days, hours,minutes and seconds...Donnie then begins to research time travel wanting to travel back to change something in the past. He notices the sphere shapes coming from peoples chests and the people then follow them in a line of their future kind of thing. (its a little hard to explain, sorry). He finds his way back and he ends up dying in the past...which of course means hes not alive in the future...which means that things which he did closer to the start of the movie (flood the school, burn a guys house down and shoot Frank) never happened. One of the last scenes is of Frank(without his rabbit head on) crying in Donnie's room looking at a picture Donnie drew of him. It then shows the family crying...and the song in the last scene is ALWAYS sticking in your head :P all in all its a great movie but don't watch it too late @ night if your young cos its a little complicated :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Their are two versions which are very different. The original is a masterpiece that combines teen comedy, romance, mystery, science fiction, and some say horror into a beautiful intricate storyline which is left open to the viewer's imagination allowing the viewer to form his own opinion. this is the only place that I have seen vagueness pay off. Whatever you do see this version first. The directors cut however contains excerpts from the book that force the viewer into the directors interpretation and assign the characters stupid rolls. Donnie Darko has everything from a guy in a demonic bunny suit to things coming out of people's chests.</fullReview>

Most could describe it as a strange, over-complicated, difficult to understand movie, but that is what the normal cinema viewer would say. While millions watch worthless and meaningless pictures such as Titanic and Star Wars, those multi billion earning movies, the really good ones, with real meaning and purpose, are cast aside, barely remembered. I would say that this story Is an excellent philosophical and brutally harsh yet true outlook on all our lives, but displays it in a very entertaining and humorous way. This is just one of those movies that i could watch over and over and over again without ever getting bored, if only more of these movies actually made it from the those brilliant minds who concoct them and onto the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great minds discuss ideas. Small minds discuss other people. And this is the reason I so love DONNIE DARKO, it's all about the ideas. Was Donnie schizo, or were these things really happening. Or more to the point, do they only happen to schizo people? My step-sister is schizo and so far all she sees are spiders in the shower, haven't seen any giant rabbits yet. I think that was the point Kelly was trying to make, that something like schizo is just a different perception of the world. Who can really say that the prophets in the Bible, if examined today, would be declared mentally ill as well? You ever notice in the Bible every time a messenger of God appears, the first thing they say is "do not fear"! I really think when the Antichrist comes, he will use virtual reality to offer the final temptation of humanity, how else would you get through to the MTV/PS2 generation? Anyway, back to the movie. The philosophy of time travel book was just a macguffin. No such book exists, unless it's a work of fiction, just like this movie. Donnie's plight also suggests the plight of hyper-intelligent, hyper-sensitive people who see the world differently and do not easily fit into the so called "normal" world. These people often keep to themselves, have a few, if any, friends, and are widely derided in their community as "losers", "misfits", "nerds", "geeks". Like I said, small minds discuss other people. Great minds discuss ideas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just recently rented this movie(2005), mainly cause it was an employee favorite at Blockbuster, but WOW! This is one of those movies that makes you sit there in silence for a few moments thinking as it ends. Straight up this is a weird movie, no getting around it. And while watching it you will be asking yourself "what the hell is going on?". Even after I've seen the movie I'm still asking myself that same question. Well, this movie has some unexplainable appeal. I mean, i was reading some of the 'preview' stuff thinking this movie is going to be stupid, mainly cause of all this giant rabbit nonsense(which has no real relevance until you get through the entire movie). To give some insight about it, it is about a high school age teen, who takes medication to soothe some condition he has(not sure what) and he hears and sees really strange things(particularly a large scary rabbit who's name is Frank). The characters are believable and interesting. Gyllenhal makes a awesome performance here. After i seen "The Day After Tomorrow" i thought he was just some goofy pretty-boy who was only around because he knew someone, but i cant think of anyone better for this role. The supporting cast is also great and has some heavy hitters like Swayze and Barrymoore. All and all i highly recommend this movie, but i cant put a finger on why. If nothing else it is entertaining and appeals to the emotions and intellect in a way very few movies do.One more thing, the song at the end is icing on the cake for this movie. And somewhat puts it into perspective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Treatment of time travel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By Donnie breaking a cycle (being killed by the engine from the plane his mother is on) the sequence of events resulting in his mother needing to be on the plane wouldn't exist (Jim Cunningham not being exposed and so on). This would cause a minor alteration in the time line of the tangent universe. If Donnie is not alive to expose Jim Cunningham then his mother will not be on the plane (family life would change greatly with the loss of a son, this could mean a hiatus on sparkle motions trip) thereby his mother would be in the house when the engine drops, if it drops at all. If you are to repair a fault in time, shouldn't the "plug" in the time line be a method that ultimately allows for a seamless cycle of continuous reparation, otherwise the fix will work for one pass but the resources to continue to maintain that fix will no longer be available and in fact will be a slightly different problem, (this time Donnies mother will be in the house). This all of coarse is crap if you consider maybe the fault arises merely due to Donnie existing (???)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko is an interesting film,but still has it's problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I think this was one of the better films I have seen in my life(and I have seen some bad ones). What I really liked about the movie was Jake Gyllenhaal's performance. Jake really nails his performance by not being too subtle, but not chewing the scenery at the same time. Patrick Swayze also did a good job as the very lame Jim Cunninghan(who is made real because there are really people who put on bad shows like that). Frank(James Duval),the bunny, was a very weird ,mysterious, and creepy character. Always when Frank left I anticipated his return. The rest of the cast was good.There are still some problems with the film. One is there are too many 'symbols' and 'meanings' to keep track off. Richard Kelly just puts in a lot of people and events to try and make the movie more philosophical but just ends creating problems with the flow of the story. Like having it being about an alienated teen, time travel, and having faith in God. Jolene Purdy's character(Cherita Chen) was almost completely pointless and if she was taken out of the movie out it would not have made a difference(I think Jolene Purdy is a capable actress, just underused). It just makes the story overblown with ideas that Richard Kelly should save for another movie. Another is that some scenes just end too quickly. Yes, I know it is used to create suspense,but it just ends up being pointless. Also the ending didn't make much sense. So it is a flawed but good film.Recommended films that make you think: Vertigo Citizen Cane 2001: A Space Odyssey(my personal favorite ever)Apocalypse Now</fullReview>

When Donnie and Gretchen are walking, and he wants to kiss her but she say no because she wants it to be beautiful, there is a fat man in a red suite just standing there. I figured that, that had absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie. But then, he appeared again, at the party that Donnie and Elizabeth threw. I believe its in the first party scene when people are walking on the sidewalk up to his house. The man in the red suite is standing there smoking... I think that this has a big significance that a lot of people have brushed off.Gretchen said that she didn't want to kiss Donnie because the man in the red suit made it not a beautiful thing. And then the night of the party he standing and thats when Frank and Gretchen die in the "Alternative" universe.If someone could please tell me their thoughts on the m,an in the red suit that would be great because not many people mention him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a contemporary film captures the attention of many persons willing to vote and offer comments on this site, it means usually that it is some high-budget, well-publicized piece of schlock featuring some non-actor like the Arnold or the Bruce. All glitz and technical appeal with little or no artistic merit. This one is in part an exception to that formula.To be sure, it is a very slick bit of movie-making with all the usual gimmicks involving computerized visuals and time bending, but it simultaneously offers extraordinary appeal in character development and some very good acting indeed. Just to mention the obvious: young Jake Gyllenhall, Mary McDonnell, Noah Wyle, Katharine Ross, and even Drew Barrymore (who for once plays a role with subtlety and depth).So much for the good and the bad. The ugly is of no consequence unless one buys into all the superfluous stuff that constitutes plot. That is nothing more than overwrought and pretentious drivel -- rabbit costumes and wormholes and airplane parts dropping out of the sky, etc., etc.Look instead for what is truly worthwhile social commentary, together with superb insights into the mind of a troubled but brilliant teenager. The interaction between Ross and Gyllenhall, for example, is reminiscent of some Oscar-winning scenes of old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director's Cut: a little less powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the original, so I snapped up the director's cut DVD when it came out.I have to say that, although some bits of it were interesting, in most respects the original was more powerful.** possible spoilers ahead ** The DC integrates some deleted scenes, some musical changes and some new visual effects, including pages from the "time travel book".The deleted scenes are OK, but frankly not especially noticeable, and certainly don't change anything of significance. In this case, it seems most of the deletions were good editing choices in the original.The added visual effects mainly consist of some computer generated 2d images of some kind of computer or visual interface which is meant to be in control of what is happening. The graphics ranged from mildly interesting (an eye, waves) to extremely cheesy (flashing English words!). In particular, the "purge" sequence seems totally inappropriate and low-tech. Seeing an English word on a fairly basic looking windows-like interface... that's not exactly what you'd expect from some kind of higher being(s) modifying the universe! I listened to the director's explanation of the graphics and his ideas for the science-fiction element, and I came to the conclusion that there was a certain amount of luck in the original edit managing to reveal just enough; once you heard it explained it really wasn't as interesting as you might imagine. For instance, the idea of God actually being involved is fairly clearly stamped out by the technological flavour.The musical changes were fine with me. The opening song (INXS, Never Tear Us Apart), I liked. I thought that fitted just as well or better than the original choice.Selected pages of the time travel book mentioned in the original are shown in full, overlaid/interwoven with other scenes. These were mildly interesting, but seemed quite intrusive to me. They were clearly just added over top and didn't need to be there. They also seemed a little simplistic or matter-of-fact for what seems quite a mind-bending story.Generally, I prefer director's cuts (ex: Bladerunner, LOTR) but not in this case. Stick with the original. This is only really worthwhile for completeness.</fullReview>

NOTHING. a lot of this movie was pointless, and the rest of it, while somewhat intriguing, wasn't worth the watch.and the ending just angered me. i mean, no. if you like a congruent, laid out plot that people can understand, this movie is not for you. if you like cracked-out movies that make no sense and annoy you at the end, then by all means, see Donnie Darko.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whatever its about my heads spinning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you've just finished studying a controversial English book in your local English class, the last thing you want to see is a giant demonic bunny rabbit who just happens to tell you when the world is going to end. For schizophrenic high school student Donnie Darko this is everyday life. After cheating death through his weird experience Donnie seeks answers to the riddle that is 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds. Richard Kelly's debut film is certainly a thought provoking one with as many, if not more twists then Thorpe parks record-breaking roller-coaster Colossus.The genre of the film is the first thing that gets your mind going, it has elements to a high school teen movie, a sci-fi, a fantasy, a romance, a horror or a thriller. Many define it as an Indie art house film but for the purpose of keeping it basic this is predominately a Fantasy Sci-fi Thriller, which in itself still doesn't tell you much His casting of Gyllenhaal as Darko was certainly a good one as he carries the film fairly well, showing why he was seen as the natural replacement to Tobey Maguire as Spiderman. What it is about him is that he has this innocent look about him, which means when he turns menacing he fits the eerie bill perfectly. The rest of the cast turn in recommendable turns too. Most of them are very low key, as you would expect in an art house type low budget film like this one. But the two that aren't, in the shape of Patrick Swayze (returning from oblivion) as a motivational speaker and Drew Barrymore as an unconventional poetry teacher, are seemingly wasted in roles that aren't really of any necessity to the already convoluted plot line.The bunny gives the film an Alice in wonderland feel, as Darko seems to follow it down a rabbit hole. Its eerie presence isn't as much scary as it is just weird, but it really adds to the intriguing storyline that follows its appearance. The storyline stays fascinating because at no one point up to the end does it become clear where or Kelly is actually going or like the Wachowski's in the Matrix Trilogy whether he knows where he is going. He explores many things such as Time travel and Schizophrenia, even the sexual nature of the Smurfs! But in between throws in lots of red herrings, which at the end means the film, is simply open for interpretation.The special effects the film produces are nothing special in the way that they seem very MTV Pop video type. The wormhole effects and the snake thing at the end are probably the only ones of any real note, but then from a film made on just 270,000 dollars you can't expect to get effects of the standard of the Titanic.Much of the story structure seems to hinge on Darko's sanity, as his Schizophrenia worsens his acts get more dangerous and more eccentric. On the other hand he seems to stand on the edge of a miraculous discovery. His one anchor for sanity comes in Joanie, the love interest. It is when she is absent in Darko's life whether she is asleep or unconscious that his behaviour deteriorates into something worse.Unfortunately Kelly's eccentric in plot line is one of the things that let the film down at times. Towards the end, he throws so much in that the viewer is overloaded. What he does well is he doesn't talk down to the viewer almost expecting the viewer to know what he's talking about often offering little explanation to what is happening before your eyes. But it is the final overload of information, that for many will let the film down but is also the kind of ending that earns you a cult status, as many struggle to figure it out. Without a doubt Kelly is an up and coming director who has you on the edge of your seat in this multi genre film which in the end I can conclude is an unsetting, original film that is undoubtedly well worth a look if you haven't got much on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most spectacular things one can do in a film is play on your childhood emotions. This was done so well in Donnie Darko. How many times did you feel like screaming or vomiting when watching one of those pitiful school videos in gym class? How many years in a row did you have to listen to your morbidly obese gym teacher telling you to get into shape? And how many nights did you sit in your room terrified that one day you were going to die alone? Donnie Darko helps you put it all in perspective. No matter how much the Man tries to tell you otherwise, nine times out of ten, you're right and He's wrong. He's the child pornographer telling you you're afraid. He's the coke snorting fella that puts a knife to your throat regardless of the fact that you're in fact in the right. He's the crazy guy in the bunny suit that runs over your girlfriend and then gets shot in the eye, because He was wrong. That's why Donnie Darko doesn't suck.PS Donnie was the good guy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the film a lot because - 1. it contained a touching romance plot - Donnie &amp; the new girl in town, a vulnerable young woman who seems to die and does not deserve her death; 2. the supernatural character was completely enigmatic: this dimension of the plot cannot be boxed into a neat framework of explanation. Who is Frank ? Where did he come from ? What is he up to ? 3. some kind of scheme of poetic justice seems to be in operation - Swazye's character turns out to be evil, the "wicked" Donnie is actually vindicated for the viewer 4. the music at the end of the film was appropriately stirring, lending a tone reminiscent of the composer Henryk Górecki's most moving work; 5. the viewer is wrenched out of the usual process of narrative expectations eg in which normality goes awry then is repaired by a hero: allowing the possibility of time travel enables Donnie to sacrifice himself to save the new girl. Nevertheless the story could loosely be called a tragedy, ending the film on a note of suicidal heroism, leaving the viewer with an implied statement of the nobility of man.A friend recommended the film to me &amp; he was right...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This great movie contains a lot of philosophical elements beneath the surface, many that are the greatest of mankind, death, the existence of God, fate and free will, and are discussed by Donnie Darko as he progresses through his strange world. You get the sense that while he is having some crazy dreams, there's a sense to what he says, a basic, primal sense that cuts through all the crap most movies fling at you and gets to you on a human level. It's nice to see a film that doesn't add confusing "artistic" elements just for the sake of confusion, as many of the more artsy films that are supposedly "deep" today tend to do. Donnie Darko is about a real character who says things bluntly but truly. It's hard to refute a lot of the basic truisms he offers up during his mad scramble to figure out the world around him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Experience To Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko should be a great experience for viewers who look for originality, entertainment, obscurity, eccentricities, romance, horror, intense thrill, all in a single movie, because Donnie darko successfully provides all. The most beautiful aspect of this movie however, is that it goes beyond the conventional film-viewing dimensionality. Usually, movies are able to be interpreted by the viewers based on everything that is provided in the movie. Therefore, after watching the movie several times, the viewer may be able to fully understand what the movie is about because every little fundamentally important detail is within the remits of the movie. Donnie Darko transcends beyond this because the movie itself is a mere tool illustrating the events that take place in the movie, with the rest of the information being somewhere beyond the movie. This gives the viewer a feeling of being somewhere in between the land and the sky. The info which is not provided in the movie is very important if one is to understand DD because it ties together the events shown in the movie and helps one to construct their own perception of its ultimate reality.THIS IS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN DD AND CANNOT EXPLAIN IT. It is not my style to give out spoilers. Therefore, although i have understood DD completely, I will not make an attempt to explain it. There are however, a few steps which will help you to make more sense of the movie: 1. Watch the movie once. 2. Straight after watching the movie, go to www.donniedarko.com and complete the website (it should take you no more than 1 hour). The website has some very important information which will be slowly retrieved after solving basic puzzles and passwords to do with the movie. Thats why it is important to watch the movie at least once to view the website. 3. After going through the website, Construct your theory of the movie either mentally or on paper. 4. Watch the movie again (hopefully, you will be uttering "ahaaa" after every 10 minutes of the movie). 5. Watch the directors cut version of Donnie Darko. 6. Watch DD for the third time. BINGO. It will all fall into place for you. Overall, I would have to say that DD is a one-of-a-kind movie which charmingly breaks the boundaries of conventionality to yield a very intriguing product that will stay with you in your conscious mind upon solving it and weeks later will channel itself through to your sub-conscious mind. Rating For Donnie Darko = 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but mostly in the /feel/ of the movie, the atmosphere and the time travel aspects. And of course, because there's a crazy guy involved, but he's no Brad Pitt.SPOILERS AHEADLooks like many other have already covered the story aspects of this film, so I'll not reiterate, but assume you, the reader, have read the descriptions and go on from there. First of all, it felt like a French film in the sense of a great big "HUH." at the end of the movie. It is somewhat open for interpretation, though not nearly as much so as the typical "I want to say something big but don't know how" French flick. Still, there is a very definite sense that the writer wanted to say something, wanted to make and/or argue a point and maybe in the screenplay he did... and when it was translated to film, it lost its eloquence. Now folks, weirdness does not a good movie make, just as big flowery words and descriptions do not a good poem make. What is makes is fluff... padding. And it's not needed. Donnie Darko is certainly interesting, I will give it that, but there's more than a few brow furrowers here. My biggest gripe, oddly enough, is with Drew Barrymore, one of the many executive producers. Whether she actually WAS a producer or was given that title as a means of coaxing her into the movie (sometimes it's a form of 'payment'), I don't know, but what DID her character have to do with anything?? We watch her get fired. Do we care? NO, because we don't know why she's even there. Well, her most poignant 2 words, "Cellar Door" is, I think, her only meaningful lines besides the fact that she is the evil, free-thinking teacher who introduced the book that was the cause behind the school flooding. That could have been handled differently and given to a more important character. She is totally unnecessary. Patrick Swayze's character... again, I suppose added in there only for some incredibly minor plot points that could have been handled differently, too. He was a very weak link, much like Barrymore, and there just was no reason for them at all. If you watch this movie, pay close attention to their parts in the film. Maybe I'm missing something, but they were some seriously big pieces of fluff. The fat little girl who says only "Shut up!!" twice in the movie and nothing more, though I did like her little talent show dance routine... why was she there? I thought maybe that, while she was sitting outside after the dance, she would look out and be the one to alert SOMEone that Jim's (Swayze's) house was on fire or something... anything that made her being there actually have a modicum of sense. No... nothing unless it was deleted. I didn't bother with the special features. The more I think about it, the more I realize that almost ALL the characters were unnecessary, redundant, and fluff only and maybe that was the writer's statement... but then, we get into the French attitude there and there's a reason I don't watch French films.The whole Frank thing was fascinating. He of the injured eye, the one line of cryptic "I'm so sorry" in the theater. (They were watching Evil Dead and making danged sure they never showed Campbell, but I have to give them kudos for the movie choice.) Around that time, I was getting flashbacks of "American Werewolf in London" where the main character sees the undead souls of this victims and talks to them. It was kind of like that but not. And Frank tells Donnie to do things like burn down houses for no apparent reason. Oh thank goodness mister "Fearlove" was actually a child porn baddie, but not like anyone knew, so it made no sense to burn down his house in any kind of righteous anger or anything. And there was no righteous anger, Frank just said do it, so Donnie did, for no particular reason. We find out much later than Frank and his bunny suit is actually the killer of Gretchen and gets shot in the eye, but you know, it's not really fair of the writer, because the guy who plays Frank is not important to the storyline except as the bunny. There is no foreshadowing, there is no hint, it's like a poorly written mystery novel where we, the viewer, don't get enough to figure it out, we're not privy to what the detectives know, and /that's/ the big mystery. Of course, it doesn't have to be linear. Obviously, this movie was going against linear things, but whenever time travel is involved, I have to cringe: it always makes such a mess of things.So there's the jet engine that ends up being the engine of his mother and sister's plane 28 days in the future. It crashes through Donnie's room, he's out cuz the bunny told him to be, so he lives, and the movie happens. In the end, it all happens all over again except that Donnie is in his room and dies, thus creating a new reality where the bad things that happened to people like Gretchen don't happen. Except it's his mom's jet engine and she may or may not have gone on that trip 28 days in the future now that Donnie's dead and none of the stuff ever happened. Weird, yes, but it's not a mind bender in the smart sense since anything to do with time inescapably gets warped, ruined and twisted in a way that wouldn't happen if time travel were possible. It's the grin and bear it syndrome. So be it.Summary: It's a good movie and worth a watching. Some people swear by this flick and more power to them. But I say strip away the fluff and fancy words and see what's underneath, look at the base. Does it stand on its own? Donnie Darko is a bit wobbly, but it manages to spin a fascinating tale and should be rented, not bought, and viewed at least once if you're in the mood for something French but that makes more sense. On the technical side, good camera work, rich filming, decent directing and an eerie atmosphere. The acting is pretty solid. The main character was creepy and scary, yet we could sympathize with him and his love interest. It is a well-made movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must confess on the outset, that I watched the film solely because of the high rating, and I was bitterly disappointed. I can't believe you morons gave it an 8.3/10 rating!Calling this film 'average' would be over-generous. It is a disturbed (not disturbing) movie and an utter waste of time. I love surreal films or indeed anything not mainstream but Donnie Darko left me totally cold and I was thrilled only when I saw the end credits!All characters in this film are cardboard figures, without any depth; usual stereotypes Yawn Yawn Yawn; the college bully, the disturbed kid, the new gal in town, the pious teacher ... you have it! Add this kind of thrash to a totally ridiculous story about giant bunnies and parallel universe and you get Donnie Darko. Was the time-travel supposed to add some kind of credibility to this ridiculous movie, by giving us a far-fetched if mildly plausible solution? Was it supposed to keep us at the edge of our seats, or deprive us of our sleep trying to decipher the plot? As usual, people who can't understand this movie, will attempt to label it as a 'cult' or 'eccentric' masterpiece. As in the story - 'The Emperor's New Clothes' - I suggest that some of you wake up from your 'pseudo-intellectualism' and starkly say that the fat king is naked! Ergo, the harsh truth is that this film is crap and does not go beyond a 4/10 rating!Wake up, sheeple.</fullReview>

It is those people who claim to see the truth, and so are able to control the future, who are blind to reality. Frank is another word for Truth, Dur.So to say it has no meaning and is open to interpretation is neither true nor false, because the whole premise of the film was to deny a structural analysis of life.

		<shortDescription>original cut is better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a short note:Having seen the "original cut" on DVD, and enjoyed it (enough to watch the movie again straight away with the commentary) - I saw it recently on the big screen. It was the "director's cut" and, while I usually find the big screen experience much much more satisfying than watching a DVD on TV, I have to say that I thought the director's cut was far inferior to the previously released version. It is, frankly, a bit of a mess. It manages to include, seemingly, a lot more material, while being even more confusing. Not mysterious, not fascinating, not tantalising; just confusing. I would guess that an intelligent film fan, watching the director's cut without having seen the movie before, would not have a clue what "happened".Not true with the other version - you get it, you can piece it all together, and the original film is a little delight in that regard. You are given enough information to work it out, but not enough to sense that, actually it doesn't really add up (which is hinted at in the DVD commentary). In the directors cut, you are left thinking "huh?". Furthermore, the mystery as to the nature of the happening is spoiled with a load of pointless "computer vision" inserts, on-screen graphics that add nothing but a jarring note.So - forget the director's cut. It's an indulgence and a mistake. Go for the original film as released. It's just a better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>full of camp and teen angst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just watched the movie and having just read the first abysmal comment left by some belicose Ebert &amp; Roeper wannabe, I would like to contribute my own opinions to the movie Donnie Darko.I sat down to watch the movie expecting some vapid, Hollywood teen thriller saturated with mild pornography, whiny suburban rock, and a couple of cute teen faces. Ah! how looks can deceive! Instead I found a campy, dark, sweet love story about teenage alienation and the meaning of the universe.I should have known immediately, with an incongruent Patrick Swayze in the credits, as well as dimpled Drew Barrymore, that something was awry, and that this was no simple summer flick. The film is rife with genre reference and kudos, Stephen King and Sam Raimi among the most blatant. The surface of the story is indeed a confused sci-fi fantasy about time-travel, highschool alienation, teenage love, and rebellion. But to leave it at that would be impertinent, it would be like reading Camus's L'Etranger and deriding it for something as simple as murder story.Standing on a beach With a gun in my hand Staring at the sea Staring at the sand Staring down the barrel At the arab on the ground See his open mouth But hear no sound-- The Cure, Killing an ArabEnter Happy Camper #1, Donnie Darko. A slightly deranged though sympathetic loner who disagrees with everyone, doesn't fit in, and is plagued by dreams of death and destruction. Obviously if you don't sympathize with him, you've led a life of drab conformity! Happy Camper #2, his girlfriend, Joanie James, who's mother is a battered wife, who's step-father is homicidal, and who has to face the ritual ridicule that new schools seem designed to promote (at least in white suburban America that is). So we've got the hero and his love, a hero who is being led by a sibilant voice in the form of a nightmare bunny rabbit (Jimmy Stewart never had hallucinations like this, that's for sure) which, surprisingly, isn't that original, having been used in both "Of Mice and Men" and "Harvey", though certainly never so menacingly. Proceeding. Our morose and disgruntled protagonist ambles along the plot line, only becoming tangled with the possibility of time travel (Stephen Hawkins obviously a sh*t disturber). What if, what if? What if it were possible to change time? What if in doing so you annihilated God? What if in doing so you annihilated yourself? (Teachers be forewarned, you can lose your job over this line of thinking) and so... Enter Patrick Swayze, Happy Camper #3, who seems to have conquered all of life's dilemmas by vanquishing fear, the Almighty Fear (brought on no less by alcohol, drugs, and eeee! pre-marital sex! Does this sound like a panacea? Sure does, but our hero can see right through his polarized morality. Isn't the gamut of human emotion more than just FEAR and LOVE, can't the two sometimes combine, or even collide?Donnie Darko is about one boy's choice to live alone, an existential duel between faith and fear. He is given no option, no saving grace, only a repetitious plague of waking nightmares that remind him of his estrangement.If he tunes out the calling of the voice, if he shatters fate, then he knows that the universe is empty, that there is no redemption in heaven, and that he must face oblivion. However, if he continues along the path, the foreseen future, rife with its hallucinations and demons, he will never be sane, will never be normal, and will lose the only person he comes to care about. Like he says "What's the point of living if you don't have a dick?" If there is no hope, if there is no love, who cares. But what if love drives to to an even greater alienation, what if love forces you to destroy the "world" the Cosmos (in its original meaning), and so doing, destroys you. What choice is that? Well, Donnie chooses, and the world does go on... so maybe Death isn't waiting in Samara after all.I won't uphold my writing, or the structure of this argument, because it sucks and I'm tired, but I feel that if I at least garner a response, a retort, or even sympathy for this movie, then I haven't wasted my time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...bad acting (especially from the renowned actors like Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze), apparently low budget and poor execution turned it into a mere second rate sfi-fi-'horror' flick. It also tries just a little too hard to deliver its message and so tends to be somewhat over-obvious from time to time. Good concept though. Pity it wasn't managed properly. 4/10.If you want to see something in just about the same pace but with a better performance (and probably considerably larger budget:) I would suggest 'Solaris'.Herr Richelieu</fullReview>

		<fullReview>wow what a movie i loved this movie the depth of thought and symbolism anyone who dislikes this movie has no sense of creativity or imagination. the allegory's present in this movie and the symbolism i have seen it 5 times and I'm still catching things that provoke deep thought. A must see for anyone who enjoys making up there own minds and not being fed bulls***. this movie is one of my all time favorites its so dark and so surreal with so many hidden meanings and messages i loved it even the music score is great mad world is a freaky song that inspires nostalgia in me. i recommend this movie to virtually everyone with the exception of those that are extremely squeamish those with very little imagination those that have problems with anything dark and anyone who is deeply religious and cant handle some religious philosophy because of there convictions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start this review off by using one of my favorite movie dialogue quotes, this one from "Repo Man": "People get so hung up on specifics that they miss out on the whole thing." There are people scratching their heads left and right, arguing about whether "Donnie Darko" is a cult film, an art film, a horror movie, a teen-angst movie, a fantasy, a self-important, overrated piece of crap, an underrated classic, blah, blah, blah, and, etc., and etc. (I know this very well, I've found myself to be one of them. :&gt; ). Anyhoo, regardless of whether anyone can pigeonhole this movie or no (especially the jerks out there who call any fan of this movie an idiot and a sucker), this is a great movie. If you have to categorize it and slap on a label on it, why don't we say it's almost everything? This film is full of moving emotional intensity, regardless of genre association or whatever else. It has a lot of truthful things to say, and, despite what some think, it's no teenybopper flick either. The sign of angst is not illustrated in this film by Donnie (played DAMN WELL by Jake Gyllenhaal) looking out from under hair, okay? That's the sign of someone on the verge of complete madness! Get it right! And that one feature on its own does not illustrate this alone, either, because this is well-written, well-acted, and all-around WELL-MADE. If it hurts your head to figure out what's underneath it all, let your mind go and watch it as a MOVIE. Chances are you'll still enjoy it, if you're not looking for a reason to condemn it. This is one of the most moving, entertaining, and deep films to come out during the past few years, and it is one of the few non-schlock movies of recent times that I actually give more than a flying squirrel's ass about. Some say there's nothing deep and thoughtful about this. Again, people get hung up on specifics. Anyone who knows what it's like to be a teenager in the US should see that this movie has depth, especially since it's not one of those "Heathers" rip-offs. As far as Frank the bunny rabbit, doesn't anyone see that this character is not from the far-off future? Who in the HELL came up with that one? This guy looks to me like he has very much in common with Donnie. I think he is a tortured, young artist who stumbled upon the truth in an unexplained way. (And, believe me, with many movies, including this one, some explanations are BETTER LEFT UNEXPLAINED.) I think that, somehow, he saw something in Donnie that was very important to him, so he wanted to pass his knowledge on to Donnie. Does it make sense that way? Well, this movie is mainly about very unstable people and their personal demons. When the characters you care about are unstable, the movie is unstable, as well as the message. So it will make sense to some, but not everyone. In any case, it certainly makes more since than Frank being from the year 3000, or some garbage like that! Anyway, I love this film, even as I understand that it simultaneously begs to be read into and isn't easily read into at all. Regardless, "Donnie Darko" is one of the best movies ever made, and no one should be called a moron for enjoying it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The beauty of this film, and that of my own that i wrote, is that it is his first film and gives him the power to experiment without it being related to any of his other material. Has anyone ever thought that maybe, just maybe, some of the dialogue or material in the movie is there for no other reason other than to add to the heightened feeling of confusion. This also means that the scope is wide open for personal reflection. When viewing a painting, or any other piece of art, is there ever a wrong way to perceive it? I think its great that everyone has so many ideas, and in some way feel that our own opinions come from somewhere influenced by own our lives...you see what you want to see. I sometimes feel that there is something else going on in this life, and that we are merely a background issue. If you think too hard about things, and our miniscule roles in the big picture it sometimes makes your head hurt, and can make you feel bad about yourself....If he was 'the one' then maybe it was his happy ending to die, after all.....ignorance is bliss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>********CONTAINS SPOILERS***********I have seen many recommendations for this movie, one from a close friend who's opinion I value, so when I saw it cheap on sale as a DVD, I bought it, thinking it was about time I gave it a go. Well, the upshot is I don't like it. That's not to say that I think it was a bad movie; certainly it was well written and competently acted and, give a sigh of relief, does not fall into the Hollywood mainstream.So why didn't I like it? First of all, I think it's something to do with the style which writer/director Richard Kelly decided to do it. FRANK, the mysterious figure of Darko's apparent hallucinations, is dressed in a rabbit suit. This leads one to think of another famous movie with a six foot rabbit, Harvey. Certainly from reading the synopses of this movie - something like "The world is coming to an end and only Donnie Darko knows anything about it" - one might have thought that Donnie Darko falls into the same category as Harvey and other movies in which the protagonist sees things that other people can't and consequently appears to everybody else to be a madman. (Blithe Spirit (1946) is another example.) However, there is a crucial difference between Harvey and Donnie Darko. Harvey works because the audience *believes the protagonist*. However mad or drunk James Stewart acts, the audience knows that Harvey is real and that Stewart's behaviour is consistent. What we see in Donnie Darko, however, is a character set up as emotionally disturbed. He sees a mysterious character, who tells him to do things - bad things, illegal things - and Darko does them. He's responding to the "voices in his head", and the fact that we, the audience, also see Frank, does not alter the fact that we see Darko from our point of view as normal people do. The consequences of these actions reveal some evil in one case and lead to tragedy in another. At the end, however, we see Kelly resorting to what we Star Trek fans refer to as "the rewind button", and consequently we can interpret (here comes the SPOILER) the entire movie as being a paranoid delusion of Darko's. Apparently the tragic outcome no longer occurs, but then neither does the revelation of genuine evil in a character thought of by the locals as good.What all this amounts to is that the message of this movie appears to me to be "Paranoid schizophrenics really *are* better off dead!" which I'm sure Kelly didn't intend. But because of the style where what was in Darko's head was never seen outside his head, it is the unavoidable conclusion.As a general work of moviemaking, there are a number of flaws. Although Darko and his fellow students are described by Barrymore's teacher character as apathetic and emotionally detached, I feel the script takes emotional detachment far too much to its heart. The revelation of evil I spoke of is the discovery that Swayze's inspirational speaker is in fact a child porn merchant. But we don't remotely see what this involved (apart from a few lines about a "dungeon" in his house) and after the revelation we never even meet the character again. Then again, Kitty's defense of him occurs in one scene but has no further consequences. Kitty's character is inconsistent - she is a religiously-inclined woman who wants an innocent Graham Greene short story banned, yet she also apparently choreographed a troupe of 13-year old girls to dance in the sexiest manner possible. Is there a connection with this, her devotion to Swayze's character, and his predilections? It simply isn't explored. The character of Donnie's love interest, Gretchen Ross, isn't formed fully enough for us to be able to either empathise with her or with Donnie's fascination for her. After he asks her to "go with him" and she says yes, she doesn't appear again until after Donnie's talk with Mrs Thurman (a long-awaited reappearance from Katharine Ross, incidentally) in which he confesses his fear of dying alone. This is a fundamental structural flaw - it's almost like Kelly forgot about her in the intervening scenes.I'm afraid that whatever concepts Kelly has of time travel indicate a woeful ignorance of the extensive literature on time travel, both by scientists and in the realm of serious science fiction, causing everything to be said by all the characters on this subject to be vapid pseudo-intellectual rubbish which didn't make the first step towards explaining the ultimate working out of the movie's plot.Supposed stylistic elements like the use of fast cutting, hand held cameras, mixed slow and fast motion, had no contribution to make to our understanding of the story or the characters, particularly Darko, and came across as a rookie director putting those things in to attract attention to himself.</fullReview>

I'd say that this is the story of a boy, named Donnie Darko. That's all. I heard about this movie from a friend and at first, when he said that it was the story about a guy that sees a talking rabbit, I thought it was one of those stupid movies that are made with no budjet but I've rent it anyway (I do like no budjet movies) and I was surprised!

		<shortDescription>mindless teen crap. (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyody I knew that saw this said things to me like, "oh my god, it's so good and the ending is open to so many conclusions, it's so powerful", blah, blah, whatever. What I saw was a hastily put-together, heavily stereotypical teen movie. When it first came out I thought maybe that Hollywood was trying to cash in on the success of Donnie Brasco by putting out a sequel. Even that would have been more interesting than what I saw. Donnie Darko is a disturbed teen living at home with his yuppie scum parents. He gets drunk in his spare time, sees a therapist (of course), gets made fun of by bullies that could have come straight out of American Pie, and meets a really hot girl who would never have even given him the time of day if the movie were real. Halfway through the movie, he begins to have hallucinations of a man who looks like Lou Diamond Phillips in a f*cked up looking rabbit mask. This character, named Frank, tells him about how the end of the world is coming. As a result of that, Donnie basically goes out and does what he wants. He meets this crazy old lady that was supposed to have written a book about time travel. If there was anything that explains the whole freaking premise of the movie, it was this scene, and we NEVER see the old woman again. He begins to read the book, and during that time he starts going out with the hot girl, Gretchen. They eventually go to some party and (it is assumed) has sex with her. Towards the end of the movie, Gretchen dies. At the VERY end, Gretchen is still alive and Donnie Darko dissapears off the face of the earth, leaving us to assume he traveled back in time, killed himself, or moved to Sri Lanka. Sound like it makes no sense? It doesn't.This seemed like some kind of nonsense art movie, that the director made because he had extra time, or maybe as a tax writeoff. The reason why I disliked it was because it was just another teen movie, complete with it's cast of "pretty" characters and unreal situations. I'm sorry, but you can't make a serious teen movie. It just isn't possible. And you can't make a teen movie then throw in some intelligent sounding time-travel/armageddon/hallucinatory concept to make it, uh, NOT a teen movie. Also, during the movie, every two scenes or so, we get to see just how many days are left until armageddon. It almost seems like they put those in there to keep the person watching the movie. If you want to see an intelligent, avant-garde art movie, watch Naked Lunch. If you want to see a rushed, stereotypical teen movie with some sci-fi elements thrown in, watch this turkey. Maybe two out of five stars. Maybe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My new favorite movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the last month, I have seen this movie three times. It is one of the best movies I've ever watched and definitely my favorite movie that has come out within the last five years. It's wonderful! I think that it is not only realistic (in the emotional anxiety the lead character suffers from), but also because it really shows how people can hide their true feelings and keep a smile on their faces, even when they're really feeling like crap on the inside. Everyone in this movie did such a terrific job. The only person I felt was not suitable for her role was Jena Malone. She was great in Stepmom, but not right for this character she tried to portray. However, the lead, Jake Gyllanhaal, really shined. I have only seen him in two other roles, the first of the two others was, Moonlight Mile, and The Good Girl, in which he also plays a little mentally disturbed. And being an avid Drew Barrymore fan, I felt that this was the best role she had ever been in, as small as it may have been. I was also surprised to learn that she was one of the executive producers to the film.All in all it was a great watch, and I can't wait to watch it with more people to see what their reactions will be. And in case you don't already know it, a fun piece of trivia is that Jake's sister in the movie, is his real sister in real life too. Noah Wyle and Patrick Swayze were the other two small characters in the film and I thought they were really good. I'm not a big fan of Swayze's but I thought this was the best role I'd ever seen him in as well. I also thought that the woman who played the annoying teacher, Ms. Farmer, was really good. She made you hate her so much and she was really good in her role. She really became her character.Weird, bizzare, and confusing might describe this movie for some, but for me it was beautiful, interesting, funny and really well written and directed. The construction of the movie was intricate and unusually put together nicely for such a confusing structure of a story. Again, I enjoyed this movie a great deal, and hope to hear anyone else's thoughts on the piece. A definite 10 out of 10.And that's the end of my review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this film for the first time this weekend, only because I ran into a 1 dollar copy in a big flee-market here, where someone sold a gigantic VHS-collection. I remembered the title from newspaper mentioning. Being not that frequent a moviegoer, It was a surprise for me. Positive aspects were the unfamiliarity of the director's and most of the actor's names....finally the great unknown U.S. movie?? NO I must say. I will not repeat what already 1000 other IMDb-fans have said...,anything is possible. My conclusion: a few more viewings will make some things clear, at this moment I do not understand anything of it, and at first viewing it was too much of one of those (to me) irritating school kids story lines, with all the sex jokes, vulgarities, etc. However, I loved some great scenes at the parental/family dinner table, like ridiculous fourletter words, and , you know what I mean....Finally, I prefer to give my words to La Femme Defendue, a french film with only 3 reviews....see you there!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read many reviews by IMDB users on this movie and thought I was getting a deal by buying the DVD for $9.95 at Target... boy was I wrong!!! Obviously, this movie has garnered many "10" votes from kids that are still in high school and don't know any better. Thus, this is why this mediocre, at best movie has cracked the top 100. Believe me, this film has absolutely no place there. I don't fancy myself an arthouse, independent film type... but if it looks like crap, smells like crap... maybe it is. In this case, it's ok, but not nearly as good as is rated. If you are in high school and trying to find yourself, go see it... if you are fully grown up, save yourself the 1.5 hours to see the "twisted" ending and instead go get your hair cut as your time will be better spent. The film is highly overrated and makes me angry for having spent the $10 for it. Anyway, I'd have thought it brilliant in my high school years, now that I know better....HONKY PLEASE!!!</fullReview>

This is where we are introduced to Frank, the giant bunny rabbit, is he for real or a product of Donnie's dark imagination? Does he commit these acts of crime to satisfy his own loathing of society and conventinality or because he has seen the future and must obey Frank? These are questions that drive the film, with an undercurrent in romance, science fiction, and clever story lines, not to mention great performances from all lead actors. Donnie Darko is a special piece of film, watch it and understand it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What people call a love or hate film, pinning down what rubbed me the wrong way about this film is difficult. Friends expected me to enjoy this but I found it self indulgent and grating despite the curious initial x-files-like turn of events. What I would like to know is why the world is ending or if an explanation for it was given in the film? I feel it is a device just to wow the audience or just to add unnecessary weight to the protagonist's heroic gesture to end his own existence. I hate this selfish vein in film where the hero's story exceeds the logical constraints or plot integrity of the world the film has created eg. The Matrix - Neo/Trinity magic kiss or how phones allow entry/exit to matrix world despite being a construction of the matrix (a historical construction of the machines themselves who never chose a pre alexander bell time period?). I fear it's a trend reflecting our growing selfishness or self-interestedness (if thats a word) along with an obsession with hard to swallow twists that on reflection involve a chain of events that would require the forsight of a god to engineer eg. Collateral damage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have tried to watch Donnie Darko four times. Each time I find the characters stereo-typical and the performances (except For Mary McDonell's) abominable. Since this movie is supposed to be telling a story, and a story is only intersting if one finds the characters interesting, this movie is boring.Other people may like it (and find it interesting), but I dont. (And apparently, a great many others don't either by the look of the negative comments here.)As has been said before, there are negative comments for every movie (Wizard of Oz, 2001: A Space Odyssey, etc). Just shows that people have different tastes.I like science fiction, and horror, and cross-genre movies. I like movies that catalyze thought. I don't think Donnie Darko does that. Sure, lots of young people like Jake G. (especially--at least on this site--young females. I don't. I think his performances (Bubble Boy, The Good Girl, and Donnie Darko) are all the same, and don't demonstrate (to me, at least) any "great" acting skills.Some may find the story "thought-provoking." I don't. (As an aside here, I COULD make a list here of movies I do find thought-provoking, as I have seen fans of this movie demand of others who have said things similar to what I have said, but I dont feel the necessity to; I am commenting about THIS movie, not others.) I feel Donnie Darko's story tries too hard to be thought-provoking, and thus brings about its own failure.The thing I find most unappealing about this movie actually concerns its fans: It seems that they are outraged (for some reason) by anyone who posts negative comments. These fans (for some reason) suddenly feel the need to make negative comments about the intelligence of people who dont like the film. I find this very saddening. I guess it really says something about themselves... </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How was such brilliance ever made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people will disagree, but i think that films like Donnie Darko are only made once every so often. Sometimes a few excellent films come all at once, or there is a slight 'drought' before another one comes.However, Donnie Darko is undoubtedly the best film i have seen (yet). Of course there are some films that are called classics which i haven't seen.But this film blends a lot of genres in a way that i hardly ever seen before. American Beauty, for example, is another excellent film. That ONLY blended comedy and drama. Donnie Darko, however, blends comedy, drama, sci-fi and fantasy, to say the least.Now, this film is not for the faint-hearted, and NOT everyone will like it.So, for the time being, i bid you farewell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantastic movie, weird and wonderful. Great lead performances and some brilliant 80's pop music in the soundtrack by the likes of Tears for Fears and Echo and the Bunnymen. Donnie Darko is one of the best films I've seen in recent years, I look forward to the Directors next film. One of the best endings to a film I've ever seen too. I spotted a couple of nods to other films too, most notably ET, so the director has good taste in films too. If you like films like The Sixth Sense, Signs and Fearless you'll love Donnie Darko. Highly recommended ***8/10***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is to melodramatic teeny-bopper movies as Something About Mary was to gross-out humor... a movie I heard a bunch of junk about, but when I finally got to see it, I sat there, and said... and?Darko's entire plot line can be basically be reduced to "My life is so pathetic and I'm so worthless that the world would be better off without me." Which might be alright if it read as genuine, but knowing the Executive Producer, I'd be more inclined to believe it was a plot line adopted to cater to the "hip young crowd" of tragic 3rd-generation-Morissey fans that can't get enough of suicidal self-pity.Is it sci-fi? What about the causality paradox... Bah. Even on the lax side, Tears for Fears? Do I really need to hear that again?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overblown Pseudo-Intellectualism + Tangled Plotting = Ominous Mixture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>?Donnie Darko' is a film that consists mainly of overblown pseudo-intellectualism under the guise of tangled plotting. The film has garnered a bit of a ?cult following' for itself ? mostly of the teenage demographic ? probably because they consider it to be a profoundly brilliant examination of a guy who's become disillusioned by the banality and ignorance of those surrounding him with an equally brilliant sci-fi context (with a doomed love story thrown in for good measure.) I suppose I can see how those who are easily impressed could see this film in that light.And ? just to clarify ? no, I don't dislike this film because I lack the intelligence to decipher the plot and/or what exactly it's trying to say. I will even acknowledge that the plot ? up to a certain point ? is actually quite interesting. Donnie ? our protagonist ? is saved from getting crushed by a jet engine when a demonic life-sized rabbit guides him out of bed. We come to realize that this rabbit is from a possible future (or an ?alternate reality') that Donnie must eventually alter by travelling back in time and ? ultimately ? saving his mother, little sister, girlfriend, and a few other characters from death. But my biggest problem with the film is Kelly's painfully amateurish (or perhaps unintentional?) effort to mix satire into the film as well. It would've been a good idea to at least embed all of his characters with a believable degree of authenticity, but some just aren't. For instance, the school/dance teacher is so overblown with her ridiculous aversion toward Graham Greene and her idiotic ?fear/love' teaching lessons that she seems like nothing more than a poorly written caricature. Kelly also doesn't stray away from the cliché ? an elderly person is once again presented as a pinnacle of esoteric knowledge and truth.What did I like about ?Donnie Darko'? I liked Kelly's choice to set it within the interesting milieu of the 1980s ? this is certainly a refreshing change from the dull modernism of most new films that look like ?Donnie Darko.' This provides a great backdrop for Kelly to display his eye for detail, within both dialogue and appearance. The tragic circumstances surrounding the relationship between Donnie and Gretchen are also done quite originally. Director Richard Kelly's way of presenting events in an ill-defined way ? expecting us to interpret our own grand meaning to these curiosities ? isn't a good cinematic technique; it's just far too easy to simply switch your character around through time and space with pretty visuals upon the idea of time travel, expecting it to all seem appropriate in the end. Kelly tries so hard to make his film contemplative that it demands its viewers to ask far too many questions whilst it provides too few concrete answers ? all theories inevitably remain objectionable. Clever ambiguousness is one thing and awkward ambiguousness is another. Unfortunately, ?Donnie Darko' falls under the latter category.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw Donnie Darko, I was unsure of what I should have "gotten" out of the film. That uncertainty prompted me to watch the movie three moretimes, in order to understand it better. In a world where so many movies take the viewer by the hand and coerce them into an uninspired emotional payoff, it was quite refreshing to finish watching Donnie Darko and have no ideawhatsoever about how I should feel.The story combines so many good elements, you can't help but find somethingentertaining about it. There are the simple pleasures of 80s nostalgia, Kevin Smith-ish discussion about the Smurfs, and some really well-delivered comicmoments. Then you have the darker, more thought provoking stuff about timetravel, alternate realities and destiny. I might go so far as to say, this movie has everything.The film's end is one that reminds me of high school, when my English classwould debate the intended meanings of various symbols in literature. I'm not sure what the writer intended, but Donnie Darko can definitely be interpreted in multiple ways. As a matter of fact, I'm interpreting it in multiple ways at this very moment.Whoa.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have so many friends who are utterly OBSESSED with this movie, I decided finally to watch it. And, while I think it is definitely worth seeing, and didn't lose my interest until near the end, I think ultimately it's a bunch of hooey. I think people who love it are saying "Woah, it's so DEEP," without understanding what is happening in it. I'm also not sure that what's happening in it makes a great deal of sense. Luckily Jake Gyllenthahtehalaal is so adorable no one will mind.None of the performances were that great. Drew B seemed to be in "I'm a serious teacher--really!" mode the entire time. I think Jake overdid his smirking and evil grin a bit. The whole thing has an air if indie self importance, and I'm just not convinced it's nearly as important as it thinks it is. It could also be 20 minutes shorter.Nevertheless, it won't leave you feeling THAT cheated, and I say again it's worth seeing. I would describe it as "Igby Goes Down" meets "The Mothman Prophecies." In fact, the similarities between the mythology here and the hallucinations (and their purpose) in Mothman Prophecies would be an interesting topic. "Donnie Darko Meets the Mothman!"

		<fullReview>Finally it was nice to see a movie that was welcomed by most of the viewers and had a definitive thought process. Things like this usually stay within the realm of independent movies and fortunately it got the credit it deserved. The plot wasn't really exhausted except for the portrayed verisimilitude of teen life, which they did a good job fulfilling. Everyone fit their characters, and casting Jake Gyllenhaal and Jena Malone gratified the hope of good teenage acting (which has really seemed to diminish over the last decade.) To tear apart a movie on the basis of minor plot complications demonstrates idleness. If you're going to watch this movie, do so with a brain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Easily one of the best movies of 2001, Donnie Darko can not be defined by any one genre of film. It's a dark comedy to keep the audience smiling, a drama to keep the audience emotionally connected to the characters, and a movie that will just plain out make you think. Donnie Darko tackles a variety of subjects. It deals with underlying family tones, the possibility of time travel, an in depth look at psychosis, and, oh yeah, in its spare time it manages to tackle the question of the existence of God. This is probably the best movie I have ever seen and recommend it to anyone who has ever found themselves questioning the existence of God. Watch for the metaphor of Donnie as Jesus. The metaphor is so intricately woven that I found myself clapping and yelling at my TV at points during the movie. A movie not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caution: Spoilers ahead!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main problem with Donnie Darko, is that the basic plot structure has by now become trite. I can list a number of movies, starting from the most recent, that use this particular `surprise ending.' There's Shamalayan's `Sixth Sense' and Polanski's `A Pure Formality,' as well as the relatively unknown `Final Approach,' and no doubt a host of others where the whole movie takes place because its protagonist is really already dead. (The grandaddy of this genre may well be the award-winning sixties short film, "Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge.")The use of this tired plot device is a fault in itself; but there is a big plot hole as well. It seems the anomalous falling jet engine that misses/kills our hero was supposed to be from the future, from a plane his mother and sister are on. Yet in the wrap-up, the whole family turns out to be in the house, and not on the plane after all.There is an attempt to evade this plot hole but positing that, by some goofy, sci-fi, time-travel sleight-of-hand, we are dealing, not with a post-death experience, but with an alternate universe in which Donnie has: A) survived in order to prevent the alt.real. from occurring; or B) has caused it by not dying. In any case, the fix is to go back in time and die and make it all better. This may sound original, but it is really just `It's A Wonderful Life' stood on its head. Other well-chewed bits include the reliance on the old horror motif of `the kids at a Halloween party', which becomes and excuse to create rather easy images and metaphors of confused-identity. Worst of all, the film has a miscellaneous sort of sound track which often obscures the dialogue. Having said all that negative stuff, let me add that the film (without the trick this-explains-it-all ending) is not a chore to watch, though the pacing is uneven. Better still, along the way there is some very nice film making: fine acting (I loved Donnie's mom); some good shooting (though nothing as wonderful as the Lynch-like opening shot); and quite a bit of witty political and social satire, as well as some relatively sensitive philosophical musing and characters you care about. Plus, there is plenty of tongue-in-cheek references to other films--not the least of which, is of course, the nod to `Harvey,' the only other film I know of with a giant invisible rabbit driving the plot.I hope Director Richard Kelly gets another shot at making a film, because he's got style. But I fear that we can get a good idea of where Kelly might actually be going if we look at his contemporary, M. Shamalayan. I'm not sure that a good eye, a bit of wit, a warm heart, and a surprise ending are enough to build a career on. `Sixth Sense' was both moving and kind of cool. But `Unbreakable' was a limper attempt at a similar sort of thing, and `Signs' was a flat-out embarrassing serving of less of more-of-the-same. I hope Shamalayan has discovered that long, tense, moody shots, full of spooky ambiguity can do a lot in the hands of someone like David Lynch. But a director had better have the artistic and intellectual cojones to back it up, or he's going to look silly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice try at a deep movie, but boring at its roots.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I had heard great things about this movie from a few friends and some buzz on forums, I decided to dedicate a night in front of the TV with a good friend to watch this movie and expected a movie in the likes of Memento/Fight Club, to where you were kept on your heels until the end. What I ended up with, however, was a dull, drawn out movie that failed to spark my interest, and when the confusing plot twists started coming in, my disinterest kept me at bay.First off, I don't want to have to go online and read a website or watch a commentary to figure out what a movie is about. After watching Donnie Darko, I was not only left disappointed, but confused yet not very much interested in thinking it all out in my mind. With this suspense/thriller genre, the number one thing you need is an interesting plot to back up your "good" plot twists to keep the audience in the movie and thinking every step through. Memento achieved this easily, and kept me interested until the end, Donnie Darko did not.Secondly, the plot twist in this movie was so overwhelmingly confusing and introduced so late into the movie that immediately at the end of the film I felt a huge wave of disgust. "What just happened? Who cares I didn't have enough time to figure it out during the movie." Basically if you want to have a satisfying ending, introduce these factors a bit earlier so the viewer has some time to let it settle in. Memento and Fight Club had some sort of conclusion at the end, with a 5-10 minute ending that left you satisfied knowing what had gone on. Donnie Darko's 11th-hour plot twist, with its complex interpretations of time and space, did not really follow this format and did not leave me very satisfied.With these two major faults, however, I would still like to commend Donnie Darko for its very in-depth view of the world and the laws of nature. Trying to let the viewer grasp at this type of information is very tough, however possible.I would do this movie great injustice by comparing it to another movie that I had a similar, but much worse, experience watching. "Soul Survivors" was a movie in which the viewer is trying to piece together a puzzle of what was happening in the movie. The fatal flaw with this movie, however, was that the presentation was very subpar and also by the end of this movie the "shocking twist" didn't really register much in my mind. Anyways this movie's been getting very good reviews around here, so you be the judge. For me I give it a 5/10 just for the whole time and space integration and the complexity of it all, and it could have easily been a 9/10 if it had sparked any interest in my mind...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See "Jacob's Ladder"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT I've checked around about this movie and apparently people are really confused as to what it means. It didn't really hit me until my fiance rented "Jacob's Ladder" for the umpteenth time. I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone who hasn't seen "Donnie Darko" but the film isn't really about time travel per se; it's about "what if" a person lived thirty days after his death. Given the time period in which the film is set (the social wasteland known as suburban VA in 1988 -- I was in middle school in suburban VA at the time), Donnie's life beyond the date of his death wouldn't have been a picnic. While "Jacob's Ladder" deals with the idea of letting go of the people and things a person loved on earth in order to find peace in death, "Donnie Darko" offers a much darker message -- that a sudden death for Donnie was far kinder than if he had actually continued to live in the world he knew. Girls whose mothers violently murdered their fathers, sleazy motivational speakers who were supposed to be role models for young people, Duran Duran, psychiatrists and bull****. Donnie was better off not living. Because of his inability to conform to the society he was born into, he would have ultimately destroyed everything he loved (or could have loved) on this earth. His sudden death was his was of making peace with everything he loved on earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"This makes David Lynch (of whom I'm a big fan) look out-dated and flat. This is a brilliant little film. Confusing, intriguing and inventive, it eventually folds back upon itself, and makes you leave the cinema in a daze. A great movie, that you'll have fun figuring out, both while you're watching it and for days after!! So many possible theories exist for this movie, I won't include one here... Suffice it to say, go see it yourself. Its one of those movies that is more enjoyable the more you watch it, rather than less."The above is the original review I wrote about DONNIE DARKO. But I just want to say and write so much MORE about it. This movie has become a huge part of my life lately. After buying it on DVD, I watched it several times more, with and without the two commentaries - and became engrossed in the deleted/extended scenes and other extra features.There is so much to say about this movie - I could fill a book. Suffice it to say, well that there is too much to say and no one review is justifiable for this movie.Is it a science-fiction movie? A teen-angst drama? A social commentary focussing on 1980's suburbia? All of the above? And more? The last two -yes. And it has passion perfectly balanced with pain, and emotional depth layered within its complex and intoxicating structure of suspense.Unlike other so-called "weird" films, this is not intentionally weird. It just is ... well, its own movie.Watch this movie. Maybe you'll hate it. Maybe you'll be nonplussed. Maybe like myself (and my friend Kevin - hi Kevin if you're reading this!) you'll become addicted to it. One thing is certain: it's one of the most original movies I've seen in a long time.Don't just read reviews of this movie - see it for yourself. And that is all. Thank you for reading.</fullReview>

Donnie Darko, was amazing. Every aspect of it , i foundalmost perfect. I dont think i am yet to see a perfect film: even thevery best films can have an ingrediant or two missing from whatcould be classed as a personally perfect film. But boy does thisfilm come so close. The story line is rather complicated but at thesame time it can also be seen as quite simple: a teenager, atemotional war with the world around him realises that to save itfrom its oncoming desruction, and to save everyone around him,he must let himself die. Of course, this pleasant thoughmelancholic story is told by quite a bizarre plot, which makesthings seem a little more complex. But in the end, things are not.Donnie Darko tells a beautiful, if sad, fairy-tale like story and it tellsit with brilliance. Brilliant characters; brilliant pace; brilliantdirection and an absolutely amazing score ( which is laden withsome great 80s tunes) I loved this film.

		<fullReview>The problem with all these comments is just basic difference of opinion but there are some things that need clearing up. The Philosophy of Time Travel as written by "Roberta Sparrow" doesn't exist and no such titled book does according to Amazon. Some people have said "I don't want to have to read this book" to understand the ending, I thinks its pretty clear from the film that its not real. All other critiques of this film come down to personal opinion. I personally loved the number of characters the story focused on, the way it was shot etc. I wish people wouldn't criticise it if they didn't understand the ending there is no "intellectual bias" in this film the clues to the ending are dotted throughout and even summarised in voice over at the end. I saw this film two days after seeing Die Another Day and maybe thats why everything this film does right was highlighted. Its imaginative, satirical, well written and never drags. After seeing Bond it seemed like everything every film should be. Special.</fullReview>

The first few minutes of the film, you think this is going to be some corny teenage angst film or maybe some moral family drama. Yet you see very quickly this is far from a healthy normal family. The film continues like this and keeps us guessing, we are never really sure if his visions are real or in fact just figments of his imagination.&lt;Spoilers&gt;Obviously the story is really about the discussions that took place between the science teacher and Donnie. If you were able to see your destiny right in front of you could you change it. What would happen if you did as regardless of the change this would still be your destiny. Anyway as we find out Donnie gets pieces of future events through visits from someone in a large rabbit costume and strangely he is influenced by these visions to perform various actions, which presumably take him to his eventually destiny. At the end of the film he realises this and decides that given the chance again, he would not allow the events to take place as they had and so allows his own death to take place.Well that's my take on it. There's still some unanswered questions; the engine from the plane still comes from the future. The first scene of the film hints that maybe this has happened before and this is the second time around the loop. Also why was it the dead boy who coaxed him out of the house if indeed his destiny was to die in the accident or maybe it wasn't.&lt;Spoilers&gt;Anyway I dislike most Hollywood films, as they are so predictable, join-the-dots film making. This is very original and every time you think you've put it in the box , it breaks out of it. Wonderful realism in the school scene's, no silly over-acting, realistic reactions from pupils and teachers.For me a genuinely original and interesting film that showed me as an old bitter, generally disappointed film watcher, that even I can get caught up in the magic once in a while.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm really surprised by the positive commentary viewers have given this, and I think that's attributable to how open to personal interpretation it is. Viewers as of late enjoy films that ask something from the audience, giving the relationship between art and spectator a false two way relationship.This is just poor filmmaking. The number of loose plot lines in this movie had me wondering when it would finally decide on a route to take and go with it. Instead, it meandered. The acting was poor. Characters that seemed to hold relevence really didn't. They were functions to drive other main characters or instigate certain situations. Grandma Death is one of the biggest examples of this.I have one word for this film. Arbitrary. Because that's what most of this felt like. You had things happening for no reason. You wait patiently for certain things to come together -- some do, some don't. It's poor storytelling. Dissapointing. 4/10. If you're serious about story, look elsewhere. This is largely aesthetic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a fun Sci-Fi movie about a emotionally disturbed kid (Jake Gyllenhaal)who sees a 6-foot tall Rabbit. In his own unique way, rookie film writer/director Richard Kelly has included a dark story line, comedy, philosophy, science fiction, special effects, and a great ending that ties the whole picture together. From the second I began to watch this movie, I was hooked. I rate it a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I simply don't know where to start here. Having just got home from the cinema after viewing one of the best movies I've had the pleasure of witnessing I find myself in a state of awe.This is superb.The story is focused on a young man called Donnie Darko, who finds himself plagued by visions which suggest the end of the world is nigh. I will say no more than that, as to do so would ruin the story, just suffice to say the direction, acting, narrative, and overall structure is just so fresh, clean and brilliant it could only come from someone with an outstandingly creative mind and a flair for doing the right thing, at the right time. The structure of the story is brilliant, and the theme, very psychologically approached.If this is a debut from the director, Richard Kelly II, I can't wait to see his next project. Let's just hope he gets better, rather than bordering, like Shyalaman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that made me wish Spielberg would go back to the suburbs . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The suburbs were the setting for three of Steven Spielberg's most popular achievements - "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," "E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial" and "Poltergeist" - and I don't think it's exactly coincidence. As a storyteller, Spielberg drew strength and imagination from his suburban setting, and he was a wry and fair chronicler of it. He knew these people and their environs; he could perceive the inherent limitations, but he also believed in the fundamental decency of most of its denizens, and also recognized what a powerful base of operations the suburban hearthside could be (even one that was, as in "E.T." somewhat less than perfect). How different from every other single movie maker who delves into suburbia. From "American Beauty" to "Edward Scissorhands" , from David Lynch's twisted tales of paranoia to the gothic surrealism of "Donnie Darko", the suburbs are continually a place of danger and trash - a place where the soul is crushed and life is perpetually dark and soulless (underneath of course the placid and reassuring surface). It's time, I think, to send a little letter to Hollywood: "Enough with this stuff already!" Either find a new take on the subject, or at least lighten up and let some joy into the proceedings. The suburbs don't *all* suck, after all.At first, this film looked like it might be going in that benevolent direction. It did a nice job painting a fairly normal suburban family and environment without pencilling in either too much plasticity (Mary McDonnell's mother veers in that direction, but her portrayal keeps pulling back from matriarchal harpy into a more rounded, human performance) or moodiness. But this idyll breaks down rather quickly, and we're once again into the Suburbs As Hell (teenage angst sub-genre). And you know what? Once you've been down that road a couple dozen times, there's really not too much more to say (or see).So Richard Kelly, the writer and director, attempts to sustain our interest with a plot that, like "the Sixth Sense", infuses creepiness and notions of horror and/or insanity before resolving all with a "surprise" ending that - supposedly - sheds new light upon all that has gone before (and is meant the make the audience say, "Aw - coooooooool, man!"). As you can no doubt tell, I don't think much of the device, or of the movie, and here's why:It makes no sense! String it all together, work it out backwards and forwards, and the film still has too many loose ends, too many things that just do not cohere. One could possibly make a plea for relativism, or ambiguity, but even allowing for that the film really doesn't hold together. For example, much is made of the firing of the English teacher played by Drew Barrymore; in the principal's office when it happens, she breaks down and bemoans anyone ever "reaching" the kids. But from what we've seen of her in class, she clearly maligns her students and acts like a supreme bitch, so why should we care. If she was onscreen for more than five minutes it might make sense; instead, it's just bad writing. Yet another of Donnie's teachers is held up as the shrewish, self-righteous type who sees things in utter black and white terms; we're not meant to like her, and we don't - but to what ultimate effect? A motivational speaker in the film is eventually revealed as someone with a dark secret, but that too is passed over and not really dealt with in any but the most cosmetic way. Amidst all this, Donnie Darko seems to be going quietly insane.All of this might have some sort of point, in a better movie. If I had to guess, that point would be: the school Administration dispenses soul-crushing pablum, like so much mental novocaine. Is this what's eating Donnie throughout the movie? It's hard to say, since the filmmaker decides he doesn't want to deal with any of it head-on, but rather plays around on an arty concept of the world being refracted into all sorts of weird shapes through Donnie's peculiar "condition" (the exact nature of which is not revealed until the end - if there, even!). Problem is, as he plays around with the "freakiness" of what Donnie is going through, he loses sight of how to portray good old fashioned reality (exaggerations and caricatures abound), leaving the audience adrift on a sea of madness on the one hand, and cartoonishness on the other. Not a pleasant dichotomy.Once the movie finally reveals its hand, a new spin is put on things, of course. But, reflecting upon everything which went before in the wake of the final twist, I could see no reason for the tone the director took, nor could I truly see any kind of resolution. My fear is that the director *thinks* he's made sense of things at the eleventh hour . . . but in point of fact, he's cleared up nothing. It's possible to muse that the film is wanting to be some kind of Generation Y version of "It's A Wonderful Life," but nothing of any import really happens or is revealed, so even that association is bogus.So many ideas in this movie. So many ideas that were almost good. There isn't a good movie inside this mess, trying to get out, but there could have been. Stylistically, at least, it was very intriguing and well handled - Kelly is a natural director, with an imaginative eye for *shooting* and *displaying* the suburban landscape (almost as good as Spielberg). But the guy clearly needs to hire a writer next time. And if he's trying to make science fiction (which is what this film seems to be leaning toward), a science fiction writer wouldn't hurt.Which reminds me: hey, Steven, you still available?! Come on back from your 21st century musings - the suburbs could really use you again!</fullReview>

This was a rather small budget movie by Hollywood standards, yet it has a look that would suggest a large budget. Simply put this is a rock solid movie which transcends genres and will provoke the viewer to use their brain and ponder it's multiple meanings. This surely will go down as one of my favorite movies of all time, I've now watched it at least 6 times and i still look forward to viewing it again.

		<fullReview>What would happen if M. Night Shyamalan had let sam Ramai direct The Sixth Sense? You would probably get something like Donnie Darko. This film is so psycholigically complex I don't even know where to begin. The film is simply brilliant in that it has so many different issues weaven together to create on huge ball of irony, that one finds blinking may take your eyes off the screen for much to long. From the very beginning you get the feeling that this film has more to it than meets the eye. At first glance one may write it off as a modern day attempt at Poltergiest. After veiwing the trailer you may even want to consider it a brainless slasher movie but nothing could be further from the truth. What we have here is the tale of a teenager who's name is Donnie Darko. But Donnie isn't your average teen, see he finds himself drawn at night to a myseterious force named Frank. Frank is a bunny who teels Donnie that in 28 days , on Halloween, the world will end. We also have Donnie's girlfreidn who had to move away because her step-father stabbed her mom in the chest four times and seems to be living a life of torment and personal angst all fueled by fear. Fear is a hard topic in the movie, infact I would say that that one world "fear" us the basis for everything to come. We also have Jim Cunningham, a motivational speaker that teaches that fear and love are the two strongest emotions that a human has and learn to live your life in the love spectrum of life and avoid the fear. Then we have Grandma Death, an old lady who may just be the most important piece of this huge puzzel. She stands in the middle of the road all day, occasionlly walking to her mailbox to always be greeted by nothing inside. One day after Donnie's father almost runs her over she wispers in his ear "Everyone dies alone." Donnie later finds out that in the past she was a teacher and wrote a book on time travel (but to understand that without giving away the plot you must see the film). This comment comes up at Donnie's therepy and along with stories of Frank the bunny his shrink believes that Donnie is afraid to connect with reality due to a great fear of what may come from it. It pains me to say this but the climax of the matches, if not surpasses that of The Sixth Sense as everything finally starts to make sense. This will not only leave you wide-eyed, it will probably take your breathe away as well. The acting is all top notch including as cast of Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swazey and the gripping Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie in his most mature role yet. The love/fear topic is present throughout the entire film and you can look for hidden signs of this scattered all over the film. One example of this is the billing of Evil Dead and The Last Temptation of Christ as a double feature at the theater. The film is horrifying and edgy without becoming cliched or unoriginal, making it not on;t the best, if you will, horror movie I've seen since The Sixth Sense, it is hands down the best movie of the year so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE FILM'S STORY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say first, the earlier film, Jacob's Ladder, is a better predecessor to the story line of Donnie Darko. Donnie isn't original (as if anything is).I just saw the film Donnie Darko. It's about the unusual chain of events that happen after an airplane's engine crashes into a suburban house.******************************************** QUESTION 1: WHAT THE HELL WAS THIS FILM TRYING TO SAY? ********************************************Well, I think the film was trying to say one of two things that are closely related. One is that things happen for a reason. And two, we think we'd like a lot of things that happen in life to have happened differently than they did. But if we were to actually see what would happen IF WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN really would happen right before our eyes, we might NOT like the other alternatives at all.Personally, this film reminded me that I am not all knowing. And I shouldn't pretend that I am in the subtle ways I do. And that I should stop complaining about the hand I'm dealt so much, be grateful for what I do have, and trust in my God more.******************************************** QUESTION 2: WAS WHAT HAPPENED TO DONNIE, AFTER THE ENGINE MISSED HIM, REALLY HAPPEN? ********************************************I think this is the million-dollar question, right? One idea is that all of the post-engine-crash events were a "dream sequence" so to speak, and that they never really happened. The other idea is that all the post-engine-crash events DID happen, and Donnie went "back in time" and changed the events that happened when the engine did not kill him.==========================================&gt; ANSWER 1: (1) The Engine Really Killed Donnie And "Engine-Missed-Donnie" Events Never Happened In Real Life. ==========================================&gt; ~ This explanation follows the same story explanations I give to the similar films "Jacob's Ladder" and "Vanilla Sky".Basically it goes like this: The airplane engine hit Donnie and he died in the REAL WORLD (everyone's reality but Donnie's). But Donnie's spirit/soul was so confused and disturbed by this "unreasonable" and seemingly pointless event, of him being crushed by a falling airplane engine, that Donnie had to come to a realization and understanding of why this happened. Only then could Donnie accept his death and move on.The evidence of this explanation is that he mentioned to the psychiatrist that he needed to know "why something happened" and he needed to find out "God's will" about something. This obviously indicates that Donnie is searching for the reason this event happened, and perhaps also to find out what to do about it.Another good reason to go with this explanation is that the things that happen during Donnie's post-engine-crash life are rather "surreal" in nature rather than real. Donnie sees the liquid tubes coming from people's bodies. Frank appears and disappears. These are rather "unreal" events. And are big clues that this is not reality, but rather a "dream sequence".Other little things, that COULD really happen, but are just not that likely is: Donnie slams an ax into the head of a brass statue; two "bad dudes" are at the old lady time travel authors house with knives drawn (why?); the old "crazy lady", that walks across roads oblivious to the world, is really a nun that decides to become a science professor, who writes a book on time travel, that only Donnie's science teacher has a copy of; and that there's this motivational speaker who holds high school student pep rallies is really a child pornography ring leader. All of these things, and many more, are just a bit surreal and unlikely.Lastly, this is not a SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY film. Donnie does not build a physical time machine device to go back into time. Instead, Donnie drives his car over to this surging black cloud, moving in the sky, that is really a time travel porthole that sends him back in time. Kind of surreal, isn't it? Any time travel, if it really occurs, is obviously somewhere between psychological to metaphysical, and not overtly physical time travel.------------------------------------------------- PROBLEMS WITH "dream sequence" ANSWER (1): ------------------------------------------------- (A) If Donnie really gets killed by a falling airplane engine, like the end of the film shows, how did Donnie know it was an airplane engine that crushes him? Did he just happen to look up and see it was an airplane engine?(B) If Donnie was really killed by the airplane engine, and he never met the new girl in town (who becomes Donnie's girlfriend in the "dream sequence"), why at the end of the film does it show that this girl "seemed to know" Donnie, a guy she supposedly never had met?==========================================&gt; Answer 2: (2) Donnie Did, In a Physical Reality, Go Back In Time. ==========================================&gt; ~ This explanation is that the film should be taken at face value. That Frank (the bunny suited guy who was shot in the eye) really came to Donnie in spirit form, and really got Donnie out of Donnie's house, and saved Donnie's life. And that every thing that happens after that is "real life".And then Donnie sees that because Frank saves his life, Donnie's girlfriend gets run over by the real, physical body Frank, and Donnie shoot's Frank in the eye and kills him. Then Donnie decides that change of events sucks, and then Donnie chases down a "time travel" black cloud porthole, and goes back in time, stays in his room, and gets crushed to death by the falling airplane engine.------------------------------------------------- PROBLEMS WITH "dream sequence" ANSWER (2): -------------------------------------------------~ FRANK "spirit being" in the bunny suit totally screws the "events really happened in reality" answer.(A) One, how could there be a real spirit being Frank if the real Frank is supposedly really walking around during this whole "engine missed Donnie" chain of events? Can there be two Frank spirits existing at the same time in the same reality?(B) Two, Frank has NO MOTIVATION to save Donnie's life from the falling airplane engine. Look at it from Frank's perspective: Frank thinks, "If I save Donnie's life from the falling airplane engine, a guy I have never met, I get to run over Donnie's girlfriend and get shot in the eye and die." I don't think so. There is no motivation for Frank to save Donnie's life. Thus, it never happened.What do you think all? What do you think Zo?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Frank</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I liked best about this film was the way it was so lovingly directed. The camera pans over settings, landscapes, and characters languorously, as if trying to savor every aspect of this tale of a paranoid schizophrenic teenager who may see into other dimensions.Jake Gyllenhaal (as Donnie Darko) deserves to be lingered over. His performance summons memories of what it was like to be in high school and surrounded by real teenagers, not the fakey teens usually on display in Hollywood movies, even well-intentioned ones. Gyllenhaal's performance is a perfect melange of rage, vulnerability, fear and wonderment, tempered by psychosis. I don't know of many actors who could have pulled this role off as well, creating a character who is definitely mentally ill, yet is also someone the audience might want as a friend.Drew Barrymore and Noah Wyle both give impressive performances. Both are entirely believeable as high-school teachers, a great feat considering that it's hard to get the image of Wyle in a white lab coat (from ER), or Barrymore with bleached-blonde hair lisping babytalk in a "girl road movie", out of one's mind when seeing them these days. Barrymore, especially, takes her energy level down several notches from her norm, portraying a woman without much overt "personality", but with lots going on under the surface. She's still lisping, but now it's merely a speech impediment rather than an attempt at cuteness. Wyle also portrays a rather meek man who issues lots of shy grins, a person of limited heroics who indulges Donnie Darko's interest in time travel as far as he can without putting himself out.One of the best scenes in the film is a brief one where Barrymore and Wyle's characters sit quietly together. Barrymore just says, "Donnie Darko." After a pause, Wyle laughs. No more is said, and the film goes on to something else. But for that moment, we see through their characters' eyes as much as we see through Donnie Darko's for the rest of the film.</fullReview>

But the actions to which Donnie is forced have a somewhat humorous tint to it and allthough it is in no way a comedy, I was entertained by the colourful script writing: Donnie interacting with his teachers, his shrink, friends..And since the rabbit is warning Donnie of impending doom, the closer you get to the end of the movie, the more curious you get what that will be, a nice build up!Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect as a disturbed broody young teenager, the way he looks down and tilts his head up, then shows an evil grin, scarier then the bunny for sure!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having heard absolutely nothing about this one, I risked a rental and came away very impressed,indeed, by Mr. Kelly's debut film. He has learned his lessons well: every technical trick that CAN be employed IS employed- to great effect. (It's a testament to the storytelling skill of this neophyte filmmaker that the very impressive visual fx never once detract from the story.) The ending, too, comes almost unexpectedly from left field (and is the very first time I've ever been COMFORTABLE with this type of ending). Casting Gylanhaal was a stroke of pure genius: this young man can ACT! No doubt about it: this is one of the most impressive debut films I've ever seen in my life. The only thing I can't figure out is why this one wasn't hailed the way the vastly overrated VANILLA SKY was; this is clearly a far superior film.

		<shortDescription>Donnie Dorko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie's aspect of being dark and deep is all pretense; the plot is a convoluted and non-sequitur growth, but without any compelling central matrix for the ideas to root. Noah, Barrymore and Swayze have thankfully minor roles, the first two give especially poor B movie performances.But it is Jake's performance who is at the center of this mess, and his jerky, schizophrenic performance may have been intentional, but simply doesn't work, though he does have a few moments standing up for life's complexity vice the love-fear model.Yet it is the plot which brings this movie down. Unlike Memento, Sliding Doors, Groundhog's Day, or even the Prince of Darkness, which use the nuances of a time continuum slyly, Donnie Darko succeeds in knotting up the stream of time. Hawking's ideas for spatial wormholes is weakly presented, but they have no direct connection to time travel.Altogether this movie is a sloppy mix of 12 Monkeys, It's A Wonderful Life, Magnolia, Harvey, the Abyss and a pinch of ET. An eerie blend, for sure, and many may mistake the remix as originality.</fullReview>

It is unexpected, you never know what will happen, and the paradoxes of the movie are not resolved in sweet little fluffy pink clouds. Actions have consequences, which this film proves so well by it's storyline. It is mysterious and it keeps you guessing, and so far I've only seen two other movies that keeps me guessing for so long as Donnie Darko does (Fight Club and Sixth Sense).

Then there's Donnie Darko, who could see the end of the world prophesied by a menacing Harvey-like bunny, a sort of guardian devil.The film `Donnie Darko,' directed by first-timer Richard Kelly, depicts teenage disaffection in such a low-key way as to make it almost sweet, largely due to the eponymous hero as played by the sweetly low-key Jake Gyllenhaal. The precipitating crisis of a falling airplane engine seems to crystallize all the danger of the modern world that Donnie accepts ruefully and cynically. This film is funnier and more truthful than last year's excellent `Ghost World.'Although at times Kelly seems to be imitating David Lynch, this is as original a film as `American Beauty,' `Memento,' or `Mulholland Drive' and sometimes just as dense. Yet there are moments of clarity such as when he tells a gym teacher where to put her timeline or when he exposes the self-help guru (Patrick Swayze) for what he really is. Donnie is a crusader for the disaffected teens of the world. The key ingredient of the film's success is that Donnie appears to be normal except when he's bullied by a giant rabbit. Not a totally weird kid, just a slightly rebellious teen who can see the end coming. Make sure you see one of the best films of 2001 and one of the most stunning debuts of a director ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>donnie darko is one of those rare movies. a movie that makes you think and feel at the same time. most horror movies, or scary movies with fantasy themes are steeped in one ingredient intended to scare you. donnie darko doesnt. so those of you looking for a good scare, skip this.donnie darko is about a clumsy, troubled teenager, growing up in a welcoming environment, but still unable to come to terms with life. its a classic case of a coming of age movie. the darkness before the dawn. forget the philosophising though, for a while. even at a very simple script level, it is highly engaging and the audience is made to think. think like never before, there is so much happening in the movie, it operates on so many different platforms nd there are so many subtle messages that it is simply mind-boggling. this on the other hnd is the exact reason why the movie esp. towards the end is a bit tedious, u tend to lose track a bit.but anyway i immediately saw the movie again. to figure out some of the loose ends and it all fitted in brilliantly. i had a long conversation with a friend discussing the movie to understand it better. donnie darko is that kind of a movie. it demands attention, but it is all well worth it. huge kudos to debut director richard kelly for coming up with such a daring movie.a must see in my books, just a little too demanding maybe, but well worth the effort.a brilliant 9!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful, complex movie about a boy who gets depressed by the hipocrisy in everyday-life. In his loneliness he creates himself a friend, who foresees the future. While Donnie Darko tries to find out what these prophecies are all about, he learns about love, life and... time-travelling. "Donnie Darko" is a very complex movie, which not only deals with social and psychological issues, but also touches on philosophical questions. Many movies have failed in trying to deal with such "heavy" topics, but "Donnie Darko" succeeds in every one of them. Instead of creating a non-consistent patchwork, the great thing about "Donnie Darko" is, that it melts all these different plots into one homogenic movie. The story keeps you glued to the screen, guessing where it will go next. But those of you who expect a straight suspense-movie, watch out: It will take some concentration and maybe some time until all the pieces come together. But if you´ve solved the puzzle, you´ll find that "Donnie Darko" is a very rewarding movie, which you will want to see again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantasy-drama takes a long strange trip to the end of the story. Audience is left wondering what the hell is going on ? how do the surreal moments relate to the rest of the story. It all ties up and makes sense, but many people won't have the patience. They also won't like the dark tone of the lead character.The performances by lead teen actor Jake Gyllenhaal and Mary McDonnell are outstanding. They drew me in and I cared about them. The film wouldn't hold up as well as it does without them. Drew Barrymore's performance, on the other hand, is laughable and took me out of the story. There are many literary references and a cool ?80s soundtrack.I heard that it may be edited from the two hour version I saw. It could use some tightening up, though the mood will definitely be altered -- and it needs its mood. In spite of its flaws, this film has a heart at its core that stayed with me long after I left the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bizarre and beautifully perfected masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film many, many times. I love this film, and so I felt the need to finally upload a review.With Donnie Darko, Richard Kelly has created a flat-out masterpiece. It's so good in fact that even with a lifetime of directing and writing movies I doubt he'll ever be able to top it; quite a feat when you consider it was his directorial debut.Anybody who's seen the film will know that it's a bizarre mix of genres all tossed into one: Drama, teen, comedy, phycological thriller, romance, horror. Trying to define it to somebody who is yet to experience it is by no means an easy task. It is this mystifying cocktail of genre's that make the so great however. It's freakishly unique and will most likely alienate some people who prefer their cinema cliché and predictable.One of the film's many merits is it's style. The film lunges back and forth from light hearted comedy into some segments which are very dark and unsettling. It's this contrast that makes the film work so well; the dark segments give the film it's sense of danger and intrigue but these are balanced out nicely with lighter elements. Combine these with impressive cinematography and the film quickly establishes it's distinctive feel.The writing is on certainly on par with the rest of the film. It's often laugh out loud funny and always feels believable and totally un-cliché. The characters themselves are well established. Donnie is a well realised character: he's intelligent, he often speaks sense but deep down we know something is not entirely right. The rest of the cast perfectly supports the rest of the film. There's the perhaps equally unusual but brilliant Gretchen Ross. And of course the hilarious role of Jim Cunningham from Patrick Swayze.The real elephant in the room to address if of course the ending. Or rather?'"That Ending". Throughout the whole story is the backbone of doomsday prophecies given to Donnie by the entity known as 'Frank'. It isn't of course till the end that we begin to realise what Frank was referring to?.Or do we? As mentioned by many others the film is not a simple one. Upon first viewing you may think that you've understood what just happened. Of course once you have time to think on it (and/or perhaps discuss it with others) you realise that perhaps you're not quite sure. That, ladies and gentlemen is the brilliance of Donnie Darko. It's not a film that you're really supposed to figure out straight away, or perhaps even ever. The second watch you'll possibly prove yourself wrong, the third you'll pick up new clues. Even after over 10 watches I find myself picking up new clues, disregarding others, changing my theories. That is why it is such a cleverly constructed film. This brings me to also point out why the Original theatrical cut is far superior to the Director's cut. The DC removes a large proportion of the mystery and riddles surrounding the films by attempting to explain what happens, practically spoon feeding you the information. If you're a true lover of interesting and thought-provoking films do yourself a favour and watch the original.Long story short, Donnie Darko is a mini-masterpiece. A beautifully crafted thrill-ride that is totally twisted, utterly bizarre but most definitely PERFECTION</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a John Hughes and Lynch 1980's film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko released in 2001 is a mind twister of a film. While this film was not a hit at the box office upon release, it has gained a rabid cult following. If you were to take the John Hughes films of the 80&#x2032;s, mix them up with a bit of 12 Monkeys sprinkle in a touch of David Lynch, then you might craft a similar film. Donnie Darko is the sort of film that you will watch and then wonder what exactly just happened. Then sit down and re watch again. The plot involves time travel, a mysterious fat guy in red jump suit and a 6 foot tall evil-looking bunny rabbit named Frank.Donnie is in many ways a typical adolescent high school student. He attends a private school, is highly intelligent, yet gets into trouble for questioning authority figures and juvenile shenanigans. However, Donnie also has a bit of a dark side, he has been sleep walking, seeing a therapist and taking his prescribed medication sporadically. The opening scene of the film, shows Donnie asleep in the road next to his bike as morning dawns, Donnie has been sleep riding again.We soon learn that Donnie has been having visions. Specifically, a six-foot tall scary as hell looking bunny that tells Donnie things. Frank the Bunny instructs Donnie to leave his bed again and go outside, he informs Donnie that the world is going to end in 28 days 6 hours 42 minutes and 12 seconds. When Donnie awakes, it's morning again and he is on the green of a golf course. Upon returning home he is shocked to discover that his house is surrounded by police, and FBI agents, and a Jet engine has crashed through the roof of his house and into his bedroom. It appears that Frank the Bunny has saved Donnie's life by having him sleep on a golf course. Donnie starts to give much more credence to the words of Frank and his prophecies.Soon we are introduced to his school, friends, sexy English teacher (Drew Barrymore), and learn more about his family dynamics and his world in general. While a classic 80&#x2032;s soundtrack plays in the background, the frequency of Donnie's interactions with Frank and subsequent anti-social behaviors increase. However, all is not terrible in Donnie's life as he soon finds a kindred spirit and girlfriend in Gretchen (Jena Malone), the new girl at school. As the time till when the world will end draws ever closer, Donnie becomes more and more interested in a book written about the philosophy of time travel, and righting the wrongs he perceives around him. Will the world really end or is Donnie slipping further and further into some sort of schizoaffective disorder?No I am not going to give the ending of the film away, or attempt to explain my interpretation of the movie, you will have to watch it for yourself. Or wait for a later post on discussion of the film. Strong performances by both the lead Jake Gyllenhaal, and the supporting cast, including Maggie Gyllenhaal, Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze and others add to the immersive world created by the writer/director. If you went to high school in the late 1980&#x2032;s, or enjoy movies that will keep you guessing and foster lots of discussion upon conclusion, you might want to add this film to your Netflix queue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't deserve the raves. Doesn't deserve the slams.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all the hype and "must-see" 's, and the praise in IMDb, I decided to have a go at watching Donnie Darko, even though I'd skipped it in the past, because it smelled of hype.Nonetheless, it was actually a pretty decent movie. The portrayal of the age of late 80's was achieved in a manner that literally pulled the watcher back in time. Like another reviewer I double-checked the release date, after watching, thinking it was a late 80's movie.I found the rest of the film easy to digest, and fun to watch. It was full of 80s stereotypes, which were spot on. The story flowed well enough, with every piece of it explained at the right moment, and the hints to the finale left bit by bitSure, the science of the film was poor. It was not explained well enough, and it probably isn't even acceptable. However, to the bigger picture, that's just irrelevant. Donnie Darko doesn't really use science to suspend your disbelief and make you wonder "Hey... What if something weird's going on and Donnie isn't just crazy...". And no matter the science, the film maintains its eerie atmosphere and engaging plot, on its own. Genre isn't really of importance if the move was successful at what it tried to do, and I think it was.That is also why I am dumbstruck by the raves. As much as Donnie Darko doesn't deserve the slams, it also does not pretend to take itself too seriously... My rating: ***? of *****</fullReview>

Donnie Darko is a piece of clay. It is what you desire. A Rubik cube or kaleidoscope. For me it was only a surprise. A delicate plea for fundamental problems.Search of essence of childhood and solutions for problems with the measure of first ages. Declaration of love and explosion of imagination. In same case, foolish travel.Too much, too strong, more colors, smells and flies. Huge cake with strange slices. A holiday in an universe -freak and familiar. A song. Chopin in skin of Mahler. Mozart in the velvet of Komeda. Bach in the waters of Jean Michel Jarre. Must see. For imagine nuances of this thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If we've done the passing, is the rite any use to us?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's said that the most difficult word to translate from Spanish is 'duende'. In dictionaries it shows up as 'elf' or 'magic', however in actual practice the word doesn't mean the woodland spirit, but another kind of magic, the one that stirs the emotions. I'm coming really late to this teenage cult flick, I've done the passing so the rite itself is useless to me now, but the translation of the movie's duende is an interesting problem. Do we accept Donnie Darko's magic as an earnest expression of angst or do we bemoan how unsophisticated it is, perhaps the angst itself, that a young man gets to stand up and lecture the grownups? On one hand, it's the charming combination, the esoteric preamble into an apocalypse of the mind, the perverse parody of a white picket fence society, the youthful rhapsody for understanding and love. To the degree that Richard Kelly is trying to emulate the David Lynch film, I'm left at a distance, amused but not terribly interested by these easy contrasts and the stretch for eccentricity, by the perversion of the moral right or authority.What I appreciate here, like in Gummo or earlier in Godard's Breathless, is the youthful expression, that a young director gets to make a film to tell us what it means to be young, that these feelings are not addressed after the fact. As with the Harmony Korine film, I find the nihilism to be as much a fashion statement as a political expression of disenchantment, and when Richard Kelly speaks of life and death, it's coming from the pretentious point of view of adolescence. Trivial problems overblown, magnified, ruminations from the safe distance of youth. But it's exactly that distance that makes them possible, even gives them a bit of charm.But I also sense a yearning for the presence of a god, plan or meaning in the macrocosm, airheaded perhaps but genuine. I think the tolerance or affection an adult viewer can foster for a film like Donnie Darko, or Gummo indeed, boils down to whether or not we recognize that the young can ask the same questions even from a naive viewpoint, whether or not they can attempt to feel the spectrum of emotion within their limited experience of the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls Apart Towards the End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is one of those movies that when I see it for the first time, I have absolutely no idea what is going on. At the time of writing I just saw it for the first time, and by the end I had so many questions that my friend who was supposed to understand couldn't answer in a way that made sense. Which is a shame because this movie does have some great moments, such as the scenes where Donnie talks with his imaginary demonic rabbit friend, Frank. For two thirds of the movie I was interested in what was going to happen next, yet when the finale finally came, things fell apart.But first lets talk about what is good about this movie. The cinematography and sets are fantastic, the acting is good for the most part, and there are some really funny scenes, like the scenes about "Sparkle Motion".Donnie Darko is about a teenager named Donnie Darko, who apparently has psychological problems. He has an imaginary friend named Frank, who throughout the movie urges him to do bad things, like vandalizing the school, and burning down a motivational speaker's house. The plot of the movie never quite makes sense, especially towards the end. For a majority of the movie I thought that Frank was really just a part of Donnie's imagination. I thought Frank was just Donnie's innermost feelings coming out, but it turns out that Frank is Donnie's sister's boyfriend. Anyone who is an expert on this movie could explain it to me, but it is a bit too coincidental that Frank (the boyfriend Frank) wears the exact same costume as the demonic bunny, and even shows up at one point and urges Donnie to burn down a house. That makes no sense whatsoever! How can the same person be Donnie's imaginary friend AND his sister's boyfriend at the same time?! Not only that major plot hole, but the whole reasoning for why the jet engine falls into Donnie's room at the beginning also makes no sense. So apparently in this movie, when objects go faster than the speed of light they create a worm hole that somehow transports objects into the past. Confused? So am I. If I am wrong about this it is because I pieced it together form what I remember, so please excuse any incorrect information.Nevertheless, Donnie Darko is a mildly entertaining thriller. If it weren't for the disappointing ending and some scenes that probably should have been cut, Donnie Darko would have gotten a much higher rating, but as it stands, Donnie Darko is a solid movie.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going to my local, video rental shop, I thought I knew what to expect from Donnie Darko. A scary movie, that a lot of people really liked for some reason. And although the film can be scary, I was pleasantly surprised to find all my preconceived notions thrown out a window.Donnie Darko is a beautiful, dark tale. One you won't soon forget. After watching the film, you'll either be quiestioning your role in the universe or scratching your head. Although gripping and intelligent the film can be incredibly confusing, whether this was intentional or not, I'm not positive. But I hated the film at first. However after viewing it for the second time, I grasped a hint of what the plot was about, and became a huge Donnie Darko fan.What I'm saying is, you should probably watch Donnie Darko multiple times, otherwise your gonna' hate it. Just as I did the first time I watched Sorority Row. Which has now become one of my favorite slashers.Donnie Darko is so expansive, and incredible that no one will want to leave the theater, until a second look. Your best bet's to buy or rent the DVD version. That way you can fully experience the masterpiece known as Donnie Darko. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I became interested in this movie after seeing a clip on YouTube. I rented the Director's Cut DVD. I thought it was a good movie, but it didn't have the impact on me that others have said it had on them. It's a good concept, though.The movie starts with Donnie lying on a mountain road, with his bike off to one side. He wakes up as if from a good night's sleep, and bikes home. One is left to ponder right away, "What an odd thing." A while later, while sleeping in his room, Donnie hears a command by an ethereal voice to "Wake up." He wanders outside, and meets a man in a macabre bunny suit, named Frank. He is told that the world will end in 28 days. While this is going on, a jet engine falls from the sky and crashes into his bedroom. His life is spared. His sister tells him later, "They don't know where it came from."A girl named Gretchen wanders into his English class. She and Donnie hit it off. They both have tragedy in their lives (hers from a broken home), and this becomes a bond between them. They "go with" each other. She acts as a comforting and stabilizing force in his life. As their relationship grows, he becomes that for her. They are both self- aware, and share a value of honesty.A theme of the movie is that destruction can be creative. Donnie is commanded by Frank to go and destroy certain things associated with his high school. What I saw in the story is that these incidents Donnie creates cause divergence, events that would otherwise not happen. There's nothing that is absolute, or fits within the neat confines of the limited mind, though the adults, and many of his fellow students typically see things in that limited way.I got this sense as the movie progressed that maybe there was a reason the world was going to come to an end that one could see in the character of the people in Donnie's school; that there was a falseness, shallowness to it all that would collapse under its own weight. There's a sense that this mundanity is oppressive to the few who are self- aware, because they are a threat to it. They exist outside of it, and so easily penetrate it. Whereas to everyone else, the mundane is all they know, and it is their only comfort zone. Jim Cunningham, an inspirational speaker, exploits this comfort zone for his own gain. What people like about him is he doesn't upset the applecart. He validates it. He seems benign, but his influence in the school leads to a subtle corruption, which infects everything, pushing out anything of substance.The one good teacher Donnie has is his English teacher. She seems to buck the trend in the school, presenting a full and heartfelt sense of her subject, and she communicates the value of it to her students. Donnie's destiny is strongly tied to the narratives that come out of his English class. His teacher is struck by the lack of perception in the staff and students at the school, as Donnie is a lot of the time. Even though Donnie is supposed to be the crazy one, the one who is always in a confused stupor, I was often surprised by his unwillingness to go along to get along in the mediocrity, and his tenacity in speaking his mind with such clarity, to confront the people around him. It was refreshing to see.One of the things that struck me is how the movie was set in the 1980s, even though it came out in 2001. Everything was very true to the time. Of course there was 80s music throughout. The musical scenes were really enjoyable. They lent a dreamlike quality to the movie, yet the music felt relevant to what the movie was about.It's a movie one is left to interpret. It is somewhat cerebral, though not technical. You have to think about what you are seeing. It doesn't have an obvious point to it, and that may disappoint viewers. Each viewer can take away something different. As I watched it, I saw that there was something disturbed about Donnie. One could chalk this up to schizophrenia, but as the movie kept going, an aspect of time travel was becoming more obvious, and I began to wonder if Donnie wasn't hallucinating, but rather was experiencing a very real alternate reality. In this way it was like the movie "The Devil's Advocate". It had the same theme of events and destinies happening in different timelines (and making one wonder whether the main character's wife is more vividly experiencing a real alternate reality, or is just hallucinating because of schizophrenia), though while "Devil's Advocate" made these realities hinge on choice, "Darko" seems to make it hinge on fate. The ending makes you wonder again, though, was time travel even involved, or was it all something else? The movie becomes clearer if you watch it more than once.The take-away I got from it is that we each interpret our experience. We come up with our own models for it. None of the models we form to interpret our experience is necessarily more correct than any other, though depending on which we form and choose for ourselves, it has a profound impact on how we see ourselves in that experience, and how we react to it. I saw some commentary on the extras disc that provided some clarity to the intent of the movie, but I feel like I'd spoil it if I divulged that here. Just a note to those who end up feeling mystified by the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Kelly wrote an amazing story, perfectly interpreted the same and presented it in the finest way possible. Donnie Darko is a sci-fi drama with an amazing storyline. I was pretty fascinated by Jake Gyllenhaal's acting. He was perfect for the role and he played the character of Donnie very convincingly. This movie is an explicit depiction of surrealism playing with the extreme possibilities of scientific facts not to forget a fine performance by Jake Gyllenhaal and the hero he gets to be, setting things right. Jake plays the role of a kid who has been chosen to maintain the time continuum by placing an artifact ( jet engine ) back into it's actual time. The story begins on October 1,1988. The intro manifests Donnie waking up at a hill-side as he has been sleep walking and he returns home smiling that suggests he is aware of the things that have been happening.He creates an imaginary friend Frank-Bunny who however turns out to be a related character in the movie as 'The manipulated dead'. On October 2nd a jet engine crashes in his room although his sleep walking habits or here Frank-Bunny saves his life. The jet engine that had crashed in his room was actually the one from October 30th which had been time-corrupted and ends up in the past. All the events from thereon turn out to be happening in a different universe called Tangent universe. Now Donnie is supposed to set things right with the assistance of a wormhole that is supposed to take the jet engine back to where it came from i.e. 30th October. The moment that would happen the time would reset and things would go on normally as in present universe albeit that would come with a cost. The characters in the story are well depicted. Patrick Swayze plays a writer who is well demolished by Jake by his arrogant comments as his theories according to Jake were pathetic. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Jake's sister. Daveigh Chase is his little sister who is a dancing enthusiast. Drew Barrymore plays the English teacher who happens to be the only sane being according to Jake in the movie. Everyone was scared by the 'thoughtful' Darko. His quest provides him with the knowledge about wormholes, time travel, etc. which ultimately elucidates him the thing that he was supposed to do albeit well assisted by the book 'The philosophy of time travel' written by the character Roberta Sparrow or Grandma Death as Donnie used to call her. The movie is quite surreal and there are a million possible explanations as per the events suggested in the movie. I'd rather go with the one I fathomed. I watch this flick again and again as every time I do, something important that I might have probably skipped pops up and bingo! a new mystery gets unravelled. I'd recommend only the sci-fi enthusiasts to go for it coz those expecting a lot of action in the movie are sure to be disappointed. I personally liked the movie very much and would rate the movie an 8 on 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was interested in this film after viewing the trailers online. I found it beautiful, engaging, sad and thought provoking. The world of a paranoid schizophrenic teenager who appears to be having insomnia along with nighttime and daytime hallucinations, but is he? Jake Gyllenhall makes this troubled teen into a likable character as soon as he smiles and opens his mouth to speak his first line. We don't know if he's really sick or just really brilliant as he seems to be when he answers his teachers question, and questions them in marvelous fashion. I'm not sure what to make of the ending but maybe there is some heroism or self sacrifice involved, I'm not sure. I'll have to think on it some more or maybe watch the movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>some mental illness is not illness, but deeper perception</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main character sees more deeply what is going on around him, and as well has certain experiences that would in some circumstances be called hallucinations, but which in reality are spontaneous (untrained) spiritual perceptions (he is naturally clairvoyant). But the culture in which he lives has no ideas, concepts or words which allow him to make sense of what he sees. He is also surrounded by a chaos of points of view and emotional expression, because the characters with which he interacts are themselves confused as well. There is no coherence in the story of the meaning of existence among the many characters, but rather everywhere endless conflict. Thus, he feels deeply alone, yet every effort at communication fails because while we all seem to share the same language, we don't see the world the same way. This makes him angry and frustrated. He looks for some solid ground in the world, and can't find it.The world is a incoherent house of living mirrors (the others with which he lives), and ultimately he must leave it, for it has no place for either his intelligence or his spiritual sensitivity. The film is a beautiful representation of this common experience of today's adolescent, and while Donnie can't survive it (and others do), the depiction here of growing up in the modern world is a fine bit of art - a visual poem of the loss, and wonder the young experience while living in a civilization that is dying into chaos on its way to a new becoming. right in front of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very pretentious and way over-hyped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was recommended to me by a dozen people, so, going in I had high expectations. I'll admit the film was decent enough for 1 hour and 20 minutes. The plot was disjointed and meandering, with many 1-dimensional characters, but Donnie Darko himself was a likable character. Then, the last 20 or so minutes was an absolute shitstorm. It was as if the writers had thumbed through a book about time travel and decided to put it in the movie. There was nothing deep or provocative about the sci-fi plot twist; it was just dumb. It was at this point that I realized how pretentious this film was. The movie tried so hard to be deep that it ended up falling flat. The unfortunate thing about this is that, apparently, many people have mistaken the convoluted plot for something more. The film was so confusing to them that they just assumed it was deep. I originally watched the film because it was recommended to me by people in my 11th grade honors English class, people who I considered intellectuals by some definition of the word. But confusing isn't deep and something deep doesn't have to be hard to understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>likable surrealism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure what I'm supposed to come away from Donnie Darko with, I would say that this is a very clever film, or a very clueless one. ( I Think) When it begins everything that follows for the next hundred minutes has happened already. That's one way to look at it. Another way would be to see it as pure surrealism like John Carpenter's In The Mouth of Madness or David Lynch's Mullholland Dr. Such films are conundrums, but the question is whether or not you are capable of watching a movie that leaves you frustrated intentionally. If surrealism is your thing, you will probably have luck with Donnie Darko. It is a good one for a movie goer.Up until the climax, we are led to believe that this is a film about a young suburban middle- class boy (Donnie) who has schizophrenia and one night envisions a large satanic looking rabbit (the anti-Harvey) to tells him to do some pretty bad things if he wants to survive the end of the world in 28 days, something hours and something seconds. The people in this film are weird, though not as much so as Mulholland Dr. (In part because the acting here is more toned down, usually) One could argue though that there are too many characters. Some of the screen time that is dedicated to the supporting cast could have gone to Donnies story, which is more important. His conversations with Frank (the rabbit) are intriguing but they are too short and too few. The climax is one that takes Donnie Darko and turns it inside out. There is no literal resolution to the thriller side of Donnie Darko, only what the viewer chooses to make of it. Is it a great movie? no, but its partial originality and evocative direction are enough to make it worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is by far one of my favourite movies. Even after three viewings, I still can't give myself any credit for understanding it. In fact, I'm am confused by it.For me, the charm of this movie lies in it's humour, brilliantly brought to life by Gyllenhaals character - Donnie Darko. The humour is often very subtle, and relies heavily on the stereotypes we remember from high school.But there is a lot more to Donnie Darko than the humour. It is a dark story, set in a sunny suburban environment, occasionally interrupted by disturbing imagery. If I should try to categorize this movie, I'd say it is a dark satire.This movie is not for everyone - you should have a sense of dark humour to appreciate the jokes. You should also have an open mind, to prevent being put off by the bizarre and pseudo-scientific twist on time travel.As for the acting and music: Spot on.Give this flick a chance. It is essentially a satirical drama, set in a brilliantly executed high school setting. Laugh as the world ends in 28 days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully filmed yet flawed in places</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is quite top notch as regards cinematography, and it is beautifully &amp; quite eerily filmed. I was particularly awestrucked by the opening scene of Donny lying down in the middle of a road at dawnbreak, after sleepwalking. The film starts at quite a steady pace, we find out more about Donny &amp; the battles going on in the kid's mind &amp; life. However, I found as the film went on, the storyline is actually quite weak and wears itself out, and some of the characters are quite underdeveloped &amp; inconvincing e.g his parents, the English teacher and the rabbit who I couldn't quite work out such as is he supposed to be real, where does he come from, whats his beef? Jake Gylenhaal gives a haunting performance as Donny who's basically a spoilt snotty nosed rich kid who its hard to have sympathy for(his Dad buys him a moped as a punishment?)but despite this, Gylenhaal plays the character more sensitively than written so its easier for the audience to connect.Again you could say this film is open to interpetation, in lots of areas and you may need a second or third viewing etc, but just the one will do me. Overrated film that begins promisingly for 30-40 mins then loses its way and ends up lost up its own behind. Thats my interpetation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unclassifiable Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some movies that receive the attention of the critics and are given accolades that make them revered for generations. And then there are those that don't, but deserve to. Donnie Darko is one of those movies. What can only be described as an unclassifiable masterpiece, Donnie Darko explores the world of a seemingly disturbed teenager who is visited by a disturbing bunny named Frank, who tells him to perform certain actions before the world comes to an end. I'll refrain from going into any further detail and instead describe why this film is widely regarded as one of the most original films of the past decade. From the setting, to the cast, to the well plotted storyline, every aspect of the Donnie Darko film is memorable. One montage that is the most well constructed in any film is when Donnie arrives at school with his friends, and the song Head over Heels is playing. No dialogue is used while we are introduced to very important characters, instead the music's lyrics and the subtle gestures from the actors gives us great insight. This film is about love, family, acceptance, social expectations, and sacrifice. Multiple viewings may be required to help better understand the concepts of the film, which can be interpreted a number of different ways. But it is well worth it. The original version of the film is my favorite, while the director's cut tends to lend more of a helping hand to the storyline. The bottom line: Do yourself a favor and watch this masterpiece of a film, you'll be hard pressed to find a more original and well acted movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" is probably the definitive 'teen movie' of the new millennium so far.Starting off as an eerie black comedy, the story spirals into an insane web of mystery and the supernatural. There are healthy amounts of humor thrown in for good measure and it actually works very well here. We don't really know what is going on until the end and when we do find out what Frank The Demon Bunny Rabbit is really all about, it is shocking and it makes the hairs on your arms stand up. Follow it to the end, you will not regret it.I would give this movie a ten if it weren't for the abysmal acting and utter uselessness of Drew Barrymore and her character in "Donnie Darko." She hams it up big time, never believable for a moment as a high school teacher. She is outclassed here by every other actor in the bunch and should have remained merely a producer because she looks terrible. She almost ruined it but "Donnie Darko" is such a great flick, even SHE couldn't do that.See it.9 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though almost impossible to completely understand on the first watch, Donnie Darko is forcefully engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is not a dark, scary horror film. Neither is it a bright, happy film. It is somewhere in between, and is a brooding, abstract Physcological thriller. It is so engaging a s a result, that you follow the story and their characters willingly, desperately desiring an answer to the film.Donnie Darko (DD) tells the story of a young, troubled teenager named Donnie (Darko). He is haunted by visions of Frank, a bunny rabbit who tells him when the world is going to end. From here, strange occurrences and coincidences take place, and Donnie starts to both mature, yet also lose control of himself. He is tormented, multi-layered, and played eye-catchingly by Jake Gyllenhall. All 110 minutes of DD is climaxing and superbly engaging. It is fantastic that cinema has finally aimed to challenge the audience, and though DD does seem to turn and twist a couple times to many, the plot threads are on the whole enjoyable.A well directed, ambitious and thoughtful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy cult film that appeals on many levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had had this film recommended to me by friends and knew it was considered a cult favorite, but have only just got around to viewing it, thanks to its turning up in a bargain bin at the local discount store.Though I went in with some preconceptions, not knowing much about the film except its basic premise, I was delightfully surprised by what I saw. Not many films now can take you on a voyage that is so free of clichés, formulas and predictable plot turns, but Donnie Darko does just that.Despite its faults (and it does have them, including phoned-in performances - thankfully brief - from Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze and the absolutely dreadful Mary McDonnell), this is a whimsical little film full of surprises and twists. It builds suspense with nearly every scene and there's hardly a moment when you're not aching to find out what happens next, and what exactly is to become of Donnie.This is also one of the few films I have ever seen to deal so effectively with mental illness, drawing the viewer so completely into the world of a paranoid schizophrenic (much as Scorsese so hypnotically drew you in in his bleak masterpiece Taxi Driver) without resorting to being patronizing, sensationalist, exploitative or simple minded.See this film if you enjoy the kind of movies that explore other versions of reality, whether they be fantasy, horror, science fiction or something else. I think you'll find it engaging, entertaining, enlightening and more. And, like me, you'll probably want to see it again right away...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is pure genius. Most people hate it because "they don't understand it." But the thing is there is not much to understand. The explanation of the movie is whatever you think it is. There is no right or wrong answer. It just makes you think. Jake Gyllenhaal is a phenomenal actor. I strongly suggest you go see this movie if you have not already. If you have seen this movie, I hope you did enjoy it, because it is one of the greatest films out there. Even the idea of having a 6 foot tall bunny rabbit as an imaginary friend, is amazing. The way the movie ties together is great as well. But the best thing is there is no logical explanation, I know I have said that before, but maybe to the people who didn't like the movie that can make you think a little more about it. The bottom line is, Donnie Darko truly is a super hero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All i can say is you must see this film. On first viewing it completely went over my head but when I sat down and watched it again ,what I saw was a film that is as cryptic as a Dickinson poem while maintaining a spine tingling sort of beauty which warrants it to be, in my opinion, the first stone cold classic of the 21st century.The acting is marvellous from the excellent Jake Gyllenhal who manages to play the role of a schizophrenic-arsonist in a somehow dignified fashion to Mary Mcdonnell who deserves a masterclass for portraying emotion without speaking a word (see ending to know what I'm on about).Every actor plays there part in making this a fantastic film, but what even tops the tremendous acting is the spot-on direction from Richard Kelly, with not a shot out of place. What is also evident is the presence of many memorable scenes; from the encounter between Gyllenhall and preacher/child molester Swayze to the extremely unnerving scene with Frank in the shrink office, there is guaranteed to be a scene that will stay with you. On a final note, the soundtrack is brilliant with the excellent implement of 'Mad World' featured at the end. YNWA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An influential and thoughtful film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to my first viewing of Donnie Darko, I knew nothing more about it other than its cult status. Having much success with cult films, I decided to take a gamble and purchase it. I'm very glad that I did so. Donnie Darko is a monumental film in its intertwining of fantasy and time travel science. The film addresses existentialism and free will as part of the human condition.The film combines a stereotypical high school (enhanced by the unimpressive Drew Berrymore) with an emotionally troubled young man. The film opens with an airplane part crashing into Donnie's home. Donnie doesn't die in the crash because he is called out of home by a mysterious rabbit. He then experiences visions from the ghostly rabbit that represents the other choice that some god could have chosen for him or that he otherwise avoided. The apparition tells him the world will end at a set time. I believe this occurs because Donnie's continued life altered the course of time. Donnie unintentionally discovers how this will happen, but it isn't obvious to either the audience or to Donnie himself. The rabbit's haunting allows Donnie to know the truth behind actions and intentions. He discovers a child pornographer's secret and realizes why Smurfit exists. Donnie is also able to see future where people will walk before they do. While this may sound trite, I assure you that it isn't. He doesn't see visions, just a celestial, amorphous figure that appears in front of the person. These images are CGI-enhanced, which is surprising for a cult film. Finally, a wormhole opens over his home and the airplane part from earlier falls on Donnie's home which kills him. This is what would have happened if the rabbit hadn't removed him from the home. I'm no theologian, but this film seemingly supports the theory that the divine has a set plan for all of us. Why then would Donnie have survived when the plane originally crashed? I have no religious views of my own, but it would appear as if Kelly may have had included his as director of this film.Jake Gyllenhall does a spectacular job as Donnie. He always has stooped shoulders as one would imagine an emotionally troubled, Casi-depressed person would. His speech appears schizophrenic and conspicuous. Patrick Swayze did good as the child pornographer, and he was especially convincing as the Kent Hovind-like school speaker. The only gripe I have about the acting is Berrymore's extended screen presence. I understand that it was to help market the film, but her's was an unnecessary character.I could endless discuss this film, and many introductory film courses regularly assign it as mandatory viewing. The plot is fantastically original and thought-provoking. It is also a great film to discuss Hawking's time travel theory and the role of free will. I wonder if wormholes can open at any point that the film suggests. Donnie Darko, despite its inability to appeal to the masses,is a masterpiece of storytelling. Only seven years in existence, it is already held as one of the greatest films of the century. This legacy will continue, and you should include yourself as part of that legacy.</fullReview>

We give them all this prescribed fecal matter and they get nothing." She is fired by the dumb, bureaucratic principal so like every principal just about that I've ever had, out-IQ'd by every teacher in the school except for the aging cheerleaders masquerading as counselors.Our high schools are failing because they are undereducating our kids, avoiding anything controversial like the plague, forcing our kids to take meaningless tests that only test memory, not the ability to think. This kid is obviously both brilliant and disturbed. I couldn't help but think of the kids I know from Bedford, Ma. who might not have turned schizoid had he not done a few innocuous drugs that made him vulnerable to what he had probably inherited. Who knows? But those parents must have felt like these parents, intelligent and kind even if they were Republicans.Great movie, and Jake Guygendal with his eerie, evil smile is tops.Yes, I'll be seeing it again, and wonder why more wasn't made of it at the time, except that it might disturb our corporate masters who love the fact that we are an undereducated nation of peasants. "Without an educated electorate this delicate experiment called 'democracy' is doomed to failure." So said deTocqueville, and boy, was he ever right!!See it, think and demand more of your School Committee than they slavishly follow the dictates of whatever Town Clique is ruining/running YOUR town, as in Canton, Ma. And support any teacher brave enough to each controversial subjects, such as "What really has caused our country's corrupt government to be despised by every right-thinking human being in the world?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"28 days... six hours... 42 minutes... 12 seconds. That... is when the world... will end" ? Frank, the giant bunny rabbit (from "Donnie Darko").When I first learned about Donnie Darko, the film was already a two years cult classic. Of course it was a devastating flop at the box office, so many people didn't know what it was, or what it was about. But when a local Israeli radio station first played Gary Jewel's melancholy adaptation of the pop hit "Mad World" (taken from the movie's excellent soundtrack), the announcer spoke of a forgotten American film about a kid who encounters a vision of a giant bunny rabbit that tells him that the world is about the end unless he takes some severe actions to prevent it. This all sounded surreal to me, and I decided to do whatever is necessary to put my hand on a copy of the film, and see what it's all about. And boy was I hooked. Jake Gyllenhall, in one of his earliest appearances (long before he started to become somewhat annoying), is Donnie Darko, the haunted teen who takes the impossible burden of fixing the world on his shoulders. Shortly after the film begins, a jet engine falls from a plane and crash lands into Donnie's bedroom. After eluding this freak accident, a sequence of bizarre occurrences revolving Darko begins to take place. Darko is led by his bunny-friend, Frank, to wreak havoc on his home town, supposedly in the interest of saving them (or something). Alas, it is not quite clear who this Frank bunny is, and why Darko is the only person to see him. This whole hallucinatory film takes place during the 1988 presidential election, but if you notice the voices in the background, you'll notice something went wrong with the alternate reality Darko is living in, and it is not the 1988 many of us would remember. Whatever he was trying to pull, promising director Richard Kelly's debut film is a journey of fate, faith and our ability to walk the thin line that separates thee two. Gyllenhall's real life sister and a talent on her own right, Maggie, plays Darko's on screen older sister, and Daveigh Chase (The Ring, Lilo &amp; Stitch) is the younger one. Also taking part in this wonderful indie film are 1980's legend Patrick Swayze (as a child molesting sports coach), Drew Barrymore (as Darko's teacher) and E.R.'s Noah Wyle.If you manage to get your hands on this one, you won't regret it. The film's success is word of mouth in its full pride and glory ? and an extremely justified one in this case.</fullReview>

Simply amazing. Jake Gyllenahll gives the performance of his life. The movies plot is very complex as well as being very different. The plot is about a troubled teen named donnie. He has seen a large bunnie rabbit named frank who tells him that the world is going to end.The film surrounds what happens during that time until everything ends.The movie is simply amazing for the sheer mystery and wonder that surrounds it.

Not sure it matters any more what this movie was intended to be... What I'm trying to say is that this film needs to be watched with no 'label' or preconception in mind, and ideally alone so you won't be distracted by 'What's happening now?' questions or embarrassed if, like I did, you find yourself getting too emotional to hold back sobs.With a heavy and ominous tone of foreboding from the outset, the film moves on to scenes of strong imagery perfectly matched with a deeply evocative soundtrack -It's gripping, powerful, unsettling and thought provoking in a way I struggle to describe.If you like cinema that leaves you feeling 'trippy' after you've watched it and need to have some time alone to think about your reaction to it, You will NOT be disappointed.Once again, don't look for a genre or worry too much about decoding the 'official' meaning. Meaning is such a personal thing - Just see where the film takes you in your own reaction to it! I'm not intending to look online for deeper analysis, as I'm content with my own interpretation.

The joy of being true to yourself and seeing beyond what you are programmed at birth to see can be perilous-and yes, the world is cruel.What if Death gave you a choice of escaping it's grasp? Would you allow yourself to love through senselessness or to question those with programed thoughts? If you did escape death would find it very easy to give in to your inner feelings of angst? Jenna Malone's character Gretchen asks in the movie: "What if you could go back in time through all those times of sadness and darkness and replace them with something better?" The movie leads up towards two deaths. In the events leading up to the end of the movie, the apparition Donnie sees is actually Death itself. Not Frank, but actually Death. Donnie sacrifices himself after given the chance to see life outside of his death.The ability to see outside of death causes Donnie to go somewhat insane and being outside of death allows him to interact with the life he was responsible for taking. Thus schizophrenia."I can only hope when this world comes to an end that I can breath a sigh of relief that there will be so much to look forward to." Donnie says this at the end of the movie and the statement more than galvanizes what this movie truly delivers.People who deserve to move forward do not, those who don't deserve it do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is like a pack of Rizla papers, its what you make of it. Its like a really good poem, except...its a movie. Its more so your opinion and your movie than what was really intended.The fact that when I watch this movie, each time I learn something completely new. Its yet to fail to entertain me and it really was worth the ?5 I paid for it. I like everything about it, the music, the way its filmed. It's just so good.What annoys me is when people say, "It's rubbish...." (a more modest way of rephrasing what was actually said). ACTUALLY... (I said) you only think that because you cannot understand it, therefore you find it not so entertaining as people who do understand it. You've really got to think with this film and often use your imagination.Donnie Darko is a film I could watch whatever mood I'm in. I love it more than cheese which says quite a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deus Ex Machina</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At one point in this film, Donnie (superbly played, might I add) utters the phrase, "Deus Ex Machina", literally meaning God Of The Machine, but more closely and familiarly known as "God's Machine". I find this moment wholly... or should I say Holy... interesting considering the layers and layers of spiritual incarnation in the film. Donnie, thanks to a strange 'riff' in time, has been placed directly in the seat of control for God's own machine. He even questions this very idea when talking to his science teacher who immediately dismisses the conversation, supposedly for fear of being fired, but I suspect it is because he is among the manipulated. (For more on that, you need to check out "The Philosophy Of Time Travel", one of the many extra goodies that can be found at the official Donnie Darko website.) A lot of people interpret this film in different ways and rightfully so. It brings the layers of teen angst, spirituality, philosophy, time-travel, the absurdity in life, etc. Some people watch this and see a movie about the relationships of the family, others a kick-ass sci-fi. I prefer to go with somewhere in between all the genres. There is no clear label for it. I can say that the character of Cunningham is extremely interesting in the spiritual sense. Here's a man that, seemingly, has a strong belief system and yet we quickly learn he is quite possibly the most corrupted man in Middlesex. (I know, its a little contrived to have the 'well sorted guy' be the most screwed up, but this is the only role I truly can stand Patrick Swayze... and that's saying something) Donnie struggles to understand the Deus Ex Machina that he is placed in and eventually learns to deal with the jarring and ultimately mind-screwing series of events that have almost conspired against him. (I'm not missing the irony of the term originating in original playwriting as a plot device) I firmly believe that you can tell a lot about someone by how they interpret the end of this film. You'll be left with the repeatedly uttered "Did he know?...Damn it, did he know?" asked to yourself over and over. Its what you finally come to that says a lot about you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a lot of great independent films out there. So when I watch them I am not that thrilled. However, Donnie Darko does not fall into that category. Donnie Darko is one of the most mind blowing movies ever made. The plot of the film is just incredible. There is something about it that no other science fiction, no other thriller, no other film has touched. Donnie Darko is truly unique. This movie is like art...the way it unrolls just makes you speechless...and then there is the ending. The ending is masterful...if there was ever a film to make you think after it was over, it is Donnie Darko. A near flawless piece of work.10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's right , Richard Kelly is a genius . It takes to be one to write a screenplay like this when you're only 21 ( or maybe 22 , I'm not sure )in only a few weeks while doing your regular , day - to - day job . And to direct it in such a professional manner when you're just 26 , and if that's your first full length movie after a few short ones at the academy - then it's truly mind - blowing .Do yourself a favor and 1. find the Director's cut version because it's more complete and richer with meaning and ideas ( and more comprehensible ) , and 2. stay away from this if you're too lazy to use your brain during and after watching . This is pretty deep stuff , complicated , multi - layered , with references to philosophy , science and whatnot . I've seen it three times so far and can't say I really got it . I know I'll never understand it entirely . But it doesn't bother me , 'cause this is one of the best damn movies I've ever seen in my entire life . No matter what I come across in the future , this fact will remain , no doubt about it .This movie is also a lot of fun. You get to know the mysterious phantom in a creepy bunny costume with skull mask instead of a face , hear how Donnie makes fun of the manipulative pedophile guru in front of the entire school or gives his buddies a lecture about sex life of the Smurfs , and there are also horror , suspense , sf and philosophy of time travel . It's completely insane . Great , great , great movie . Richard Kelly , thank you . You are a true genius .</fullReview>

Richard Kelly made a great work by mixing in a inspired way many genres,from satire and romantic drama to science fiction and horror. Donnie Darco became a mouth to mouth phenomenon because of many things such as: the sophisticated and original screenplay,the compelling performance of Jake Gyllenhaal,the ideal 80s' revival,the exciting soundtrack. And the most important:this is a movie with soul that's full of energy. For me the independent American cinema is the most important thing that ever happened to the modern cinema and Donnie Darko is one of the main reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most beautiful and unusual movies I've seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this movie at a friend's house and was somewhat inattentive through lack of sleep and the lateness of the hour. I made up for this crime by buying it for myself soon after.The hazy blueness of a school summer in the 1980's was rendered with an attention to production values by a man I was very surprised to learn made Donnie Darko his writing/directing debut. The plot is either very simple or very complicated, depending on what you believe is going on or who you ask. On the one hand you have a school in the 80's and some well thought out character interaction. Against this backdrop, on the other hand, you have Donnie himself who seems to be in the middle of some kind of teenage delusional crisis. As the plot progresses however, it becomes apparent that he has become victim to some kind of temporal anomaly which is gradually pulling his world - and potentially everyone else's - apart. He gradually learns - from old ladies, six foot rabbits and reluctant teachers - that he is the only person who can reverse the anomaly and stop the world's time-line from unravelling completely.I have an appreciation of the whole writer/director thing and this Richard Kelly movie reinforces my belief that only the writer can truly interpret their vision in directing an actor. The cinematography is hardly groundbreaking but I found it impossible to fault. However there are moments of lucidity which almost seem to reach from the screen to command your attention. Some quite underrated and subtle performances from much of the cast, Ghylenhall included, add up to make this one of the most unusual movies I have seen in years and one which I am proud to have in my collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now and again a small movie....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now and again a small movie comes along and dramatically shifts the views of the audience and intrigues the viewer and makes them think. What the Bleep: Down the Rabbit Hole, 1984, Animal Farm and Donnie Darko all entrance the viewer to think.Donnie Darko's plot is a maze of emotion and ideas that won't make sense to people if they don't watch carefully. The movie begins much like Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, more commonly known as Alice in Wonderland. During the beginning of the film Donnie is very bored with his life and then he sees Frank, the white rabbit, much like the White Rabbit in Alice in Wonderland, Frank is also obsessed with time and tells Donnie when the world will end. Donnie Darko (DD) also focuses on mirrors, same with Alice in Wonderland's sequel Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There, In DD, Jim Cunningham, the motivation speaker, tells people to take a good long look in the mirror, but one should realize what might rise when you look deep into the abyss and the abyss looks back at you. In Alice's second adventure she travels through a mirror into Wonderland, in DD, Donnie and Frank see each other through the mirror. At the end of the movie, Donnie wakes up in his bed where he first heard Frank, like Alice who woke up under the tree where she first saw the White Rabbit. The events of the movie could have been a dream, since a dream time line can be short or feel like days. In the movie, Donnie falls in love, does things that are inhumanly possible (put the axe through a pure bronze statue), exposed the true colours of several people and brought change to almost everyone else he knows. It could very well be a representation of his sexually frustrated mind, his anger at bullies, authoritative figures and his medication. Not to say that that the events of the movie could be a drug trip, much like the original Alice in Wonderland could have been.The audio side of the movie is quiet dramatic and adds incredible depth to the movie. An example of this is whenever Frank is on screen there's an eerie electronic sounding buzz telling the viewer that there's something is not right. The audio also pushes the sound of certain objects in the movie, such as camera flashes and other machinacal noises. Even silence is used in a few scenes to create a distant feel. DD also features a selective and well fitting soundtrack of several 80's hits that fits perfectly within the scenes. Such an example is "Love Will Tear Us Apart" by Joy Division plays when Donnie and Gretchen make love. The song is about lead singer Ian Curtis' failing marriage, which was one of several reasons that drove Ian to kill himself. Donnie's love for Gretchen is torn apart when she is ran over by Frank. When Donnie appears to go back in time or wake up, it's wondered if it's better never to have loved, then lost.Donnie's death at the end of the movie brings an end to the other world, may it be a dream world or alternative reality. Donnie's death is instantly felt by all the other main characters who have a moment of silence. The viewer wonders if the alterntive world impacted the other characters or if they came to the conclusion by themselves. Since the human mind is capable of such tremendous power and studies show that humans only use a small percent of brain capacity is it wondered if Donnie's thoughts of what happened in the other world was transmitted to the others. This concept of the human mind being able to alter ideas is not a new theory and is explored in 1984 and several other films. Was Donnie's adventure real? Could such things happen, or was it just a drug induced dream about a giant rabbit, time travel and love? All the answers are in the movie and most people will have to watch carefully to discover for themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of a very few movies that can bring me to tears and I love any film that can change my emotions like that. I only bought this film because the director's cut had a commentary with Kevin Smith and I love everything he's done so I figured since he put his stamp of approval on this it must be good or at least worth a shot, so I did. And when I watched this I fell in love with everything it stands for, and I cried when Donnie Darko dies at the end, it was unfair for him to die, but I understand that that is the meaning of this film, life is unfair. I love how the character time travels through the Evil Dead and thought to be funny. The soundtrack is wonderful and I hope to buy it someday. Watch this it is great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely foreshadowed and atmospheric mystery story ? but when FAQs, forums and DVD bonus materials are needed just to 'grasp' the film, then it is probably flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just starting to write this, I realize "Donnie Darko" will be a very difficult film to review. It is also a very difficult film to grasp the scope, timeline and message of ? but now that I have just finished reading a long "Donnie Darko: FAQ", I feel as though I could give it a decent try without the most semi-coherent, rambling observations.Plotwise, titular character Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) is on the surface a normal American 16-year-old, but scratch this surface and you find a deeply, deeply disturbed and dark teenager who is tormented by hallucinations of a demonic bunny rabbit, obsessive thoughts and a world of darkness that even his psychiatrist cannot quite grasp. The film has Donnie do a series of crimes and deeds in his fluffy suburban neighbourhood that at first appear to be petty and pointless, but eventually link up and culminate in an eerie revelation. This "eerie revelation" is best left alone and unspoiled (the ending was spoiled for me before I saw it, grr!), but I will say this: even with a long-ass FAQ and DVD bonus material, it doesn't really make sense. It does occasionally, and when the pieces of the puzzle DO manage to fall in the right place, it's brilliant. As most of the time they jumble about in a great big existentialist mess, this puzzle feels incomplete and often too crazy for its own good. A few more solid facts would have been welcomed to ground this film a bit.While they say that the ending usually makes the film, "Donnie Darko" has other good factors that redeem the hazy payoff. This is stuff like an hilarious Patrick Swayze as the local guru-fraud, the sensationally layered acting from Mary McDonnell as Donnie's concerned mother and a great soundtrack. Gyllenhaal undoubtedly captures the inner turmoil of his character quite well, like the bathroom hallucinations. This is clear-eyed and assured acting, which is more than you can say for the direction. Remember the style of Dirty Dancing? That is a film from the 1980s that it supposed to be set in the 1950s, but fails miserably because it's just so blatantly 80's coloured and influenced ? from the catchphrases, the hair, the outfits and music to the actors, it just oozes "1987". Well, the same applies to "Donnie Darko" (2001). It is set in 1988, for the sole reason that the director Richard Kelly felt more at home as a teenager in the 80s. But curiously, all the people look and act like 21th century characters or late 90s kids. It's wildly distracting.This is far from a perfect film; it should have been sewn together more clearly. But this aside, it really is a very entertaining fare that would easily get an A+ for effort and an A for acting. 7/10</fullReview>

I wouldn't recommend the movie to anyone younger than 13 years of age though. This is in my top 5 movies. It is an absolute shame that the movie isn't very popular. There wasn't much of an add campaign and I suppose the fact that it was released in 2001 and that September 11th happened that year and in the movie it contains the plane accident. If you like the movie, please tell your friends about it. I want to see some books on it but I haven't seen any.

		<shortDescription>Original version is just as good, if not better, as the "director's cut"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me make it clear that this is a great film. The script, the cinematography, the music and the casting make it one of the top films of the last decade. That being said, a new viewer, who knows nothing about the film, should see the original cut before viewing the "director's cut." What's the difference? The soundtrack of the director's cut features more tunes from the 1980s (which, according to NPR's FRESH AIR, Richard Kelly could not secure the rights to back in the day) and also incorporates chapter shots which resemble something from Wes Anderson's "The Royal Tenenbaums." Apparently the director felt that his film needed more framing; hence, the illustrated chapter pages used to break up the narrative. These chapter pages, culled from the Sparrow text on time travel, really don't add anything to the film -- in fact, they clutter an already perfect cinematic treasure. Plus one line from the "director's cut" -- which is delivered by the psycho-therapist near the end of the film , where she tells Donnie that he can "throw away his medicine, it's only a sugar pill placebo" detracts from the powerful ambiguities (even though, I assume, it was meant to call even more of his "reality" into question). The original version may not include allo of the songs that Kelly envisioned in his film, but it certainly is a tighter film from beginning to end.</fullReview>

I find that this film is much too deep to explain in a comment and while I should tell you what the film is about I can't...I can only give you the gist. Donnie hasn't been the same since something of a near death experience has occurred in his life. Now he gets visions of a 6 foot tall bunny rabbit. At least that was what the description said once I pressed the "info" button on my remote. I wasn't too excited. Donnie the main character is one of the most pronounced and well developed characters in film history. Jake does his best performance that he has and will ever do. The secondary characters float around in an off positions with out much notice...except Donnie's girlfriend. This movie makes you care about only those two and nothing else and I wouldn't have had it any other way. By the end of the film I guarantee that you will have a different prospective on life. I don't expect nor recommend someone to watch it just once. There is too much to get with out a second viewing. I enjoyed this film and this film actually putt a tear to my eye AND made me smile and chuckle all in a couple of hours. I suggest that everyone see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a time where Hollywood was spoon feeding....scrap that... FORCE FEEDING the movie going public, I'm happy to see that courageous movie makers are still producing movies that engages your brain. These days the best movies should be found at the bottom of the list of box office hits. Donnie Darko is a movie about a troubled youth looking for some kind of closure in his life. The backdrop is the beautifully recreated 80's in the middle of right wing suburbia. It was refreshing to see Patrick Swayze in a serious role, and Patrick Swayze being a 80's icon, enhances that nostalgic feeling. I'm almost tempted to say that this film is like a modern "Rebel without a cause" directed by Stanley Kubrik. But no, this film stands alone.***** Spoiler alert ******* I urge you to watch this movie, and look past the superficial time travel discussions (which is just a vessel to carry the theme) and see the brilliance of these movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a teen horror film. In addition, it's a teen romance. In addition, Donnie Darko is a Hamletian study in familial relationship. The viewer never really knows whether Donnie, a brilliant high school kid is wacko or completely sane while his adult world is nutty. I particularly liked the scenes with the lady-shrink where under hypnosis Donnie has a self-pleasuring moment. Things can go wrong in those shrink sessions for sure.There are two groups of adults here, the Democrats and the Republicans. Dukakis is smart and thoughtful. Bush 1 is stammering and smarmy. The Physical Education teacher is new-age bunko, book burning, inflexible along with her idol, Patrick Swayze, as the handsome motivational speaker with one message, there's Fear and Love. To contrast, Drew Barrymore plays the really cool young English teacher that gets canned for being too Liberal. Donnie rebels and insists there is a world of grays out there, not black and white. Okay, this is relativism which has it's own critics. I'd go along with the evil Dan Quail idea if it were more developed, but good and evil in Darko is pretty cardboard.I'm not at all sure why Kelly decided it was important to do a 1988 film in 2001. You got me on that one. There's as much political animosity and self-help gobblygook today as there was in the 80's. I can only assume that the 80's was a crucible for the director.Finally, Darko is an incredibly creative film, very interesting to watch visually as things might fall out of the sky at any moment. Donnie walks through life in movie time, effortlessly burning down buildings while his girlfriend sleeps during a movie date. My teen dates were never like that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never ever liked my original review cause i never really explain why this is my all time favourite film not the best because it's Terry Gilliam's Brazil. (SEE FILMFANATIX.com)Over The Years, i've had favourite film for example...Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Harry And The Hendersons, Wild Wild West (extremely underrated film,it's not great but it's a fun blockbuster) and a lot more.It wasn't till some day in the fall of 2003, i found my favourite film and that films is of course Donnie Darko.At the time I was having a really bad time at school and it has helped me thought it and thats why i've seen it for i think like 100 times.Jake Gyllenhaal plays a teen in 1988 who may be imagining a 6 foot bunny rabbit called "Frank" or may not and people have said this is a complete rip-off of the James Stewart film "Harvey" even though it clearly is not.This is one of the films people love to try to compare to different films and you CAN'T it's a one of a kind film and the most similar films are David Lynch's Masterpiece "Blue Velvet" and "Jacob's Ladder" and those are still very different films.Now to the plot of Donnie Darko... Donnie is a kid who sleep walks and finds himself at different places in this home town of Middlesex (this mostly happens at the start) and one night when he is sleep walking, a jet engine falls into his room and escapes death and when he is sleep walking, he meets Frank The Giant 6-Foot Bunny Rabbit (played by James Duval). He goes to school and meets a girl and is moved into a hotel room.I will not explain it anymore because i don't want to ruin the impact of the film.Some films for me i just loved the first time i saw them and this one of them and some others are Lord Of The Rings Trilogy,Fight Club (but i wasn't one of all time favs till after i read the book but i loved it a lot),Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas,Brazil,Sin City and Hellboy.The Film seems so normal but like "Blue Velvet" it seems so surreal.The Script is one of the greatest pieces of writing ever written and i can't stress the fact that it is as good and even better then most books i've read.Jake Gyllenhaal really really deserved an Oscar for playing Donnie Darko but because the film really vanished out of the cinemas but it has became a cult classic on DVD.The Cast is unbelievable...Maggie Gyllenhaal (Jake's real sister),Patrick Swayze (who would have though my fav film would have Patrick Swayze),Drew Barrymoore,Jena Malone and many others.The Film is a poetic,tragic,love story,thriller,mysterious,surreal,magical,teen movie.And it's always nice to see Jake Gyllenhaal gets good roles after this masterpiece for example as Jack in Brokeback and Swoff in Jarhead. and i just identify with this film a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So glad I watched this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With well over 1600 other reviews here at IMDb, I'll be surprised if mine ever gets seen! Oh well, this is a great movie, and I want to write a review.I saw this movie for the first time 6 days ago on IFC, a Canadian movie channel. I was utterly fascinated by it by the ten minute mark. I couldn't stop watching. By the end of the movie, I had grasped the basic concept (time travel, saving the world, sacrifice for love...), but was utterly confused, but in a good way. I watched it again the next day, and though still not grasping every concept, liked it even more.At this time I decided to purchase the directors cut and watch that version. Well, it certainly cleared up a lot via the extra scenes and the commentary track (that's 4 viewings now in 6 days!) and I'm glad I saw it, but I liked the theatrical cut better. More mystery made for better viewing.The acting was topnotch, and the dialog was fantastic. The conversation about emotional problems was my personal favorite scene. The music suited this flick wonderfully also. Although I still don't understand the role of Cherita Chen in the movie (it's almost like she's the embodiment of the primary universe...far-fetched and wrong I'm sure, but that's the best I can come up with) and the role of the man in the red jogging suit. All the theories I've heard about this guy just don't add up to me, and I can't figure out the point of this character at all.As a word of advice, seek out this movie, but only watch the directors cut if you want clarity, the theatrical cut is better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot adequately describe this absolutely outstanding movie simply by writing a review. Nobody could do that. The impalpable emotions that this movie makes you feel; fear, distress, sympathy, understanding,love, and annoyance. 'Donnie Darko' is no teen slasher movie, nor particularly about time travel. It is recall about understanding. It creates a entirely new genre. This movie may be one of the most beautiful I have ever seen.It really is one of the scariest movies that I have ever seen in my life, in all probability because it deals with insanity. Donnie is really very capable of scaring you, with ease. This movie is really outstanding. I would recommend it to everyone who loves movies.</fullReview>

He also has a great knack for the music he uses. Every song he put into the movie feeds the scene and it is truly remarkable. This is not by any standards a simple movie, however, and i recommend having your undivided attention on it when you watch it. Once again, it will blow your mind.

		<fullReview>to explain the 'very superficial' title of the comment first.it does NOT refer to the movie itself but to the all comments about it. the movie is an excellent review of our lives, but none seem to talk about it. i would hope that this moves was made not for the 'get rich fast scheme', but rather that it made money on account that it depicted the philosophy of life in such a honest, yet metaphorical way.as the lyrics from the movie soundtrack go: "...i find it kind of funny, i find it kind of sad, the dreams in which i'm dying, are the best i've ever had..." this is true for more people than we care to admit. at least for those people that take the time to review their lives as they review this movie.the movie itself is amazing, together with the performance from the actors (well done casting director). as the above song resonates through my brain, i can not help but feel that some of us are not adjusted to todays world in which so happily(?) live in.the main question for me after seeing this movie is: did the world really needed to be saved?SPOILER THREE PARAGRAPHS BELLOW ***for me the answer is NO, for you it may differ, but we can all agree that the world could be a better place for us all, and many people think so, and work for that goal, at least through their lives of honesty and care for their loved ones, but yet somehow the world is getting to be a very cumbersome and tiresome and a place of sorrow and disrespect and sadness and lies and tears... for most people. so many people live in poor conditions, in conditions that range from no fresh water through aids and other illnesses to their everyday lives without meaning.SPOILER TWO PARAGRAPHS BELLOW ** what i am trying to say is that this movie should raise a question in your mind: would the world be a better place if i was dead?SPOILER DIRECTLY BELLOW * fortunately for donnie, he got to be the hero. he died. he made the world a better place. for his loved ones. for everyone. it makes me sad that i'll never have such an opportunity."...i find it kind of funny, i find it kind of sad, the dreams in which i'm dying, are the best i've ever had..."10/10 for this movie as it is a definite recommendation for everyone to watch. and then watch it again. i was fortunate to watch the directors cut first, since i missed the first release of donnie darko.all in all a very sad movie, for those involved in it, but also for the rest of us who got left behind after darko died for us all. i think he made the wrong choice. what do you think?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best mind thrillers out there. This movie not only has great acting, but a great story. For many people it may take a couple watches to fully understand the concept of this movie, but most people do enjoy it. So don't judge this movie on just one watch, you need to see it a couple times to see all the hidden messages and symbolism. This movie has a mix of genres to entertain many viewers, it is a mix between a psychological thriller and a comedy, and it doesn't disappoint. Jake Gyllenhaal has a strong performance playing a boy named Donnie Darko. He sets the mood for the movie and really pulls you into the movie. If you are a fan of his movies, this one is definitely one of his best. Director Richard Kelly is not a very famous director, but he proves in this movie that he has great potential in a film career. He made the movie flow very well and with the release of 'Donnie Darko: The Directors Cut' makes the movie very easy to follow. The directors cut is slightly better than the original, only because it is easier for people to follow along and understand the point of the movie.please do yourself a favor and see this movie. It is one of todays top films and has been highly overlooked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Donnie" is everything you could ask for in a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard some buzz about how great a little film called "Donnie Darko" is before, and I did spend five minutes pouring over the DVD cover at Target. So one night, after I got it on Netflix, I popped it in the DVD player and sat my fanny on the couch. It was one of the best two hours I ever spent in front of the television.Donnie Darko is portrayed magnificently by Jake Gyllenhaal of "Brokeback Mountain" fame. Donnie is a teenager of roughly sixteen who gets disturbing visions of a six foot tall rabbit who tells him that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds. That night an engine from an airplane falls through the roof of Donnie's bedroom.This movie is filled with laughs and chills and awesome cinematography. It is a great film for those who like to think about the movie they just saw. The ending is kind of open-ended, which leaves room for the viewers themselves to interpret the film.On the cover of the DVD I believe, it hails Donnie Darko as a "psychological thriller". While very psychological, calling it a "psychological thriller" does not do it justice. The best classification of the film that us movie buffs can think of is a thinkpiece. Whether it's thinking about how the ending happened, if poor Cherita Chen will ever be understood, about the story behind Frank the bunny, whether or not every living creature on earth dies alone, how exactly one "sucks a f*ck", and about the sexual lives of smurfs, this film provokes those thoughts.I dare you to enjoy the masterpiece of "Donnie Darko".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding and overwhelming film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Donnie Darko is about...is kind of complicated. It depends on what you get from the film or how much you understand it. If you have enough perception to understand that the film is NOT actually about time travel, at least that's not the basic point of the film, then you get it. (Richard Kelly, as a teenager of the 80s, wrote the scenario. So it reflects those times' popular questions about time travel. Is it possible? If it is, how?) The film is actually about fate. At least it's my comment. It's about a boy being enlightened through the constant flow of the film. At the beginning of the film, Donnie is confused. He gets psychological assistance. But aside from that, he is a normal and confused teenager. He is afraid to be alone, die alone. So he thinks the search for God is absurd. But as it goes, he gets to know about time travel, he has questions. He has been through so many devastations by the end of the film. Suddenly he's enlightened. Though he thought before that the search for god is absurd, he HAS accomplished on his way of the search for God. He himself answered his questions about God, and time, and history. So he knows that every creature in this world has its own predestined fate and it cannot be resisted. He ceases to resist his fate because he's seen the consequences of it. He's seen that if the history swerves from its predestined flow, some tangent universe arises and it's a suicidal universe which will collapse in less than a month if the living receiver(the person who is he reason of the tangent universe in this case, Donnie) does not complete his/her assignment to call it off, to sacrifice him/herself. Another comment(of which I'm not very fond) is that these are all a dream. But I think that it all would be meaningless without the reality and the sorrow it gives to you. All comes to the same, every creature in this world follows a predestined path in its life and EVERYBODY DIES ALONE...Cause he did so</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to choose another path in life? Why are we here? Donnie Darko touches upon the inertia of life and choice. I have seen this picture many times, and each time it opens new questions and it reveals new ideas birthing a new experience. I love thinking movies and this has proved to be a delectable brain food.A 6 foot rabbit leads Donnie down the fated rabbit hole. What seems as nightmares await him at every corner grasping at the threads of his being. Being is the variable and time the ever constant. Perception is a toy that being plays with, and it is never the same for any two souls.If you've ever felt the pull of choice and fate, you'll enjoy this picture.</fullReview>

The atmosphere is incredible. And the acting is top notch.Donnie Darko is based around a boy, Donnie Darko (Gyllenhal), who has illusions of a Bunny, named Frank (who is pretty darn disturbing), who says the world will end in 28 days. The next day, a plane jet engine from nowhere lands in Donnie's room. It is the beginning of the end in an incredible journey of time. The ending will knock your socks off.

		<fullReview>First off, I should say that I'm not sure if I watched the Director's Cut or the original version. I downloaded it not long ago, and the file didn't specify which version it was. Anyway, on with the review. I really didn't know what to expect from this movie, having heard many different opinions over the last little while. After watching it, I'm still not sure what I thought of it. While I didn't like his character very much, it's hard to deny that Jake Gyllenhaal gave a very good performance as the title character. Something about him just seemed out of place and strange, which suited the character well. I don't think there was a single likable character in this film, except maybe Donnies girlfriend. I don't see what everyone finds so hard to get about the ending, I thought it was a good ending, don't get me wrong, but pretty straight forward. Overall, I'd recommend seeing this one, but I wouldn't buy it. More of a curiosity than anything.8/10 PS - I did think that it was a nice touch casting real-life siblings Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal as siblings in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Modern Catcher In The Rye?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is the type of movie that should stand alone without comparisons or genres, quite simply because it's a genre bending movie. Donnie Darko pays homage to everything from theories of time travel to the coming of age struggle that has earned it titles from a Modern Catcher In The Rye to the definitive coming of age movie.The movie finds the title character Donnie trapped in suburbia, where his intense questions and huge intellect are less than welcome. While the movie does have a large section of sci-fi and thrilling plot twists, the viewer cannot ignore the poignant first love of Donnie and Gretchen, and the more personal struggles Donnie has to overcome in order to face his demons (including the giant bunny rabbit Frank).If you're looking for a movie that you can glide through, Donnie Darko is not the movie for you. It's thought provoking, an attack on the mind. Donnie Darko covers such a large scope of genres from teen romance to saving the world to atheism. Donnie Darko is a movie of questions, made to raise questions.It may be lost on an older generation, but in my experience it is a movie that appeals to the lost teen to the mature adult. The soundtrack and imagery conjure up a truly beautiful film, that is a joy to watch no matter how popular it may become.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>28 Days... six hours... 42 minutes... 12 seconds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko, a film set in angst-ridden suburbia gives a village almost like an 80's Stepford but with secrets, is one that leads you to question all conventions and boundaries set by films at this moment. As always, the change comes from an unknown, Richard Kelly who wrote and directed, with some minor parts in the editing and camera work suite too.The film itself, throws up questions, mainly existential theories such as everybody dies alone, but never actually answers any. Many would see this as a downfall to a film, but when done outside of the typical Hollywood formulaic style it works amazingly well. It throws you a resolution that doesn't give a full equilibrium, it more leaves you confused as to what went on, and leaves you wanting to know even more about this film.Jake Gyllenhaal makes a big statement about his abilities in this film, taking the seemingly 'super hero' named character of which the film is named. An ever so slightly sociopathic schizophrenic with a tendency to sleep walk. Gyllenhaal manages to take on such a crazed, scared yet unfearful character with aplomb without dropping anything about the subconscious of Donnie himself.The plot comes as hard thinking as they come. It normally lose everyone on the first watch, and the second too. It gives everyone the sense of loss of mind and sends you home re-thinking every minute detail over and over, drawing you away from the bigger picture which itself gives away all the imagery you need to see to figure the plot is not actually that testing, just a science fiction film set in an all too familiar suburban town. They key words for the film is the single quote that gives the film away, creation through destruction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It makes you stop and think. I wish more films did that.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Richard Kelly has done what some would say isn't possible in this century. He has made a film that is actually worth talking about. Donnie Darko is as open to interpretation as any film I've seen since 2001: A Space Odyssey. At least with that film you had Arthur Clarke's book to use as a reference point for explaining some of what you saw. With Donnie Darko, you just sort of have to figure things out for yourself. In this day and age, it's no wonder the film didn't make any money.Donnie Darko is a very troubled young man. He lives in what appears to be a very nice house with a loving family during the fall of 1988. I was his age then, so I feel a little connection with the young man, though I never experienced some of the oddities that he faces. Donnie is being treated by a therapist and taking meds for his emotional problems. He has been sleepwalking at night, too, and the first shot of the film shows him waking up in the middle of a road right outside his home town. The following evening, a large creature that appears to be a spooky rabbit instructs Donnie to follow him outside of his house once more. It's a good thing, because a 747 jet engine comes crashing down onto his house and through the ceiling of his bedroom. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. Where did it come from? HMMMMMM....Anyway, the rabbit tells Donnie that the world will end in approx 28 days from that evening. And the rest of the film just shows Donnie living out these next four weeks and falling further and further under the rabbit's spell. To give any more details about the film would be pointless. You simply have to watch it for yourself to see what happens. I promise you that whatever you feel about the end result, at least it will make you think, and it likely will make you want to watch the film at least once more.Kelly has a unique touch for such a young director. He didn't have a ton of $ to make the film with, but he does the best he can, and I sure hope we continue to see more from him. It's kind of scary for me to see that a guy younger than me made such a thought-provoking film.Spoiler part ahead!!!!Like Roger Ebert said, I could tell you what I think the ending is all about, but I might be wrong. It is very much open to interpretation, but here's mine: Donnie is finally happy when he knows his death will save the life of his girlfriend. We see the look of fear on each of the faces of the characters in the final montage. Not on Donnie's however. He has lived in fear his whole life, but now his death will bring him freedom from that fear. As Donnie told Jim Cunningham: We all live in fear. And we don't always have the answers. Donnie finally does, and the euphoria of his final expression proves it.Anyway, do yourself a big favor and check this one out. We need more thought-provoking films like this!!!10 of 10 starsSo sayeth the Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director's Cut Was Helpful, But Took Away Greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Review of The Director's Cut***When I first saw Donnie Darko, I thought it was so amazing, I knew I had to buy it. I also got extremely attached to the songs that would have been on the nonexistent soundtrack (except background songs). The Director's Cut added a lot of extremely useful scenes that helped me grasp some of the mystery of the movie that I didn't yet understand (like Grandma Death's book: WHY the world was coming to an end, I didn't know at first). The movie also added a lot of unimportant scenes and used pictures Donnie's eyes that didn't seem to work and mesh with the film. Frank's voice was initially creepy, but the director's cut made it too echo-y. As I said, I was extremely attached to the songs. When I turned on the first seen and heard not The Killing Moon but some other song (which I grew to like, but not nearly as much) I stared in horror. I thought that The Killing Moon fit so WELL with the first scene. So why was this imposter song here? Well, then Richard Kelly put in The Killing Moon. But he put it where Under the Milky Way should have been, a song I also loved. He put Under the Milky Way on the radio during the car scene. So why not just put The Killing Moon's replacement song on the radio? (I mean, I can't even find The Killing Moon at my library, so what do I do now?!) The Director's Cut still added a lot of great features and useful information, but it is not the perfection I hoped for. It made me wonder if I should have maybe just gotten the original. You can make your decision based on how much you love the musical score. (All 80s music, come on, Tears for Fears? It's unbeatable).</fullReview>

If so surely at the end of the movie when Donnie is in bed laughing in the real world and the engine comes through the roof and kills him there are now two identical artifacts(jet engines) in the real world now i.e. the one in his bedroom that came through the portal and the one on the plane somewhere else in the real world??

		<shortDescription>Ambiguity does not equal genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hated this film the first time I saw it. It was not a fair judgment because I hated all the hype surrounding it. And I still do. I loathe it. I need to say this right off the bat: this film is not shining brilliance. It seemed that people who loved it for its ambiguity had never seen a film like this before with a vague ending, and then labeled it as revolutionary. Which it most definitely isn't. Citizen Kane was revolutionary, The Matrix was revolutionary. Donnie Darko is unique at best.It's not hard to figure out, however, even with all this vagueness that surrounding the ending initially, that he decided to go back in time and place himself in the path of the jet engine to save the world in a selfless act of martyrdom.However, I thought the movie was clever, and anything with the use of an evil bunny rabbit makes me quite happy, so that instantly gives it at least a 5. Jake Gylenhaal (SP?!) was quite good, especially at creating this feeling of being part of a surrealistic nightmare whenever he was around Frank, the rabbit, with his attitudes and so forth. I also like how this film is a very blatant homage (or rip off? you decide) of The Last Temptation of Christ. My theory is homage because Richard Kelly inserted that film (in a way) into the movie by labeling it at the theater where Donnie and his girlfriend go see Evil Dead. Think about it: he continues his life normally, meets a girl, falls in love, and realizes that if he wants everything to work out (to save the world), then he needs to sacrifice himself, like it was intended originally by a higher power. He needs to go back, and rethink his "selfish" choice. Anyway, I'm over-analyzing this film a little too much, almost as much as my friends who are in love with it. Granted, its a very well-done film. I respect Richard Kelly for making what he seems to think of as his baby, his pet project. My gripes with the film itself are that its script is a bit iffy with a lot of the secondary characters, and to tell the honest truth, it's just not terribly compelling. I guess I leave it at this: people should really lighten up about this decent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>differences between original and directors cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i noticed a lot of differences between the original and the directors cut. one of the main differences is that in the original, after i watched it, i was stunned. i literally stared at the blank screen after the movie was over for fifteen minutes, thinking "wow. i gotta see that again to figure out what just happened." i then watched it again and again, and read lots of things people said about it online, and i finally think i got the idea of what happened. in the directors cut, it explains what is going on, little by little, so if i was to watch the movie for the first time, i would have known what happened by the time i get to the end. i feel that this addition to the movie takes away from it a little bit. i personally liked looking for more and more information about what happened, and not knowing right away. if your the kind of person that likes to think about a movie long after you watch it or watch it over and over again, i'd say go with the original. if your the kind of person who likes to watch a movie, know what is going on most of the time, and doesn't like to look up too much info online, go for the directors cut. if you want the best of both worlds, i'd definitely say watch the original, think about it and possibly watch it again, look up stuff online, and then watch the directors cut maybe a week later, or whenever. the reason i gave this movie a 9/10, is because i liked looking for info about the first, and i think this takes a little away from that, so i dropped it down to a 9, but i'd definitely give the original a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Food for thought.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was reading the message boards and i was surprised that no one took a religious view to it. I think there may be something in this interpretation of the film. I you set Donnie as being the savior and frank being the devil perhaps you can draw a few parallels. It really sunk home when i saw the other movie was the Last Temptation of Christ. It could be seen that Donnie was tempted by Frank three main times. First would of been to get out of bed, second to flood the school, and third to set fire to the house. Each affected peoples lives in a negative fashion. Each temptation further drew Donnie away from being a savior at all. The pops up the question of why would Frank want to Donnie to go back in time to save everyone. Well the therapist said that if the world ends that its will just be Donnie and frank alone. In the bible Satan is defeated. This would be the reason that Frank would not want the world to end for it would be the end of him too, hence Donnie kills Frank. I and a few guys thought then who else might symbolize people from the Bible. Well the kiddy porn guy could easily be seen as the false prophet, he of course had his following-the teacher obsessed with him. Gretchin could be seen as Donnie's follower, therefore Donnie sacrifices himself to save her life and to give every one a second chance. The therapist could be a messenger of God for she is always there to help Donnie with his troubles. At the end everyone seems to be affected by Donnies death which would explain the second chance for every one. Also a side we though that maybe that the Asian girl could perhaps be a symbol for Mary Magdalen as she is always following Donnie and has a crush on him and is rejected by all. He seems to be the only one to defend her. He also tells her things will be better for her.These are our thoughts and ideas on the movie, throw this idea around and have fun with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An amazing sci-fi film that stuns, scares and startles, amidst a creepy atmosphere that the writer-director manages to bring to the film. The mysterious and rather intriguing nature of the film is enough to drown out even the likes of David Lynch. In all technical aspects the film is finely done, especially on a visual scope, with some great special effects and excellent use of lighting. The film's screenplay is almost perfect: it injects just the amount of comic relief without neglecting what the premise of the film demands. It is a touch confusing, but still a superb film, regardless of whether or not one is able to understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If it weren't a re-release, this would be the best film of 2004</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>20 minutes has been added to screenwriter and director Richard Kelly's debut feature Donnie Darko, which was originally released two years ago.It's 1988, and while Bush and Dukakis debate the presidency, troubled teenager Donnie (Jake Gyllenhall) returns from his periodic sleepwalking to find that his bedroom has been crushed by a falling airplane engine. He begins to be visited by a 6-foot tall rabbit, Frank, who tells him he has 28 days to live. As he begins a crusade to rid the town of hypocrisy, he also meets a nice girl (Jena Malone) and is influenced by a strange book called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".Part science fiction, part teen comedy exploring disillusioned suburban America, the brilliance of Donnie Darko invokes comparison with some of the most interesting films of recent years. Like American Beauty, it delights in the beauty of small things, like Pi it depicts the strange internal life of its protagonist as it probes technical mysteries. And, as in Happiness, the social satire is razor sharp. But while Donnie Darko is more complex than any of these films, it can be appreciated on a number of different levels. Don't be intimidated, see this incredible film. *****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Darkman is back! No, not another straight-to-video sequel of 'Darkman'. I am referring to the tormented juvenile schizophrenic "Donnie Darko', who has obtained a cult following since the film's release back in 2001. This is not a sequel to 'Donnie Darko', even though that would be one dark side I would have loved to revisit. The latest cinematic release of Darko is the Director's cut of the original. Therefore, I will release my own Meezer's cut of my original film review of 'Donnie Darko'. (Meezer Cuts are in italics)Do not be afraid of the darko! Why? Because 'Donnie Darko' is one of the best and original films of 2001, and in 2004 it also made the cut. Jake Gyllenhaal is amazing as Donnie Darko. Donnie is just your average teenager who has schizophrenic visions of a demonic rabbit who tells him to flood his school and burn motivational speaker's mansions, among other things. Moreover, Frank the Rabbit (as he likes to be called) warns Donnie that the world will end in 28 days 6 hours 42 minutes 12 seconds; which is how long this revamped Meezer Cut Review will last! Just kidding! Talk about a real life rabbit test! Director Richard's Kelly debut film is, and still is, a masterpiece. Kelly is a director to watch out for in the future; even though he has not directed anything since Darko. One hit wonder anyone? I do not think that he will be left in the dark. The supporting cast of: Mary Mcdonnell, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Patrick Swayze, Jena Malone, Noah Wyle, and Drew Barrymore 'energized' the film with our bunny and Mr. Darko. So you should definitely see 'Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut ' in 1 day 1 hr 1 min 10 seconds or how long it takes you to get to your nearby store or in this case the theatre. ***** Still Excellent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many questions, too few answers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a college student in Virginia when Donnie Darko was released, I heard about how marvelous it was from every pretentious and self-aggrandizing intellectual I knew. But when even my close friends said it was a great film, I made it a Blockbuster night and watched it one summer evening. After certain scenes, I would skip back and watch them again, to make sure I grasped all of the themes going on in the film. And there are A LOT of things going on in this movie, too many, in fact, to make a clear statement about any of them. This is writer/director Richard Kelly's biggest mistake.First of all, I didn't like Jake Gyllenhaal in this movie. He seemed to be weird for the sake of being weird, and his character lacked motivation to do anything short of acting on impulses. I suppose that was the point of his psychological problems, but I was more disappointed in Gyllenhaal's portrayal than the actual content of the character of Donnie. The rest of the cast did a serviceable job, Mary McDonnell and Holmes Osborne did a great job as Donnie's parents, but the roles played by Patrick Swayze and Drew Barrymore seem somewhat transparent; they are unimportant parts given weight by the actors' fame. I did like Noah Wyle as one of the professors who tries to relate to Donnie.What the film tries to do, and succeeds on a certain level, is dissect middle-class life in the suburbs of Virginia. Growing up here, I can tell you that some of the elements to this movie hit very close to home. I would have loved for Kelly to cut out some of the external things going on in the film, and really focus on Donnie, his relationship with Gretchen, and what was going on with Frank and Grandma Death. But he tries to do too much, tackle it all at once, and squeeze it into 100 minutes. Everything gets attention; wealth, religion, middle-class society, youth and innocence, the nature of man, even the Washington Redskins. But what does 'Sparkle Motion' have to do with what's going on with Donnie? What does Jim Cunningham have to do with Donnie? There are some good moments including Jim, but it's just another thing to muddle the picture.This movie is original, and thought-provoking, and that is always a good thing. But the actual content of the film lacks a direction or an edge that really makes it great. I'd be interested to see what Kelly's future projects are like. But as for 'Donnie Darko,' it's just not a complete film in my mind. If you can set aside the cult hype and accept that it's not the greatest film of all-time, you will definitely take something away from it.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most other time-travelers, I never saw this flick in the theater. I saw it surface in the record store where I used to work and was attracted to it because some dweeb told me it had an evil rabbit in it. Well, Lord knows I'm all into evil rabbits, so I decided I had to see it. Then all of a sudden there was a renewed interest in the film when Gary Jules' "Mad World" took off and it was soon playing on my satellite dish (not the actual dish, but the t.v. it was connected to). Well sonofabitch, it isn't just about an evil rabbit, the rabbit isn't really evil, it's just an artistic lad in a bunny suit who gets shot and sucked into a time-portal. Well, that's fantastic! This isn't just a teenage "Jake is so cute" film, I like the fact that it doesn't make any damn sense unless you go off your pills like young Donnie. Too many people are trying to explain this movie and that ruins the magic of it. I really like Richard Kelly's vision here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over the top and overrated, but still entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" is the perfect example of a rookie filmakers attempt to capitalize on the success of "Memento" and other odd movies, and writing a script thats unbelievable yet imaginative. I have been told it's totally impossible to understand unless you go on the internet. What if you dont have the internet to reference. Yep, your screwed. Well not screwed, but you certainly miss out.It's the story of a kid who is involved in a near death experience, and continues to live in a paranormal life. The acting is marvelous, the dialogue is witty. It's actually a great film until Kelly decides to go crazy and makes up some stupid stuff about time travel. It could have been a great film, with great characters, but instead became a good film with great characters. No doubt its entertaining, but it becomes hard to sit through.If you like films that are different, and films you have to have a reference book to completely understand its for you. But this movie tries to hard to be different, which ultimately hurts its quality, but apparently not its large following and surprise success.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i think what makes a film memorable are the things you know are in there but missed the first time. details are important in weaving a tapestry as rich in detail as donnie darko. i enjoyed this movie for the attention the filmmakers gave to the detailed nature of it's storyline. lot's of juicy little tidbits to find on repeated viewings. and that's what makes a memorable film a great film. worthiness and even the taunting necessity of repeated viewings. the writer-director here has laid a bread crumb trail to the heart of his vision. each small detail is a treasure, a light bulb and a gift to be unwrapped. finding a new one changes the landscape every time you watch this movie. and there are lots of them. very very clever little movie. maybe not profound but definitely extremely insightful and loaded with lovely little treasures.</fullReview>

Romance, Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller black comedy. but i think it can be summed up in one word. LIFE. The film is unpredictable and ultimatly backwards. It deals with fate time the paths people lead the expiriances we have and death. It is an extreme form but how can it not be a film about life.Simply watchable, simply funny, simply complex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, i'd recomend it for people around the age of 15.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen many different comments on the film. And there is the people who say its one of the worst movies they have ever seen in there lives. In addition, some who say it's the best or close to it. I personally think that the people who find this movie a bad movie have no understanding of what the movie is about. It seems like people almost haven't seen the movie. I have to admit it took me a few times of watching it again to get it. But then again you need to wonder about the movie and what it means to want to watch it a second time. For the people who didn't understand the movie and didn't watch it again for the second time around. I recommend you do watch it again and just sit there to try to fully understand the true meaning of the film. If you don't get it then I guess your too far off or just to stupid to understand what the film is about and how rare it is to find a movie of such great work. I personally have never seen a film that could make you wonder, what does this all mean. I mean really what kind of film does that to people anymore. I am really awaiting Kelly's next film. It looks just as good, I believe its titled "Knowing" it looks quite interesting. This man is a Genius for being able to write something of such wondering and at such a concept few will understand. This film, If not already, should be a cult classic. Another thing to add on. I may be only 15 years old and I might not be getting the full understanding of this movie. But From what I think Its a great movie and for the people who have only given it once chance, you should really take another chance at it and watch it over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needs more explaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert! I am half on liking this movie, and half on really hating this movie. So let me explain:Hate: I hate this movie because it is poorly explained. It is a convoluted plot based on metaphysics and abnormal psychology. Donnie is a schizoid and is loosing touch with reality, so be introduced to the bunny. Well, this goes along with the poorly described bit, but the bunny is never really explained. I found the bunny to be annoying. I was praising that the death of the bunny would expedite itself quicker. Towards the end, I found myself also glad that Donnie was killed. I told you this was the hate part of my review.Like: I like this movie because it is not your typical crap that Hollywood likes the throw out at conformist America (see T3 for example). This movie is an emotional rollercoaster and does require a bit of intelligence to understand the plot. This, however, is difficult because; starting a movie, going throw a fake dream, and ending up at the beginning of the movie doesn't evolve into a continuous and moving forward plot. It is a mobius strip. It ended were it started.I liked the fear component of the movie. I think fear is a limiting factor for a lot of people and basically tells me that humans are scared of being alone. I did like this subplot about fear being the price of our instrument.I give this movie an 8/10 for being different and quasi-thought provoking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very original, thoughts provoking concoction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start with this: This is a must see movie. Forget what you have heard or read about Donnie Darko and just go and get the DVD release. The suggested atmosphere is: a dark room (you should let the moon light in though), lying on your bed (preferably alone), leave the usual popcorn or snack in the kitchen this time and get ready to experience something original.I am not gonna tell you that I could dig the whole concept because I couldn't and even if I did, that wouldn't necessarily be the right answer. This is one of those: Vanilla Sky, Mullholland Dr., Lost Highway, Dark City and etc. kind of movies that wont provide you with the answer; it will make you work for it. Yes, this one requires some heavy lifting and that's the beauty of it. There are so many films out there where you can tell the end by just seeing the title or the leading actors. Those are not fun and we all know that. Well this one is different.I would say the plot was toooo complicated. Trying to make something really different and big, Richard Kelly (director and writer) got lost himself and us into the story. He could have simplified the script a bit to mine modest opinion. Because of the great number of different stories and characters throughout the movie the end fell short. It was of course impossible to comprise all the pieces into a 5 min meaningful ending. Kelly should have stick to a bit less of characters and slightly reduce the number of different stories and ideas. Just a bit. Notwithstanding, the whole cast was brilliant, especially the Darko ?es family. Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie) delivers a great performance. I can?ft imagine any better way to play this role. He is the sole of the film. Amazing. Memorable. Mary Mc Donnell (his mother) was my second best with the greatest line in the movie: asked by her son ?ghow does it feel like to have a Wacko for a son?h she answers ?git feels, wonderful?h. Jena Malone (Gretchen) is also perfect for the role. And the whole 80?fs sentiment with the soundtrack definitely pulled some strings.And at the end my understanding of the movie is: don?ft try to explain everything simply because you can?ft. There are certain things that cannot be explained and are better left such. And when you think, it won?ft change a thing even if we could so because not everything has to do with reasoning. Human nature. This is one thing. Second thing has to do with not waiting somebody else to provide you with the right answers. Find your own answer to that movie as well. And I wanted to finish with something about sacrifice and ordinary people but it will be better to leave it unsaid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" is one of those films you'd say to yourself, "I'm not looking at that" but because nothing else is on, you catch it. You'll think you know what's going on. You think you'll know what it's about. Don't pre-judge, just take a look. When you do, you'll kick yourself for not knowing about it sooner.This little film was done well. It is a smart film, I really liked the elements of it and the theme of it. Many reviewers said enough about this film so I wont add more story elements to it, all I will add to their wonderful reviews is for you to watch it, at least once.This is a film where the writer/director will go on to do either more great things and be a strong writer and/or director in this decade, or as a few others in his shoes prior did, get the old "Hollywood Shaft". I hope its the former and not the latter.I recommend this film highly. Go rent it, or catch it on Cable. You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, I know there are going to be a great amount that tell me "Man, you just didn't get it! The film is over yoru head!" Well they would be right. I am sick of films being made for the sole purpose of trying to pull off a Keyser Soze! I will give the film credit on atmosphere and the "Evil Dead" cameo. Other than that this film was a flop. I undestand the basic plot, but I am not a fan of scientific BS. I usually don't warm up to science fiction, but at least science fiction has the integrity to let the viewer understand the fiction part. This film, however actually tries to make us believe that things that don't happen could happen. I understand most of you are gonna defend it saying that it is meant to be taken fictionally, but I am sorry any film that chooses science as a tool for rebellion has simply lost touch with reality. Here in Donnie Darko, that is what we have. The plot is science versus whomever is content. Well, factually I think the world needs to be a little more apathetic to what we can do, because in the end everything we do is just everything we have done. There is no honor in pointless scientific advances. Especially when the science world is still divided on the idea of "Monkey Man Evolution". Here's a little pointer you can't get from point A to point C without point B. Point B is a missing link and so is the gap between Monkey and Man. Science weirdos get a life and quick feeding us garbage like this trash can flick and others such as "The Matrix". All these films are, is "Plan 9 From Outer Space" with a bigger budget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not saying that it's the worst movie that's ever made, but it's nothing short of a teenage romance film disguised as a science fiction.One big flaw of Donnie Darko is that the protagnist Donald Darko has all the luck in the world as a somewhat unpopular guy in school is all of a sudden hooked up with the prettiest girl in school (mind you, the pretty girl is portrayed as a loner coming from a dysfunctional family who seeks help that's also a brainiac). If you are a science freak who wants to dissect into the world of physics and try to figure out how the time-traveling which appeared in the film works, it's all up to you, because in the end nothing will be earned. Also, the movie is really LONG.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame, shallow, "American Beauty" wannabe on Valium.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the worst pieces of cinema crap to come out of the U.S. in some time and it took me just 5 min. to notice. All you got to do is watch Donnie's family. To give you an idea, imagine the AB Burnhams but with Lester having married Ricky's mother instead of Carolyn and having become like her. Say, what kind of a father sits, laughing meekly while his kids ping-pong F.U.s all over the diner table? What kind, when his wife tells him that their son just called her a bitch, just shrugs his shoulders: "You're not a bitch but now you're bitching". So, you see it: the writing is amongst the worst you'll ever see, from beginning to end. As for the characters, they are the lamest, shallowest ever, starting with same father; most of them just cardboard cuts. The acting goes from so-so to putrid--with special mention to said father--but you can't really blame the actors; the cinematography is ordinary. Now, a movie is in deep trouble when, already in the beginning, the filmmaker, realizing he got nothing to say or show, proceeds to pad the clunker with assorted dialog; with inane, out of place, political references; with meaningless visual gimmicks--such as people suddenly jumping into fast motion mode when walking in corridors, for no reason at all. And what about the subplot of the Asian girl, what was its meaning? Was it that ethnics have feelings too? Was it that fat people are beautiful? Whatever message they tried to convey there it was lost, as the only way said girl is able to relate to others is by shouting "Chut up!" Putrid script, bad directing.If AB works so well it is simply because its characters are perfectly defined; crafted all with strong personal features, from the very beginning, and so they interact with each other in cohesive, unequivocal fashion, all which give the movie a solid structure, a clear direction?so much so that that for itself is enough to carry the whole movie for almost an hour. No such luck with this dog. Characters here are dispersed all over, lost in a desert, walking in random circles, with no purpose at all. See for ex. how flimsy Donnie's connection with his sisters is; you may even say there's none at all. They just happen to live under the same roof. And see how the parents' couple works--rather doesn't. There's no tension there, no complicity, no intimacy whatsoever; that couple is just as phony &amp; contrived as the rest in the movie. Donnie's family is obviously not one, by any means, but just strange, unrelated people who were picked one by one, in different places, and brought to this table. There's no structure or cohesion in their group; no consistency in their chats, no common thread, no follows up. That's not a real family, just members of the "Hear What Random Thought Just Crossed My Mind" Club in one of their meetings. And you can say the same of the school teachers, the students, even of Donnie's romantic couple.DD contaminates everything it touches, it makes it shallow, puerile. It may contain also a record number of dumb lines: Ex., when teacher Barrymore tells an attractive new student to sit next to the boy she finds the cutest--sure, teachers love nothing more than creating causes for distraction in their classes! (BD's teacher is supposed to act daring, innovative, but it only manages to appear dumb &amp; clueless: she challenges every authority in school and then...she's shocked when getting fired!). Or when Donnie's dad advises him to say F.U. to anyone who annoys him--exactly what all fathers advice their sons to do, to succeed in life. Then, I imagine, when kids coming of age reunite, they talk of their traumas, hopes, dreams; but here what they do? They talk of the sex life of Smurfs!...while laughing at a poor senile old woman (And what about that masturbating mental patient?).The worst thing about DD is that it glorifies mental illness. See, the only ones here having even limited access to the mechanisms of Time, Life, are a senile old lady and a psychotic kid. The rest, what we fools call "normal people"--teachers &amp; parents--are dumb, clueless. This twisted idea is presented in a most grotesque, manipulative, way in the Donnie/Mrs. Farmer exchange on Love vs. Fear. What's so insidious is the fact that it's the borderline psychotic the one presenting the voices of reason; a scheme repeated later in relation to Swayze's overacted preacher. See how while Donnie presents a reasonable, logical POV, "normals" in the audience appear lost, clueless. It's impossible to find a more cynical way of presenting mental illness under a positive light.But on a pure cinematographic way the worst manipulative feature of DD is the gratuitous inclusion of cartoon villains who will do terrible things with the only purpose of making the hero look good. That's their only use here; and the best way for us of recognizing putrid writing. The obvious ones are Mrs. Farmer and Donnie's Nemesis amongst the students: a cartoon bad villain who'll randomly jump out of nowhere, when we least expect, for no reason at all, just to show us he's the villain and Donnie the hero. The best metaphor for a flick that comes out of nowhere and there it goes back, a zero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This cult classic did not have such an impact on myself as clearly it has on the cult following. Whilst being dark, mysterious and interesting with the tone of the film...there was quite a lot wrong with the film. There was quite a frequent use of strong language which was unnecessary and the sexual references was not pleasant at all and i found that really off putting. Those aspects of the film put me off and prevented me to enjoy the film. Also the character of Frank was quite disturbing. The few positives that can be said about the film is that Jake Gyllenhaal was quite impressive in this film as he manages to give the performance of a very troubled teenager. The ending is imposing though, very emotional and interesting. It is also very confusing as it is open to many interpretations. Overall, not worth the watch as even though there were inklings of promise the immoral aspect of the film really put me off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie contains a lot of interesting stuff, without actually being interesting in itself. It's a confused collection of often-clever scenes, but no kind of masterpiece taken as a whole. True, the 'asides' are frequently entertaining... discussions of literature, weird confrontations that don't play out the way you expect, nice bits of characterization... (Bizarrely, I found Drew Barrymore's character the most interesting and likable.) And, in fairness, the acting is uniformly good.But overall, the movie just doesn't add up to anything. The ending is a kind of Twilight Zone cop-out - trite if you take it literally, offensively meaningless otherwise. Is Donnie nuts, or is he not? By the end, who cares? The schizoid behavior becomes almost random after a while. The giant rabbit starts out sinister, then becomes laughable through repetition, eventually ends up just plain uninteresting.This sort of material can work, but it's not enough to just be weird for weirdness' sake. If you want to be surreal on a story level, you really should have something to say on a philosophical level. This movie has nothing on either level. You get the strong suspicion its creators couldn't quite think of a brilliant statement to make, so they just muddied the waters in the hopes that the audience would read in some brilliance on its own.Sorry: 'murky' is NOT the same as 'deep' (except to those who really don't GET 'deep.') And 'artsy' is NOT the same as 'artistic.' By all means, see this film if you're curious and have time to waste - but otherwise, don't feel you've missed anything important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reasons as to why 'Donnie Darko' is so acclaimed as it explained to me via other viewers seem all in all quite relevant and understandable. Its a movie that is opting to go in a unique direction and has moments that leave you gasping. There are three major problems with this film however, and unfortunately they far outweigh any intrigue or thrills it may provide. One: Its characters are so disconnecting to viewers, its almost like watching group of characters from a Wes Anderson movie in a serious film, it dawned on me about twenty minutes into the screening that the people in the movie were so uninteresting and so lifeless that I couldn't care less what was to happen to them. Two: The story, as inventive as it is, it is really quite basic and it seems so much has been done to draw it out, by filling the film with cheap subplots about high school/ country town/ American life, not tot say that good things can't be done with the as for mentioned, but they are like the characters quite uninteresting. Three: the major one, cinema as an art should be timeless, it should be able to be revisited again and again and still in someway impact its viewers, 'Donnie Darko' is a film that needs only to be viewed once(even those who like it agree here). It is essentially a cheap present, a one hit wonder on the pop charts, and unsustainable work that cannot bring people back to it and offering something new at each showing.</fullReview>

You will find a plot around Time travel, Changing Destiny, Facing your inner demons, there are so many ways to interpret it....I will recommend this move to anyone looking for a new, unique, and fun(even funny) film even with its R rating...Good job Donnie.....Good job...xZx</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a great movie, i think its the type best enjoyed alone so you have no distractions and can become in a deeper &amp; more questioning state of mind when watching it. I felt as though i related to Donnie throughout which is why i think i liked it so much, how it portrays you're average normal high student on a deep and alternative level, even if he doesn't dress particularly different than any other students, which is somewhat how i perceive myself.Can i say Donnie Darko has changed my life in any way?, i don't really know yet, i think i will need to watch it again to decide. But it did introduce me to one of my now favourite songs "Mad World" by Gary Jules, which fitted the movie perfectly, a better soundtrack couldn't have been chosen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, the first time I watched this movie, I didn't understand it a lot, but I was amused by idea of a troubled teenager, who is communicating with a large bunny about time traveling and end of the world. But second time I was really enjoying in this movie, I understood story more than before. Donnie Darko is dark, depressed and mystery movie about Donnie, a problematic kid, who one night starts to communicate with a large bunny Frank, who told him that the world will end in just few days. I can't explain the whole point of the movie, because it's really impossible to interpret it in one way. I like this movie, because it allows you to make your own interpretation and it's a big possibility that you want understand a lot by viewing it for the first time. I really adored deep philosophy of time travel, unique mix of teenage drama and sci - fi thriller, with a lot of bizarre images and black humor. Jake Gylenhaal is excellent as troubled Donnie, he's really convincing and his lines are excellent (the monologue about the Smurfs is excellent). Overall, Donnie Darko is great piece of work, a unique sci - fi movie without expensive special effects and mutant aliens attacking the earth. It's disturbing, confusing, funny and tragic at the same time.Donnie Darko is wonderful mess, a "David Lynch" movie for teenagers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cant believe it. The first time that I watched Donnie Darko the original version I was amazed. It combined a great amount of scientific and philosophical speculation with a wonderful cast and great filming technique. The second time I watched it, I watched the directors cut and all I have to say is that they destroyed the movie. I understand that a directors cut is supposed to bring back scenes that were deleted for enthusiasts of the movie to enjoy but does it have to completely destroy the movie? I guess it doesn't help that I didn't realize I bought the directors cut but the pacing was so destroyed, and the movie seemed to draaaaaaaag on forever. If you are going to bring back scenes make sure they at least serve a purpose! And furthermore, what is with completely destroying the climax of the movie with all the screens and fireworks?? It was such a subtle, beautiful movie before they gunked it all up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Beauty+ Catcher in the Rhye+ a genius named Richard Kelly= Donnie Darko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a teenager or remember your years as a confused teenager living in an upper middle class suburb, you probably will feel identified with Donnie Darko. Yes, I think that it is important to focus in the time travel aspect of the movie; but the reason that made this movie become one of my favorites is that it portrays perfectly what a confused teenager feels like: afraid of growing up because he feels that all adults are hypocrites (similar to the way Holden Caulfield felt in J.D.Sallinger's "The Catcher in the Rhye"), afraid of being alone and not understanding the purpose of existence nor the existence of a God (as portrayed in judeo-Christian religions).Another aspect that is very well portrayed is the relationships among adolescents; and between adolescents and adults. The deep relationship that Donnie and Gretchen (his new girlfriend) have is represented perfectly, with all the psychological complexities that exist between humans. Gretchen is a girl that seeks for protection (for she has lead a tough life: his stepfather stabbed his Mom) and finds it in Donnie. The relationship couldn't possibly be more inspiring.Other aspects of the suburban life portrayed it he movie are the way in which people live. Some are forced to conceal who they are because they are afraid of being judged. (This aspect of the movie is very similar to what happens in the suburb in which Sam Mendes' "American Beauty" takes place).And where did I leave a six-foot rabbit, time travel, a jet engine that falls into a house, "The Philosophy of Time Travel"...well I don't want to mess with it for, if you haven't seen the film yet, I would probably spoil it for you. Another great aspect of the movie is that it can be interpreted in endless different ways, and they all are perfectly correct. The interpretation is as subjective as the way a confused teenager perceives the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko a winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This quirky film may go in the history books as a cult classic, but it is far more than that and shouldn't be shoved into some special interest niche. Jake Gyllenhaal's interpretation of the benighted Donnie Darko is nothing short of brilliant, and he is supported by a first-rate cast. The screenplay is straightforward enough to make the story completely believable. This direction is tight and focused. There's no ambiguity of purpose in how Donnie's story is told. While I was appropriately impressed with Jake's Gyllenhaal's performance in "Brokeback Mountain" - and it was mighty stunning - it's "Donnie Darko" which has made a me a Jake Gyllenhaal fan. This man is no pretty-faced flash in the pan, though it has to be admitted that he's a handsome dude. We will be seeing more of him in the future.</fullReview>

Just like for Shining I couldn't stop seeing it time after time. Because I have a desire to search out what exactly horrified me. I think fear is one of the most precious human feelings. When people fear that's because he sees the truth that he never saw. Only those shallow-headed would try to smile all day and shout "I don't fear any more!" It also has a wonderful and pure British soundtrack that features some cool New Wave/Post Punk bands. Maybe the best entertainment film one could ever make when he has only four million dollars to spend in current times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting, but, ultimately, disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoiler Jet engines falling from the sky, a demonic rabbit and a horrible performance by Drew Barrymore are all featured in this semi-weird, slight and unconvincing film. It's watchable, there's no doubt about that. It's also, from time to time, creepy. DD is also a self-negating film. That in and of itself isn't necessarily a bad thing, but, it's Superman-like ending(remember Superman flying around the earth to reverse time to save Lois Lane) cancels out most of the film. If only it could've cancelled out just the parts in which Drew Barrymore appears. Ah, now that would've been something worth applauding.After watching the film, I found myself thinking about how the writer failed to fully incorporate some of the supporting characters into DD's storyline. The puritanical Kittie Farmer(the one who teaches Donnie and the other boys about FEAR/LOVE)is completely unnecessary. She could've been cut out of the entire film and it wouldn't have made any difference. She doesn't figure in Donnie's story in any significant way. His confrontations with her and Patrick Swayze's informercial creep are forced and irrelevant to the central story - that being Donnie's hallucinations of a demonic rabbit, his obsessions with time travel via Roberta Sparrow and his relationship with the new girl in class(Jena Malone).Of course, it's clear that the writer/director meant DD also as a satire of Regan-era America. That's all well and good. I agree with his critiques(superficial as they may be)but what, exactly, does all that book banning and info-mercial idiocy have to do with the demonic rabbit's apocalyptic talk or DD's desire to find a way to time travel or his love for the Jena Malone's character? And who cares if Ms. Pomeroy(Drew Barrymore - wow, really bad) loses her job? And what were those two creeps from DD's school doing in Roberta Sparrow's cellar anyway? Apparently waiting for DD and his girlfriend to show-up so they could threaten to kill them and, ultimately, put Jena Malone's character in a place where she would get run over by a car being driven by a guy named Frank in a demonic bunny suit so that DD could then travel back in time and commit suicide to save her.Another thing - when DD travels back in time and offs himself to save his girlfriend, he also, inadvertently, frees Patrick Swayze's character from jail, which, I guess, means that he can continue viewing his kiddie porn collection. Way to go DD!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Referring back to the title of this entry, 'people are too stupid', the sort of people who hate this movie and think that it's crap are the product of the Hollywood revolution. Those who go to the movies just for explicit violence, romance, and sex.Donnie Darko is about none of these things, at least not explicitly. It is a journey of discovery, exploring the nature of fate, and whether all our lives are predefined by a higher power, be it God or whoever. Donnie avoids his fate, and so the world ends, when he goes back and dies at his proper time, things are better in the world. 'Everybody has a time to die' as the film says.For those who don't see why Gretchen must die at the end, here's my theory. Donnie loves Gretchen, he doesn't want her to suffer, so by going back he saves her, sacrificing himself. People's lives are improved, when things happen according to His (God's) plan.I think that in the new reality there is a sense of Déja-vu, Donnie's psychriatrist wakes up in a cold sweat, and Gretchen's pause when Donnie's neighbour asks 'Did you know him?'The film is surreal, not least the giant bunny rabbit, and the music is poignant, especially 'Mad World' originally by 'Tears for Fears' performed exquisitely by Gary Jules and (Micheal Andrews - i think?).I think this film is a masterpiece, and extremely thought provoking, although I have only seen it twice, I think I have a better understanding of it than some of the big-wig complainers on here. It really doesn't help when you categorically slag off a piece of film history before you understand it, if you don't get it damn well watch it again until you do.:steps off his soapbox:10/10 a fantastic film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very good movie, sadly spoiled for me by expectation. I had heard a lot about this movie before I ever saw it. People rubbed their chins and furrowed their brows, and spoke of "interpretation" and "meaning". Oh, I thought, I must investigate this apparent brain-teaser of a movie for myself, and so I purchased the (non-directors cut) DVD, some years after its theatrical release and for a bargain-basement price.It is a thoroughly good watch, but where was this intellectual mystery I had heard so much about?? And so I watched it again, fearing that I had completely missed some deeper "meaning". Alas, I still failed to find any existential depth. I searched the web, and found a great deal of fan material, all of which seemed to insist that there was some sort of ineffable and profound message hidden in DONNIE DARKO, that only repeated viewings, microscopic scrutiny and intense intellectual and spiritual interpretation would reveal.No. I'm afraid it was not to be. With Donnie Darko, what you see, is indeed, what you get; A bold, and actually quite effective effort, by a very young movie maker, to bring us a twisting sci-fi fable. Just because some areas of the movie appear veiled in ambiguity, doesn't mean they hide within them some incommunicable truth. It just means that its a work of fiction, and as such suffers from unavoidable inconsistencies, inherent in such flights of fancy. Its not the real world, its not factual, it doesn't obey the natural laws of physics.Instead, we are presented with a fleeting and very spurious stab at a scientific explanation of "time-travel" and "parallel" universes , i think intended to baffle and misdirect the lay-audience into crediting the story with more intellectual substance than it truly deserves. Dropping in key-phrases like "Einstein-Rosen Bridge", (incidently, an inappropriate reference in the context of the movie plot), does not undo the utter gibberish contained within "The Philosophy of Time-Travel"; the book around which the plot is structured.(As an aside, I would like to point out that, although some respected physicists have theorised on the idea of time-travel, it really is little more than a romantic notion, that some scientists have had fun with over the years. Infinitely more exciting than visiting our ancestors in a DeLorean, is the simple and amazing fact that we all "travel through time" every moment of our lives!!)The only aspects of the movie that requires any "interpretation" is this; Is Donnie imagining the events, or is the spectre of Frank "real" within the fabric of the story? Either answer is a satisfactory explanation for a movie of this sort, and neither embellishes or detracts from Donnie's experiences, or our sympathy with him.There are a few, somewhat, clumsy and sweeping references made to spiritual truth. Such as questioning the concepts of free-will, and does a benevolent deity care about us, but these references are so brief and superficial, and are in no way discussed by the characters in any depth, so it would be wrong to suggest the movie is in the least bit soul-searching.Instead what we have, is a lovingly crafted "Tale-To-Astonish", nicely written, shot with care and affection on a modest budget, and rather well acted too. Its easy to see why Jake Gylenhaal has become a hot-property of late, he exhibits craft and a screen presence beyond his years. I will go so far as to say, without his charming and eerie performance at its core, this movie would never have received the attention that it has.No. This movie is not essential source-material if you're after a PhD in philosophy, but what movie is? If you want soul-searching, try reading The Tao Of Physics by Fritjof Capra. But if you want a movie with a little more substance than the usual fare, try DONNIE DARKO. Its really rather good.</fullReview>

I can't remember anything I have seen that has made me feel so many different things in two hours. I definitely laughed, almost cried, jumped out of my seat, and had to pick my jaw up off the floor more than once. The special effects done by ILM were amazing. Think of an American Beauty/Pie setting with a mix of science fiction and psychedelic undertones taking a few twists and turns that are more than unexpected, maybe even enjoyably disturbing.Do Not Miss This Movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you idea of a good movie is to see teens discussing the sex lives of smurfs, then you will find something right up your alley here. Sadly, that is about one minute of this interesting film that defies description. Is it a supernatural thriller? A comedy? Irony? A coming-of-age movie? It is all of this and none of this.Jake Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain, Proof) plays an emotionally disturbed (szichophrenic?) teen who talks to a weird rabbit that tells him the world will end in 28 days. What happens in that time is the stuff legends are made of.You will definitely not get this on the first viewing. Maybe, even after your 10th viewing, you will still be confused, but keep in mind, during this summer of endless sequels, that there has to be something that challenges you and makes you use your head for something more than placing a ball cap.There is great acting by a variety of favorites, and great lines throughout, but it is not about the actors or the lines. It's about you. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeeze, what a seriously overrated movie. OK, a few stars in it like Swayze but nothing spectacular.I think people like to say this film was good as they think it makes them look intelligent. Nothing new in this movie, painful to watch to be honest. I understand the story but found it all very very dull. Yawn factor 8/10. Americans must be rating IMDb because as a Brit I thought it sucked BIG time. Time travel, OK, interesting subject. I'm sure we all have our own idea about it if you are a thinker and are remotely interested. I was ungripped by this movie. The actors were pretty grating. Donnie Darko was annoying - dude needed a slap and pull himself together. Tacky, I should become a director or create some dross like this I'd make a fortune. If this is the stuff that turns people on I could churn garbage out like this in my sleep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Donnie Darko is bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't think of a better summary to give for this movie other than the simple fact that I didn't particularly find it good. I saw this movie a month ago. I thought I would check out the rating on IMDb and to be honest I am not surprised that this movie is rated 8.4. I expected that people would find some way to justify that this movie is entertaining. The mere fact that fans of Donnie Darko do not understand the movie, nor able explain much of it gives them the sense that they need to enjoy it.Aside from the plot holes, flash forwards/back/sideways, attempt at philosophical references, and "make your own interpretation" this movie did have a good soundtrack. I found the acting to be well given the fact that the actors probably had no idea what this movie was about. This is the only reason I gave it a 3 over a 1.*SPOILER* I usually like time travel movies and am a big fan of sci-fi, but this movie makes no attempt in letting the viewer understand the movie whatsoever. Donnie Darko fans take pride in its mindless story and its confusing ending. It's obvious the writer and director are aiming at self interpretation of the viewer and leaving them to wonder why they spent the last two hours watching this movie when they could have been cutting their toenails. Never have I seen a more overrated movie.Watch at your own risk and be warned, Donnie Darko is purely a cult flick. Don't feel betrayed (as I did) and consider the high ratings this movie has on IMDb. You'll be ready to throw the DVD across the room in an attempt to shatter it. And whatever you do, do not buy this movie before watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply beautiful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched Donnie Darko in December of 2004. I've heard a lot about the movie but I never really knew what was so great about it. I really don't know if this is a movie that you can take several different ways or not. But this is the way that I saw it: A jet engine crashes through Donnie Darko's bedroom. Some odd force, also known as Frank, had taken him out of his room so that he could survive. He meets this girl named Gretchen. She lets him not be alone. Toward the end of the movie, Gretchen gets killed and Donnie meets the real Frank. He kills Frank for killing Gretchen. There's this on going theme of time travel and everything. Well once he starts to see the world ending, his parents flight takes another turn, and travels back into the past where Donnie actually gets killed by the engine. Gretchen pulls up on her bike as they're taking Donnie out of the hose. She asks a neighbour kid about him...she didn't get the chance to know him because of the engine. in the movie she tells him something about going back and replacing all of the dark times in your life with something like a Hawaiian sunset. So in saying this, she was his sunset...beautiful and right. I really like this movie. I can't believe that I actually sat through a movie by myself. And it didn't seem that long either. I must say, this is a great movie through and through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the DVD of the original 2001 release, and found it fascinating. The story seemed very clear to me. I see the story built on the theological debate over predestination and free will. Before watching the film, I was told that it compared to various films such as "12 Monkeys", "Sixth Sense", and even "The Buterfly Effect". I saw the film to be closer to "Occurance at Owl Creek Bridge" (based on the Ambrose Bierce short story "Incident at Owl Creek Bridge"). The 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds all takes place in Donnie's dying seconds. Doonie goes from the confusion of a sleep-walking schysophrenic to total clarity. Time travel, transcedent universes, worm holes, etc. make for a great vehicle for telling a story that feeds the viewers imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film came highly recommended, but it simply did not hook me. I love movies that give me something to think about, but the actual moments of the film, the characters and dialog, have to entertain me in some way, and DD was pretty mediocre in this regard. I loved Mulholland Drive, so I clearly can enjoy movies that are puzzling, thought provoking, and fairly well outside of the mainstream. I liked some of the subplots and ideas, but overall to me this was a lackluster film. I'm surprised that it rated as highly as it did, but hey, it happens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew the script had been floating around for a while (I think I heard at one point that David Lynch was interested in directing this....?).Anyway, just saw a screening of this at the Austin Film Fest. If you enjoy surrealistic films like Terry Gilliam's movies or "Being John Malkovich" written by Charlie Kaufman with a dash of "Heathers" style sarcasm thrown infor good measure then you'll probably enjoy "Donnie Darko". I'm still on the fence about some of the writing, some of which was a tad too clever for its own good (e.g., the Graham Green references and the contrived climax involving the school thugs -- and no I didn't just give away the ending, not by a long shot!).But overall I still enjoyed this, esp. since the ending is open to multipleinterpretations and I couldn't tell where the story was going (very effective use of a time lock). Funny, quirky, and a bit dark. If that's your thing, then go for it. P.S. Keep your eyes open for Katherine Ross ("ELAINE! ELAINE!").</fullReview>

Soon, film buffs are arguing all over the place about what this or that means or symbolises, and before you know it, the words 'genius' and 'masterpiece' are being bandied about.Sorry, but for me the words have got to be 'self-indulgent' and 'crap'. I got this at a sale in my local Woolworth's for just ?2, but as far as I'm concerned, that was ?2 too much.About halfway through, I felt I'd been sitting there for at least 7 hours, so perhaps the director knows more about time distortion than Grandma Death did.</fullReview>

It is an abominably self-worshipping egotrip of the film maker, and a sel-indulgent sycophancy of those worshipping in as the "end-all, be-all" of modern filmmaking.At approximately a half-hour into this "film" (and I use that term extremely loosely), I was overwhelmed by an overpowering urge for a full frontal lobotomy... or at the very least to put out my eyes (and ears) with needles ala Oedipus to put an end to this unbearable torture session. Told in a typically hectic manner that attempts to aspire to "nouveau-filmaking" ( godhelpusall, "Tarantino-esque"), after a while you stop caring anything about the film whatsoever... Anyone and everyone no longer gives a d**n whether the movie makes any sense any longer (-- it doesn't!--) or not,After wasting hard-earned $$ on this film, someone will have to hold a gun to my head before I will even consider watching this "thing" again.Some people have said this movie will change your life. This is true. After seeing Donnie Darko, any movie you formerly considered "awful", can safely be labeled "average".Filled with cliche. Tawdry. If you demand mental stimulation, stay away from this movie at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, in short, is crap. This film offers an uninteresting set of characters (none of which have any kind of arc), juvenile direction, fairly poor acting (which is surprising, considering the talent all these people possess), and an utterly unsatisfying, i'm-trying-too-hard-to-impress-you ending. While i won't give the ending away, i must say this: after the movie's "twist" ending, i honestly wondered what on earth possessed the screenwriter, director, producers, actors, and crew to actually make this movie. There are few endings i absolutely hate, but this film tries too hard to create a dramatic tension by deconstructing reality within the film, then invalidates itself by copping-out of any kind of resolution--which isn't entirely accurate, given that the tension is never really there. At the end, if you think about the ending of the movie, you too should gape in wonder at the awe-inspiring pointlessness and stupidity of an ending that retroactively invalidates your entire viewing of the film. So, i recommend you skip it, and get your root canal instead--i guarantee the pain of root canal work will actually benefit you more in the end than this piece of crap, and it'll probably be less painful to boot.</fullReview>

The only things I can say about "Donnie Darko" are this: The most disappointing points of the film are the "we're-so-cool,-we're-in-the-90's-and-we-live-in-California--(FLASHBACK:90120whenIwas inJr.High)--and-we-go-to-a-school-where-we-have-to-wear-uniforms" attitude.

		<shortDescription>Most Overrated Movie on IMDb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Completely and totally overrated.Disjointed, silly plot, poor cinematography, plot holes big enough to drive a truck through, it is the most over-rated and over-intellectualized movie I've ever seen.Save yourself some time: A teenager who fears death above all things, dreams of his impending death and comes to the epiphany during this dream sequence that death is nothing to fear.Now, that's not the explanation the director gives, but I'm not even sure the director understands his own movie. There's a huge plot hole at the outset of the movie that he tries to explain his way around, but a plot hole is a plot hole is a plot hole. Notice in the trivia that Kubrick passed on this film, and there's darn good reasons.That's it. Don't get distracted by the "time warp/paradox" discussions on the message board, the "time corruption" plot point is simply a construct for Donnie to accept his fate without fear.The concept is novel, the execution is horrific.The director tried to out-Kubrick Stanly Kubrick and make a story with it's own peculiar mythology (which gets tedious over-explanation during the movie), but this director missed by a mile.Any movie which relies on it's primary schema and plot point, a book which is explained in the movie, which **explains** the movie, well, is cheap and lazy film-making. When the movie got to the part wherein the viewer is asked to read the text of the book on the screen, I thought "no, please, they're not going to do that!!" but there it was. If you think you can buy into that type of film, then give it a try. I couldn't buy it.Good performances all round and not a bad concept, but lousy lousy lousy execution. Very clearly, there were valid reasons Kubrick chose NOT to make this movie.I rated it 1. I would rate it -1 if that were available as a choice.</fullReview>

O'k here is the problem with the ending... if his Mom's plane didn't crash, then where did the jet engine come from?????? So none of the rest of the movie makes sense. I liked the actors, the script was out there, but I was willing to go with it, but the ending ruined the entire movie. Teen angst is great for a movie, but the ending eliminated the teen angst, since the teen was dead all of the time anyway. There have been sooo many time travel movies made, you really have to go the extra mile to make a time travel movie work. The ending lost that extra mile. I think the Writer/Director just had no real ending for the movie, so he just pulled this ending from his butt and explained it as new and different. It wasn't. It was done in the 80's on the TV show Dallas. Remember the whole Bobby-wasn't-dead-it-was-just-a-dream season? Or the ending to Newhart? It just twisted it to he didn't live, but was dead the whole time. Very lame. Too bad, because it had a very good cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a terrible "movie." And I use the phrase "movie," because this... thing... was lacking in many of the elements that make something a movie. Elements like plot, or character development, or even a sense that what you are watching is more than random images flashing by the screen.Without adding any spoilers, it is sufficient to say that this is a 2 hour collection of moving images about an emotionally (and probably mentally) disturbed high school kid, suffering from a serious bout of teenage angst. And, like most teens, he is angry, (prohibited word describing carnal desires), and thinks he is smarter than everyone. Of course, as this is a movie about self-important teenage angst, it would not be complete without various acts of senseless destruction. And, no doubt, to pander to the large demographic of angry teens spending their parents' money, this particular angry, (prohibited word describing carnal desires), self-important teen is gifted with special powers (for reasons with no explanation). The end product is a disjointed collection of scenes that will no doubt appeal to angry teens everywhere by playing on that deep desire they have to think they're special, not just obnoxious and annoying. Which, if you waste any time watching this movie, you will likely find ironic, given the character of Jim Cunningham. (Unintentional, self-deprecating irony.)Sadly, while you may hear this "movie" described as deep and thought provoking, this is probably from some dark, angst ridden teen who wouldn't know a deep thought if he or she was drowning in one. The only thought this "movie" provoked was whether or not this actually qualifies as a movie. It does not.Do yourself a service, and watch an "adult" flick instead. Every bit as "deep" and "thought provoking," but at least with porn you'll enjoy yourself... and probably have a more productive time to boot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie has become harder to appreciate, what with jake's rising status as the new heart-throb, which has resulted in this movie's post theatrical boom. i personally can't stand him, and i think that he is a one-dimensional actor, but this was the first time i had seen his only act, so i appreciated it at the moment. as for the film itself, it is all over the map, not sure what it wants to be, possibly trying to play itself off as a movie that is above the average viewers intelligence. it's funny that most people who really enjoy this film are under the age of 18. one of the most unnecessary elements is the setting, which is the late 1980's. apart from a few bush/dukakis remarks, and a reference to "married, with children", nothing is 80's about the look of the characters (especially gyllenhall). with that out of the way, some of the issues tackled in this film are well thought out, and you'll find that to be even more true if you watch the deleted scenes. truthfully, this should have been re-edited into a directors cut for dvd, because no one saw this in the theaters anyway. at some point i started to notice a similarity to "the last temptation of christ", and much to my surprise, the director put that title on the marquee of the theater that they watch "evil dead" in. since it is supposed to be some sort of fright night double feature, it is obvious that the director is showing us that he was influenced by this picture. the ending is very similar, but comparing this nobody loser of a kid to jesus christ might seem a bit of a stretch. this brings me to my final point. while this movie has many many high points, and i do give it a nine out of ten, no one cares AT ALL about any of the characters in it, ESPECIALLY donnie. here is the director's true downfall, and it is what he will need to improve upon with further pictures. otherwise, he'll have just been a flash in the pan, much like our good mr. gyllenhall is turning out to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful movie alert! Beware!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't possilbly see what's so good about this movie. It was just total nonsense. The script was poorly written, some idiotic exaggerations made every possible role a disaster. The main character was the worst of all, he just... didn't fit! I couldn't really tell about the actors' performances, the script was so horrible. What could save a movie like this? A good storyline perhaps? But no. The story was much much worse. Especially because it uses ideas from Stephen Hawking in a disgustingly abusive manner. I can't help but mention this, some may not have understood the movie and thought it was deep or something, but that's not the case: "To travel through time, you must travel faster than the speed of light and then find a wormhole", this was claimed to be found in Hawking's book, but what it really says it that it's IMPOSSIBLE to travel faster than the speed of light and wormholes have NEVER been found. And the idea about having a liquid timeline growing out of your stomach... do I really need to say anything? So, in conclusion... an awful movie with an awful story, definitely worth a 1. The only movie I've ever seen worth a 1. Not even funny, like "Battlefield Earth".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw how high Donnie Darko's rating was, I decided to see it. It was strange because I had heard nothing about it, and after seeing it, I can understand why. Donnie Darko was by far, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It looked like a made for tv movie, only with worse acting. The cast is full of a bunch of no-bodies, so they threw it Drew Barrymore, Pat Swayse, and that guy from E. R. It really didn't help. Even if the movie correctly demonstrated time-space theory, which it doesn't, it still couldn't make up for the shotty dialogue, direction, acting, ect.My advice: do not see this movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the Heck was I Watching?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the Director's Cut of Donnie Darko a few years ago, and for whatever reason I was left with loose ends and a senseless plot. The story's about a kid that was supposed to be killed by a meteorite or something, but survives and goes through a weird week. His one teacher inspires him and he starts studying morality or time-travel or something (I forget, it has been a while since I watched it) and another teacher tells him that they've crossed a certain line in talking about the subject because it's getting into things he can't teach.He keeps seeing this bunny guy, who doesn't really do anything, just kinda sits there and acts weird, then one day Donnie goes to a speech this rich guy is giving and is the only person who disagrees with him, and the bunny tells him to burn down his house, so he does. After this there's a news report that says the rich guy was actually a pedophile, so whether or not this justifies what Donnie did (it doesn't) it's good that the guy was figured out. Then Donnie goes out with this one girl and has sex with her at a party, and when he goes out into the street one night he sees the bunny guy again and kills him, or some-such, and then learns that the bunny guy is the one who saved him from getting killed by the meteorite, or something.But Donnie didn't want to give the bunny that burden (?) I guess, so he goes back in time through a portal or something, and decides to stay in bed and be killed by the meteor, so that the events of the movie don't take place. The next day it shows Donnie's body being taken away in an ambulance and everyone in town is standing around in shock from it, feeling bad that Donnie died even though they didn't know him, and a couple of people come together because of his death.So yeah...Didn't really get the movie, again maybe I really missed something in the film, but after I watched it, it made absolutely no sense to me. The whole movie is really about Donnie and how his death is important or something, the teacher and the rich pedophile guy and everyone aren't really that important and don't appear in the movie that much. I have gotten scratched DVDs from the place I rented this movie from before so, who knows, maybe the whole plot of the story was damaged and I just didn't notice it. But I didn't see the scenes just skip or anything, so I guess this is really what the movie is supposed to be, and it is crap.My opinion - horrible film, made no sense, no questions answered and no real likable characters. I was going to give Donnie Darko a '3' because I was interested enough by it to actually rent it and watch it, but upon writing this review I now realize that I hated this movie, so it is awful enough to garnish a 1/10. Stay clear of it unless you want to waste a small portion of your life (and possibly money) on it and feel confused and disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I'm a big fan of movies that question things, this movie was a waste of time. Some people might classify this as an "intelligent movie" but I Loathe the day I read and trusted the internet reviews on IMDb.com for this "intelligent movie".Ill give it one point for good acting and for the fact that I liked the music choices, but it goes down hill from there. The music was just played on top of the scenes as if it wasn't actually a part of the movie, hardly any fade in/fade out. The whole time in the movie I was thinking please don't end at the beginning and boom I had to watch the whole movie to find out what? Nothing, I should just have done a fast forward to the end to see the truth and not wasted my time with all the in between nonsense that in the end proved doublespeak.Don't bother seeing it if you don't like movies with no ending, or futile endings. This movie certainly doesn't belong in the top 250 I rate it 1in10 other movies deserve this top spot. Not even close to the originality and mind-blowing coolness of a movie/ movies like Momento.- My 2 cents</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do not be afraid of the darko! Why? Because `Donnie Darko' is one of the best and original films of 2001. Jake Gyllenhaal is amazing as Donnie Darko. Donnie is just your average teenager who has schizophrenic visions of a demonic rabbit who tells him to flood his school and burn motivational speaker's mansions, among other things. Moreover, Frank the Rabbit (as he likes to be called) warns Donnie that the world would end in 28 days 6 hours 42 minutes 12 seconds. Talk about a real life rabbit test!! Director Richard Kelly's debut film is a masterpiece. Kelly is a director to watch for in the future, and i am sure will not be left in the dark. The supporting cast of: Mary Mcdonnell, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Patrick Swayze, Jena Malone, Noah Wyle, and Drew Barrymore `energized' the film with our bunny and Mr. Darko. So you should definitely see `Donnie Darko' in 1 day 1hr 1 min 10 seconds or how long it takes you to get to your nearby video store. ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are young and dissatisfied with your family, if you do not have too many good friends, and you are having a feeling that the whole world is stupid, evil and against you, and you are wishing that someday you will have some special scientific power to destroy all evil and save the world..... Donnie Darko is the perfect movie for you.Its a fairy tale cashing in on introvert teen sentiments! Surreal is not the right word, Donnie Darko is based on science. Well at least it has a few sprinkles of unexplained scientific twists here and there to help you spend a lot of time looking for logic even after the movie is over. This is an added advantage because you spend money for a two hour movie, and then wonder and discuss about it for two years. Great deal?Well, the movie is about a boy who seems a bit retard and drowsy because of his psychotic medications. He faces his family which is not too supportive about his confusions about life. He faces friends in school who are not exactly his type. He faces other grown ups like teachers and doctors around him who do not have enough intellect to understand the depth of his mind. And everyone around him is mostly dishonest, blunt or evil to the core! Being shy and drowsy, there was not much chance that he could find a girlfriend. But one day the most beautiful girl in school chooses him as the cutest guy in class! A perfect dream come true for a troubled teenage boy! So at last it seems like his troubled life will come to an end! But not for long....! Soon he will have to play the role of a knight in shining armor to save his girlfriend's life... and by lying down on his bed.The director is smart! He was only 25 when he made this movie. He remembered his teenage days and the complexes that an average troubled teenage mind usually has about the grown up world. He totally cashed in on that. He added some new concept from hypothetical science to make a few parts of the movie a bit difficult (often impossible) to understand, so that the viewers do not feel its cliché, and get a subject to talk about it for years to come.So if you are grown up and confident about yourself, you will readily figure out what this movie is trying to do. But if you are still confused about the world, you will probably love this movie, irrespective of your age!</fullReview>

Donnie just wants a normal life, but can't help to try and figure out what is happening to him, and then come to a realization and how he can fix everything.

		<shortDescription>Moody and mysterious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Kelly, the director of "Donnie Darko", could be considered a 'one hit wonder'. His debut feature film was this atmospheric cult favourite about a teenage boy (Jake Gyllenhaal) who has visions of a huge rabbit warning him that the world will end in 28 days. Unique and thought-provoking, the film represents a high water mark that Kelly hasn't come close to matching in the 14 years since.Kelly's screenplay is perhaps the film's biggest asset. Daringly unique, the story is highly unpredictable. The plot is shrouded in an air of mystery that keeps the tension high throughout the proceedings. The eventual payoff is satisfying as well.Kelly's direction is sure-handed throughout and shows a keen grasp of building and maintaining suspense. The movie's score and period specific soundtrack also enforce the overall atmosphere of the film. It certainly isn't a presentation that suggests the inexperience of a first time director.When it comes to the cast, it's surprisingly good for a movie with a relatively small budget. Jake Gyllenhaal wasn't well known at the time, nor was his sister Maggie, who plays his sister in the movie as well. It's a bit of a surprise to see Patrick Swayze here, though he is effective in the role of a motivational speaker. Other notables include Katharine Ross as Donnie's psychiatrist, Mary McDonnell as his mother and Noah Wyle as his science teacher. Drew Barrymore (who was also one of the producers) has a small part as well but I don't think that she was quite right for the role.Ultimately, "Donnie Darko" succeeds mainly because it doesn't give too much away in terms of the central mystery. If you explore the movie's supplemental material you'll see that some of Kelly's explanations are pretty far out, so I think that it was fortunate that the movie played it close to the vest. Leaving the explanations to the viewer can be somewhat risky but in this case it worked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is one of the most bizarre and confusing movies I have ever seen, and I absolutely loved it. Richard Kelly perfectly mixes almost every genre into one movie. It has Sci-fi, romance, comedy, horror, and action. The pure genius of the movie is not fully appreciated until a second viewing, due to the fact that the plot is so hard to follow the first time through. Donnie Darko is a grade A example of how movies should be made. Kelly creates a dark look into the mind of a disturbed teen who you never really understand totally until the end of the movie. If you have not seen this movie I highly recommend it. It is a masterpiece of cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko: Explained</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apart from Donnie there are several other actors whose roles serve two overall functions: the foils or "bullshitters," as Mr. Darko calls them, whose narrow minded perspective on life provides a contrast to Donnie's and the enablers who engage with Donnie's view on reality and help him try to understand the truth. His sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal, serves as the overbearing but good hearted older sister who brings out the rebellious teen in Donnie. Other foils include his gym teacher Kitty and Jim Cunningham both of whom preach his cult's view of fear and happiness. Both of these characters show us the frustration building inside Donnie as they present oversimplified explanations and solutions of life's problems which Donnie knows to be insufficient: "The world isn't black and white," he tells Kitty.In addition to these "bullshitters" there are those characters who aid Donnie in his quest for the truth: his therapist, Grandma Death, his English teacher, and his science teacher. These characters are of far greater significance to the film as in addition to showing us the depth of Donnie's character they are what progress the story. These "manipulated living," as they are referred to in chapter 7 of the film, are portals of information for Donnie which drive him closer to enlightenment and ultimately help him to make a decision about his fate. In order to reset the universe to its original course Donnie requires the insight provided by these characters who function as Deus Ex Machina "God from machine" by providing the necessary resolution to the seemingly unsolvable problem of a collapsing space-time continuum.WritingDonnie Darko succeeds because all of the major themes in it, even those that are very different from each other, all tie into one theme: Donnie is meant to die.The first major theme is introduced in Donnie's English class where he discovers that destruction can be a form of creation in a story where children flood a school. Once this idea is planted in Donnie's head we see him act on this knowledge as he floods the school, defaces the school's mascot, and eventually burns down Cunningham's house. This is the first time Donnie is given information from a Deus Ex Machina (in this case his English teacher) and then given a task which is meant to compel him to choose to end his life and restore order to the universe. By flooding the school and burning down Cunningham's house he willingly commits acts for which Donnie knows he is likely to suffer great consequences: "I only have a few days left before they catch me" he tells his therapist. Yet ironically it is not fear which motivates Donnie to do these things, which Cunningham claims motivates Donnie, but loyalty to Frank who saved his life and, more importantly, a desire to "know his master plan" (Whether "his" refers to Frank or to God is never made clear in the film and whether it is one or the other is irrelevant since what the film is primarily focused on is Donnie's figuring out that he must choose to die.) The audience is meant to understand that while the fear of being caught hangs over Donnie, pushing him away from any attachment toward this tangent universe, it is the search for knowledge that drives him.There are several other themes raised in the film that also point Donnie towards his death. Time travel is of course a significant part of the film and while it is certainly used to make the film more complex and therefore interesting, its ultimate purpose is to make it possible for Donnie to change the past and die as he was originally supposed to (another example of Deus Ex Machina.) The acceptance of one's fate and that we all die alone is a subtler but equally important theme that pops up several times in the film including towards the beginning of the film when Grandma Death tells Donnie that "Every living creature on Earth dies alone." This is another example of how a theme which seems to stand on its own is really just a vehicle for getting Donnie to accept death so that he can more easily make the decision to save the universe. Death itself also serves as an important motivator as the one person Donnie loves, Gretchen, is killed by Frank's car as a result of Grandma Death standing in the street (not coincidentally, right after Donnie cries out "Deus Ex Machina.") Gretchen's death proves to be the most significant motivator for Donnie. The morning after Gretchen's death, we see Donnie return home. Though Donnie is faced with plenty of reasons for not being invested in this tangent universe (those mentioned above as well as for murdering Frank) he still tries to flee from his fate by driving away with Gretchen's body after he sees the cloud formation in the sky which he knows will bring about his death. Sitting on a hilltop overlooking the valley below, the film reaches its climax as Donnie is finally faced the decision of whether or not to sacrifice himself for the universe. Donnie gets back into the car, takes a long look at Gretchen's body and realizes that the only way to save her is for him to die. Following his decision the screen immediately flashes the word "purge," signaling an end to the tangent universe and a restoration of order. Ultimately Donnie was not motivated by fear as Cunningham alleged, but by his love for Gretchen.The complexity of this story and its many themes all working towards one beautiful resolution is what makes this film such a masterpiece. Kelly's genius is demonstrated by his ability to take longstanding clichés like the story of a troubled teen, young love, and an overbearing school and effectively combine them with as complex a concept as time travel.Check out my full review at http://windreelandprintmoviereviews.blogspot.com/Or search Wind Reel And Print Movie Reviews</fullReview>

You don't know what he will do next and you can honestly feel your heart pounding because it is meant to be frightening but it's so bloody good!It was funny how Jake Gyllenhaal and Maggie Gyllenhaal teamed up as actual siblings for real to bring this team-ship into this film. I say they loved telling how they couldn't stand each other and just fight like what normal siblings would do! I'm sure they got on fine really since it is part of the job like!So thanks to this film, I wouldn't have heard of Watership down even though it is a very sad film like this. I'm guessing they added that film in was because it influences Frank so much. I suppose you can say that alright! I honestly loved Jake Gyllenhaal as Danny Darko, he was always awesome at playing compassionate roles throughout the film industry. No wonder he's likable! Very good job he has done!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding debut film with a well-thought out plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an elaborate and well-thought out movie which is very well-done. It's a great debut film by Richard Kelly.Donnie Darko, a high school student, is visited by a large bunny named Frank that tells him the world is going to end in 28 days. Frank then urges him to perform different dangerous tasks in the days leading up to the calamity.This movie is made great due to its elaborate plot which was clearly well-thought out by the director. I didn't have much trouble understanding the film throughout its entirety but the ending did confuse me. But after re-watching it and looking up a few theories, I was able to get it and I was astonished by how much effort went into it. It is truly well-done.Jake Gyllenhaal clearly steals the show giving a mesmerizing performance. He is able to convey several emotions and draw us in very well. The fact that Donnie Darko's character is brutally honest, troubled, and confused makes him an easy character to sympathize with. All the other actors did a great job too but Gyllenhaal did the best job.One last thing I want to talk about is that usually when people talk about great mind-bending movies, Christopher Nolan is usually brought up the most but I feel that people need to focus on other movies too. Examples of other great movies with elaborate plot include this film, The Usual Suspects, Fight Club, Being John Malkovich, The Tree of Life, Primer, Mulholland Drive, Twelve Monkeys, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Shutter Island. If you're a fan of Nolan then you should check these movies out too. I think Nolan is a great director but I don't like how most people ignore other movies with elaborate plots. Some of these are really famous like Fight Club but the audience usually tends to say that Nolan does the best job with movies of this genre. If you enjoy Nolan then you should check these out too. If you don't like them or still prefer Nolan's movies though then that's fine. I'm just giving these as suggestions.So in conclusion, I think that this movie is amazing. Once you know its plot, it will keep you in awe. I think that this is an outstanding movie which you should see.</fullReview>

It's a movie for thinkers and those who don't see everything as black or white. If you enjoy movies like Birdman, Paris Texas and Fisher King, there's a good chance you'll enjoy this one.

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a film that has a hard time fitting into one single genre. It is comical and thrilling, but most of all -- a mystery. Join Donnie (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) as he tries to piece together the events that led to a plane's wing motor falling into his house and destroying his bedroom. This event will change Donnie's life as well as his perception of it forever. Not to mention he keeps seeing a man in a creepy bunny suit named who tries to convince him to commit crimes. Donnie's parents believe this is due to a mental disorder but through Frank's guidance Donnie might actually be saving the world? This film will withstand the test of time because of its self-reflexive tone. Everyone has asked themselves, "If I could go back and change that moment, would I?" You can't help but put yourself in Donnie's shoes and wonder what decisions you would make. If you have trouble understanding the film's concept the first time around, give it another go. You'd be surprised how many hints you pick up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing yet very, very confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donny Darko is one of the more unique and original mystery thrillers that you can find. This movie had you completely clueless and puzzled right from the get go, and the longer this movie went on, the more confused i became. In a way, this was one of the things i liked the most about the movie but it was also one of the things i didn't like. The fact that it was so puzzling got me on the edge of my seat for almost the entire time trying to make sense of what what happening whilst trying to figure out what will happen next, this made me very interested and invested in the story trying to be told. But then the bad part about that was that it got a little too confusing and mind bending so that at many points i had no idea what the plot was and just what exactly i was trying to realise. It was definitely an experience like no other with many hidden messages and clues that try to give you explanations about what is going on and why or how. As well as the directing, this movie would not have been as effective without the stellar performance by Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie Darko. He manages to capture both the kind and regular school kid side and the dark and almost evil side so well that you are just amazed by the character whenever he is on screen. Through this role i can totally see why he got the role as Lou Bloom in the more recent film Nightcrawler. He seems to be able to play this type of character so well that every time you forget it is Gyllenhaal. His performance was the standout as the many other performances were still good but lacked the spark that Gyllenhaal could bring to the role. The overall pace of the film was quite slow and i felt could have been sped up a little at certain points but i can understand why the director decided not to after spending some time thinking about the significance of certain events. With a very intriguing scenario and lead character, this movie will not fail to get you confused and thinking about it for days. - 7.9</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films you had to have seen when you were growing up in the 90's, and being a teenager when this movie hit the cinema or TV. Even now, it's a quite relevant movie I think. It is strange and dumb, a lot like being a teenager is about, and what goes on in our minds. I'm an adult now, but still enjoy this twisted, yet beautiful movie. It's one of those plots you have to think, and think back on. How it changes but, still stays on it's line. The mind of Donnie comes to life, which I really thought was a nice twist at times. This maybe isn't the greatest review, but this is what I had in my mind at the moment looking back at it. Anyway, this is one of my all time favorite, and I would recommend you to see this one, at least one time before you die. Cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mind blowing masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great thing about this film is that every time you see it you catch something you didn't notice before, and piece by piece this clever thriller comes together. Sometimes when I think I fully understood the film I still haven't even come close. When it comes to fully understanding a film this film makes understanding inception look like a cake walk. Even without fully understanding the great twist it is still great and ridiculously clever but the most of the story is left mostly ambiguous unless you watch the directors cut which is easier to understand but is still no walk in the park.If your a person that can't stand to get lost and confused and you need to fully understand the ending then beware of this film because it will drive you crazy. However reading the synopsis and the fictional book created for this film (also known as the philosophy of time travel) can also come in handy with this film. But for me personally this is one of my favorite thrillers as of right now.To some this film is an absolute must see but to others it may not be enjoyable because of the complexity and ambiguity of the story. In my book this is a must see and deserves a spot in the 250 where it sits. I highly recommend this film to people who love to use their minds in films. That's all I have to say thanks for reading my review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ain't it kinda funny, ain't it kinda sad?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those words kind of sum up 'Donnie Darko.' It's definitely not for everyone, being the writing/directing debut of Richard Kelly. It's deep, complex, with overlapping-story lines and constant blurring of genres.Rumour has it that once it was made, the distributors let it sit on the shelf for a year while they tried to figure out how best to sell it. I can see why. It's hard to name a genre that it doesn't borrow from. It's definitely sci-fi, but only in parts. When the sci-fi elements come, they're very noticeable, but surprisingly fleeting. However, it's also very creepy in places, producing a more sinister atmosphere than most horror films. Then, just when you're scared senseless, it throws in a lot of light-hearted banter, even going as far as to discuss the sexual habits of Smurfs like it was a Kevin Smith comedy. Then you have the touching sadness of it all, plus the high school element, the teen romance subplot, the family drama and the general satire on modern living in suburban America.If anyone asks you what Donnie Darko is about, even if you've seen it, you may have trouble explaining it. The people that really know what it's about have probably looked up its 'true meaning' on the internet somewhere.If you're familiar with David Lynch's work, then you may know where Donnie Darko lies in the scale of films. Where is Lynch specialises in disturbing horror, Donnie Darko utilises all the genres to produce a mind-bending trip into a disturbed teenager's head as he struggles to balance everyday living with strange visitations from a time travelling bunny rabbit from the future (called Frank).Those who don't like it will probably say that it didn't make sense. Well, they're right in some ways. It's not a film that wraps itself up easily. A lot is left to your own interpretation of what you've seen. There is definitely a story that you can follow and you should care about all the characters, but it's partly more of a 'sensory experience' than an easy narrative to follow.But then it's worth it just to see Jake Gyllenhal's breakthrough performance. He hadn't done many films prior to this and it's great to see him carry the film on his own. However, there are numerous characters in this film and, just because they're not quite as good as its leading man, doesn't mean to say they don't all put in excellent performances. Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze aren't in it for long, but that doesn't mean to say that they aren't both excellent in their small roles.Donnie Darko is an experience. It may not be for everyone, but you really should see it to decide for yourself. It was listed in the 'Top 50 films you need to see before you die.' I think it justifies its place in that list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply, the best film of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, there are so many films that contend for the best film ever title. And all of them deserve so. But this one is just beyond, because,this is not a film. Yes, it is not a film. It is the meaning of life. All the characters represent all the humans ever born on this planet earth. Recently, Christopher Nolan's Interstellar came out. And no doubt, it was one of the most fabulous films, ever! But the concept of "they" shown in that film had already been mastered by Richard Kelly in Donnie Darko. The corruption in the fabric of space time is caused by the unknown reason whose explanation spans from our own future beings to future alien contacts to even God. I mean, do you get it? Is it a film about a teenager who is schizophrenic or is it a pure science fiction or is it about good parenting or is it just another low budget film? Only God knows! Only Donnie Darko knows. For me, it's the greatest film ever! Actually, it's the greatest thing ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is one of Jake Gyllenhalls first major film roles. Now if you haven't seen This movie I'll tell you right now...Its confusing. Like really confusing. I usually pride myself in seeing what a film is trying to say and catching all the little things that happen. But I was pretty much completely lost. It follows Donnie Darko a young kid that is I guess, stalked by a 6 foot tall bunny. That is about as far as can say since I'm avoiding any kind of spoilers. So uh lets just go into the GOOD STUFF!Good stuff Like I said Donnie Darko features Jake Gyllenhall In one of his first roles. And He was fantastic. And it's not just him either. The entire cast is perfect and are all excellent. One thing that this film offers that not many movies do these days rewatchabilty or something. Now You can re watch any movie you want. But donnie darko is one film that the more times you watch it the more you understand. It's a lot like Inception in that regard. But unlike Inception Donnie Darko is kinda slowly paced. The movie does move quick and you really can't look away for a second or you'll miss something. But it feels slow while you are watching. There are Lots of things that feel like they don't matter at the time but when you hit the end and realize you blinked at a certain part you'll be hitting yourself for it.The Bad Stuff Donnie Darko is very confusing. And hard to follow on your first watch. Which is quite a turn off for lots of people. For me not so much but I recommend this movie to a few people and more or less they came back saying they didn't like it because they simply didn't get it. Verdict Donnie Darko is Jake Gyllenhalls first major film role and hes never really looked back. He delivers one of many astounding performances as does the rest of the cast. The film is also super tightly written as it needs to be to drive home its original (yet Confusing) ideas. The only real negative here is how confusing it is. But this is an easy fix by simply looking up Donnie Darko Explanation</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story unveils slowly at the opening and gets to normal pace when the characters set in. Yet the story is filled with the constant mood of mysterious happenings and suspicious possible connections. The details are very sketchy, these kept the viewers curious and stay on watching. But some people with less patience will likely be bore off, I know I did feel kind of bored as the story only reveal sketchy hints and details to make out a guess. Yet the finale revelation is nice enough that covers and sums up the entire story into one complete tale. Jake Gyllenhaal acted out just enough to keep the story alive while his sister gets not a very significant role here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a kind of movie that calls out not merely to be experienced but to be solved. The plot coils back on itself in intriguing mind puzzles, and moviegoers send bewildering e-mails to one another, explaining it. Two weeks ago brought "Mulholland Drive," which has inspired countless explanations, all convincing, none in agreement, and now here is "Donnie Darko," the story of a teenage boy who receives bulletins about the future from a large and demonic rabbit.Richard Kelly, the first-time writer-director, is obviously talented--not least at creating a disturbing atmosphere out of the materials of real life. His mysterious jet engine is a masterstroke. He sees his characters freshly and clearly, and never reduces them to formulas. In Jake Gyllenhaal, he finds an actor able to suggest an intriguing kind of disturbance; the character is more curious than frightened, more quixotic than eccentric, and he sets a nice tone for the movie. But somehow the control fades in the closing scenes, and our hands, which have been so full, close on emptiness. "Donnie Darko" is the one that got away. But it was fun trying to land it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is very rare for me to watch a film more than once, but this film is so enjoyable I have watched it at least 50 times. The 80's soundtrack to the film brings back memories of being a child. There are some very funny moments, controversial questions and hidden meanings. The cast is to notch and the end will leave you scratching your head and watching again and again to find different meanings. With Jake Gyllenhaal, Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze in the cast, it was always going to be a good film. They are all playing such unusual characters. Patrick Swayze, in particular, is a character like no other role I've seen him in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Cult Movie is all about Tone. You will Either Love it or Hate it Depending if You Love or Hate the Tone of this Ambitious First Film from Writer/Director Richard Kelly. Complementary Weird it is so Deep and Dense that it has Fanboys and Eggheads Debating Endlessly about its Merits or its Failings. It has Both.It is Magnetic but Misfires on Occasion. Verbally it is Smart and Darkly Humorous, Satiric and Scathing at Times with its Stabs at Politicians, Self-Help Gurus, and Academic Snobbery. It has a Very Different Approach to Teen Angst and Stability Among Conventions and Pre-Determined Acceptable Posturing. But it can be Overwrought at Times with its Bullying, Science, and Psychobabble.There is Time Travel and Hallucinatory Imagery on the Sci-Fi Side and a Grotesquery of Symbolism and Iconic Characterizations of the Imaginary Friend and the Forgotten by Time Philosophical Genius in Grandma Death. There is Enough Enjoyable Eccentricity in the Movie to make up for the Ambiguity that can, in the End, be a bit Frustrating.A Fantastic Effort that will Appeal to Some and have Others Screaming Fraud. One Thing for Certain, the American Cultural Form in the Vision of an Anthropomorphic Bunny Manifestation has, for Better or Worse, Evolved/Devolved from Harvey (1950) to Frank.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing movie for people who like to think!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a modern classic. Having just watched this again for the first time in a number of years, I finally understood it! I think you do have to delve a bit deeper with some research outside of just viewing the film but it is well worth it and adds to the whole 'reality' of the universe in which Donnie lives. Mixing drama with sci-fi and horror elements (Frank the bunny manages to scare me every time I watch this film!), everything is orchestrated so neatly by the writer/director. On first viewing, I remember being so confused, but time (and maturity I guess) has allowed it to all sink in and I think that it's a very special movie which is a wonderful addition to the history of cinema. Without delving into the realm of describing plots points, I'll just say check the trailer that is provided on the IMDb page, and if you think you might even be slightly interested from that, then you will definitely think this film is amazing. A very accomplished piece of film making, and a movie everyone should see! And also, as a side note, it was fun to recognise Seth Rogen, who has a couple of lines in the film, before he rose to super stardom!</fullReview>

It's very watchable and the music sequences are beautifully thought out.I heard an interview with the director about how long this took to get made. Good on you for sticking it out.

		<fullReview>This is a very interesting movie, but I might require you watching it more than once. There are many things in the story that doesn't make much sense, unless you have made a bit of research about black holes, Einstein's theory of relativeness etc. But you don't need to, because there are many ways this movie can be interpreted, and everybody's interpretation is as good as mine. This is what makes the movie so great. Some of the scenes in the movie are dark and surrealistic, as we follow the protagonists life and it's ups and downs. None of them are terrifying or horrific like scenes in a horror movie, but the background music and colors are keeping you alert senses throughout the most of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is renowned for it's dark and sinister feel and themes, however, I oftentimes felt a sincere lack of these things while I was watching. The first half of the movie made me question why it had received so much cult hype over the years. It felt thrown together, messy, and confused. At times it seemed as if there were three separate plots sewn together, threaded by a director as confused as I was. As I loved watching Donnie's character develop and discover his delusions, I also found myself unusually annoyed at his lack of screen time. Instead, Kelly chose to focus on other, sloppier characters who served no purpose to the relationship between the creepy and interesting Frank and Donnie. Why should I care about the obese Chinese foreign student or the overly-stylized and annoying teacher/mom Ms. Kitty? The director was exploiting their unlike-ability for the sake of the audience enjoying Darko and his companions more. Throughout the first half of the film I yearned for more screen time for Donnie and his rabbitular illusion. The second half of Donnie Darko, however, was a completely different film. Kelly invests small bits and pieces of the actual plot into the first hour in order to prepare the audience for the second. I thoroughly enjoyed this section of the movie, and thought it mostly made up for the loose script and pointlessness of it's counterpart. Kelly and the audience spend more time with Donnie and the mysteriousness surrounding his visions. I began to realize why the movie was such a hit. I was fully immersed in the time-travel theme and began to connect with Donnie and his girlfriend Gretchen on a new level. The twist ending was predictable albeit clever. After some research into the events it seemed to me like the audience needed some if not loads of background knowledge of time travel philosophy to fully understand it's genius. This only serves to separate the viewer from the film. I think that is why people think of this movie as an instant classic- they simply didn't get it, and need to keep coming back in attempts to understand what they couldn't the last time. You would think that by the end of the film someone would given the audience some clues. So, while it was an interesting and thought-provoking ending, it was not all it could have or should have been.A cult favorite, Donnie Darko has inspired countless movies of it's kind-movies that ultimately saw more purpose than Darko ever did. Jake Gyllenhaal shines as young Donnie and serves the dark theme of the film well. Kelly's script, however, falls short of producing more than a few good characters, dialogues, and plot-advancing scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserving of Cult Status</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally watched Donnie Darko. I knew it was one of those films that had not done well on original box office release but had achieved "cult" status over the years. I think it belongs squarely in the cult category.It's an unusual film that combines sci-fi, horror and teen angst. Watching Donnie and his family deal with his suspected mental illness, and Donnie dealing with his visions of a 6 ft. rabbit is at times wrenching, comic and completely compelling. Frank the rabbit in Donnie's visions first saves Donnie's life and so Donnie feels compelled to do whatever Frank says -- especially since Frank tells Donnie the world will end in 28 days. Through the twists and turns of what Frank reveals to Donnie begs only one question from me: does Donnie possess a 6th sense that others don't, and that's why he has been diagnosed with a mental illness?Frank saving Donnie's life and putting Donnie's universe into an alternate path has consequences for everyone around him. What is the purpose of this alternate time line? It seems the only positive purpose is for Donnie to experience that first sweet love and loss in a short young life. It's only with Donnie's re-entrance into the correct time line that the dirty secrets of everyone around him are revealed, secrets that only he was privy to in the alternate time line.I love a film that pops up in my brain long after viewing. Donnie Darko is one of those films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Satsfying Mind Blow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A while ago I put Donnie Darko away on my Netflix to do list and before That was a long time ago and after seeing it I had no idea how to review it. I took a day or two to think about the ending and even went to the internet to see what actually happened and after I read a few things I decided I needed to see it again. I was fixed in this world and when I went to watch it again it was gone. I waited a few months and bought the director's cut on blu ray and I watched it again and the second time was so much more satisfying than the first.The story behind Donnie Darko is complicated to say the least. We follow Donnie, a troubled high scholar who just wants to be normal. It is hard to be normal when he is on psychotic medication and he hallucinates about a bunny rabbit named Frank telling him to do things in his sleep. Jake Gyllenhaal, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Patrick Swayze, and Drew Barrymore each have their own short story lines that tie into the main plot so perfectly. The writing in this movie was one of the best I have ever seen. Personally, the idea of time travel is so interesting and the idea of a tangent universe was new to me and I was hooked immediately. After seeing this movie I wanted to write something like it and it inspired me to say the least. Each character did such an amazing job with the strangeness of Barrymore and the odd feeling with Swayze. Their individual stories are almost as good as the main one following Donnie and his love interest. Gyllenhaal delivers in this movie as Donnie. He is troubled and another strong interest of mine if psychology and the mind. Donnie is incredibly gifted, smart, and opinionated. His story is so vague enough to keep the audience interested in the story as well as crept out. Frank was a scary character with a strong voice and seeing the bubble trail thing was unexpected. Noah Wile and Drew Barrymore are the only two teachers Donnie connects with in the entire school and their relationships are remarkable. With Barrymore especially, Donnie connects with her and her teaching style. Her role is never fully clear but she is effective. Maybe if I go back and watch it I will notice something else. That is the thing with this movie which is very rare, it gets better and better the more your watch it over and over. Noah Wile is a science teacher of some sort and after Frank mentions time travel Donnie goes to him for answers and every scene with Wile and Darko are together, my mind was blown and I was so interested. The conversations about wormholes and tangent universes and whatnot were so fascinating and it only works in a movie. The main relationship is between Donnie and Gretchen. Their relationship is so weird and cute at the same time. From the introduction of Gretchen she had a strong connection with Donnie and their relationship builds slowly and unexpectedly. Donnie has so much going on and as his methods of picking up girls are far-fetched and unrealistic but it was good enough for me. I still can't figure out what Gretchen saw in Donnie, you know because he is crazy, but I think she related to him and that was fine for me. Their relationship was unrealistic but for the universe the movie takes place in I bought it. Their ending was, in my opinion, controversial so let's get into it.I want to spoil this ending so bad and dive deep into my own thoughts but I really shouldn't. The entire movie builds up to one date, October 30, 1988. The movie is broken up into chapters and as the date approaches the scenes get more intense. It is supposed to be the end of the world and Donnie is afraid of the date and anticipating it. The beginning of this movie is slow and confusing but it picks up quickly. The beginning may be the one flaw but it has that one scene to keep it alive to keep the audience invested in the rest. Most of the questions are answered with more questions but the answers we get are so satisfying and the ending is outstanding. The star of this movie is the writing and the ending saved this movie from disaster and I still think about it every now and then. I am still trying to wrap my head around it because it left an impact. Out of all the confusing movies with a big ending this was one of the best. I felt so lost for the entire movie it was hard to stay invested but there was always that one scene to draw me back in and the ending was the icing on the cake. A total mind blow, especially the last shot. It was sort of an Inception shot at the way end with the topOverall, Donnie Darko has a cult following of a fan base so consider me a member. The clever writing kept me thinking and the ending was shocking and amazing. This movie is probably one of my favorites ever. Probably in my top 20 of all time. I noticed so many little things like in the beginning the first shot with Donnie's mother, she is reading IT by Stephen King and I took that as a sign. Spencer from iCarley and Seth Rogan are also in the movie very briefly but of course I notice that. Even the lyrics of the sings tied into the scenes perfectly and when Mad World came on at the end I lost it. Need I even say it, WillyT Seal Approval.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply immaculate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***MANY SPOILERS*** IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE, I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU TO NOT CONTINUE READING PAST THIS POINTDonnie Darko is just immaculate. Jake Gyllenhaal's role as Donnie was immaculate; everything was just simply immaculate. Donnie Darko is about a troubled teenager who gets guided through 'life' by a man in a bunny suit, named Frank. Donnie soon realizes that what Frank is making him do is outrageous, but Donnie, being the kind of person he is, accepts Franks plan, even though Donnie really kind of had to in the beginning. Donnie Darko taught me to fight for what I love, and to never, ever give up. It also taught me how people are not as they seem to be, and that everyone has a different side to them. The movie itself if extremely confusing, but with careful examination of the movie, you will understand what it is about. I recommend Donnie Darko to anyone who is into twist endings, and can read and understand movies exceptionally well. If you watch this movie, be prepared to spend around 2-3 months finding answers; it took me about two years, but it was SO worth it in the end...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some kind of a perfect movie...accidentally or not!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I want to point out that I am reviewing the original version, not the director's cut, of this film! The director's cut has shown the fans that the mind behind this movie was just lucky to create such a piece of art. Originally, he wanted to change many aspects of the film, which can be seen in the director's cut. However, in my eyes, that version can not be compared to the original version. It does not have that magical feeling at all! So here go:I do not want to summarize the main plot of this movie here, since it is such a complex story that has basically every genre in it! It is a heartwarming love story between the psychotic Donald Darko and Gretchen, a real drama, at some points even scary like a horror movie, thinking about the rabbit "Frank" and Donnie's sleepwalking. It is funny, mysterious and thrilling at the same time.There are also sci-fi elements in it as well as it is a superhero story:Gretchen:"Donnie Darko? What the hell kind of name is that? It's like some sort of superhero or something" Donnie:"What makes you think I'm not?"The protagonist "Donald Darko" is excellently played by Jake Gyllenhaal; probably his best performance that he has ever given! His facial expressions of this psychotic person are superb!"Donnie Darko" has a complex story that you won't understand after the first time of watching it or even the second. It will leave many questions unanswered, however after seeing it several times, you are able to come up with your own interpretation.The whole movie is attended by a more than just on point fitting soundtrack. Every song happens to be there for a reason and their lyrics perfectly display the theme of the movie. Gary Jules' "Mad World", especially, sticks out of the rest, due to the fact that it gives distinction to the mind-blowing ending!All in all, this masterpiece is one of my favorite movies of all time. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko [2001] Donnie Darko is a story of a teenage boy who becomes the centre point to a massive event involving time-travel, superpowers and a demonic bunny. Donnie Darko is not your ordinary film and has a compelling plot that is serious even if far-fetched, the films entire point is to portray what it is to be a teenage boy with girl troubles and the overbearing fear of death. It is difficult to show how the film does this without revealing its -plot, but it is well written. The characters are very well thought out and all serve there purpose to the plot, I particularly likes Donnies father Eddie, played by Homes Osborne, who at first doesn't seem to add much to the film but on repeated viewings, certain lines seem very thought provoking. Jake Gyllenhaal also does a great job as Donnie and casting his own sister Maggie as Donnies sister was inspired, leading to some quite hilarious exchanges. Even though this film has a dark overtone it is still light hearted at times, but in my opinion what steals the show is the musical choice, "Mad World" especially, if you are yet to watch it, Donnies Darko is one of the most thought provoking films you will ever see. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and mysterious in equal measure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a movie that combines many things. On the one hand it's an 80's nostalgia-fest with a tone to match, while it simultaneously has a really ominous mood bordering on horror at times. Genre-wise it's equally eclectic; it's part coming-of-age teen movie, part sci-fi/fantasy. This mish-mash of styles and tones make for a very distinct film. On top of that, of course, is a narrative that folds back on itself and requires quite a lot of post-viewing thought to fully piece together. Overall, it's a most unusual combination.Set in 1988, the story surrounds a troubled teenage boy who has visions of a giant rabbit called Frank who urges him to perform dangerous criminal acts and warns him that the world will end in a month. His first encounter with the rabbit coincides with a jet engine crashing into the family home, seemingly from out of nowhere.The basis of the story asks if it is better to die, than for your happy story and correct deeds resulting in worse atrocities. It's about sacrificing yourself for others you love, even if it ultimately means they will never have even known you. It incorporates hallucinations and time travel as a way for its labyrinthine story to pose its conundrums. The drama is underpinned with a strong central performance from Jake Gyllenhaal, with good support from everyone else including an against-type one from Patrick Swayze. To round things off there are some excellent sequences soundtracked to 80's new wave and post-punk groups, namely Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Joy Division and Tears For Fears. This adds to the sense of time but they are also incorporated in such a way as to make them feel slightly off-kilter and dreamlike which suits this strange story just perfectly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: do not read too much into Donnie Darko. And by "read" I mean what the internet dissects from the film. Talk about spoilers for the experience!And what an experience this gem was: an all-star cast in which everyone was either great or excellent, a perfect soundtrack and above all else: it was one of the most original movies I've ever seen.Probably, about a decade ago, I first saw Donnie Darko, and that was the "Theatrical Cut." Unlike "edited for television," I don't mind theatrical versions because a lot of the time, the "Director's Cut" thoroughly ruins the experience. Best example, the near-excellent Payback's "Straight Up" ? or Director's Cut ? edition is positively awful. And same with the Richard Donner's Superman II version. Blah.That all said, after buying Donnie Darko on BluRay, I decided my second journey down this, ah-hem, rabbit hole would be with the Director's Cut. Not disappointed was I, but it did "clear up" a lot of "left open for interpretation" scenes the first go-around. Some people would rather figure it all out on their own, while some need some explaining on the menu. I could go either way, unless it's too widely out of left field and takes fifteen discussions to understand. Donnie Darko wasn't 100% straight forward, but I "got it" both times I've seen it.Sleepwalking Donnie inadvertently dodges a huge bullet, in the form of a jet's engine that falls from the sky and obliterates teen Donnie's bedroom while Donnie was wandering his small town at night. The kid's already having problems ? he's on meds, sees a shrink, in fights with his parents, he's an outcast at school and has an imaginary 6 foot demonic man-rabbit friend. But, he knows something no one else does.It's easy to pass this off to his illness, but we know something else is going on here. Amongst all the going on's, that is. This movie is chock-full of intertwining and interesting story lines with some fantastic characters. But, getting back to this synopsis, this is a journey of Donnie Darko attempting to understand all the "signs" following his near-death experience.Did I mention he knows when the end of days is? And it's coming up fairly soon.The movie's extremely well shot, enormously interesting in how different it is and leads people to so many conclusions even though it's quite concluded at the end. The score and music are top notch, despite not being from this 1988-era set movie and there should be a drinking game to count how many actors flooded the screen without looking at the credit list online prior.Overall, this experimental film was a blast, and I loved how even a "weird" movie doesn't have to cross the line into "spaced out."(Yeah, I've seen those "spaced out" types of movies and wouldn't recommend going into one that has a great premise and just falls apart because the director/writer cannot control their drug habits.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that this is by far my favorite movie. It's mind blowing! When I saw it the first time, I wasn't sure if I liked it or not. I wasn't even sure if I got the story right. So my point is that Donnie Darko is a movie you have to watch more than just once. OK, so the story is a masterpiece. I cannot even say what's so good about it but if someone asked me, my first guess would be that every person can interpret it in his on way. But it will always be right. Every character in the movie is used well and every word he says is important for the movie. The big scary rabbit called Frank who's Donnie's illusion is so freaking awesome. His voice, his costume and his monotony are perfect.Jake Gyllenhaal who embodies Donnie Darko is just amazing. His performance couldn't be better. We can sense his teenage-rebellious side and his schizophrenic-dark side. I think Gyllenhaal was perfect for the role. The way he talks and moves...everything fits. Mary Mcdonnell aka. his mother is just as perfect. We can see a typical mother who loves her son and is desperate to see him get better. I was really amazed by her performance when she realizes her son has an imaginary friend who is a big scary rabbit. Maggi Gyllenhaal, Drew Barrymore and Jena Malone were amazing just as well.The music is amazing and at moments even mind blowing. Every time Frank shows on the screen and that scary music plays, shivers go down my body.But all thanks go to Richard Kelly and the producers. oh and by the way, I was pretty stunned to hear that Drew Barrymore was one of the producers.So anyway, I made all my friends watch Donnie Darko and they all loved it. But i still think that Donnie Darko isn't a film everybody will like. People have different opinions and if you don't like this movie it doesn't mean that you're stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can be said about this movie that hasn't been said before? The film touches on so many points, one would think you would end up with a jumbled mess. But Darko is so well written and deftly filmed, not only does it work, it has something for everyone to identify with. This film will not easily be forgotten. By the end, most will be tempted to rewatch immediately. It's almost a necessity. Regardless of the haunted feeling it leaves you with, multiple viewings are not only required, but enjoyed. you'll be sure you missed something, which you probably have. This is how and why film is made. If you haven't seen this movie yet, drop everything and do it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Wonder It Is A Cult Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a science fiction psychological thriller that stars Jake Gyllenhaal in the title role together with Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wyle, Jena Malone, and Mary McDonnell. It depicts the adventures of the title character as he seeks the meaning and significance behind his troubling Doomsday-related visions.It was written and directed by Richard Kelly. Donnie is a bright and charming high-school student who also has a dark and willfully eccentric side as he does little to mask his contempt for many of his peers and enjoys challenging the authority of the adults around him.He also visited on occasion by Frank, a monstrous six-foot rabbit that only he can see who often urges him to perform dangerous and destructive pranks. Late one night, Frank leads him out of his home to inform him that the world will come to an end in less than a month. Later, the engine of a jet aircraft comes crashing through the ceiling of his room, making him think there might be something to Frank's prophesies after all. The rest of Donnie's world is only marginally less bizarre, as he finds himself dealing with his confused parents, his sister, his perplexed analyst, a rebellious English teacher, a sleazy self-help expert and the new girl at school who is attracted by Donnie's quirks.This film is a daring, original vision, packed with jarring ideas and intelligence and featuring a remarkable performance from Jake Gyllenhaal.Also,it is an unclassifiable but stunningly original film obliterates the walls between teen comedy, science fiction, family drama, horror, and cultural satire but it remains wildly entertaining throughout. The debut feature of writer-director Richard Kelly is a shattering, hypnotic work that sets its own terms and gambles-- rightfully so, as it turns out that a viewer will stay aboard for the full ride.No wonder it has become a cult classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately kept out of theaters because of 9/11 but later on it has become a cult movie, with good reason.Without giving away much of the story, Donnie Darko is a kid affected by schizophrenia.... but the movie soon turns into a metaphysical thriller where it's hard to distinguish reality from the distorted perception of the protagonist.Donnie Darko often wanders at night, led by hallucinations, and on one of those nights a mysterious man in a black rabbit suit warns him that the world will end in 24 days.... Is the world gonna end? Is he just crazy? Are there other mysterious forces at work? Those are just some of the many interesting questions we seek an answer for, while meditating on our own perception of reality and time.A very original story, great performances, an awesome 80s soundtrack and great direction in this masterpiece of modern cinematography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that seem to get lumped into two categories, love or hate by the way and not love or fear! It may not be easy to understand for some people and may take more than one viewing. Well I loved it from the first time I viewed it and have watched it several times. It is sort of a dark surrealistic with some humor. Great cast and acting for the most part. The story itself is pretty interesting and kept my interest. Has a great soundtrack that goes perfect with the tone of the film. And a few classic lines that crack me up every time I see it. Those who hate the movie may complain about it not making sense or that there are too many loose ends. Well personally I don't see that. True maybe everything about the characters are not explained for you but there are many movies out there that leave unanswered questions yet still are very popular, for example Alien, the pace jockey was never explained in that movie and it wasn't until a few decades later until it was and many people dissed that movie. Just an example of leaving something's unanswered isn't always a crime and in Donnie darko enough was told to make a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film and it's plot have been misunderstood as much as Donnie has been misunderstood by the rest of the characters. If you're looking for plot holes, you're missing the points it makes. It makes such great social commentary. The acting is so amazing. Some one said it was "weird for the sake of being weird" and that's just missing the point completely! It's being "weird" for the sake of the movie! It gives viewers the respect they deserve, which is none. It takes you on a crazy roller coaster and stops and tells you "There, it's done I don't care if you're happy!" It gives standard movie realism the respect it deserves, again - none! It's fiction for the sake of an awesome story. It leaves you thinking, but unapologetically and almost unintentionally. I enjoyed it till the last shot!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that stuns. Jake Gyllenhaal does great, as does the rest of the cast, and the writing is great. I am not fond of some of the depressing lines and scenes, but I understand it is fitting for this film, and does not reflect the actual feelings of the writers. It is sad at times, but other times it is hopeful. But it is always strange. Frank the Rabbit is a wonderful character, and a confusing one at that. The whole film is rather confusing, and you will read about it and watch it again, not only to understand it better and to pick up on more, but just to experience it again. An amazing movie, and one that I you will not forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>!SPOILERS!Although there is enough to find on the internet, I too wanted to give my vision on the interpretation of this godly work. I'll try to keep it short.I strongly recommend you to watch the directors cut and to visit the official DD site after watching the movie.startA tangent universe (TU) is created, this is an exact replica of the main universe (MU). A branch if you will from the main time-line. There is no particular reason for this.This would not be a problem, wasn't it for a small error made during this copy. An artifact is a erroneous double copy, in this case the jet engine. It has no place in that universe. Hence it just appears somewhere in the TU shortly after it has been created.The TU gets unstable by this artifact and will collapse on itself within a few weeks (28 days). If it does it will create a black hole that will destroy everything including the MUSo the jet engine needs to get back to the MU.Now you get one massive deus ex machina. Basically god, in whatever form you can think off will set out events that will lead to the return of the artifact to the MU.Donnie as the living receiver will be 'given' special powers. Those that die within the TU will also be able to guide Donnie (frank especially, but also Gretchen; manipulated dead) The rest unconsciously will help Donnie achieve his goal (manipulated living).Every event that happens happens for a reason, all events lead to Donnie being "forced" to return the engine to the MU (since the fate of all that exists depends on it). He rips it off the plane (using his special powers) and sends it back in time to the MU Oct 2nd (the origin of the TU time-line). The TU seizes to exist and Donnie is back in the MU, time did not seize to exist.The end?Now, there is a hole in this story. Now there are 2 copies of the engine in the MU. this is also confirmed on the official DD site. somehow the MU, the main time-line, gods main channel whatever you wanna call it is stable enough to support these artifacts and wont collapse, only a tangent one.I also like to think a TU is not a complete universe, its a small branch from a thicker branch. the world may be copied exactly but maybe not the whole universe.At the end you see Donnie laughing still having time to move away if he wanted. Theoretically he didn't have to die in the MU, but when he awoke in the MU he did not have the clear memories of the TU, for him it seemed like a dream, there wasn't really a reason for him to move.Kept it as short as I could. PM me if you like, I could make this story pages long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkably overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have long known of the high reputation of this film but, for one reason or another, had failed to see it until last night. I was surprised by how ordinary the film is; perhaps the original audiences were right when they made this a box office flop. In fact, only the reputation of this film kept me watching till the end. Otherwise I would have bailed out much earlier.The story is rather too thin to hang a 105 minute film on, yet despite the length and lack of plot, character development is minimal. In particular the self-help guru (Patrick Swayze, in a walk-on part) is poorly drawn. We neither care nor not care when his house is burned down by Donnie or when he is then revealed to be a paedophile. This latter revelation appears more to make us more sympathetic to Donnie, in what would otherwise be an appalling act of vandalism.Swayze's sidekick Joanie is equally unsympathetically drawn as an big mouthed ignoramus. She appears, when the necessity of the story dictates, as a cartoon villainess, although sometimes to advance what little plot there is, as when she gets Donnie's mother to go in her place to supervise a dance troupe. Another couple of cardboard cut-outs are the school bullies. Its saying something when Nelson Muntz from the Simpsons is a more flesh and blood creation. I guess it helps us sympathise with Donnie that he has these one-dimensional hypocrites to fight against, but it can hardly be said to be good writing.The other characters in Donnie's life are more sympathetic but equally one-dimensional. His family are, at best, sketched in. In keeping with Hollywood's modern mythology women=good, men=bad, Donnie's mother, his female councillor, his female teacher (Drew Barrymore) and his girlfriend are shown in the most kindly light, but hardly well drawn. Mary Mcdonnell makes the most of her slender part as his mother and is the stand out here.A major problem is the unsubtleness of the script. The writers should learn the old dictum "show not tell". So when a new cute girl is introduced she says "hi I've just been transferred here." banal enough but then the teacher invites her to sit next to the boy she likes and she chooses Donnie. Next we see him asking her to go out with him, which she agrees to, even after he's told her (in their first conversation) that he's burnt down a house. Donnie's got such a great seduction technique.Other story strands go nowhere. Barrymore is sacked late on for being too caring (Oh dear! Another gentle soul crushed by the repressive system), we must take this statement on trust, since we have not seen her methods apart from the above: allowing a new girl to pick her own seat, which incidentally requires another girl to be curtly told to move. That's OK though, she wasn't so cute.How can we then explain the reputation of this? The self consciously cool soundtrack, inappropriate yet designed to make the audience think "hey I remember that song". Set as it is just over a decade before it was released, when its target audience would have been becoming self aware, this built-in nostalgia is a comfort to them even as they delude themselves that the music might be in some way 'edgy'.Likewise, the sudden unexplained cuts and story strands left dangling will delude many that they are clever because they can get it while their supposed intellectual inferiors cannot. I personally have no problem with the unexplained time travel denouement, believing that mystery does have a place in story telling, but I do not think that Donnie Darko earned the right to such a device.The film certainly looks good, with several images which will stay with me, such as the scenes with Donnie prodding the rabbit's eye. For this reason I have rated it a 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is really a great accomplishment. It has started its own movement and some lackluster mock offs (see Chumscrubber). I think the film is best taken in as its constituent parts. There are some scenes in this movie that really have a bite to them. They really stick out as these great little vignettes. I'm thinking for instance of the first dining room scene with the Darko family. Or perhaps when Donnie is first hypnotized by his therapist.The ebb and flow of the movie works great as well. The whole time travel bit really fits in and gives the movie a spooky theme throughout.Even more importantly may be the theme and impact of the movie. Sometimes to put yourself in someone elses (or a type of person's) shoes, you need to break out of the element of both you and that person. In this case we're breaking out of our element into the movie and out of the element of a troubled teen into one of a young man faced with the issue of the fate of those around him and the paradoxes of time travel. In a spooky kind of way this gives us the feel of what it feels like to go through the early years of high school. Although it doesn't look like it at points, it certainly feels like it. And unlike many other movies, this really places us in that universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all time favorite movies. And that's nothing to be ashamed of.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko is a triumph. A film that is a simple character study at the start but evolves into a complex and thrilling story that seamlessly mixes a coming-of-age story and a science fiction based thriller all in one. On paper this film is far to advantageous to even consider being made. All of the characters are filled with turmoil and spend the majority of the film brooding over what will happen next. But to simply write this movie off as simple angst or the typical high school movie wouldn't do it justice. These characters wouldn't work if there wasn't a strong performance behind them. Every actor in this film gives a stunning performance. In particular Jake Gylenhaal, Jena Malone, and Drew Barrymore. If any woman was able to pull off a scene where she screams the f-bomb for 20 seconds it is Drew. The story here is completely unoriginal in base (angsty teenage boy meets new girl at school etc.) but becomes original through concept and through the science aspect that is quite skillfully weaved throughout. From the opening shot to the ending credits you will find yourself completely immersed in these characters, their individual stories, and the overall tragic conclusion they are all absent-mindedly going towards. If anything can be said in defense for this film it should be it's ending. Heart-breaking, somewhat confusing, but overall moving. The song "Mad World" is used quite effectively in, what I consider to be, one of the greatest and most human montages ever filmed. The movie is great. Nothing I say in this review is going to guarantee that you see it but I would highly recommend that if you have the slightest desire to watch this you should give it a shot. It is one of my all time favorite films and I believe that it deserves repeated viewings. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! A real refrigerator talk film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock used to talk about moviegoers who would come home, take some cold chicken out of the icebox, and talk about what they'd just seen. He called it refrigerator talk. Well, in the computer age, "Donnie Darko" engenders a lot more than refrigerator talk. One can find endless discussion of this film on the Internet.On the face of it, Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a schizophrenic teen on and off his meds. He takes orders from a giant bunny rabbit. Remember "Harvey?" This is "Harvey" standing on its big bunny ears - not a benign, invisible friend, but an evil-looking rabbit ordering Donnie to commit acts that cause chaos and even death.So is this is a wormhole movie, an indictment on the public school system (as the director says), or the story of a deeply disturbed young man with strange dreams? I don't know. Whatever it is, "Donnie Darko" is a very provocative film and well worth viewing. It also has a great soundtrack that includes the intriguing song "Mad World" - the Adam Lambert version of this song plays on "General Hospital" every time James Franco walks on camera.Gyllenhaal is ably supported by Katharine Ross, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore, Mary McDonnell, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jenna Malone, and Noah Wylie.See it for yourself and make your own decisions: schizophrenic, dreamer, time traveler, all three - or something else? A fascinating film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not a bird or a plane! It's Donnie Darko!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko explores many genres of film, from teen alienation to sci-fi, it's all in there! This is one of those films that are impossible to explain in one sitting. It will take much researching to understand the core plot of the film, and even then there are different theories on what actually takes place on screen.To put it as simply as possible Donnie Darko explores the theory of time travel. Darko, Jake Gyllenhaal, is a troubled teen who is plagued by visions of a six foot tall bunny rabbit, with an abundant knowledge of the universe. A crazy premise I know, but Darko is after all a crazy individual. The story follows him as he tries to make some sense of what is taking place. Everything in the film seems to have some divine purpose, and there is an overwhelming sense of enlightenment when the film comes to an end.The acting is superb, the film sees the partnership of real life brother and sister, Maggie and Jake Gyllenhaal, as on-screen siblings. The cast as a whole lends itself perfectly to Richard Kelly's script. The special effects are a credit to the plot and the directing is spot on. Also the sound track is stroke of genius! Simply put there is nothing bad about this film! If you are a fan of good movie making then I suggest you see this film, it easily deserves its cult status and will amaze and bewilder all audiences. If I had to complain about anything to do with this film it could only be the existence of the sequel. S. Darko is an affront to the first film, take my advice and stick to the original masterpiece, you will not be disappointed! Unless you like sappy romance films with rugged heartthrobs as leading men, in which case you will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The power of this film derives from its ambiguity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with other user comments about how the Director's Cut spoils the film by removing the ambiguities over its meaning; instead the viewer is asked to accept a load of sci-fi twaddle about time-travelling.What really comes through for me in this movie is the disturbing effect that mental illness, and the drugs used to treat it, can have on a person's sense of self. From personal experience I am very aware how fragile reality, and particularly the linear nature of time, can appear to those in the grip of such a disturbance.By extension, it is impossible to say that such a view of reality is not at least plausible; and I would also point any film lover to the movie "Jacob's Ladder", which also explores the idea of alternate, parallel realities."Jacob's Ladder" spoiler coming ... !To say that Jacob Singer, the protagonist in that film, is simply experiencing a hallucination destroys the power of "Jacob's Ladder" in the same way that making a similar assumption about Donnie Darko does. The point is that both explanations may be true, and may exist side-by-side.The final scene of "Donnie Darko", where Donnie lies on his bed laughing as he experiences the epiphany of having all the story's events fall into place in his mind, is truly frightening - but it is so because of the ambiguous nature of those events; not because he's some time-travelling superhero, but because he is mentally ill and his view of reality is corrupted. Likewise, the film is affecting precisely because when it ended, you're not sure what happened.It is this quality that makes the film so powerful, and the Director's Cut with all its silly exposition about time travel just makes it into a geekfest. A triumph for editors Sam Bauer and Eric Strand, then. (Yep, had to look them up.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most beautiful film ever made on the history of the earth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko.Richard Kelly once made a masterpiece. And this was it.Donnie Darko follows the signature character. Oddly enough called.. Donnie Darko. We learn early on that this boy is disturbed, and has problems with home life, and social life. One evening, Donnie finds himself awoken by a mysterious voice, which he follows to a golf course. Stood on the golf course is Frank, a rabbit. Frank tells Donnie that the end of the world is coming.SPOILER---------- as this is happening, a plane engine falls through Donnie's bedroom. Luckily he wasn't inside. Could this be a final destination thing? Donnie obviously doesn't die, and from that point karma becomes a bitch and his life is turned upside down. The only good thing is Gretchen. A new student to Donnie's school, who takes an active interest in him. Donnie goes about his life, however Frank still appears and tells Donnie to commit crimes. Mentally unstable? You'd think so. This mystery comes to a head on Halloween, the night that the world is supposedly going to end. On this night, Gretchen is run over by Frank, who turns out to be a teenager in a rabbit costume. Consumed by guilt and mentally unable to take this, Donnie shoots Frank and steals his car driving to the place we began on. In the middle of nowhere he sits and watches the world end. This is all really and happening to him. But as the world ends, a portal opens and Donnie goes through it back to the night that we were first introduced to Frank. And as he laughs, we realize that he is pleased that he is about to die. Hes pleased with the knowledge that he met someone he loved, and he lived his life, even if he has to go back and end it all for someone else to live. With the knowledge of Gretchen never knowing him, he turns off his light and goes to sleep. For the last time.The way we know this, is that when Gretchen pulls up on her bike outside the Darko house, she and Donnie's grieving mother have a moment of recognition. A sign that they know that each one of them cared and loved him. Even though Gretchen supposedly never knew Donnie. END OF SPOILER--------As it is, this film to me is perfect. It took me a lot of viewing to come to this conclusion, and god knows I'm probably wrong. But this is how i see it, and it causes me to adore this film.Richard Kelly? I love you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely give movies such high marks, but I find nothing to pick apart in Donnie Darko. Everything down to the soundtrack is just so perfect. The story revolves around a teen held back in school for anti-social behavior. It is established early in the film that he is seeing a therapist for issues and is on medication. So this film has you wondering if Donnie is a mentally ill teen seeing things or someone caught up in supernatural events? By the end of this movie you will be in complete awe of the outcome. I just about guarantee you will view it again to see the subtle hints and nuances that make the story so unique. I just purchased my DVD from the store last night and viewed it three times already. It is an incredible masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The bottom line.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie after having seen many comments about how great it was. Fortunately I never read any of the spoilers. In fact, I never even read a synopsis of the plot. But, unfortunately I had great expectations for this film. Saddly, the movie did not live up to them. Most of the reviewers who gave this 5 or less stars I generally agree with on their comments.The bottom line is this.*Spoiler coming*.This is about a teen who has psychological problems. There's also a half-baked, pseudo-science fiction theme about time travel here. The night that the jet engine falls on the Darko house, we are led to believe that Donnie gets out of bed to follow a voice which turns out to be Frank the rabbit. From that point on the movie unfolds through the numerous events until Donnie is given a choice to pass through a wormhole back in time to before his girlfriend gets killed. He does so and ends up back in his bed the very night the engine falls on him. Well, it's quite simple to explain that everything that happens to Donnie before his death is all in his mind. The time travel is related to the fact that right before his death, his life flashes before his eyes, but it's not his past life, it's his future if he were to get up out of that bed before his fated death. He sees all these consequential events happen, lives them in his mind for a supposed 28 days. But in fact, it all happens within minutes. He decides in the end not to get out of his bed knowing the fate that awaits him, and he is free from himself. The movie is a whole illusion playing out inside Donnie's mind.</fullReview>

I can write a plot with ambiguity and absurd open ends thankyou very much...Its not that the director is somehow cleverer than all of us and can see the "hidden genius"...its just that it IS totally ambiguous and disjointed!(eg, the character and the post box; remember that? WHAT did that mean to anyone?)For me Donnie Darko is very much like the opening of a modern art exhibition crammed with wanna-be intellectuals. Everyone is so obsessed with what they think they are SUPPOSED to be seeing they cant see the wood for trees and realise what their looking at (when taken at FACE VALUE; ignoring hype) ..is actually nothing special.The EMPERORS NEW CLOTHES all over again, everyone is so desperate to appear "cinema-chic" they block out reality..Nobody wants to be the one to say what they really think.YES its a good film, NO its NOT some kind of ultra intelligent; neo-horror/sci fi classic.Forget the hype, watch with an open mind and see it for what it is...</fullReview>

Donnie Darko is this kind of psycho/sci-fi/teen-drama/action moviemix like for example "Brick" etc. Its a typical "stoner" kind of movie that you just throw into your DVD Player and enjoy the nice vibes and scenes of it without paying too much attention to the plot. But I also can understand negative comments towards this film here. Why? Because it isn't suited for people that always feel the need to make sense of it and are constantly in search of an realistic plot. Yet I have to admit that even I found it sometimes a bit too "of the hook"......not a movie for realists but for dreamers ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not weird</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand why people call DD weird. While I would never call this movie a classic, in the end, its nothing more than a camp new package for a forgotten theme. In terms of genre, I would say it is a pretty standard example of the written science fiction of the golden age (50's, 60's) combined with some good old Stephen King scares. I just think contemporary movie goers aren't used to science fiction films without things that go boom. Three factors combine to make this movie seem strange: its soft science-fiction applications (fiction loosely based on science or fantasy), the age-group of the characters and the comical special effects that make it seem more juvenile. (Perhaps making it more appealing to a younger audience.) These things detract from what is otherwise a lovely ramble down the 80's memory lane, (semi-biographical of the director's) and a perceptive look at a teenage boy's existential crisis. On the whole, I think its a good movie for teenagers and parents to watch. Take the science fiction out of the movie and you'll see a very scary look at how middle class children are raised today. Cared for by well-meaning but wishy-washy parents and confused by sanitized psycho- social babble and drugs.I give the director/screenwriter some kudos for having the gumption to not just pose the question, but an answer too. So many so-called serious film makers don't do that anymore. (From his commentaries on the DVD, its clear that the director doesn't really know he did that in defiance of conventions. Maybe if he did, he'd make other cool movies.) In the end DD has to decide what he believes, make his peace, and shrug his shoulders.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No film is a 10 if you need a manual to go with it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with Donnie Darko is that you cannot really understand this movie without either buying the director's cut version or finding a website to explain the point. Supposedly the real plot had to do with tangential universes. Unfortunately, you can't figure this out on your own. The director of this movie actually wrote out about 10 pages of the 'Philosophy of Time Travel' book that Donnie is given, and you can find these pages to be read on the internet, as well as on the DVD. You can't really understand this movie without glancing at those pages, or having the movie explained to you in some other way, and I have a problem with that. Though I'm not saying that a movie can't be good if you don't understand it the first time (I actually enjoyed having to watch it a few times to understand it), I was disappointed with the fact that it was only after reading a list of questions/answers about the plot and subplot did I understand what the director was trying to say. That's kind of disappointing...a film isn't really that great if you need extensive explanation on its meaning. I think the director assumed that his audience would be able to understand too much with no explanation of what was going on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Migraine-Inducing But Fascinating Stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies take many years to achieve cult status; others become objects of cult adoration relatively quickly. "Donnie Darko," released several weeks after 9/11, has achieved that quantum leap to cult status faster than any film I know. I've never seen so many laudatory reviews here on the IMDb, where over 1,700 (!) people have taken the time to sing the film's praises. Having now finally seen the movie, I can understand its cult appeal. Dealing with an emotionally troubled youth, Donnie Darko, who is not only in therapy and on prescribed psychotropic drugs but who is also possibly hallucinating a death's-head, man-sized bunny rabbit, the film dishes out a story involving time travel, alternate universes and kozmik wormholes. The picture has been impeccably made by tyro writer/director Richard Kelly (and for only $4.5 million!), is well performed by the entire cast (how nice to see Katharine Ross on screen again!), and features excellent use of '80s pop tunes, especially "The Killing Moon" by Echo and the BUNNYMEN and Tears for Fears' "Mad World." Too bad the film is also hopelessly confusing. I've watched the darn thing twice on DVD already, and although the second viewing (with the English subtitles on) did clear up some matters, too many questions remain, and still left me scratching my head. One can get a migraine trying to riddle out all the temporal paradoxes and Mobius-like plot convolutions hinted at here. Thus, the aforementioned cult, spending endless days picking at clues and debating this brainteaser no end. But as Donnie himself says somewhere in the film while talking about God, one can debate some subjects forever and still not come up with concrete answers. And that's just how I feel about Kelly's film. Still, pretty fascinating stuff...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by reminding my readers Donnie Darko is not a bad movie. Jake gyleminahalfardein or whatever does an exceptional job as the weirded out high schooler with evil bunny vision and supersonic god hearing. The movie is set-up nicely and paced right on time. The idea, though not concrete is original and intriguing and is a potential conversation storm. Thus, I cannot give "Donnie Darko" any less than a 7/10, but it's flaws detract from its success. When I watch a movie, I need to have images and themes bootprinted in my brain like jackie chan just kicked my ass....brain or something like that....anyways, one reason this movie failed to be great is it tries to be classic. They try to inject Donnie with super smart intelligence and emotional anti-social speeches which just don't move me in the slightest. I wasn't even nudged by his "gripping" lunch room monologue. I don't like subplotting religion into a film like its supposed to be some sort of subliminal message only heard by listeners and then calling the bulk of said message science fiction because you add some time travel and an exploding plane. You have to give me downright explosiveness to be considered for my top 250, nevertheless my top 100. Yes, Donnie Darko is an exceptional piece of artwork. No it does not deserve to higher than Full Metal Jacket. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much sizzle, little steak. Wait, not much sizzle, either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a Johnny-come-lately to the Darko phenomenon, so I suppose I was somewhat set up for disappointment by the hype this movie has received on the internet and elsewhere. Catchphrases and visual references abound in people's sig-files, so at long last, in the interests of cultural literacy, I had to check it out.My verdict: not bad. But not nearly good enough.The movie's plot has been hashed out in many venues, and I won't spoil anything here (though I will note that I haven't encountered a better set-up for an O-Henry plot twist in a long while). So let's focus on the more numinous qualities which have to sell this movie: The acting is competent throughout, sometimes very fine, as in the title performance by a young Jake Gyllenhaal, and particularly in an unusually understated turn by too-often too-shrill Drew Barrymore, who manages to convey more bitter superiority in a few glances than most people could with a shriek. The cast is weighted down by a number of over-padded parts, however...Swayze serves a purpose here, but why is so much screen-time devoted to Beth Grant? She overacts miserably, and takes what should be a modern "Turn of the Screw" into the over-the-top territory of "Heathers." It jars.And what's up with the visuals? For a fantasy/sci-fi/psychological film like this one, however, I expected a good deal more...well, competence. The editing is often spastic when it shouldn't be (an early dinner-table conversation in the Darko household snaps back and forth from speaker to speaker like a badly-done MtV video) and too damn slow when it should rivet (several of the key 'demon rabbit' scenes are, frankly (hah!) boring). Maybe that's a problem with the director's cut alone.And then there's the sadly unfinished feeling to the plot. The whole goal of this movie is to bring things around in a big circle, to provide perfect closure. That narrative structure is completely inconsistent with the looping, inconclusive dialog. And where's the meaning? Roll your own? Look, I recognize that the screenwriter/director is grappling with weighty issues, and one of his points is that there are no easy answers. Thanks, anyone past middle-school knows that. So there should be something more substantive to chew on here and...well, there just isn't. Many overly-broad philosophical conversations between characters drift off into uncomfortable silence, and I'm left with the sense that I'm wasting time.Maybe that's the real point of the movie: time is precious. So don't waste. By, like, you know, watching movies.Grade: C+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You guys are thinking way to hard about this film. Kelly explains what's happening in the special edition, but as the director, he shouldn't have to explain anything. Any screenplay book going back to dinosaurs like Syd Field will tell you that. If everything works out, the film asks the questions in the beginning, and answers them in the end. It's an independent film made by a eager young artist fresh out of school. He probably thinks a lot like David Lynch, and Lynch is the master of not explaining anything. Kelly, like Lynch, wanted ambiguity in its meaning, and folks, he got it. Big time. Now, don't get me wrong - I liked it (especially where he threatened his sister about the garbage disposal) and hell, I own it. But it's an independent film for a reason.For what it is I give it 10/10, and wish him the best in future films. He's probably the envy of all his classmates to this day...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This quirky little film is, simply, one of my picks for Top 10 Films of all time. I cannot express how much I enjoy this film, nor have even a remote count the number of times I've seen it.Cast is solid, complex, and perfect in their roles. The plot will make you scratch your head for years to come-- is Donnie crazy? The Messiah? A Super Hero? You figure it out.One note for all that have not seen this film-- see the original, not the Director's Cut. Changes made in the director's cut, in my view, add nothing to film, and actually reduce the impact (and lose some of the cooler music). The original release is much better. The DVD extra scenes are great, but for whatever reason, they didn't end up splicing them into the Director's Cut (which MIGHT have made it better).Aside from just being a great film, this flick is also a great encapsulating of the 1980's. Music is great, especially if you were a fan of New Wave alternative bands like Echo and the Bunnymen back then.</fullReview>

Donni's mother dies with his sister in the plane. As a result of Donnie's actions, some people are better off, while others are worse off, like the guilt of Frank, not to mention his eye.

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko, a highly intelligent but troubled teenager is trying to cope with possibly intermittent episodes of schizophrenia, or are these dilutions and "Frank the rabbit" projections from the future? Donnie has been troubled with emotional problems for years for which he takes medication for and sees Physcologist. His problems get worst went a stray aircraft engine falls from the sky and demolishes his bed room, he is only saved because he had slept walked that night to the near by golf course and returns home that morning to see the results of this incidence. After being told in Donnie's second reality by Frank, the rabbit masked person, the world will end in 28 days Donnie's next four weeks find him grappling with depressive thoughts, destructive feelings and the concept of time travel. A new girl to his English class adds romance to the story adding another dimension to her place in the time continuum. Well thought-out story line and occasional black humour make this movie very entertaining, an emotional roller coaster to say the least, definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting movie about one' s self.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is unfortunate that this movie was a commercial disappointment. In Hollywood, the "formula" for a successful movie seems to be in making three times what is cost to produce that movie. "Donnie Darko" did not do it. This movie is an interesting interpretation about mental health / hygiene.Whether or not one appreciates the status of one's emotional stability is NOT important. This movie captures the essence for those unfortunate ones suffering these afflictions.Jake Gyllenahaal definitely gets to the emotional core of his character. And, much praise to Drew Barrymore and all for producing this film.Whether we like it or not, one has to acknowledge that this is a widely studied, but highly treatable segment in our society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely good, but disturbing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having personal experience of mental illness, I found this movie both heartbreaking and brilliant. It can be difficult to capture the emotion and Jake Gyllenhaal does an awesome job. Paranoid schizophrenics can appear, to the outside world to be normal people, but with an anxiety, stress or aggression complex. Donnie Darko captures the aggressive emotions of Donnie, without generalizing that all schizophrenics have the same emotions or symptoms.I understand that the movie is usually generalized as sci-fi, but I think that it is definitely sci-fi with a difference. For a movie that appears, at first glance, to be so 'out there' it is surprisingly real. I thought it was a brilliant movie of the struggle of a young boy trying to escape both the real world, in which he has so much trouble surviving in, and his other world, which influences him to do so much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie appeals more to a younger audience because so much of it is based on rebellion. The stupid principal, the stupid teacher, the stupid Patrick Swayze, the stupid parents (the mother and father listening to extreme gross language at the dinner table), all this is what would appeal to people who do not yet know who they are and don't want older people to have any say in it. But, the idea of a guy who was so self-absorbed and learned one of the great scientific ideas ever (time travel) and then used it to save the life of his girlfriend, while also juvenile, was nevertheless kind of impressive. Great coincidences (the engine, the wallet), gutsy scenes (under hypnosis near-auto-eroticism) and Jake Guyllenhal is always interesting to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most original movies of the decade so far....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's how the movie begins...a teenager who's on medication walks in his sleep and meets a giant bunny rabbit. This rabbit tells Donnie to do various deeds of vandalism. Sounds stupid? Hardly...! You'll know what I mean if you sit through this incredibly riveting drama full of brilliance! Superficially "Donnie Darko" would seem to be a story of a troubled teen who hallucinates.But as the story progresses, you begin to realize that its something much more complex and unimaginable! The movie is, as the reader must already know (if he/she has heard about it), very difficult to comprehend in the first attempt. This is one of those movies that require repeated viewing, but it hardly bores the viewer, because it has so much new to offer in each viewing! As you watch it over you will notice the finer points you missed in the preceding viewing.Great acting from Jake Gyllenhaal and the supporting crew. If possible, rent the theatrical edition DVD first. Although the Director's Cut has been criticized, it will facilitate better understanding of the movie; yet, keep it as a second choice.Donnie Darko is one of the most original movies I have ever seen, and is a must-see. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Ghost Story: Lynch meets Brady Bunch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My main take on this gem of a film? the whole problem may be that American kids are over medicated. Screw the shrinks and the pills they hawk. Donnie takes his pills and POW ? he winds up talking to his low budget rabbit head buddy. The soothing rabbit voice doesn't fit the toothy skull face, and the rest of the outfit is from Cheapsville. It's derivative of Matt Groening's rabbit in his early "Life in Hell" comic. Poor Donnie lives in an upper class Republican enclave, with a school dress code that reeks. His house has an elegant chandelier in the magnificent stairway, and a Porsche in the garage. It's these kind of top 5% folks that get the tax cuts and will pay shrinks $200 per hour, then think they are doing the right thing by showing their love with pills. When things don'ts seem to be working well, why not double the dose? At the end, his Mom and kid sister are on a 747 and it seems to hit a storm, loses it's engine, which falls through a wormhole back in time 28 days to strike the house again, changing the Fabric of Time, so that the plane doesn't crash, right? I am thinking the whole movie is a construct so that Donnie gets to go back, in a parallel universe, to fall in love and get laid, so that he won't feel so ALONE, so he could take down Jim Cunningham, so he could double up on his meds.Back t o the end again, Donnie drives away from home with dead Gretchen, like he knows he will meet the blinding light that will blast him back in the past. Earlier, the rabbit told Donnie the portal is Jim's house, but Donnie drives up into the hills.Donnie puts an axe in the top of the Mong sculpture, but it looks like they could fix it with a bit of bondo. Why does the private school PTA ask for public donations to help fix it? I did like that line, "Feces are baby mice." Speaking of sexy smurfs, Drew Barrymore looks great, but acts dumb as a teacher. The new girl is told to pick the boy she thinks is the cutest, and then Drew orders Joanie to surrender her seat. Joanie should have pitched a bitch.Overall, this is film is tremendous. I am only complaining about it because I haven't been taking my meds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko thoughts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Donnie Darko was awesome! Its a great movie to get you thinking and what not..but there was just two technicality.. At the end of the movie when his lying in bed and the jet engine falls through the roof into his bedroom, if it were correct that whole street would have been disintegrated with the force of that jet engine as it would have generated so much energy. And the other was how come near the start of the movie Donnie's therapist informed his parents she wanted to put up the dosage of his medication, whilst later on she told him not to have them anymore as they were only placebos? Was she just pretending that they were placebos or she wanted him to believe that the medication was changing him even though it really wasn't? Besides that I think Donnie Darko was wonderfully made, filmed and acted. I recommend anyone who hasn't watched it, does! This ones a keeper guys!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mind-blowing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" is one of those movies that you have absolutely no idea what happened when you go through and watch it for the first time. What you do know, though, is that it was amazing. You will have to watch it more than once and deliberate for hours if you want to figure out what happened. It's a psychological kind of movie that will keep you guessing and that is what makes it good.It is about a boy named Donnie Darko who is suffering from schizophrenia. He is met by a man in a rabbit suit who saves him from being killed and who tells him that the world will end by the end of the month. The rest of the movie builds up to the mind-blowing conclusion which is what will make you think about it for a long time. You'll think you have it figured out, then watch it again and realize that you're completely wrong.A fantastic story with a wonderful way of telling it. A truly monumental film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard abit about this film and how it was a new cult phenomenon. At the beginning of watching it i was ready to expect anything out of the comments i had heard. Going through Donnie Darko it made me think of how the creator of this film could have thought out such a masterpiece. Jake Gyllenhaal did some of the best acting i have ever seen...ever. I felt as though it was him going through this crazy series of events. The other actors blended into his performance perfectly and gave a brilliantly real impression of this story.I have had to watch the film a few times too fully understand it but now i think i do and it shows how great and complex, while at the same time simple this story is. I am still a young person, maybe i don't understand this film as i should cause of my developing brain, but it pointed out some interesting questions about the whole thing with reality.This may not be The Best Movie of all time, as a movie . But if you asked me which movie made me think about this world and my reality and had the most influence, then this one hits the spot.I don't know if a movie will ever be made with such poinience ever again as this film has made me think a lot more then boring RE lessons or will make me feel so weird about this weird world.I implore you to watch it and feel what i have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but not Thought-Provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm just after watching Donnie Darko, and It held my attention till the end. There's some brilliantly chosen music in the movie, egg. Joy Division's "Love will tear us apart" and that other one that was number 1 for like 2 months a few years ago.However I didn't think Donnie Darko was as thought-provoking as such movies as "Contact" and "A clockwork orange", or even "Fight Club". It's in the same genre as "Final Destination", but better. Its essentially a teen-horror-SF combo, with a bit of a love story mixed in, but It didn't really grab me.For some reason its set in the 80's, and it reminded me of "ET". The ending confused me somewhat. did the planes engine enter a wormhole or what? Anyway it made me think about life a bit, and I suppose thats good, but it definitely wouldn't be in my to 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well after seeing this film, i wanted right away to figure it out. Easier said then done. I wanted to piece the puzzles together. After reading many user comments about the film, I started digging deeper. Some people seemed to feel that "what if" time travel would let us change our choices, but taking out our bad might cause others harm.The best example i have found of this (just watched movie like 30 mins ago) is that if donnie lived, His Girlfriend would die and if he lived, she would die. And no matter what you do, Time respun or redone will just rotate the good/bad that happens to us all anyway. Now i wonder if i should watch this movie again? I think no right now, but i surely give this movie a 5 star rating!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie and great example of a paradox!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is an excellent movie! The more I watch it, the more I love it. I recommend to anybody who is willing to think about a movie. If you prefer not to put thought into a movie, do not watch it. If you do choose to watch this movie, keep in mind that missing a lot of the movie will impair your ability to understand it. So, if you want to understand this movie, watch it all.I love the fact that you need to think about this movie to understand it. This makes it different from many movies. You can understand many movies by just watching them, but you cannot do that with Donnie Darko! You have to think about this movie after it is over. You may even have to watch it several times, which is what I recommend doing. I think many of the people who do not like this movie should try doing that.I also love the fact that so many questions remain unanswered, thus leaving the movie open to interpretation.I rated Donnie Darko 9/10, as opposed to 10/10, because there is always room for improvement.I would try to explain the paradox presented by this movie, but I do not know if I can do that without making this review too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is an unusual film with very loose plot, cheap character development, and sci-fi, phantasmagoric occurrences to hold it together. The visuals are great, the music tightly integrated, and the rather contrived plot twists are enjoyable. It is so well edited that I kept looking for more profound insights or meaning, but they never arrived. Several profound concepts are never satisfactorily explored, and the film rests on undeveloped cliché characters. The scenes with Donnie's therapist are the most shallow and allow the frustrating consequences to unfold. There could easily have been more actual depth rather then just the pretension of such.</fullReview>

I'm a hebephonic schitzophrenic which made the film much more important to me. First of all the story is amazing, richard k. did an amazing job in creating his characters in showing maturation and development. Even donnie's smallest or quickest remarks were important to the film. it helps to understand donnie if you want to understand the film because there are soooo many subplots, points of discussion, and commonly debated pieces of the film ranging from superheroes (Donnie Darko, Klark Kent, Bruce Banner, Peter Parker all superheroes-catch the similarity), Christ(at the movies the last temptation of Christ was showing, also, donnie's self sacrifice in order to save the lives of those he cared about) and the films overall significance as a modern piece of art. watch it many times and love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether you are 45, or about 30 years younger, you may feel just the same as Donnie.Adoloscent existentialism is not that far removed from the middle aged variety. The flavours change a little but the essential ingredients don't. Everybody has a Frank on-board.The fact that this film takes aim at the hypocrisy in modern conservative culture, while portraying the reality that ultimately the same fears grip us all, just makes it all the more satisfying. And the 80's music redeems an entire decade of popular culture.If you don't get this you have been watching too many Anthony Robbins DVDs.</fullReview>

All the same, after seeing the comment about it not being as good as the original, I quickly signed up and decided to now write a comment of my own. Personally I love this movie! I can truly say that it is one of my favorite movies. I do not believe that there is a better actor to play this role than Jake Gyllenhaal! The plot is great, the actors superb, and it is an overall very thought-provoking movie. I think that the more times you see it, the more you learn from it. Also you constantly realize new things and themes in the movie, which is great! It's like reading Catcher in the Rye. Every time you read it, something new pops up into your head; I love that feeling! I recommend it to everyone from the age of 12. Shirah (14 years old, living in Germany)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every now and again you watch a movie that completely blows you away. You spend the rest of that day just thinking about it, wishing you had never seen it just so you could watch it for the first time again. For me, this is it. As good as it gets. Following the story of strange yet utterly cool Donnie Darko, the film is refreshing in it's content. Although the theme is not entirely clear at stages, subjects are raised that keep the viewer utterly engrossed, even if a little uncomfortable. The characters and scenes are so fantastically written and directed that every moment of the movie is a joy to watch. With acting to match - Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead role is one to watch - captivating filming techniques, quality cinematography and a soundtrack to perfectly capture the time, 'Donnie Darko' has earned itself cult status. I know this film isn't for everyone but I don't think their should be a film lover who hasn't at least tried it, simply a must.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko: Cerebral Workout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is an original science fiction film that leaves a thoughtful viewer pondering well after the closing credits. Plot Summary: The story chronicles the strange experiences of Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllanhaal), a sensitive and intelligent high school student struggling with schizophrenia. His schizophrenic episodes, and the imaginary friend he interacts with during them, seem to give him supernatural powers that manifest themselves in reality, which brings into question whether these experiences are fantasy at all! This uncertainty of fantasy and reality continues throughout the film. When a motivational speaker comes to town preaching about the harmfulness of being inhibited by personal fears, Donnie chastises him, claiming that he is not realistic. He asserts that there are problems in this world that are more complicated, that cannot be remedied so easily.On a lighter side, the film resembles many of suburban teen films of the 80's, almost to the point of parody. There's the Asian girl who is aggressively assaulted by bullies and has a crush on Donnie, the relationship Donnie establishes with an out of town girl trying to escape a difficult past, the quarreling between Donnie and his Harvard-bound sister, the dead beat dim-wits Donnie hangs out with, and the retro soundtrack used during scenes in and around the high schoolThe most haunting part of this film is how so many of the characters seem as if they know more than they let on; that they understand something that we don't. I wish they would let me know because I have yet to reach a satisfactory understanding of the film ? it will, therefore, require a second watching which I look forward to because it is, indeed, entertaining, cerebral and well-acted.</fullReview>

Richard Kelly is a good director and writer, who I've never even heard of before this movie, and at a young age this guy is going to have a great future up ahead. The film is pretty dark and is highly bizarre, which actually is a good thing, because the whole story is very dark. The acting is very good especially Jake Gyllenhaal, he is a phenomenal actor. The humour is spread out all over the movie and has a lot of funny scenes such as the speech with Jim Cunningham. Overall, a great movie that has an excellent sense of originality.

		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" is one of the best movies of 2001. I rate is like a thousand. Yes, it is THAT great. Evil bunny telling someone what to do, ah, classic. If your into weird/freaky movies then this is a must see. On top of it all the main character is hot. The ending is terribly sad and I can't get it out of my head but it was such a shock to me what happened. I never really thought that that would happen. Even though in real life an airplane engine would like never fall in your room. It's like a one out of one hundred chance. At the time this movie appeared on screen I wasn't old enough to enjoy such a movie. All in all, this movie rocks your socks so hard that your grandma has to wear slippers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Words can't describe the true greatness of this movie. But it pains me to no end to have some idiot Ben Stiller/Adam Sandler-lover to come up to me and say how they saw the movie, thought it was cool but didn't understand it. I used to give them a complex answer that would make there head spin, but now I'm so sick of them I narrow it down to "watch the Director's Cut". What also gets me is the people who think they are cool because they "know the secret of Donnie Darko". So what? Everyone has there own idea about it, so why should I care what they think? It is fun to tell them that what they thought of the movie was flat out wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The majority of films i tend to watch are for the sole purpose of entertainment , but however when the magic of that film stays with long after the film has finished then it has indeed served its purpose . Donnie Darko is a film that does that for me , this film drew me into a world where nothing is what it seems like at all , we are taken on journey where i believe we experience the chaos theory and we are told that everything that we do has a consequence . The film it-self has a sense of humour but also retains that certain level of being creepy . With a twist that is added on to every level of the film up to the climax leaving people a little dazed and confused . This film is certainly not one to view just for entertainment purposes as it will probably get you thinking a lot and it is not for people with a short attention span as you have to follow it very carefully . However i defiantly recommend this film , add this to your films to watch before i die list .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twisted and dark cult film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With more than a touch of 'It's a Wonderful Life' and 'Harvey', albeit with a decidedly odd twist, Richard Kelly's debut feature is a clever and thought-provoking piece of sci-fi.Donnie (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is a troubled teenager in therapy, a schizophrenic with imaginary friends - Frank the evil rabbit - and aspirations to travel through time. Add to this bodily projections carving out each person's path through life, a mad old lady always checking her mailbox, portals, Graham Greene's classic short story 'The Destroyers', a creepy self-help guru (played by Patrick Swayze), and a girl dance troupe, and gel it all together with an 80s score and that famous cover of 'Mad World', and you have a recipe for success.But does it work? From the strange opening premise, as destruction comes to the Darko house in the form of a fallen jet engine, through to the bleak and haunting finale, it's a valiant try, but for all it's good points, it feels a little sterile and undeveloped.Familiar faces such as Katharine Ross (The Graduate), Mary O'Donnell (Dances With Wolves), Noah Wyle (ER), and Drew Barrymore add interest, but the focus is strictly on Donnie himself, and he ultimately leaves us baffled.</fullReview>

If anyone likes Thrillers or Dark Movies they should see this.When I first saw this I was freaked out and did not get the storyline very well. I did like the aspect of it though.The second time I saw it I though so much more of it and that what a brilliant mind created this.One Of my favorite movies along with Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Holy Grail, and Clockwork Orange.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko(The Directors Cut)has to be one of the greatest movies of my lifetime (Which, for 13 years, is pretty short), and quite possibly one of the greatest supernatural movies ever. First,I'll start off with the story. The story of Donnie Darko is a mix of humor, horror, romance,comedy, and the supernatural. I don't want to give too much away, but I'll give the main part of the story:Donnie Darko is your average teenager living in the late 80's. He has an average suburban family: A strict mom, a laid back football obsessed father, a (semi)rebellious sister, and a little sister who is interested in dancing. He has slacker friends, some school enemies, and a girl whom he has a crush on. Oh yeah, did I mention that he is frequently visited by a six foot tall demon bunny named Frank?That's all I'll say, you'll just have to see the movie to find out more. Besides a superb story, D. Darko has excellent music, exquisite acting and phenomenal directing; a combination that will truly blow your mind.Donnie Darko is a movie that you literally have to see to believe, and an experience that you'll never forget. 10 out of 10 and my highest recommendations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm an atheist, and this movie was a religious experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is your typical screwed-up teenager who, through a cosmic accident, becomes the most important person in the universe. After a giant bunny rabbit saves Donnie from being killed by a jet engine that drops through his bedroom, Donnie begins a journey through a "tangent universe", in which he is carefully shepherded into an action to preserve the "real" universe. You must see the Director's Cut in order to have a chance of understanding the circumstances which lead to Donnie's final decision, although many people prefer the ambiguity of the original theatrical release.The acting in this movie is top notch, which can only be attributed to director/writer Richard Kelly's amazing vision for this story. While there are some similarities to _Fight_Club_ and _Memento_ (for "imaginary" characters and out-of-sequence storytelling), this movie stands alone as the most unique and haunting movie to be released over the past 10 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko is one of the greatest movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is about a teenage boy going through many problems. He beings seeing a giant bunny rabbit that tells him to do weird and unusual tasks so Donnie can be lead into the future with him. Donnie Darko is a drama/science fiction/thriller/comedy; now I am not a big fan of science fiction but this became of my favorites. I rented this from a public library and when the movie ended, I immediately bought the movie on DVDand I bought the soundtrack. Now remember if you buy the soundtrack there is only instrumental music and one performed song, which is mad world. You have to scout out the other songs (it is worth it). This movie makes you feel every emotion and it is so different and unique.It is what makes this movie so interesting and fun to watch. There is no other kind of movie like this out there. I would give Jake Gyllenhaal a ten also, an excellent actor and not too bad to look at either. Also he was named one of People Magazine's 50 Hottest Bachelors in 2004. I give DONNIE DARKO ten stars because it definitely keeps you drawn in, there is never a dull moment and it has such a fascinating plot. On one other key notes all the actors are superb in this movie.A quick note: Donnie and Elizabeth Darko and Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal. There are brother and sister in real life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko was more than 'thought-provoking.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like everyone is saying the same thing about Donnie Darko, that it was 'deep' and 'thought-provoking,' and maybe they'll get off their lazy butts and put in another long word that means exactly the same thing. Yeah sure, Donnie Darko was deep and thought provoking, but it was also more.Donnie Darko is a teenager. On the night of October 2, 1988, Donnie was supposed to die. Instead, he sleepwalked away from his fate. This movie is about how every living creature has a fixed path toward its destiny and how if you get off track, time will correct itself and you will get back on. Since escaping death is more extreme than any other "mistake in your path," Donnie needed the help of Frank, the 6 foot tall, monster-like rabbit to help him get back. In addition to Frank, they needed a time porthole to bring him back to the night of October 2, 1988, henceforth why Frank said "28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds, that is when the world will end." What Frank meant by that was that a porthole will open from the sky, exposing the Tangent Universe and quite possibly ending the world. But the purpose of the porthole was not to end the universe but to send Donnie back in time to his appropriate destination.When Donnie spoke to his teacher about time travel, the teacher stated that all you needed to travel time was a vessel of some sort and a porthole. It was destined for the Middlesex dance team to go to LA, so their plane (the vessel needed for time travel) would fall into the porthole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Social Commentary and Shakespearean Themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>YOUNG HAMLET BECOMES PROSPERO -- Rarely do you ever see a film that combines quality wit and satire, savaging the weaknesses and poverty of values in our modern society, along with drama and tragedy worthy of being called "Shakespearean." Incredibly, this is exactly the beautiful and seamless combination "Donnie Darko" achieves. In addition, it is an example of film-making (including directing, acting, writing, and production) at its very best.I won't summarize the plot or comment on the story. Others who have posted reviews on this site have done this admirably. I want to comment that the film emphasizes major themes in Shakespearean tragedy plus an additional "magical" element.To give a short English lesson, Shakespearean tragedy has the following basic elements:1. The hero has to die in the end (there can be more than one hero, as in Romeo and Juliet).2. For the most part, the hero creates his own conditions. He always dies in some way by his own doing, either by outright suicide (Brutus in Julius Caesar, Romeo and Juliet) or by in some way actively bringing on his own death (Macbeth and Hamlet). Individual free will is important in Shakespeare as opposed to "fate" in the Greek tragedies.3. His death is not meaningless or negative, but rather an act of sacrifice, an action to right a wrong, an act of justice, or some major symbol of love or "rightness."4. Through the hero's death, the family, community, nation, (pick one or more) world becomes a better place. In this sense the tragedy concludes with a positive "catharsis" (to use the literary term).5. An overall personal, externally controlled order exists in the universe, which the tragedy reaffirms. Call it God, divine justice, force for good, or whatever. Shakespeare was probably not a traditional Christian in any sense, but he most likely did believe in some notion of God, a God very much in control of the universe.In "Donnie Darko" the first four elements are clearly present. But the story makes it clear that Donnie and most of the other characters (recall the conversation with the physics teacher who says he can't talk about God or lose his job) are generally agnostic. I get the feeling that, as far as the filmmaker is concerned, the jury on God's existence is very much out.Interestingly, there's also an element of the supernatural in several of Shakespeare's tragedies (and in many of his other plays). This is not present in all of them, but witness the witches in Macbeth or the ghosts in Julius Caesar and Hamlet. The time travel element in "Donnie Darko" falls very much in this same category. What Shakespeare would have called "a magical story" we call "science fiction."In addition, however, you have to look at Shakespeare's Prospero in "The Tempest" to find that Donnie combines elements of Hamlet AND Prospero. Prospero is a magician who discovers great powers and could easily become a god or misuse these powers for selfish purposes. Instead, Prospero uses these powers one last time, to benefit the person he loves most in his life. Then, he renounces them once and for all because he realizes being an ordinary human being willing to sacrifice the ultimate is the VERY BEST a person can be in this life.I only want to say one more thing in terms of social commentary, the central symbol of our society, in the film, is endlessly jumping on a trampoline. This is continuous motion, effort, and "busy-ness" that goes nowhere. It's also a metaphor for time travel certainly (still in space but motion in time), yet the image of jumping up and down meaninglessly all the time also echoes the "Mad World" idea where people "run in circles" going nowhere.Donnie is able to transcend all of this and reach the sublime through sacrifice. As Joseph Campbell has said, "Sacrifice is bliss." This is the profound bliss Donnie attains by the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Draws you in, spits you out, then leaves a tear in your eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies are meant to entertain, be that via humour, shock, surprise, fantasy or whatever. But one thing that all movies have to do in order to make them watchable is make the viewer empathise with the characters. This empathy doesn't always have to have a positive spin, but the characters must always make the viewer love, hate, feel sorry for them. With Donnie (the brilliant Jake Gyllenhaal), we have a character that draws us right in, spits us out, then leaves us with a tear in our eye but a smile on our face. The movie carries a really good concept, and the direction is excellent (and what about the musical score - wow!), but it is the empathy that Donnie demands that really makes this film so watchable. And the ending is one of the most powerful and emotionally confusing that I've ever witnessed. A brilliant movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awesome...just awesome!!! I saw this film a couple of years ago and thought it was good...then I saw it again...and again....and again...and again....and the more I watched it the better it was! There are few films that have the same repeat appeal as Donnie Darko. The only other film that can really compare to DD is Memento. I'm no Jake Gyllenhal fan, but he is just amazing in this movie...Jake delivers an inspired performance that is one of the best in the Thriller genre.Frank the demonic rabbit is one of the best "villain" characters that has ever graced the big screen.The rest of the cast is stellar and deliver some of the best performances of their careers. Drew Barrymore is good for the small part that she does play. Jena Malone plays a fantastic "troubled teen" who is still trying to figure out who she is, and trying to make sure that she doesn't end up like her mother.One thing I have seen is that people who are fans of Michael Bay-esquire movies are not fans of this movie. If you don't want to watch a movie that will make you think then don't watch this movie.If you want to watch a mind-bending movie then catch out this movie and make sure you watch it more that once.</fullReview>

However this is the movie that has brought me to watch movies like this. Calm, paced, good story. If it wasn't for this movie, it would probably have taken me a couple more years to start liking the type of movie that doesn't have to have a bunch of things being blown up or a whole lot of people dieing to keep my attention from wondering if my bed is warm enough to go to sleep yet.As said many times it's probably not the best movie to watch if you get bored from good stories that rely on the idea rather than the stuff that goes on.The soundtrack is perfect for this movie. Haunting in some areas, and sad in others.An overall very realistic movie (however with so far impossible phenomena). Excellent acting. Most definitely a must see. Even if you aren't into this sort of movie i suggest you watch it as it may change your mind as it did with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" is simply the best science fiction movie ever made, bar none. Although I have not read reviews for this feature, all I could add is that I agree wholeheartedly with any and all accolades and praise, and believe any negative comments must be from ignorant losers who should crawl back into their pathetic hovels and never resurface. "Donnie Darko" is to the science fiction genre what Lynch's "Blue Velvet" is to the fantasy genre. The entire story is intriguing and edited beautifully. Whoever is responsible for the movie, Drew Barrymore and others, did everything, including casting, perfectly. In my book at least, Darko replaces the original "Alien" as the acme to be judged against in science fiction movie making. The only reasons for not seeing "Donnie Darko" would include being a fool or being a masochist. If you are offended by fun and good story telling, then "Donnie Darko" may not be for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is the psychological thriller directed by Richard Kelly it is a story of Donnie who has visions of an evil rabbit possesing him and making him commit acts of violence and predicts the end of the world. "Drew Barrymore" and "Patrick Swayze" have smaller roles in the film along with Jake's mother Maggie Gyllenhaal.Donnie Darko was something that had always grabbed my attention but I had never decided to pick up at the store, but I'm glad I did. It was a very moving and powerful yet strange and sadistic movie, it is unlike anything I have ever seen, I rate it at the highest of levels for its acting and originality. Obviously it isn't to be taken serious as it is fiction but Jake Gyllenhaal does a very real and psychotic performance he just keeps getting better and better, pick this movie up when your at the store you won't regret it!</fullReview>

And when a friend put it on for me a few years ago I had no idea of the films content and it was not the right time to watch it.I just wanted to comment on not only the wonderful cinematography and soundtrack, but the perceptive nature of the story, a mixture of paradox and a glimpse into the nature of reality.For those who seek to explore the above, the film provides an excellent insight. I would be very interested to know if Richard Kelly's writing was inspired by personal experiences in lucid dreaming or has read much Carlos Casteneda. Having practised the dreaming techniques myself i can only hope that the film encourages others to explore and push the boundaries of their own psyche to enhance their own perceptions of the world within and without.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Richard Kelly Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very minor spoilers: This movie is totally untouched. It covers all film genres which makes it seem like it would be an immensely huge/massive budget movie but in actual fact it is not. That is because it dwells much more from its characters and specifically the lead character, Donnie Darko. Raw emotion is shown from scene to scene and especially when Donnie is talking to his therapist. His conversation about the existence of God and dying alone is probably the most heart felt and engaging scene that i have ever seen in a film before. And the letter that Donnie writes to Grandma Death is the best form of wrapping things up in a neat little package since the Usual Suspects ending where basically every line of dialogue was replayed! The final line of the letter where Donnie explains that he has so much more to look forward to is almost tragic in a way.For a first-time filmmaker this is probably the most outstanding debut ever. The thoughts and ideas that make up this masterpiece are beyond anything that most of us could conjure. This film is perfect and is the perfect example that Hollywood isn't everything in the movie business. Thankyou Richard Kelly for changing the way that I think about film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie: Donnie Darko Rating: The Director's Cut: Rated R for language, some underage drug and alcohol use, and violence. Original Version: Rated R for language, some drug use and violence.Starring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, and Noah Wyle.Summary: Donnie Darko you may think is your ordinary high schooler except with sleepwalking problems. The story beings with him waking up on a hillside foreshadowing the events to come. The next night, Donnie sleepwalks once again but to the voice of a giant bunny rabbit named Frank who tells him in "28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds...that is when the world will end." Sounds weird right? Well, it get's weirder! Well, eventually the next morning, Donnie awakens on a golf course and returning home, sees that he has just escaped death; a jet engine had fallen into his room and if he hadn't of been sleepwalking, he would be dead! As the mystery continues, Donnie's visions of Frank continue but this time, Frank wants Donnie to do awful things, first to flooding his school and eventually burning down a house of which Donnie later explains in the movie "I have to obey him; he saved my life! I have to obey him or else I'll be left all alone." As going farther into the story, we see from his therapist's point of view is that Donnie is experiencing common hallucinations from someone with schizophrenia, which will make the audience reconsider to follow Donnie's vision to reality. But the whole thing that makes this movie compelling is that we can never tell if Donnie is really hallucinating or experiencing "an act of God"! Besides the whole science fiction aspect of the movie, as other people have said, the one other thing that will make any teenager want to watch this movie is it's down-to-earth characters. Donnie is like any other teenager who feels disconnected from his family and isolated. He's like any other high schooler going through tough conflicts of life such as parents, teachers, bullies, etc.The acting is believable and you feel like you've met at least one of the characters in a similar person in some point of your life. Jake Gyllenhall as Donnie may be one of his best roles to date with the ranking of his other roles like "October Sky". Other famous actors like Patrick Swayze who plays a motivational speaker with a hidden secret and Drew Barrymore as a sick-of-her-life teacher and newcomer Jena Malone as Donnie's girlfriend are all convincing and well acted! As for the setting of the film set in the 1980s, the music for this film could not fit better! The movie includes songs like "Head Over Heels" by Tears For Fears and "Under the Milky Way". A remade version of another Tears For Fears song "Mad World" re sung by Jules Verne is performed for the ending of the movie which can make anyone depressed. The rest of the music for the movie is a great score and will make you feel creeped out.To conclude, director Stephen Kelly has done an excellent job especially for a first movie. Yes, this is Kelly's first movie but hopefully not his last. This film is highly recommended for any science fiction fans, psychological obsessives like me, or teenagers who have gone through tough times, this movie you should check out! Total: 9.2 out of 10</fullReview>

It has moments of hilarity, melancholy, and absolute clarity. Donnie is the most multi-faceted and interesting character in any movie I have yet to see. It's intellectual and funny at the same time, yet at the end it leaves you with a melancholy feeling but somehow its not a bad one. I love this movie for not only the emotional ride it takes you on but also it will intrigue the scientific aspect of the mind. If you don't watch it because of the awesome plot, insanely good acting, and great cinematography watch it for the potential scientific applications the movie hints at. If you need any other reason to watch this, please lord tell me what you're looking for in a movie, because surely this encompasses all the things a movie needs: hot and great actor, creepy 7 foot tall bunny, cool bubbles shooting out of your stomach, psychological drama, scientific insanity...MUST I GO ON?!?!? ~Thanks for reading!

		<shortDescription>Thought provoking, absolute masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An absolute masterpiece. Donnie Darko is incredibly thought provoking. It is difficult to describe the film as being within the sci-fi genre, as it transcends other genres of fantasy, teen drama, satire, horror, comedy, and thriller. However, if it is to be allocated a place within a genre at a local video store, sci-fi is perhaps the most appropriate. Donnie Darko can not be watched just once. Upon first viewing, you will most likely be so puzzled that you will be driven to watch it at least another two times, and search for possible answers on the web. Definitely this helps, but I don't think Director Richard Kelly himself really knew of a 'set' interpretation of the film. Some interpret it, for example, as a story that begins with a glitch that occurs in space time, requiring Donnie to 'go back and set things right for humankind'. I, however, saw it as more of a philosophical, existential piece on human existence, our role on earth and the existence of god and divine intervention. Basically, if you listen to Kelly and Gyllenhaal's audio commentary, you'll find that Kelly will single out certain parts of the film as 'essentially what Donnie Darko is about' or 'hitting the nail on the head'. These parts, however, are so dramatically different, and this is what I mean when I say I don't believe Kelly knew what his film met, or what the most likely interpretation would be. I recommend the film to anyone. It was severely underrated at its release in 2001, and yet, the acting and script is superb, the score and soundtrack haunting and reflective, the special effects impressive (particularly given the budget of a mere $US4 million), and the plot and hybrid genre is such that you can take a variety of interpretations of the film away from you, but each one will inevitably have its inconsistencies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko Is Just Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, the first thing that is unknown to someone who hasn't saw Donnie Darko is what the hell is it about! Well its not a horror, which is what I thought it was, but in fact its about time travel! As someone who is only 16 its refreshing to watch a film such as this, and wanting to watch it straight again! The film contains superb acting from all of the actors and includes an all star cast! The soundtrack is just awesome, with such music from Gary Jules, Duran Duran, Tears For Fears and a chilling score from Michael Andrews! I admit the first time I watched it i had no clue what it was about or whether it was any good, but trust the second time round of watching it, gives you an answer to your all your doubts about the film. Now I suggest you watch the theatrical version of the film before watching the directors cut , both are excellent but the theatrical is just that bit better, and has now become a cult classic (yeah)! Richard Kelly directed and wrote the film, which is his first debut as a director, after watching Donnie Darko you'll be keen in seeing future films from him!Don't listen to anyone whos says its crap, jus watch it yourself and it will surprise you! This is up there with my favourite films, and if you like this i recommend The Butterfly Effect. Reviewed by alexboy-4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard about this movie just recently on IMDb and had to see it. I bought the original release on DVD and I was absolutely amazed by this movie. I watched it three times on the day I bought it and watch it at least every other day. It's that good. I was very surprised by the emotional weight this movie carries, especially at the end. I always cry at the end of this film, and I think it's the song used. 'Mad World' by Gary Jules is absolutely heart wrenching and very sad. I remembered the Tears for Fears version from the 80's because I was there. I was 17 in 1988(when the film takes place). But I had never heard Gary Jules version. The score for the film is brilliant, Michael Andrews will become a "John Williams" type if he keeps up the good work. The song at the beginning of the film sets the tone for the movie as well, the music and lyrics almost seemed "destined" for this film. 'The Killing Moon' by Echo and the Bunnymen is a perfect beginning. Bravo Richard Kelly for making this film. Quite a gem. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darko; thrills, chills and unleashed madness: That's entertainment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was well directed and edited. In fact, aside from the writing,these were the film's strongest features. Richard Kelley pulls tremendous open performances out of the actors and assembled a complete vision of a deep and thought provoking story. His vision is peculiar enough to attract one's attention but still general enough in his underlying themes to enable some level of connection with a wide range of movie goers.There is something for everyone here. The casting was superb. There were terrific actors from the late 80's and 90's, as well as rising stars that did not gain widespread fame until after this film. The parts were well suited to each chosen actor. the biggest stretch was Patrick Swayze as a creepy motivational speaker, (who has the lesser minds in the community under his thrall) but he pulled it off rather convincingly using his good-guy image to lend substance and credibility to the character.Finally I would like to publicly thank Ms. Barrymore for investing her time money and talent into a risky notion such as this script. You have come a long way from the days of Stephen King's Firestarter and ET. You should be exceedingly proud of your participation and influence(as well as your performance) in this project. It is more than a film or a movie, it is indeed, from the writing all the way through post-production, a work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Strange But Excellent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that only come once in a blue moon, If anyone gets the chance to watch it i advise you all watch it MANY times. It is a very strange movie that will leave you with more questions than the end of Matrix Reloaded, but "Why did it suck" won't be one of them.Donnie Darko is about (You guessed it), Donnie Darko. He's got major psychological issues through the entire movie after his life is 'saved' by a daemonic bunny rabbit. The thing then makes him do its work and everything comes to an ending that'll leave you all with questions.Like I said, this is an excellent movie that I suggest everyone watches. It deserves it's score all the way in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some films fade away from the subconscious as soon as you finish watching them. Others linger for a few days, possibly weeks before dismissed as films that we were really rather good. And then there are those few, either through their extreme brilliance or sheer weirdness that just refuse to dislodge themselves from your cerebellum. Donnie Darko is one of those few films that manages to achieve it by being both.Donnie is a troubled teenager. Undergoing therapy for a series of strange hallucinations, he is lured out of his bedroom one night to his front yard by a 6ft bunny rabbit called Frank who calmly informs that the world will end in less than a month. After this bit of information is passed on, the engine of a passing passenger plane crashes through the roof, landing on the bed Donnie would have been sleeping in, if he weren't sleeping on the golf course. Are you following this? Good, because after that things get really weird as self-help gurus, restrictive teachers, senile hermits and a growing obsession with time travel all seek to gnaw at Donnie's sanity.After a set-up like that you have to wonder what screenwriter-director Richard Kelly is nibbling on for a bedtime snack. And then wonder if there's any chance of getting some yourself since the film is a near flawless dive into the surreal. From the opening scene of Donnie asleep on a cliff side road, things are very definitely not right. Unlike a David Lynch movie, nothing truly bizarre actually happens (even Frank is kind of explainable), but what does happen occurs in a very bizarre way. Time and space seem to twist and distend. Even the blue skies and white clouds above seem moulded to confound. Michael Andrews music (a mixture of piano, choir and theramin) only adds to the proceedings.Against this perfectly formed mood is a perfectly formed script. By turns funny, scary and sad but always moving forward in small, building pieces to the final day. It would be easy for the complicated, tendril like plot to overwhelm the film; but it's always told through the characters, and not just Donnie. Everyone gets their own little subplot, quirks and their opportunity to be developed. They also get great lines, be it Donnie's attempts to compare emotional problems or Patrick Swayze's squirmingly smarmy self help seminars (it even gets in a monologue about Smurfs for crying out loud).Those lines are delivered by a cast very obviously aware that they may never get a chance to be in anything like this again. They're led by Jake Gyllenhaal, who is perfect as the titular teen. Scared and confused about what's happening around him, but seduced and finding some comfort in it as well, he nails every single scene as the brilliant but angsty Donnie. Katherine Ross also makes a welcome return to acting as Donnie's well-meaning but slightly ineffectual therapist. The rest of the cast are all sublime. Only Drew Barrymore disappoints, mostly because she doesn't get an awful lot to do. But then her presence has probably more to do with being a producer getting the film made than the number of lines.Of course the final question about Donnie Darko is: what the hell does it all mean? There's some evidence to suggest that maybe, maybe the film is about the commercialised 80's not being accepted by the more apathetic, wary and cynical next generation. The film is set during the Dukakis/Bush election and Donnie is, rather like Benjamin Braddock, at odds with the proposed society and ideals he is supposed to take up. Perhaps the explanation is on the DVD, perhaps Kelly never had one or perhaps its better not to worry about it too much. Because whatever the rhyme or reason behind Donnie Darko it is, without doubt, one of the most original, compelling and hypnotically beautiful films made in several years and easily the best film of 2001.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The kind of movie you hate to love...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is the kind of movie you hate to love. It's a movie where 3/4 in you ask yourself why you decided to watch it. Then the ending redeems the whole experience.Here's a story about a guy who escaped death, then follows a path of (seemingly) destruction. He acquires a new "friend", Frank the rabbit, of which you ponder during the movie if he's a product of imagination, pathological deviation, etc. The movie shows the good and the bad of Donnie Darko as he unravels the beautiful exterior of the evil seed of his community.Then the ending rewards your patience. The movie has you going back to the beginning to see how everything was affected by the ending of the movie. We finally understand "Frank". Ultimately, it's Donnie's sacrifice that leads to the understanding of the question "if you could go back in time, what would you change?".I'll tell you right now, you'll hate the movie. You'll feel like the movie was a huge detour to your ride home - you hate the experience but once it's over you forget about the bad. And that's just it - the ending will leave a seed in you that will want to watch it again for nourishment. Only upon seeing it for the second time will you appreciate the journey.</fullReview>

No actor or actress could replace any of the cast's parts. 2. The movie has a brilliant and unique plot line. There has neverbeen a film made before hand that was nearly the same. 3. It has a twist ending. I won't spoil it, but if you see the movie,I'll personally gauruntee* that you'll agree with me. 4. It has the appearance of a teen/slasher movie, but it'sdeeper than that. It goes into the mind of a mentally ill high schooler in the 1980's, and it goes through every aspect of his life. 5. **Donnie Darko and Frank are just plain AWESOME! *sorry if I misspelled it **see the movie and you'll know what I mean</fullReview>

Everyone I spoke to beforehand said what a great film this was, and was touted as a modern classic by the time I got round to watching it. Why? I understand the film, though I spent about three hours afterwards tyring to work out the clever hidden meanings in it, which it must have to be called a classic and have so many fans. It doesn't it hides a poor film behind a pretence of some deep meaning. It should have been made as a music video for misunderstood teenagers to drool over, it's a boring waste of an afternoon, don't bother watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko, from what I have heard, has been labeled a modern day cult classic. The movie fixes itself around a high school kid named Donnie Darko, hence the name of the movie. Donnie has problems, lots of problems. He suffers from social anxiety, bullying, sleep walking, and nightmare visions/daylight hallucinations of a demonic looking rabbit who give him jobs and prophecies. The movie fixes itself heavily around the discovery of the fourth dimension and time travel. I originality saw the regular cut version until I bought the directors cut. If you plan on seeing this movie get the director's cut. The original doesn't reveal nearly as much as the director's cut. This movie does a great job of screwing with your mind and leaves you guessing up until the very end. Richard Kelly wrote a great script, and I believe this movie is successful because of the main character. Donnie has so many problems and ideas that every teen deals with on a day to day basis. See this movie, it is great.</fullReview>

This film has everything, Humor, wit, unanswerable questions and mind-boggling theories that will leave your mind unsettled. I honestly feel that it has affected me a great deal and has made me think more deeply. Rickard Kelly has written a one-of-a-kind work of sheer genius that has separated the film lovers out there into two groups- those who have seen and those who haven't seen this film. After seeing both the film and the director's cut version, i finally felt that i understood the film as much as i ever could, but i was wrong. Every time i watch it i discover some new theory or possibility about life or the meaning of the film that i have never thought about before. Jake Gyllenhaal is incredible and plays the troubled Donnie to perfection. A must-see film for people with deep questions about life, Jake Gyllenhaal Fans, People searching for something new or people who simply do not want to miss out on what i believe to be the greatest film ever. One word of advice- watch it at least twice before you say you don't get it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favourite movies of all time, cult classic Donnie Darko. The story is basically about a messed up teenage boy. Except its much deeper than that. What this movie is really about depends on how you look at it. I love the way that every time I watch it I still see different things in it. The music is beautiful and suits the movie perfectly. It's set in the 80's so an appropriate soundtrack is needed and is delivered with classics from Echo and the Bunnymen, Tears For Fears, Duran Duran, Joy Division and much more, as well as some piano tunes which are also essential to get the feel of this movie across. Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect for Donnie, he has the perfect look for a fucked up teenage boy (sorry I don't mean it badly or anything). Watch this movie even if you're not usually into cult movies(I'm not). Just expect to watch it a few times before you even begin to get it. Also, watch the original and then Director's Cut. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jake Gylenhall stars in this eerie psychological thriller about a paranoid schizophrenic teen who hallucinates.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring: Jake Gylenhall, Jena Malone, Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze The first time I watched this movie, I was anything but impressed. It made no sense to me, and it just seemed totally and utterly pointless. A complete waste of my time. But the more I thought about the movie and tried to analyze what it was really about, the more I thought I should give it another chance.So I gave it another view today. And I've decided that I really like this movie. It's insanely messed up, but so incredibly undeniably interesting.Donnie Darko (Gylenhall) is a boy in his late teens with some serious issues. He seems to be suffering from paranoia and schizophrenia, not to mention he is hallucinating. He keeps hearing from an imaginary friend of his, Frank. A giant rabbit with a hideously disfigured face. Frank is very creepy to look at, and looks like something you'd only see in a nightmare.Frank starts telling Donnie to do different things, and he does them. He breaks the water main at his school and floods it. He burns down the house of some motivational speaker that has been at his school. Frank keeps telling him to do other things of the nature, and Donnie listens to him.But the strangest thing that Frank tells Donnie is that the world is going to end in about a month. The whole movie builds to the climax when the world is supposed to end, and at that point some of the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, but there are still so many missing.One of the most interesting things that this movie brings up is the notion of predetermination. At one point in the movie, Donnie sees everybody walking along with a trail of what appears to be water leading from their chest out into the world. As they continue moving about their day, they catch up with this predetermined trail. The paradox that Donnie grapples with is, if we know what our path is and it is predetermined, is there anything we can do to change it, or should we even try? Who knows.This movie is a dark and haunting psychological thriller. If you like your movies to come to a certain and complete ending by the time the credits are rolling, then don't watch this movie, or you will spend hours beating your head against a wall screaming "WHY???" I know I did the first time I watched it.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (definitely worth a look)</fullReview>

Talk about a major oversight.Donnie Darko is one of the best movies ever made and should rank in the top 10. The movie will leave you thinking about it for days if not weeks. It is one of those story lines that transcends the film-maker's vision and takes on a life of its own. It can be interpreted in dozens of ways and yet no one interpretation can be said to be correct. There are no answers, only questions.The movie contains some subject material which may offend some (and I'm not talking about pornography) but this I think is a mark of the movie's greatness.

This one is a good flic in its own. I saw the basic guy teen working things out for himself that many seem to do. I also saw that this guy teen act out in such a way that seemed to show a portent that he knew that there were no repercussions in his actions, e.g. the suggestion that his teacher add a literature to her rectum or the blaze that would be set afoot after the meeting with Frank.In that right, I think that this movie is quite good. The ending was a bit sad, whereas the ending of a like movie Butterfly Effect was actually uplifting.Donnie did well with what he had and actually expressed some good teenager angst, but didn't do anything with it; however, the character from Butterfly Effect learned from his mistakes and helped his family.Two disparaging movies that made me think along the same ways.</fullReview>

It is one of the most influential films of modern days, from an amazing director. It has many different layers. Donnie struggles with so much, from his mental health to his love for his family and girlfriend. It demonstrates controversial ideas about the world and the people who live in it and how we interact with each other. It is a beautiful story and the haunting images included in it have really changed the way I see the world. Every time I watch it, I find another meaning to the film.

		<fullReview>in 3 short words this movie can be described as BEST MOVIE EVER. and why do i say this? not just because it is one of the few of it's perspective types, but the real eye catcher was how the director planned out and followed through with each and every one of Donnie's moves and thoughts. Frank, his 6 foot tall "bunny rabbit" was really a random soul who was used to show Donnie the way and give him the final decision and lead him on the path to saving his mom and sister, while dooming himself. although he dies at the end, it is clear that he acknowledges the fact that it was meant to be, and that with his death, his family will grow. After seeing two possible scenarios of life i guess he made the good choice. but what i don't understand till this day is, why did the man in the bunny suit have a blow to the eye before Donnie shot him?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On a whim I bought the director's cut on DVD last night. It took me a night to "sleep on it" before I fully understood the film. It was (so far) the most beautiful movie experience I have encountered. The two other people I shared this movie with did not agree so much. I don't think they were able to grasp the ideas encapsulated.Donnie Darko is the heart rending story of a young man possibly suffering from some form of mental illness. In a freak accident a jet turbine crashes through the ceiling of his house plowing right down into his bedroom. We witness his family dealing with their son/brother as he descends farther into depression and/or schizophrenia.The frightening imagery, superb acting, and twisting plot line combine to tell the story that seemingly takes place in the spaces between consciousness and unconsciousness, in those remarkable distinct moments between the one thing no one can escape, those moments/seconds between dying and death. Did Donnie Darko die? Or was he being born? If you work in or have any experience dealing with mental illness, this movie will touch your heart. Don't judge. Just feel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie made greater by Maggie Gyllenhaal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regarding Maggie . . .she really has a special presence on the screen that goes beyond beauty. The first time that I became aware of her was in Mona Lisa Smile. I could not take my eyes off her no matter who else was on the screen with her. The same thing with Donnie Darko. She only had a small role and yet, for me, she jumped off the screen. The over-used word 'authentic'comes to mind. In any case, I expect her to become more than a star. She is so talented and takes risks. Her movies differ so much. They don't fall into any category except that they are all different. And from such a great family. Oh, I also forgot to mention her unique beauty. Maggie, take care of yourself! The world needs more actresses like you. Best wishes to you and all the Gyllenhaals! The movie really shook me up. The ending, combined with that haunting song, reduced me to tears. Maggie, as the bereaved younger sister, finished me off. I did not discover this magnificent movie until my students warned me about it. I am a movie buff yet I do not remember it when it was first released. A wonderful cast, great script, mind-bending plot, and wonderful sound track. What else can I say? 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never trust a "cult movie" which is younger than you,,,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One problem of this film is that the main character, Donnie Darko, is an anti-hero, someone not to be proud of - although I guess that his rebellious behaviour can somehow be appreciated by teenagers. It is a problem, because to make you interested in the stupid things he does, there should be something - a motivation. And when other more deprecable characters come into the picture (as the fear-love teacher), and you are supposed to side against her, it's not that easy, because in order to do that you should side with Donnie Darko.Another problem is that the film - and I don't know why - has become a "cult". OK, time travel is a fascinating thing, but this is definitely not the first movie about that (and, I'd say, not the best). And because it is a cult, your expectations are high - higher than due, and so the absolute normality and averageness of this film pops out evidently.And maybe the biggest problem is that part of the (little) beauty of the film is outside of it, actually: in the discussions, interpretations, "parallel worlds" that live within the fans.It is good of course if a film sparkles ideas and discussions, but first of all it should be good itself. And I'm afraid I've seen too many stupid and boring scenes, that yes, they can look less silly "a posteriori", but a film must be a pleasure to enjoy "real time" too.The 15 BBFC classification reads "Contains...psychological horror". Horror??? Psychological??? Hey, when I see a horror movie I get scared (yes, indeed), not bored. All I see here is laughable. And, among the other things out of place, the politics deserve a special mention: it went too far if its purpose was just to frame temporally the film (and what for?).When the end came, well, I was still begging the film not to end, but to start! The final was interesting, and the ending scene of great beauty (thumb up for the song "Mad world"), but in my opinion that was the only good part of all the movie. A whole movie should not rely uniquely on one scene.Probably, if this had been a short film, fifteen minutes say, it would have been a great short film.By the way, I saw the director's cut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A scary, disturbing film that you need to watch at least twice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko-Jake Gyllenhall, Elizibeth Gylenhall, Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, Mary McDonnell and Noah WyleThis film is a terrifying film in many ways. This has spoilers and the movie will be revealed, so be wary. One night, a disturbed teenage boy, Donnie Darko, wakes up because a voice is calling him. A six foot tall rabbit that you only get a small glimpse of is outside his room. It tells him the world will end in 28 days. This rabbit is a lifesaver, because the rabbit called him out, and saved his life. That night, a jet engine fell on his house and would have killed him if it weren't for this mysterious creature. The next night, it appears in his bedroom (scary) and tells him to flood the school. Because he does this, school is cancelled and he meets a girl that he ends up going out with, all because of the school flooding. This rabbit tells him his name is Frank, next time he sees him. He also tells him basically, that he has time traveled and tells Donnie about it. Donnie follows a time travel beam, only to find a gun hidden in it. He, meanwhile is suffering through a mean psycologists (Swayze) lectures. Donnie and his girl go to the movies and Frank appears and tells him to burn Swayze's house down, and he does. This leads to cops finding his underground children sex center, and he is hauled to jail. Frank takes the mask off, and is a person missing an eye with blood trickling down. One thing leads to another and Donnie and his girlfriend (on Halloween) try to find a book on time travel by breaking into an old lady's house and they get attacked by two other kids and they beat them up and throw the girl in the street, where she is hit by a car and killed. The driver is a young man named Frank that has a bunny mask for Halloween. Donnie, in his anger takes the gun he found in the portal and shoots Frank right in the eye and kills him. Donnie has ruined people lives and realizes that it isn't fair, so he finds a way to travel back to the day the engine crashed. He knows what will happen and stays in his room waiting to be killed. The engine crushes and kills him, and his girlfriend doesn't know him. It is very scary when Frank the bunny pops in, and very sad ending.My review:9/10 (Good!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies all times... Maybe it is because I like cult, but I have also some empathy with Donnie (Jack Gyllenhaal).It would be ridiculous to state, as a number one fan, that I totally understand the movie. I watched it several times, played the games, did the tests and even THEN it's not always clear what director Richard Kelly is trying to do.One of the other + things about this movie, is the music. Most of it is written by composer Michael Andrews (you probably heard his Mad World song (taken from Donnie Darko)together with Gary Jules. His scores are superb and with his MiniMoog he knows how to give you the eerie chills! As a producer, I did a hip hop version of one of his scores (by his personal approval), just to let you know how fond I am of this movie. I can't really compare it with others....it is about the time tangent, love, future, history, common things in life. Every teenager (well, not every, but most of them) can identify themselves with Donnie. I can't really tell you too much about the movie and plot, because that would spoil it.Let me tell you this...after the movie I bough a "dark" o rabbit, named Frank. That is how much I like it. After seen the movie you catch my drift! hahaha Have fun watching it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Life Changing Film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some movies I seen in my life that help change my life and how the way I see the world. THE PASSION OF THE Christ ,PUNCH DRUNK-LOVE, HEARTS IN ATLANTIS, and now DONNIE DARKO.A young boy by the name of DONNIE DARKO, is sort of mentally ill, sleepwalks something awful. One day he has a dream of a six foot tall demonic-like bunny who tells him the world is about to end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds. By doing this the bunny saves DONNIE from a airplane engine crashes into his room. And the scary thing is that no one knows where it came from. So as long as DONNIE does evil favors for the bunny, which name is FRANK, tells him more of the future.Now the movie seems and looks like a slasher film, but it's totally not. It goes through it stages of horror, then science fiction, comedy, drama, and a hard dose of reality. Sometimes in the same setting. The person I really connected with is DONNIE, who like me felt abandon buy family and didn't feel like being alone, because like him I think not one person should be alone when they time is up. And basically what this movie is about. The second chance we get to set things right after we know the answers to the question in this place we call life, especially the director's cut which is just as brilliant as the original cut. And the song at the end of the movie called MAD WORLD is the summary to the whole movie and My personal favorite song in the world. This film will change your life forever. It makes you really care about it's leads and the last deleted scene on the DVD made me cry harder than on the movie. And hurted me real bad. Glad they left it out of the director's cut, although it will make even more powerful than ever. After this movie you too would want to do something that will change the world, you, and the others around you. And that's a promise on that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit i have taken my time to pick this film up from my local DVD shop but a special 2 disk edition was far too much to pass up.Despite my tardiness its the best choice I've made as of late, words cannot really sum up this film but ill try to give my spiel to those have yet to see this film. From the first scene of Donnie waking up on a highway and his cycle through a seemingly average sub urban setting, an off key world is seemingly established. I interpreted Donnie's side to be the chaos to the normality that he passes through.As best as i can ill just say this is not a horror/psychological thriller/sci fi it would be all and more piled into one word which is impossible to even type.All i can say is you should really see this film at least once to get a taster and second time to actually fully understand it! I was a little weary of the idea of a 6 ft demonic bunny rabbit, thought the imaginary rabbit had been done with Harvey?The rabbit frank is no arbitrary character added to create stick out weirdness, he is a character crucial to the plot and its whole flow which when it reaches full circle leaves you speechless. I am not choosing to delve into plot as its been all said before, I'm just putting my thoughts as a new believer in Darko completely recommending it to anyone with a curious/open mind to avoid conformity of recent cinema misfit films.The cast is superb, with plenty of familiar faces lending their weight to the scenes of dialogue.Musically its also very well done, special effects are quite a minimum but when its used its very effective.Again all i can say is if you want a unique experience check this film out asap!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrifying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This site ranks the movie among the 100 greatest films ever made. The film has gained what many would call a "Cult Status" among it's viewers. It seemed that this film barely shook the box office, or for that matter, the nation, when it came into theaters near the start of the decade. A recent Director's Cut was released, adding a near half hour to the film, which, provoked my interest even more. Well, I wouldn't even say that. Prior to the releasing of the Director's Cut, I had never heard of such a film. I never knew it existed, and as I read the summary, I knew I had to see it. So, I did. I didn't get to see the Director's Cut, I honestly didn't want to, I wanted to examine this film from when it was first released. I knew the premise, something about a giant rabbit and the end of the world. Sounds right up my alley.So, I went into the film with high expectations. A movie about a giant rabbit and the end of the world? And it's one of IMDb's top 100 films? It has to be good, with a premise so out there, and to be appreciated to the extent it would be given that honor, of course I went in with very high expectations. The opening shot of the film already raises a question. Donnie atop a cliff, appearing to be thrown from his bike. He lifts himself up, then smiles at the mountain tops in front of him. Already, the audience is confused. The movie takes place in 1988 in Middlesex, Virginia. Our main character is a troubled 16-Year Old who's recently refused to take a number of medications. At the moment, I was already disappointed. Yay, clichés. However, in a matter of less than twenty minutes, I found myself liking Donnie Darko's character to a very large extent.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the movie is the growing tension in every scene. You know something is going to go very wrong, even if it takes awhile. To see the characters develop around this growing tension, is what caused everything to have some sort of meaning. As little things were shown on screen, very minimal, I knew they had to mean something. I would hope this movie would not have thought I was stupid enough to either ignore them. Though, they were not too obvious either. I just have an eye for these things. Early in the film, Donnie awakens, and appears to be sleepwalking. He walks outside into his yard, where a grotesque bunny is waiting for him in the yard. He informs Donnie that the world will end in less than a month, it's presented in such a disturbing way that, well, you think the world is really going to end like this being is saying.That's exactly what the film is though, terrifying. Is it scary? No. It's on a whole other level of emotion, one which penetrates you, and scares you in an emotional way. As the film continues, an apocalyptic tone is thrown all over it, with atmosphere that I have yet to see in any film. Underlining this film about the end of the world, the social commentary is dead on. It's a universal film, one that speaks of the corruption seen in our everyday society. Never have I been so disgusted to watch a rather common dance done by grade children. Once again, that's another element of the film. It's disgusting...But in a good way. Does that even make sense? The film needs to be looked at as if it were a 3D-Model. It needs to be watched numerous times for us to find meaning in it, even if that meaning is different to every single person that watches it. Everyone will see a different film. If you're looking for a End-Times Sci-Fi Thriller that will entertain you, look elsewhere. This is a film for those who want to analyze it, want to think about what they're seeing. Not saying that it is not entertaining, it's amazingly entertaining.The film counts down the days until it's conclusion. Each day, the sun in the scene seems to be ab it dimmer, until it's completely pitch black. Never have I seen such creativity and imagination in a film, nor have I ever been so amazed by a piece of cinema. Dare I say I prefer this film over EOE? Dare I say that this film is the most amazing I have ever come across? I think I do. After the credits rolled, I was stricken with a feeling of sadness. It felt like it was ten seconds long. This film needs to be explored, and most importantly of all, remembered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This version of this astounding movie is something that audiences have not yet seen. While there are still existing scenes from the original, this movie feels as if it is a different experience. I will not give anything away, but I will say to treat this movie as something brand new with aspects of an existing storyline to create a new idea and perspective. Look at this one as a different movie from the other, and instead of feeling that it is replacing the former movie, understand that it is simply co-existing along side the original. I think that true Darko fans will embrace this movie as a further interpretation into the fantasy of Donnie Darko.</fullReview>

What to say: give it at least 2 visions, the first emotional (listening to the sound track mainly) the second critical (trying to understand the plot).Just my 2 centsMax</fullReview>

His range is simply astounding and is one of the most talented young actors of his generation. He is admirably supported by an able cast, including his sister Maggie, which was a master stroke in casting as it lends an authentic air of continuity. The chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Jena Malone is equally impressive. But it is the plot and script which astounded me, the dialogue is astounding and the twist, when it arrives, is audacious and mind-blowing. It is a film which demands multiple viewings.</fullReview>

It's hard to classify to one specific film genre. It's sardonically dark, edgy, gripping, and tragic. I guess if there is one genre to put it into; it would have to be AWESOME. However, that is only a word and does not do this film proper justice. This movie has changed my opinion of Jake Glynenhaal completely. Prior to viewing "Donnie D." if felt he was a blasé type of actor. I was wrong. I might have to watch all of his films over and re-critique how he formulates the characters he portrays.

There have been comments made that compare this movie to classics like the Neverending Story and Willow. Not a logical comparison at all. The latter two films are fantastic journeys into different worlds that require a youthful joy and belief in the magic of all things to appreciate. Donnie Darko is a social commentary, a dark comedy, and a mono-mythic masterpiece. The film has certain part that drag, but it compensates for its shortcomings by offering up thought provoking subject matter. I firmly believe that those who enjoyed such films as 12 Monkeys and the like will appreciate this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film For Creative Youth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The following regards the DVD release of the original version.Throughout my many years of looking at User Comments about countless movies here on IMDb.com, I am on occasion amazed at the glaring lack of insight of some people to appreciate the creative genius that most other people agree exists in certain films. Unfortunately, in the case of "Donnie Darko," I now find myself to be one of those morons. Sorry, but I just didn't see in this film any of the stupendous achievement that most other viewers have found. I found the film neither highly original, profound, nor particularly intelligent (beyond a plot construction that the viewer must wrap his brain around).My lack of appreciation makes me ponder not what I've missed in the movie, but myself: Have I "lost it"? Why don't I find "Donnie Darko" to be the ingenious gem that most others agree it to be? One theory: I'm too old for this movie. Of the people I've known personally who've said they enjoy "Donnie Darko," I realize that they all have been teens to twenty-somethings with a creative bent and perhaps who also possess a soupçon of general life-angst and who are, perhaps, like Donnie Darko himself, more intelligent than the people around them; young people who feel isolated because of their superior ability to doubt or challenge what others around them accept blindly. If that description fits you, then see "Donnie Darko." Regarding that particular plot construction: there have been movies somewhat similar (David Lynch's "Lost Highway" comes to mind), but not one that pushes the buttons of today's youth. So that's my assessment: "Donnie Darko" is a film that creative, intellectually-superior-to-their-peers, mentally/socially fettered youth can rally around as one that speaks to them. However, if you're a FORMERLY youthful, creative social misfit like myself, you'll probably not care too much for this film. You've already gone through your phase of attraction to science fictional phenomena of wormholes, time travel and evil-looking imaginary friends to assist you out of your teen-angsty life. We older creatives have already embraced and abandoned such phenomena; but now here they are, presented anew, for a new generation. Every generation of us needs such a film. Enjoy it, my younger brethren.** Spoiler ahead ** Extras on the DVD include extended and deleted scenes. Some of the deleted material puts a divine spin on the story, which I agree with the director (in optional Commentary) inclusion of which would be too revealing, too explanatory (and, being an atheist, would turn me off). Better to let events be of mysterious origin. Oh, and for the record, I found the Bunny Boy of the movie "Gummo" far more intriguing and symbolic than Frank in "Donnie Darko."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ALright, I just picked up Donnie Darko last weekend, and got around to popping it in the DVD player tonight. I was under the influence from rave reviews from friends this was going to be a comedy or Dark Comedy. I wouldn't say it was much of a comedy, my mother thought it was a very dark movie. It was done in a weird-sense but I did enjoy the film. Along with the enjoyment upon arrival of the credits scrolling upon my screen I responded with "what the hell was that"I would have to say chalyss summary hit the nail on the head. What I thought they had missed was in Jim Cunningham's home there was a painting of Frank also at the ending with the short clip of frank with his drawings he touched his eye. It would have made sense had they introduced Frank earlier in the film or shown the connection of between donnie and frank. All I could draw from it was that possibly Donnie's sister's boyfriend was Frank ( she was on the phone with someone earlier in the film and i couldn't recall it entirely)Overall I enjoyed the movie, it had some awesome imagery and an interesting use of surround sound. Check it out! it was only 10 bucks at Fry's.- Paul</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>extraordinary film, supported by a great cast, mixing fantastic elements with familiar ones of everyday life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor spoilers herein. Donnie Darko became an instant cult classic when it went out on 2001. Not only because of the fantastic or science-fiction elements in it. The mysterious and strangeness that pervades the whole film, stems from the insertion of fantastic elements troubling suddenly the daily life of a typical American suburbs and especially (only ?) the hero, Donnnie Darko.Donnie Darko is a high school student in a private institution, plagued by somnambulism, and visions of a giant fearsome, devilish, rabbit who dictates him to commit violent and seemly destructive actions. Even before seeing the rabbit, he must attend sessions with a psychotherapist because of violent past acts. Thanks to the rabbit, he escapes being crushed during its sleep by a huge reactor falling from nowhere. From this start, doom is looming, threatening the world. In effect, the film is set in the end of the eighties, at the end of the Reagan Era, before the election of Georges Bush. So the world we know as a spectator has not ended. The mystery is installed we feel of the impending doom must be thwarted in some ways or else. Like great fantastic films we never know if all is real or a great part the product of the mind of the main character, Donnie Darko. Is all not a dream of a sleeping young boy before the crash of the reactor. Nearly all are not hallucinations from the pills he is obliged to take? We'll know at the end. The real force of the film is in the successful mixing of different disparate elements: - Psychology suspense. Donnie Darko is real a troubled teenager, trying to find a place in an adult and largely inept world to his eyes. But the family and its parents are not ridiculous, only mildly Republican. They are not portrayed as bigot or stupid or insensitive. His sister (played by the beautiful and talented Maggie Gyllenhaal, the real life sister of Jake playing Donnie Darko) is not necessarily his enemy, though they are fighting verbally at times.- Social satire. Swayse plays skillfully a positive action guru which has the support of the school hierarchy. The simplistic solutions he wants to impose are cleverly denounced publicly by a rebel Donnie Darko.- Science-fiction through a possible tale of time traveling and parallel universes. The film plays with time paradoxes which are central to the structure of the film. This element succeeds in being exposed in a not ridiculous fashion is the source of the success of the film. In fact it helps creating an atmosphere of unreality and danger throughout the film.- An '80 evocation and near nostalgia (mainly through the soundtracks: for example the Killing Moon of the Echo and Bunny Men at the start the film, the party)- Teen and college coming of age movies through the love affair wit the newcomer girl.A special mention for the excellent supporting cast, especially Drew Barry More and Noah Wyle, as high school teachers out place in the ridiculous narrow minded private high school.</fullReview>

Not to mention the character called Frank - a giant scary guy dressed in a bunny suit. The moment you see the mask he wears you will be breathless. God damn, the mask is a little masterpiece. And Frank's voice... "Wake up, Donnie". The best scene? I think it has to be the cinema scene, while Donnie is watching "Evil Dead" (yeah!), Frank appears and something unusual happens...

		<fullReview>I saw Donnie Darko the other weekend and thought of it as a breathe of freshair. I've been really getting used to overestimating movies lately but in this case I got more than I expected. Donnie Darko is a creative, funny, and witty movie, full of memorable lines and bizarre incidents. It is indeed a cult film and the user comments alone are enough proof of that. Some people completely don't get it and some loved it. I loved this movie I didn't understand the end, but by then I didn't care. It's cool, if your into movies out of the norm you should definitely go see it. If you're someone who is quickly and/or easily frustrated, this movie will probably piss you off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie darko is a dark humorous psychological introspection that brings you on an adventure into the depths of the psyche and consciousness, transcending boundaries between the personal and collective realms. in a way, it is a sci-fi journey that explores parallel universes. in another way, it is a mythical journey that includes the manifestation of surreal forms(bunny). Perhaps it could be closely related to lynchian material, but in my opinion presented in a more tangible and understandable way. it really depends on the placements of perspective to personally define this work. you would either love it or hate it, because it is after all, a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific movie, a surprise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SHORT SUMMARY OF THE PLOT: Donnie Darko is a boy with mental problems who lives in the small town of Middlesex. He starts to see a giant black rabbit and from that day his life, and the ones of people around him are changed. The all story seems to be connected in its deployment with time traveling.When I went to theater to watch this movie I expected a tale about a super-hero (because of the stupid Italian trailer, in which there are no rabbits, can you believe it??). However I was expecting something like this, a movie without a concrete plot and some special effects. What i actually got was instead an amazing tale about a boy affected by strange (dreadful in my opinion) visions of a giant rabbit and strange worms coming out of people. The movie gains a complete and effective meaning only at the very end -but i suggest that you search on the Internet for more info, because some very interesting aspects of the plot are not explained at all in the movie - and during the whole film you get a sense of drama , awe and complicity. The ending is a surprise, too, and concludes in a magnificent way what can be defined as one of the best movies I have ever seen. Absolutely unmissable. 10+/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is the name of the depressed main character (ably performed by Jake Gyllenhall). Donnie is a genius, but like the stereotypical genius throughout history, is also on the edge of psychosis. It is indeed a dark and creepy film, but not really a horror movie, at least not in the sense of modern shock-value horror. This is a thinking person's horror movie, a psychodrama if you will.This film is not only the story of a mad genius trapped in the body of a horny teenager, but in a broader scope is a philosophical work about the meaning of existence, the meaning of God, the importance (or lack of importance) of the family, the essence of truth, the fabrications of commercialism, and the relative hotness of Christina Applegate.Confused? Well, the movie is a bit like that. I think the purpose is to make you think about all these things rather than provide any answers at all. When the end comes you're left a little bit bewildered, but that forces you to try to find meaning in the film, to see the points the screenwriter has tried to make.A very good film, well acted, with some clever camera work. Has an excellent script, plenty of humor from both the kids and the adults, and a lot of deep, thoughtful bits that make you go "hmmmm". Could have used a little trimming (like perhaps the entire infomercial character played by Patrick Swayze), but otherwise a very interesting film. I can see it has the makings of a cult classic (it may already be one for all I know).8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Janeway Headache</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This little known film, that I only by chance saw this evening, may move into being a classic. It slowly pulls you in and leaves you involved in ways you never expected. It is very nicely done in many ways but will not be a film for all... it would not play well in the 'Red Country' for example. The film is oddly dark and charming at the same time. At first it seems like a quirky teen coming of age movie. Then you wonder if you have fallen into another teen horror film. These are all just teasers though and it is much more than it appears. Stick through to the end for it is not what it appears at first glance. It was one of the few films that I was not able to predict where it would go. This is a story you play back in your mind and actually wish... Well I will not be a spoiler. Janeway would have to deal with a headache.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time at a party at around midnight when i was hopped up on caffine and sugar. It totally blew my mind out. Then i watched it again when and it still blew me away. The writing for this film was unbelievable. The fact that Richard Kelly could come up with this vision and turn it into a movie amazes me. The characters evolve continually and move through a web of complete insanity. The plot of the movie is so twisted and inexplicable that you just need to see the movie for yourself. After watching Donnie Darko you'll spend about two weeks trying to figure out what just happened. It makes you look deeper into the meaning of life and what we are meant to do. I know that sounds cliché and all but its true. I also must add that the song that plays at the end can move a rock to tears. That's how emotional the ending is, it just really gets to you. All i can say is just go see the film, thats all there is to it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Donnie Darko about two weeks ago, and it has become my new obsession. And I only obsess over well directed movies that have good plots behind them.The movie is about this guy named Donnie Darko (wow! Go figure) And he is schizophrenic or bipolar...but he generally has a freaky mental disease. Anyway, one night he strides away from home in a sleeping daze...and he comes upon a 6-ft tall rabbit named Frank. He tells him exactly when the world will end. During this time period, a plane engine has fallen into Donnie Darko's bedroom.Then Frank tells Donnie to do assortments of bad things. Flooding the school, for instance. His psychiatrist is the only one who knows of the things that go on within Donnie Darko's tortured mind.Overall, the movie was well produced, and the special effects were consistent with what happened in the movie. The plot was good, there were a few anachronisms, but it added tot he overall effect of the movie. SO RENT IT!!! But don't let children under 13 watch it for the multitudes of obscene language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a would-be lynchian bland washout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all the praise people had heaped on it, I thought I watch it to see if it's any good and it turned out a total washout even though I watched it with an open mind. I'm bamboozled! There is nothing whatsoever to justify the accolades! Watching it I felt like it never really got started. I was waiting for something intriguing to happen that would grab my attention. But instead we are served some puny pranks and you wonder what that ado is all about. So those practical jokes are supposed to make Donnie a cult figure? The things Donnie commits are nothing we haven't seen before. He's just an average student. Scene after scene Kelly tries to draw a surreal atmosphere but there's no food for thought involved. The whole plot is just too weak and lacks any kind of sophistication to make you reconsider anything.SPOILER: Donnie talks to the mirror. Oh big deal! He has a split personality! We haven't seen that one before! He travels back in time? What's new? There is nothing outstanding about Donnie and his personality. And as the whole movie was just tedious, the ending couldn't make up for the rest. Director Kelly seems to have studied David Lynch closely but failed the test miserably. For real thrills and mystery watch "Lost Highway" instead. Those familiar with Lynch's body of work cannot help but dismiss this as bland Lynch-light for teens that don't know Lynch or that only purport to like because it's tr?s "hip." To each his own. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As much about time travel as good vs evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I've seen this movie three times now, the first two were the original version, and this last time, the director's cut. Having already "figured it out" (as much as one can) after the first two viewings, I spent more time on this third viewing trying to catch the subtleties and symbolic references. What I think I learned is that Richard Kelly is going for something far greater than a sci-fi time travel flick. Initially, I didn't care very much for the first 30 minutes of the film - I felt it was unusually and unnecessarily rough with foul language and discussions of Smurfs having sex for a few cheap, misogynistic laughs. My view has changed - Donnie lives in a dark, evil world. This 30 minutes tries to drive this point home. The Chinese girl who is always getting harassed, in some ways, I now feel is a central figure in the movie. It's no coincidence that she always wears ear muffs. It's no coincidence that she plays an angel in the school talent show. This is the same "angel" that students are hoping gets "molested", a line one of the characters sneers in her direction at the bus stop. And it is especially no coincidence that she has Donnie's name written on her notebook when Donnie confronts her and tells her "someday, everything's going to be alright." He then puts on the ear muffs. She's the Clarence, and Donnie's the Jimmy Stewart. I think one of the previous posts is dead-on with the "Last Temptation of Christ" and "Evil Dead" signpost that was left for us. This movie is up there with some of the best Hitchcock ever produced - every scene matters, right from the start, even if you think it doesn't. Every line is important. Every scene change and dissolve is planned, and is meant to tell us something. If you've seen this movie once or twice, and think you have got a feel for the plot and what is happening, try looking for the good-vs-evil relationships. I definitely have gained a deeper respect for a movie that I already felt was one of the best I have ever seen.By the way, I think the original version was a tad better - the director's cut takes a bit of the fun out by explaining things, although there's still plenty to talk about. It just seems a bit less mysterious this time around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a stunning film. Though flawed, Donnie Darko possesses everyaspect of a classic film. The acting in the film makes it very easy for just about anyone who watches it, to relate in some way or another to a character in the film. The script twists your mind, and brings up important issues in society and the everyday lives of almost everyone. The movie also captures every viewersimagination, and whether you love this movie, or just hate it, you think about it for days. The direction that Richard Kelly had to do was nothing short ofgreatness, and I think people should keep an eye out for future films by Kelly. Kelly creates a very terrifying, graphic, and demonic world in this film, and this creation is very similar to the real world. The characters in this film are so real to the audience, because they are all so flawed and not as predictable as otherfilm characters. Donnie Darko 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The search for God is absurd?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you that have seen the original version of this film, the director's cut fills in some unanswered questions and nearly takes this film into a whole new genre. After leaving this film last night at the theater, my wife and I had another two-hour discussion about this film. One of the discussions that we had was if the director's cut perhaps moved this perfect film from the world of fantasy into the world of science fiction. This is something to think about when you watch this edition. The ending of this film (not to give anything away) opens the door to the possibility of the genre change. Throughout the film there are hints towards this chance change, but it isn't until the end that it becomes clearer. That is what impresses me about Richard Kelley's unbelievable film, it opens your mind to several new ideas and possibilities. He does this by adding chapters from the book 'The Philosophy of Time Travel' to better guide us through the different phases that Darko encounters and experiences. Also, Kelley adds the images of the human eye to several of the scenes to create a stronger connection between the tangent universe and reality. This director's cut seemed more like a dream than the original, and I thoroughly welcomed this change.There are a handful of other scenes that Kelley adds that helps enhance the world around Donnie. We learn a bit more about his parents, his girlfriend, and his therapist. There also seems to be more referencing to religion in this edition. I was overjoyed to see this because I felt that was an aspect missing from the original. There is a wonderful discussing in this film between Donnie and his therapist concerning the difference between an atheist and an agnostic. This powerfully sealed the film for me. It allowed a bit more insight in Donnie's character as to where he stands on the issue of God and the strange events that are happening around him. It was as if the final piece of the puzzle was finally put into place. Thankfully with these extra scenes and better sound we can witness Donnie Darko in it's purest form. The way the director wanted it to be. We finally were able to see the finished product, and for some it may not be the finale they desired, but for this film fanatic it was extra icing on the cake. The additions of some new songs only help build the already haunting sound of this film. Honestly, who can match the remake of the Tears for Fears song 'Mad, Mad World'? It seemed like it was made explicitly for this film. Finally, how can you challenge a film that releases the secret to time travel? The truth is out there? Not unless you have seen this film. There are some cases when a director's cut will dramatically change the structure and sensation of the film. This was not the case here. Kelley changed nothing with his deeply developed characters or the overall story. The only aspect that I feel did change (and possibly not for everyone) was the possible genre switch. It will be up to you to see if this is true or not. Donnie Darko continues to remain on my top eleven films ever list. I do not see it dethroned anytime soon, especially with the release of this director's cut. It is a cultural phenomenon and a thought provoking film that will leave impressions on your mind for years to come. You will not see films like this in the recycled Hollywood riff that is currently being released, and I doubt we ever will, so go out and buy this film today. It honestly is one of the greatest ever to escape the grasp of Hollywood.You will never experience a film like this again in our lifetime.Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far from masterful...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw Donnie Darko, sometime in the beginning of2002, I walked out part way through disgusted with its pretensions.However, to its credit, Darko never left my mind; it was a movie thatI thought about in spare moments, piecing together its fracturednarrative. Because I could not shake the movie from my brain, Iwatched it again, in its entirety this time. Although I still found itpretentious and silly, I also found it entertaining; subsequentviewings have raised it further above my initial assessment.That said, I am not about to proclaim Donnie Darko a masterpiece,nor am I willing to call it a good movie. Ultimately, Donnie Darko isa failure - an attempt at high-minded science fiction that combineselements everyone's already noted, John Hughes and horror. Ofcourse, Hollywood could use a few more failures like this. Itherefore recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies tosee how an interesting idea can turn sour in the hands of anamateur. Philosophical movies rarely work (13 Conversations About OneThing and Waking Life are examples of successful philosophicalfilms). Donnie Darko does not work on the philosophical levelbecause it attempts to infuse philosophy into a story that requiresthe director to spend too much time on narrative. Philosophicalmovies, to be successful, require a lot of talking (and not aboutSmurf's sex lives); a science fiction, horror, teen-comedy plotrequires an emphasis on story. Philosophy therefore takes a backseat to narrative and the whole movie comes off as a cursorysummary of Philosophy 101 (sort of like the Matrix acting as aprimer for Religious Studies). Ultimately, the movie's ideas lackthe depth they deserve; Donnie Darko's philosophical ramblingsare half-baked and appear as such. Ultimately, that's why themovie flounders. As I said, though, it is an entertaining failure. The performances(aside from Jake Gyllenhal who gives easily his worst performance outside of Bubble Boy) are top notch and thecinematography is mostly fantastic (some slow-motion shots wereannoying, but the exteriors of suburbia were perfect).Furthermore, the movie, at times, captures a perfect mood andatmosphere. I am thinking specifically of the scenes toward theend, after Donnie and Gretchen have left the party, and the scenessurrounding their date at the movie theater. The mood created inthose scenes cannot be beat, as they combine perfectly with themusic Kelly chooses for the soundtrack. There's a beautifulelegiac quality to Under the Milkyway, Love Will Tear Us Apart, andKilling Moon that those scenes mirror. If Kelly had maintainedsuch a mood more often, I would be more inclined to give thismovie a positive review. For the most part, people fall into two categories in regard to thismovie - they either love it or hate it. I fall in between. I find there toomany faults in this film to ultimately recommend it, but I also findthat there are enough bright spots for me to abhor it entirely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I may actually understand this movie. This movie didn't creep me out, or scare me. It made me think. If that really was happening, Donnie was trying to save everyone. Instead of killing everything on the face of the earth, he killed himself, to spare the lives of the others. He cheated out death, which was why the world was going to end. Instead of making everyone pay for his "mistake", he payed for it himself. I think honestly that Donnie Darko was a great movie, and that it is just very misunderstood.I guess you just have to be capable of putting yourself "inside" Donnie's shoes, and see it his way. It's really the only way to understand the movie, but I guess you need an open mind as well.</fullReview>

On the marquee at the movie theatre where Donnie goes with his girlfriend there are two films listed. See BOTH films... most of you have probably already seen Evil Dead ( but see it if you haven't it's a good scare) the other film is the key to this film. Watch it in its entirety!

		<fullReview>Wow. I just finished this right now on Halloween night and I'm blown away. Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a depressed troubled teen who has disturbing visions from Frank, a man in a bunny outfit. He tells Donnie that the world is going to end in 28 days and tells him time travel is possible. Throughout the month of October until "the end of the world", Donnie struggles with his visions from Frank and gains knowledge on time travel and the pursuit to happiness and the separation of love and fear.The movie is a total breath of fresh air from the recycled crud the theaters are currently running. The plot challenges the audience to push themselves beyond their limits of understanding things. The movie doesn't focus on being scary, such as someone sneaking behind someone and crashing cymbals behind their head, but instead centres around the disturbing thoughts, and reactions that Donnie goes throw. Jake Gyllenhaal was absolutely incredible in this film. His performance was radical and totally believable. By the way, was he nominated for an Oscar for this one?If not, he damn well deserved one.Donnie Darko is dark, challenging, and undoubtedly brilliant. An instant cult classic. I loved it.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie if you can stand time travel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is Richard Kelly's first(?) movie and it walks the line between human drama and science fiction. The sheer weirdness of Donnie endears us to him as we try to comprehend the boy behind the eyes. Also of note are the supporting characters. A gigantic, grotesque, yet calming, rabbit, some teachers, a teenage love interest and a guidance counselor provide contrasts to Donnie. Of great importance to myself is the scene in the lecture hall, the great square off between Donnie and the anti-Donnie if you will. One strange-on-the-outside-calm-on-the-inside character against his exact opposite. Time travel is the other side of this coin and is probably what confused most people. This could have been the movie's only weakness but if you are like me and can stand a bit of a head trip it isn't too overbearing. The movie's achievements aren't huge but they don't have to be. There are characters we care about and a plot to keep them floating along. A good way to spend some hours.9/10</fullReview>

It's certainly the best movie I've seen in recent memory. Our society is being fed such pathetic, idiotic, lowest-common-denominator dribble, that it is thrillingly refreshing when one of those rare gems that actually engages the brain and spurs thought outside itself is offered. (Don't get me wrong: I have a huge soft spot for Jackie Chan, who offers no cerebral stimulation, and The Little Mermaid's about as brainless as they come, but I love it.) It's just so much fun following various possibilities, paths di- and converging, coming full circle again and again. I truly crave entertainment of this sort/caliber, and beg Richard Kelly to give us more!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not know there was a cult-following for this movie, but I can see why. It reminded me of Butterfly Effect, Grosse Pointe Blank, Dogma and American Beauty. It's a very intriguing movie, deals with similar issues as those in Butterfly Effect; Leaves you thinking about it for months after having seen it, which is a compliment of absurd proportions to those who contributed to this movie. Some scenes are a little over the top, some are even predictably overdone, but never in a way that it makes you not like it. I very much enjoyed a lot of the dialogue, it's done so well by all actors. His sister's role is extremely powerful, although we see very little of her. So are those of his mother and father in the film, they've done some amazing scenes. His dad is truly awesome when he tries to stop his wanting to laugh about what his son said at school, for example.The music and setting are so eighties that it makes me wonder what the creators are trying to tell us by doing that. Did they like the era more than the current state of things (like probably many of us do)? Still, some events in the story are quite unlikely to be possible in that time, which makes it even more strange.I'm lost for words, one should not write about it, one should see it at least two times, and enjoy the fact that it transcends life and religion. Very few movies succeed in attempting to do that, some accidentally have that effect, and I think the latter is the case here. It takes you where you don't naturally want to go, but it takes you there in a way that you never want to leave.From what I've read I would not recommend to see/buy the director's cut, maybe after they've created a remake out of that version it would be more interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I particularly liked the dark cynicism in this movie. The things that happened do not remind me of any other film (other than Butterfly Effect) and seem to be very original, and thus far more interesting. Though I wouldn't say it's my favourite film, it is a piece of work that enriches our society and reminds me that we aren't all drones following the same path till the end of our lives.Even though one may claim that a happy or optimistic movie would be better, this movie takes a hard realistic standpoint on the fiction it is telling. Most popular and profit-driven movies that come out nowadays do not and are not worth the time it takes to watch them. Happy or sad, if it strikes a chord within me and makes me think, pulls me out of my depressing life for a time then I will sing its praise and have that much more courage to accomplish my dreams.If you like to think more than you should, if you dwell upon pain and death, if you wish you were happy, this is a film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most fascinating movie I've ever seen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is not a doubt in my mind that this is by far the most fascinating and touching movie I've ever seen. The first time I saw it, nothing in it made any sense to me, but after watching it again and after having read the book "Philosophy of Time Travel", the key to the movie, on the Internet it struck me that this was nothing less than a masterpiece. A striking example of fantastic possibilities in the art of motion pictures.Watch it. Prepare to be mystified, but take the time understand this movie, and you will be astonished. I will not reveal any of the details in the actual plot here. Those, you must figure out for yourself."I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad. The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had." (From the song "Mad World" by Gary Jules and Michael Andrews)If this movie doesn't deserve 10/10, no movie does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the weirdest movies I've seen. The only one weirder is Fight CLub and Memento also great movies. At first the movie looked like it would be a scary movie but was it...it wasn't for me at least. Frank the evil bunny showed Donnie (Jake Gyllenhall) a way out of many things. The whole point of the movie is that at the end of your life everything will be gone except the people you have touched or everyone dies alone. The movie looks very serious but it contains some quite excellent comedic parts. So watch Donnie Darko it is pretty great. If you are looking for something to pass your time or just want to get in some laughs while watching a deep movie you should watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, with respect, this movie is awesome! I believe, from personal experience, this movie is about the acceptance of one's death and the ending of the world. Since I was young, I had a premonition that I was doom to die when I turn 21. My birth day was in October. I did not see this movie until 8 months after I turn 21 and written a short story regarding my experiences, endured before my 21st birthday, for a writing class. I was told to go she this movie after my peers read my story. I didn't see a bunny, but I saw many grim reapers flying over my bed as I lay sleeping days before my B-D. I didn't see them, but i could sense them, and visually pictured them in my mind. As I am 22 now, which means that I didn't die and here watching Donnie Darko for the Nth time, that time travel is possible and you can make it possible by generating future memories. I am currently working on theory dealing with the phenomenon of life and the singular perspective of the world. If you are interested in this movie and the meaning of it...check out Phenomenonism (highly philosophical). I see myself as a portal into my world, and when I die, the world dies with me. That is what this movie is all about to me. Have fun watching this movie, it can change you for life. Thank you Richard Kelly! You are SO CUTE!</fullReview>

In September, I had a Donnie Darko party where me and my friends sat around and watched the movie. It was really interesting because when you watch it you have your own theorie, your own ideas of what's going on, and they have thiers. We sat around and discussed our theories and talked about our favorite parts in the movie. It's incredible. This is one of my favorite movies besides maybe Fight Club.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant must see...Donnie Darko is a movie that nothing is as it seems. For the roles the characters have to play I do believe they do a great job. This Sci-Fi movie as most would call isn't as much unbelievable if you think about it. All actions have an equal but opposite reaction and all time is the basis for the layout of our lives... What says that another force is not acting on it to shape how out lives are lived. I think also that the ending message in this movie was also good and if you can catch it you will probably take it to heart.But don't believe me or anyone else says about movies find out for yourself because good movies just like beauty is all in the eye of the beholder...

		<fullReview>After my first viewing of this film I must say I was baffled (but in a good way). A further five successive viewings over the following weeks and I was still baffled. I searched in vein for someone to fathom a viable explanation for the disjointed finale of the film.Donnie Darko is a perturbed, sordid tale about a boy who is doomed (i won't elaborate on this, so as not to spoil the film). The film is interspersed with light humour throughout, this makes it enjoyable viewing time and again (although I don't recommend more than five sittings in under one month). The problem with this film, in a similar was to 'Mullholland Drive' by David Lynch, is that it is mysterious and misleading. On one hand 'Donnie Darko' is seemingly science fiction and geared towards time-travel. On the other hand it seems that the film is exploring the religious insight regarding life and death.This is what i loved about the film - you never really know what the theme is, but all the same it is intriguing due to the classy direction of Richard Kelly. The cast all put in excellent performances, so convincing in fact that i believed that none of them really knew what the theme of the film was. I have never seen a film like this before. It blew me away and made me want to watch it over and over. I don't usually watch a film more than once, so that must mean something.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has some fascinating concepts about the movie. From time-travel and time-travellers, the movie brings to light the concepts and how they may be perceived by the individuals who were or are experiencing them. It doesn't try to sci-fi these concepts or focus on science hyperbole, but instead shows it as being diagnosed as a series of schizophrenic hallucinations, through which really are to coincidental to be mere hallucinations. (Just a note: Is schizophrenia really someone who is "seeing" between other dimensions. We need to understand more before diagnosing people and prescribing drugs to these "sick" people. The mind is more powerful and capable than most people give it credit for..)If you can get beyond the main character's need to converse with a giant psychotic rabbit while in his hallucinatory state, you will see the movie wrap itself up nicely and as such concluding nicely.As a movie, it was a good movie. Good actors bring the storyline alive and make the movie enjoyable to watch. Overall, I would rate this movie a 8/10 for keeping the viewer interested.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern classic in many ways, but spoilers ahead!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is one of those films that you either love or hate. I don't want to sound like Mrs. Farmer from Donnie Darko when I say this, but you cannot feel nothing about this movie. It's very being is dependable on how you feel about the characters and events in this movie. Just a warning, there's a few spoilers aheadI first saw Donnie Darko when it was 11pm at night and I was at home with a friend. My friend happens to be a Jake Gynahaal fan, so she doesn't really notice much else about the movie. I, on the other hand, am totally riveted. But this film is complicated. I don't completely understand it. Parts, maybe, but by the end of the film I'm not sure what the hell just happened. But when I watched it for a second time I really started to understand it on a different level. And that's where the film is great.I guess obviously the type of person you are will influence how you interpret this movie. My friend called it a horror film. I couldn't believe that. I mean, this movie splits into so many different genres it's impossible to spearhead it into a specific one. Another of my friends said that in the end it was "all in his mind". Thats a pretty logical way of seeing it, granted, but seriously, if you really understand the film then there is no way that ending would fit!To really get into this film, I would say you need to read between the lines of this film and be able to keep your eyes open for the subtle hints that it drops on the way. Not to say that you should analyze this movie too much, but it's certainly not a movie where you simply go in and watch it. You really have to be able to connect with the character of Donnie, because the film is really focused on him and has much more to do with the evolution of the characters than the plot. Without the remarkable acting and character composition, this film would simply be a spacey, sci-fi flick and certainly not appeal to as many people as it has done.This film is pure genius, especially when you compare it to some of the nonsense Hollywood is churning out at the moment. It was great to see all the subtle edges that made it realistic whilst retaining the dreamlike state that pulls us all into the plot, characters and message.</fullReview>

I haven't yet seen directors cut but i hear good things about it and really want to go see it.Its sad the movie didn't hit it big in the box office but dvds have.

		<fullReview>This was remarkably the best movie I've seen in a long time. The first time I saw it I was totally involved with everything. The acting chops for Jake Gyllenhaal were right on for this performance. He has that "I'm a misunderstood-brooding teen on the verge of killing everyone" thing going for him. This was also the best movie for Jena Malone since "Cheaters". Drew Barrymore, Katharine Ross, Patrick Swayze add to this movies character in itself. (And who can argue with Swayze as a kiddie-porn king)?But, for me and most the people I talk to, you have to see it a couple of times for it all to sink in and make some sense. But it takes nothing away from the movie at all. The parents acting, though good enough, could have been better. But dinner time was never more fun-"How exactly does one suck a f**k?" P.S.--Frank is now my new hero.Twisted plot, above-par acting, well-rounded cast and good direction makes me give this movie and well deserved 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best American films released in the last 10 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a simply fantastic film. Being origially promoted as a intelligent teen horror film it became so much more and it will live to become a cult classic. This film will live on as one of the seminal films of its time because it is so incredibly well made. The film was amazingly well cast and it succeeded to create suspense and drama with a shoe-string budget where as films with millions of dollars fall flat on their face.Donnie Darko should be viewed at least twice so that you can pick out details that you may have missed during the first run through. It's an incredibly deep film and there is a lot to be inferred from the subtext. If you don't have the patience to go through it multiple times and pick things out then I'd recommend seeing the director's cut. While the film is longer and it explains a lot more of what happened and why, I feel that it sort of dumbs down the experience and hands the viewer the story rather than having them invest themselves in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The music alone is worth the price of the movie. But after watching and listening to the movie there are many points that are not completely explained which can easily lead to confusion. Listening to the director's commentary provides insight regarding the entire storyline and reasons for why specific scenes and events are important. I've watched the movie a dozen times and still like just listening to it. One important point, however, if you like the soundtrack, listen to the movie. The "soundtrack" does not include many of the fantastic songs in the background of the actual movie. Excellent cast. The fact that such talented and established actors enjoyed the script and storyline enough to participate in itself makes the movie valuable. This movie does not think for you. As a result it may not be popular with those who just want to watch a bunch of people moving around on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of modern cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing is with people like Richard Kelly or David Lynch, is that it takes time for their work to surface. In Richard Kelly's case, even more, since he was a first time director, with a cast of mostly unknowns and a plot beyond comprehension, for some. The masses rejected it, but just like Lynch, Kelly found his audience. Which i now, know, is more than just a cult. Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhal) is a trouble teen, living in small town America, among other troubled teens. What's special about Donnie is that, he has visions, which kind of translates to him waking up in strange places in the morning and visiting a psychiatrist. The rest of the story is more or less the usual, the new girl (Jena Malone) comes into town etc... Well, the thing is, the world kind of ends and an engine falls into Darko's bedroom. Not so usual. Weirdness ensues...I won't get into the trouble of actually explaining what it all means. Donnie Darko is one of those awesome movies, like 2001, which can translate into anything you want them to. Obviously, there is some point, which the director intended--(SPOILER)it is all leading to sacrifice(SPOILER), but the rest of the "void", you have to fill in as you like. People have said, it is a meaningless, confusing garbage or something close to that. All i have to say to them is that they maybe can't fill their own void, let alone Donnie Darko's... To me this movie is a real journey(or a "trip" if you like) and as i grow up and obviously watching this over and over, i find myself discovering new things, but ultimately i just discover myself. And that's the beauty of it and ultimately all the movies in general. I have to mention of course, the work that has been done by the cast and crew. Kelly, for whom i foresee a great future, has a magnificent eye for detail and a taste that even though it did estrange me just a tine bit at first, after repeated viewings, i became really familiar with it. And he certainly knows a lot about how to set the mood for a film, this puppy just grabs you from minute 1 and doesn't let you go... even when it's all over. It also has a very handsome photography, nicely dressed sets, effective special F/X and a cool soundtrack. And of course, kudos to Drew Barrymore for supporting this flick, she did the cinematic world a huge favor and she may have discovered a new Orson Welles. By now, we all know that MAggie and JAck ( Gyllenhal) are the new Joan and John(Cusack) of the decade--able to carry a movie on their shoulders and having the charisma to look adorable while doing it! Basically the entire cast of Donnie Darko deserves a praise, but they are just too many to mention here, great acting all around. Finally, i just like to say that if you actually have yet to see this movie and you agree that Kubrick is THE MAN, Leone KICKS ASS, Gilliam ROCKS and Whedon is a GENIUS and obviously KElly is the next Welles, then i think you'll just have a life changing experience. If not. Go rent Road Trip or whatever and stop trashing masterpieces like this.Rating 10/10--Top 20 in my list of favourite films of all times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was confused after watching this movie. I didn't understand the point of the many plot twists and detours and decided to read the IMDb to figure out what I was missing.But what is this? Almost everyone who loves the movie also claims that they don't really understand it! It is admired because it isn't clear what's going on. Well, I could write and direct a movie like that. Add some time travel, mystery, murder, darkness, weirdness, fear, unusual characters, chilling music, and prophesy into a convoluted plot and you would all call me a genius!I conclude that Donnie Darko is open to 100 different interpretations. If you want to pretend that you are superior to others and truly understand what nobody else can, then go ahead and proclaim how great this film is. But I won't be fooled by you.It takes talent to write a book or create a movie that cleverly ties all the lose ends together in the end. But anyone can create a pile of weird concepts that really don't tie together well - and that is what Donnie Darko is all about.Who admires this movie? It seems to be primarily mid and late teens. That's who recommended it to me. Why does this group like the movie so much? I speculate it is because those teen years are often dark and confusing, where you have many questions and few answer - kind of like this movie.</fullReview>

Then, go to the message boards on this movie, here at IMDb.com and read several of the posts on it. Read 'em all and follow the links provided by several of the posters there and study the theories projected by this film. Then, watch Donnie Darko again. It's amazing.

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko was a brilliant film. I thoroughly enjoyed the cinematography and tone of the movie. Mind you, the film's tone was decidedly tragic, in the Shakespearian sense of the term. Most people become hung up on the cinematic and thematic plot elements used, and miss the message of Richard Kelly, both the conceptual and cinematic artistry. His vision of the intellectual wasteland that was early 1990s suburbia was not only hauntingly tragic, but frightening in it's accurate capture of the moral decay present at that time in society. It's a dirty shame that he has not produced more cinema, or at the very least published a novel or two. Needless to say I was thoroughly amazed by his vision of the conflict between intelligence and idiocy in society. I give it 5 falling jet engines out of 5 (or a 10/10 for IMDb's purposes)DJ Excen excensmovieblog.blogger.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director's Cut is amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've loved this film from the time I first rented it a couple of years ago--so much so, in fact, that I'd seen it six times. Yet, it still seemed a flawed masterpiece. The DVD of the original version revealed that there were twenty deleted scenes--simply put, the movie was terribly over-edited. Sure, it was enigmatic, but it felt like a cheat in that so much vital information was withheld from the viewers. Yet, in spite of that, there was such grace, charm, suspense, and wonder that it drew me deeply in to this stunningly original work. . . But even in spite of six previous viewings, and listening to the director's explanation of the deleted scenes, nothing prepared me for the power of the director's cut, which is so well done, all I can say is you haven't seen Donnie Darko until you've seen the director's cut! Simply put, it's flawless. Acting, pacing, plot, characters, suspense, comic relief, and even sound effects are perfect. Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect as a dark kind of holy fool, a mentally troubled teen who is tormented by seeing a different world than what his peers experience. (And if you don't know by now, a key figure in that world is a gigantic, Satanic-looking rabbit who calmly prophesies the end of the world in 28 days.) All of the other performances are also superb, most notably those of his parents. Besides incorporating some of the deleted scenes (though not all), director Kelly much more closely integrates R. Sparrow's book into the story; scene changes become chapters unfolding as the countdown begins to the end of the world.If you haven't seen it yet, RUSH to where the director's cut is playing. And if it's not in your area, mark your calendars to begin checking on when the director's version comes to DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is your classic story of a boy and his bunny. Oh wait, except for the fact that the boy is heavily medicated for his psychological problems, and his bunny is six feet tall, can see the future, and will give you nightmares for a week. Other than that, it's just your everyday amazing cult flick. The cast is absolutely perfect, with especially stellar performances from Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, and Patrick Swayze. The soundtrack is also very good, and worth a listen in its own right. If you haven't seen this movie, you should seriously consider either sitting down and watching it, or moving to Antarctica.

		<fullReview>I just finished this movie for the 6th time. I cant get enough of it. The first time i watched the film i was mildly confused but fascinated by the character and the sheer bizzar nature of it. After a little explanation i understood the movie more clearly. I am now addicted to this film. Every time i have watched it I have picked up a deeper sense of what is trying to be said by the film maker. I am especially interested in a theory that I recently read. The theory states that there is a biblical parallel in the movie. Donnie being Jesus crucifies himself for the good of all man. By allowing himself to be killed in the accident he saved the world from Armageddon. the other half of this parallel is that Jim Cunningham is Satan this is a little more shady but he does portray many satanic traits such as hidden sinful activities while luring innocent people into his satanic ways without their knowledge. In my opinion this is one of the best films ever written.</fullReview>

Richard Kelly has crafted a film that is equal parts comedy, fantasy, tragedy and even musical. His characters have an empathy and depth to them that makes the viewer burst with sympathy or loathing for them. It amazes me that one so young could create a film of such maturity and beauty.

		<shortDescription>Imaginative, thought provoking film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its the type of movie where you wake up the next day still thinking about it. Very cool. It only suffers from being self-indulgent. It relies heavily on a set of parameters that the viewer never fully knows. It only hints at ideas and expects you to bridge the gaps which works for the most part. But with rules this specific, you'd expect a little more disclosure. Unless, of course, you just want the audience to make of it what they make of it... Don't get me wrong, I got it. But I didn't totally get it until I read what was in the book the old lady wrote (available at Donnie Darko fansites).A good example of a movie I feel similarly about is "Mullholland Drive" -- though Darko is not nearly as bewildering. Now, I'd probably enjoy the movie a lot more if Lynch made it possible for the viewer to understand what the hell was actually going on. The viewer can speculate and come up with some "whatever it means to me" kind of answer, but that's silly. Any good movie will leave you satisfied. It should challenge the viewer, not bewilder him.Performances were good, dialogue was right-on, the pervasive dark humour was funny. A must-see for any sci-fi/horror/cult lover.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike many art/cult movie fans, I for one am enjoying Hollywood's newfound idea of going for films that are 'wierd' or 'edgy'. I enjoyed both Fight Club and Boys Don't Cry, and Mulholland Drive, while hardly Lynch's best, is an interesting watch. Donnie Darko is even better than any of the previously mentioned films.It's not quite the confusing wierdfest that it's promoted it as being, but Donnie Darko is one of the most enjoyable films of the last few years.It is a science fiction/fantasy which delves into the life of an adolescent boy growing up in the 80s.Some brilliant casting of relatively mainstream actors was a smart move and they all play the parts well. The soundtrack is also awesome featuring some of the best tracks of the 80s, by the likes of Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Joy Division and The Church.Definitely a movie worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILER: This film is fantastic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...not only for mood, but subject, plot development and style. IMO, this is truly a cult classic - NOT BAD for Richard Kelly's "freshman offering." This is a movie for:1. everyone who "sees" and "hears" - and can "...connect the G** D*** DOTS...!" 2. wonders about the possibility of "time travel" - (in case you haven't noticed, you're doing it RIGHT NOW!) 3. and, for everyone who has ever felt dis-enfranchised and / or misunderstood; you are not alone....I like this movie because it exploits seemingly unrelated events and - with Donnie Darko's heightened perceptions and "super-hero" qualities - these all appear to fall right into his hands. NOW - before all the nay-sayers start screaming at me...how many times have you looked back upon an event or a sequence of events in your own life, and seen how they played out - do you chalk it up to "coincidence" - or...? From an more mature perspective of wisdom, can you see how things have worked out BECAUSE you followed your intuition. If you HAVEN'T ever done so, then you're "living blind"...Check this movie out...(and just in case you are wondering with what authority I heartily endorse this movie...I've seen it 175 times...!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10/10 work for Kelly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Intro:I heard of this movie somewhere off the internet and it just seems so cool. The plot and the overall theme of the movie just lured me into buying it. After looking all over for it, I finally found it. The last copy. I couldn't wait to just sit down alone and watch what it was all about. And I was blown away by the impact of this movie. Plot: 10/10 The plot seems like it is easy to follow for a long while in the movie, until it hits a sudden climax and everything changes.Donnie Darko suffers from many mental disorders. He is haunted by a giant bunny rabbit named Frank who tells him the "World" will in 28 days. His first encounter with Frank, prevents him being killed with a jet engine that crashes through his room, allowing him to live a tangent universe until that day comes when the World does end.The whole movie is full of hidden meanings and messages that come clear after watching it several times. But it is worth it.Characters: 10/10 Throughout the film, you are able to know all the characters. They area all portrayed by great acting and shot by the wonderful director, Richard Kelly.Acting: 10/10 Jake Gyllenhall, (October Sky, Bubble Boy) plays Donnie Darko. Very well, actually. He captured the true character that was presented to him and it couldn't have been don't better by anyone else. Jena Malone, (Cheaters, Life as a House) plays Donnie's "clueless" girlfriend, Gretchen Ross. She has no idea what is going on with Donnie and Jena's acting really absorbed that whole feeling that she gets from him.Also in the cast: Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jake's Sister. (Secretary, Mona Lisa Smile) Daveigh Chase. (Lilo and Stitch, The Ring)Patrick Swayze. (Dirty Dancing, Ghost)Noah Wyle. (ER)Drew Barrymore. Also produced. (Charlies Angles, Duplex)Directing: 10/10 Richard Kelly did a superb job in creating his own screenplay and bringing it to life. It was well written and filmed. Amazing for a debut director.Overall: 100000/10 This is an amazing film and everyone should see it. It is no doubt my favorite movie of all time. I've watched it 5 times or so now and I enjoy it every time. Get it and watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, if a friend tells you to rent a movie, and when you go to check it out you read the back only to find that the summary Blockbuster gives it is "An evil rabit tells Donnie Darko the day the world will end", you immediately begin to question your friend's taste in movies. However, this is one of those movies that, while it may sound weird, is nothing short of amazing.I recommend it to everyone I know, which is hard because they all want to know what it is about, and its difficult to give them a summary that accurately describes the greatness of this movie without giving too much away.Well, if you haven't seen this movie, watch it. Reading all of the summaries on the internet could never do this movie justice without ruining it. You won't be disappointed. And if you are disappointed, you're insane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly enjoyed this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt this movie hit the spot for a time travel movie.There were many things I enjoyed in this movie. I liked the fact that it was a period movie done in the 80's. I loved how the Tears for Fears songs were played out, which rarely happens in movies taking place in the current time. Loved the soundtrack. I like the little details - Donnie's mom reading Stephen King's IT to the hilarious smurf debate. When I first heard that this movie involved a time traveling rabbit - I was skeptical. But after seeing it I can only say that the moments with the rabbit was creepy, which is a good thing.I thought Jake G. did a terrific job portraying troubled Donnie.I've enjoyed reading all the board messages to this movie about the paradoxes of the time travel presented in this movie.I think time travel paradox movies will always hold a fascination with me. Cheers to the film makers of this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that you have to watch a few times and you still may not "get" it completely, but don't let that dissuade you from trying because if you can find that dark place inside, this movie might open something up in your psyche. I made my husband watch the last half of the movie with me tonight without explaining any of it and he ended up with tears in his eyes during the "wake up" scene -- when that haunting song is playing "the dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had..."I think it is, really, a movie about waking up and realizing that we all die and in that death a universe ends -- because, really, when you think about it, there is nothing in this world that exists outside of you yourself, so when you imagine your own death you have to imagine the stopping of everything. So, if you control your own universe, whatwould you do differently? How would you conquer your fears? (So I guess if you don't want to have nightmares after seeing this movie, rent "Defending Your Life" as a good post-Darko chaser).Jake G is amazing -- he and his sister (also in the film as his film sister) have the mose soulful eyes. You just want to hug him and say "everything will be okay" even though you are pretty sure it won't.Sigh...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is just so different then all those stupid teen flicks and romantic comedies out there. It's something fresh in a world of stupid movies which all have the same plot, I am so anxious to buy the "director's cut" version of the film. If you like sci-fi, drama, fantasy, or any other genre you will probably like this film, if you understand it. If you are one of those people who doesn't understand a film unless the plot is just put right in front of you and its just the same mundane crap that we see everyday you won't enjoy/understand this film. If you're willing to try anything once...give it a whirl, you'll be pleasantly surprised. I hope all who watch this film will enjoy it as much as i have. If you don't quite get it the first time watch it again or watch the director's cut when it is released on DVD. I've read that it adds more to the story. Thanks for reading my comments I hope they've been helpful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie, disappointing ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My initial reaction to this movie when it ended was disappointment; to an extent, I still feel this. I thought the movie itself was excellent, and yet the ending seemed to wrap up so quickly, it just didn't seem fitting.It wasn't so much the concept that I enjoyed, as I usually don't care for movies involving time travel. There were other elements that made this so great, such as the acting (particularly Gyllenhaal). The dialogue was amazing. I really think this could be overlooked as a result of the "confusing" concept and the creepy plot, but little things in the conversations were so refreshing to see in a movie. For this alone I could watch the movie over and over (not that I plan to). I also enjoyed the political and social commentary woven into the dialogue and the story. It was a huge part of the film, yet in so many different ways. Its thrown at you immediately that the story takes place during a presidential election year ('88). Debates within Donnie's family, conversations among school officials, and TV news reports constantly remind you of this. On a more subtle level, the entire power structure within the school is used to take multiple stabs at politics and society. There are plenty of specific examples, but its better to decide for yourself what it could represent.The best thing about the movie to me is everything going on while Donnie figures out the Frank/time travel mystery...his interactions with his peers, family, and authority. As I said, the time travel/cause and effect thing didn't really grab me. Its been done before, and will be done again. The ending seemed really rushed and it bothered me. Other than that, the story of Donnie and the hypocritical world he lives in is truly entertaining and thought provoking in many ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a fantastic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, as I write this, there are over 1200 comments already below mine regarding this movie. And not surprisingly,either. This one is a good one, and quite unique. A couple of distinguishing characteristics of this movie, briefly:1. Atmosphere: masterful, a tour de force display of creating atmosphere. This kid ought to be hired to make a movie from every Stephen King novel there is. What Stephen King does for atmosphere in his books, Kelly has done in Darko.2. Excellent realism with an ensemble cast. He manages to humanize secondary characters in a very short time. In fact, some of the secondary characters seem almost to be there only to create a sort of verisimilitude with respect to a human environment. The movie feels more lifelike because there are secondary characters whose function seems mostly unrelated to the plot, yet who are rather well drawn and fleshed out, nonetheless. Or rather, many of the secondary characters are fleshed out in ways that have nothing to do with the plot. This movie is quite Australian, in that regard: it has a large ensemnble cast where many of the characters seem to actually live lives of their own, independent of the central plotline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without a doubt, this is the best movie I have ever watched. From the very first second, this unique combination of a strong storyline, amazing acting, and a poignantly intellectual soundtrack, keeps your eyes glued to the screen the entire time. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers one of the most believable performances I have ever seen, with all the idiosyncrasies of a real person.Every actor accomplishes the tricky feat of establishing solid emotion without lapsing into soap-opera-esq melodrama. The score subtly enhances every component of the film, and the Tears for Fears song "Mad World" gives me chills. Donnie Darko is a completely unique movie that touches the viewer to the core. If you have not had the opportunity to watch this epitome of brilliance, please do, and tell all of your friends to join you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good movie, would recommend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I personally loved this movie. I like almost any movie to do with disturbing events/people. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Donnie Darko was wonderful, I've never seen him as a disturbed schizo. Jena Malone is great as Donnie's girlfriend, Gretchen. These two work together wonderfully. Jake is also wonderful with his real life sister Maggie who plays his older sister and Daveigh Chase who plays his younger. Jake has the paranoid schizo down and when he needs to, he plays the psycho very well. His interactions with the fuzzy rabbit 'Frank' are also very well done. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I would also recommend it to anyone who wants to see Gyllenhaal as he is very handsome as the leading man. Rating: 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen the VHS video cover and DVD cover before, and even on one occasion flipped it over to scan through the synopsis, but it *sounded* like a 'straight to video' flop, so I never gave it another thought.Until...A close friend of mine with very similar cinematic taste, insisted (more like yelled and screamed at me for not having the commonsense to have seen it already) I watch it.I must say that the first time I watched the film, I was in that confused/thoughtful state for a good few hours after, trying to piece together what I had just seen. On repeated viewings (and there have been a few), some things become clearer, while others become even more confusing.The simple fact is, that Richard Kelly at his first time up at bat, has succeeded at making a very thought provoking science fiction/drama/thriller/comedy/coming-of-age movie, and one that will be watched and discussed for a good time to come.If you are looking for some mental stimulation, and the odd shock or surprise, and don't mind thinking about and discussing films well after their conclusion, then you will absolutely adore this movie.If you are looking for Halloween XVII, then you will be sadly disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reminds me of Harvey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film in many ways, it really makes you think and awakes many feelings inside. I don't know if someone had noticed and mentioned this before (there was over 1000 comments made so I didn't read ALL of them!), but Frank the rabbit reminded me immediately of the film "Harvey" (1950) starring James Stewart. The rabbit must be some kind of a tribute to that film. In Harvey the rabbit was invisible for others than the person Stewart was acting. In Harvey the rabbit was never shown, but it was told to be 6-foot tall human-like creature, just like in Donnie D. The name of the rabbit (Frank) has a weird link to James Stewart too, because Frank Capra directed maybe the most well known Stewart-film ever, "It's A Wonderful World".Donnie Darko is an original, intelligent and beautiful masterpiece compared to many other modern films. The actors were awesome, shooting was artistic and creative, the script was very good and original... We even got to see clips from Evil Dead, which is another great movie. I highly recommend this film! 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard talk of this movie being so amazing, about all the depths it goes to.The talk was right. It was probably the most well put-together movie I've ever seen in my life. Donnie Darko goes on SO many levels, religiously, scientifically, and many other points.The amount of symbolism in this movie is mind-boggling. I cannot say anything at the risk of spoiling, but some of the symbols are more obvious, some are less, but lots of them have to do with religion. Nevertheless, it is one of those movies where 3 days later you'll realize what a person or event was being compared to.One thing I loved about the movie was the whole "Trance-Like" state Donnie enters when Frank is around. Jake has a very good evil grimace that makes him look like a nice boy, but pure evil at the same time. Very good acting throughout the entire movie. As far-out as the plot is, you actually believe it.All in all, with the somehow calm and soothing music mixed with a very eerie plot of the end of the World, Donnie Darko wraps up every genre of film there is in one amazing movie that is sure to be a classic for ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So ahead of its time, you have to go back...Are you ready?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko, much to my surprise did not enjoy any amount of great box office success upon its original release in 2001 (I think it was 2001) In fact, it did not even make a box office profit until its UK cinema release. I find this baffling as I believe Donnie Darko to be, quite possibly one of the best films in the history of cinema. It is many things all at once: funny, dark, touching, thought-provoking and at the end, heart-breaking.Richard Kelly's ideas are at once clear and yet elusive. Just when you think the film is heading in one direction, it turns on its heel and goes the complete opposite way, and this lack of definitive direction makes it gripping and thrilling. Each actor, especially the highly under-rated Jake Gyllenhaal give truly memorable performances and bring each individual character to life. Jake's sister, Maggie plays the clearly bright but reluctant older sister of Donnie, Elizabeth. Mary McDonnel is perfect as Donnie's confused and worried mother Rose. And Jake gives quite possibly the performance of his life as the angst ridden anti hero/super hero Donnie. Donnie is everyone, every viewer will be able to relate to one of his qualities be it his reluctance to reach other people's goals, his troubled past or his sarcastic (and sometimes immature) sense of humour - "When you go to sleep tonight, I'm going to fart in your face". The film itself is everything you could want in a movie. It has emotion and amazing special effects without going too "Hollywood". There is an incredible air of innocence about this movie that will touch anyone and everyone. I recommend this movie to people of all ages, but through past experiences I feel people between the ages of 15 - 25 will take more from the movie as they will find it easier to relate to the trials and troubles of the teenage Donnie. You must see this film, it will open your eyes to what all movies should be, and you will find yourself watching other movies and saying to yourself - "That's not as good as Donnie Darko" as I have done it on many an occasion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A near perfect masterpiece from newcomer writer/director Richard Kelly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2001, 'Donnie Darko' was released in limited release. I watched the trailer several times but never got to see 'Donnie Darko' in the theaters. But on March 19, 2002, 'Donnie Darko' was released on DVD; I immediately ran out and bought a copy of the film. From that day on I have been hooked on the film. I must have seen the film at least 20 times since then and I was very happy to be able to see the Director's Cut on the big screen.'Donnie Darko' is a very hard movie to explain mainly because everyone thoughts on the film are different. Heck my theories about the film change from time to time after repeated viewings. But the basic premise is this: Donnie Darko is a troubled high school student. He is seeing a shrink because he sees an imaginary 6-foot tall evil looking rabbit named Frank. Frank tells Donnie that the world is going to end unless he stops it. The movie then follows Donnie through paths of destruction and violent behavior, during this time Donnie himself is trying to figure out what is going on and if Frank is real or just messing around with his head. A lot of thought provoking content, an interesting and unique story, and a what the hell ending ensue?'Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut' is 20 minutes longer than the original cut released to theaters in 2001. What I liked about the directors cut was the fact that it added footage that helped the audience try to understand the film better. The added 20 minutes surprisingly does not contain an alternate beginning or ending. It's just footage that will help the audience understand the film better and the main part of that which helped the most in my opinion was to show chapters of the Philosophy of Time Travel book that Donnie reads in the film. If you have seen the film because and really enjoyed it, I suggest that you check out the director's cut. If you haven't seen the film, I advise you watch the directors cut before you watch the DVD version. The cast of 'Donnie Darko' is great. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the Donnie Darko character perfectly and this is a great Jake Gyllenhaal role not like his newer mainstream roles in crap like 'The Day After Tomorrow' &amp; 'Lovely and Amazing'. I liked the Donnie Darko character because he was weird, lonely, and interesting. I think Jake did a great job of playing a psycho teenager. Jena Malone plays Donnie's love interest Gretchen. Jena Malone like usual is wonderful in the role. She plays the lonely new girl perfectly. Her character was a very sad and had a very disturbing background story. As for the smaller roles, Patrick Swayze stars as the motivational speaker Jim Cunningham. He as well plays the 'Fear' guru perfectly. Not to forget Jake Gyllenhaal's sister Maggie Gyllenhaal also stars as Donnie's hip sister. The film also stars Drew Barrymore, Holmes Osbourne, Mary McDonnell, and Beth Grant all of which whom are near perfect in the roles they played. Casting was really perfect for this film. Although at the time this was released most of the cast seemed unknown. Richard Kelly was the director and writer of the film. Again Richard Kelly is one of the many first time writer/director who has made a terrific film on his first try. Richard Kelly knows how to write a thought-provoking movie. The script was fresh and original. The script also contained drama, comedy, and horror. I liked how Mr. Kelly created a film which was interesting and unique story. I like the fact that you as many times as you see the film you have a different opinion on it and is a good movie to chat about with friends. I also liked that Donnie Darko was a touching movie because you really felt the emotions of its characters. Richard Kelly caught the emotions of these characters and the pain and suffering of them as well. I also like how the movie featured a love story, which was never over the top and sappy. I really liked what Richard Kelly did with script and his direction of the film. I particularly like how Richard Kelly chose to shoot the film in a late 80s settings. I think it really helped out for the tone of the film. 'Donnie Darko' is a near perfect masterpiece, which is always just as good each time I view the film. I however feel that the director's cut is a bit better than the original release for the reasons I previously stated. I highly recommend 'Donnie Darko' to all people who like to think when they are watching a movie. I recommend it to people who like originality when watching a movie. I highly recommend this movie mainly because it features a terrific cast, a funny, dramatic, thought-provoking story, and great ending. Donnie Darko is one of my favorite films of all time. I give this film a high 9/10 rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening scene, straight away struck me to be intriguing. The music is eerie, it's a local neighbourhood, yet it's desolate, except for one teenage and his bike next to him. The use of this green grassy sub-urban area would normally represent happiness and security but for this character it shows desolation, my road in particular has neatly cut grass and due to speed bumps isn't that busy either. Whilst sitting down it is almost as if he has sub-consciously creates this disaster and that he has created Frank to sort out the problem as well I found the use of the bicycle to symbolise deformation of this boy's psychology. The fact that originally he is on terra-ferma and is in a ?solid' place confirmed his sanity is there. However once on the bike that represents an imbalance, for when he stops, he was fall off or have to dismount. I myself cycle a great deal, particularly at that age and particularly down hills (because unlike walking, downhill is basically a free ride). If Donnie was walking a greater stability can be perceived, however the use of the bike going down the hill shows a lack of control and an irregular velocity as he speeds up and slows down. Jake plays an adolescent and it is his expressions that capture Donnie's appearance and bewilderment surrounding the events that unfold around him. Richard's use of a teenager going through puberty illustrated the kind of viewpoints and distorted images that a person of that age can experience; they have a lot of hormones in their body and a lot of pressure from many directions being placed on them, all of which can negatively effect the psychosis of that individual. This altered vision and paranoia that Donnie is experiencing has led to the creation of a wormhole; a paradox with many subsequent turnouts that greatly affect the story and the flow of the plot. This is not a simple storyline from A to B, but once the jet engine is seen falling from the plane, we see that an extra tangent of this story has been created and this now has to be transposed into this once linear plot by the viewer. Once the timer to `the end of the world' is announced, we the spectators sit back and relax, simply awaiting the tale to unravel it self with the gradual countdown to the end of the film. Yet the time travel twist alters this experience and obviously involves the viewer more deeply; it adds a greater mystery element, as to what other surprises we should be expecting. The obscurity of the ?accidental' turbine also leaves the observer to consider how this came about, long after watching the film. It instils a sense of doubt as to how could this event come about, yet being a paradox the scenario is impossible, but it's the underlining fantasy element in an otherwise drama and thriller that adds to the greatness in this film. This leads us to the character of Frank the rabbit. Firstly it's a strange name for what would be classes as a pet, yet it's clear this is an independently wild strange creature. It's a human name, if it was someone's pet a more suitable name for him would be ?Fluffy' however it is clear that he is anything but that. The use of Frank as his name is appropriate because it is giving us the first hint that this is a human after all. Secondly, I saw frank as a scary character. His alien looking being literally adds an extra ?dimension' to the storyline. He is represented as a hard shiny metallic beast and I perceive the multi-reflecting surface of Frank illustrated the point that he had many personas, duties and represented numerous abilities (most obviously that it was just a costume with someone else inside). I to am like a chameleon, occasionally wearing more creased clothes and responding differently to different people.Throughout the film Frank has had different personalities. He has represented the hero and the key to knowing when the world will end, yet he brings with it death and anger, which is shown when he is confronted by Donnie in an automobile and Donnie realising he wanted a greater uninhibited independence. Its interesting that this occurs at night where, despite being able to see superficially further at night, the real world is in darkness. I had a rabbit called Rifkin; it was grey and died on my birthday. I to can familiarise myself with the character of Donnie.I liked the symbolism used in the film, I have already mentioned some references but the use of sleep to show which individuals Donnie had touched was a lot of fun to work out where his influence had been centred. This has had an affect on my particular sleep pattern and wonder if there's someone I have or haven't interacted with that day, and whether that's affected my natural order of things to get to sleep.The costumes used by April Ferry were really well inspired. The use of grey for Donnie showed a dull, neutral repression. It showed his generally lack of enthusiasm and absence of creativity. From this I've taken some initiative to wearing the hooded bit more of my tops (like right now) and experimenting with different hood colours so you see the world blinkered but with a different hue or tone making up the edges of your peripheral view (greater for females, because they have a wider angle of vision).I look a lot like Donnie, tall, slim, with short dark brown hair, this is probably the most obvious influence this has had on me, as for the use of the bicycle, I have got ridden of my car and now cycle to work. I don't have a skeleton costume but I have been seen about in a homemade dolphin costume (pictures available).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't read much about this movie before I bought it. However now that I have watched it, I am in awe. I will probably end up watching this movie a million times. It there were many parts of the movie in which I was laughing or concerned about what was going to take place. The character of the bully was right on, maybe a little over the top with the coke, but damn close for most schools. I recommend this movie to everyone in my age group.It got to me in a different level than any other movie I have seen. The selection of music used in this film was also outstanding! The final scenes where everything goes in reverse and we are back to donnie in bed confused me a bit, until I starting thinking back to what was said in the movie. Someone controls their own fate. That is what donnie did, as lost and confused as he was. I love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal), a disturbed 16 year old teenager that has an emotional problem. I have been doing some research and i think the medical name is called "Distress". Distress, is an emotional problem, and it cause's day-light hallucinations, violence and sleep-walking. Some things that cause Distress are stress and smoking. In the movie, Donnie is standing at the bus stop with his sister Samantha, Samantha's friend Joanie, Cherita Chen and Donnie's two best friend's Ronald Fisher and Sean Smith. Sean offers a smoke to Donnie. In the movie, it says:Sean Smith: And now that you're famous you gotta have a smoke. Donnie Darko: What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Sam? Samantha Darko: You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.The reason he doesn't want his parent's to find out is because smoking can make Distress worse. Donnie's stress is caused by either out of school or because be keeps sleep walking. In the movie, Donnie has to take medication. Some thing you don't know is that the tablets are really placebos. A site describe's placebos as:Imagine being prescribed a course of pills made of sugar and paste. They contain no active ingredients that could possibly alter the course of your illness, let alone make you better. And yet you do get better. The dummy pills work a strange kind of magic. There is in fact a great body of evidence to suggest that placebo or dummy treatments can sometimes work as well or even better than real medicines. Patients on placebos can even experience side-effects that mimic real drugs.You don't know that they're placebos because they cut it out from the movie. Some people think that Donnie Darko is about God and about the future. The reason they think that is because Donnie and his phycologist have a little chat on "does God exist?". Well, until i watch Donnie Darko for the 149 time, which mean's next week, i might get more idea's of what the movie means. Hope you guy's liked the movie! TTFN!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is awesome! Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect in his role as the mentally disturbed Donnie Darko. Jena Malone is sweet and innocent as Donnie's girlfriend, who may not understand Donnie's unique potential. Perhaps her love for him stands in the way of her fear of him. I first saw a small section of the movie on TV once, was mesmerized by it, and bought it almost immediately, which is something I normally don't do, for I usually try to watch the entire movie before I spend money on it, to make sure its worth it. This movie was worth it. The ending is shocking and the plot is great, but I also love the soundtrack. You love to hate his gym teacher, grow to feel sick towards the modivational speaker (Patrick Swayze in an interesting new role), and I can't help but cry at the end. Check it out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko, when i got this film i didn't know a thing about it all i knew is that we were going to study it for media and that we should watch it before we studied it. All i can say is this film is one of the most "different films" I've ever seen. When you 1st watch it it makes you think about everything that you've just seen and because of the gaps Kelly left in the storyline the audience are given the chance to express what they think happens and why it happens, this is what makes the film unique as each audience interpretation is different, there is no right or wrong answer to questions audience may ask. This what makes the film a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a few steps away from a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has many interesting concepts of what is really going on in the universe around us. It also does a good job showing how complicated life really is and how it can't be summed up into two factors (love and hate).This film revolves around a troubled teenager named Donnie Darko who is constantly having nightmares where he is visited by a horrific giant rabbit named Frank. Frank tells him in a very monotoned voice that the world is going to end in about a month. After hearing this information Donnie gradually tries to understand what is going on in the world around and also the world inside him.Now this movie does have its fare share of possotives but it does have some negatives. One of which is there are a few unanswered questions left behind. Now i don't mean unanswered questions which are left to you to come up with the answer, i mean unanswered questions where there is no answer (one example: why were the bullies hanging out in grandma deaths cellar late at night with knives). Another problem is that there is a few to many characters in this piece. In the end there is a purpose for each character though, but i still felt the film could have been just as good by leaving a few out. The final problem i saw in watching this film is some of the dialogue was not very believable (and this is coming from someone in the same age group as Donnie). Don't get me wrong a lot of the scenes have very well put together dialogue which make you think and at the same time take you into Donnies mind and show what he's thinking, but sometimes there scenes which to me are very fake and lame (one example: The first bus stop scene).Now don't get me wrong i did enjoy this film, it's just that there are some flaws i felt i should point out. In the end though the positives out way the negatives to this dark thrill ride. This is a very well shot movie and will keep you on edge of your seat the entire way through. I will recommend this movie to anyone who actually enjoys thinking while they watch a movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko holds its own as not only a great movie, but a cult classic. The movie has a stellar cast that propels us into this engaging piece of art. The plot is very original and the movies atmosphere, pacing and soundtrack work great with each other. Even though this movie was put to shame at the box office, it should be seen by everyone and should receive a lot more credit. There is no doubt that this movie is weird. It is very confusing and its definitely not for everyone. But the people that it is for love it for what it is. Featuring great performances by Jake Gyllenhall, his sister Maggie, Patrick Swayze, Drew Berrymore and a man in a rabbit suit named Frank, this is one movie you really shouldn't miss. Worth the rental and in my opinion the purchase. I hear its being rereleased in theaters soon, if you haven't seen it yet..see it then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko, to me, is probably the best film that my generation has put out. It's filled with twists and turns, it's unpredictable, and it even has a modern kind of Romeo and Juliet thing going on. It's not your big summer blockbuster, or cheesy thriller. This film actually takes quite a bit of thought. Donnie Darko has brought talent and taste into the world of cult films. Writer/Director Richard Kelley has done an AMAZING job portraying the mind of a disturbed youngster trying to make sense of his life. Not only was the story perfectly written, but the filming was aesthetically beautiful. Congratulations to everyone who helped make Donnie Darko, and I hope to see some more Richard Kelly work soon!

		<fullReview>After just seeing Donnie Darko, my mind is completley blown away by the enormousy of it. This film is so richly Beautiful and so deliciously dark(hence the name) quite an extreme of emotions in one sitting. If you give the film a chance its bound to captivate you with its wicked charm, its not just a movie, its an experience. It takes many viewings to understand it and to unravel its crypticness. Excellent Soundtrack and Brilliant song "Mad World" that suits the film perfectly. This truly deserves to be in the top #250 for its originality, maybe could of been put together better with higher budget etc.. but for what it is. its brilliant! A must see!

		<fullReview>Like this needs to be said here... but maybe it does. Not everyone will like, nor, understand this movie. Anyone who claims to understand, and know(as fact), everything in this movie, is lying. But thats not the point.After I first watched this movie, I simply sat quietly and tried to take in what i had just experienced. Donnnie Darko simply blew me away! I came to watch the movie through some word of mouth saying it was worth my time, and money(for the DVD). I'm so glad I took the time to see this amazing vision of an adolescent troubled by the world around him. The character, and the title, remind me of the Jhonen Vasquez comics. I might be crazy, but there are some similarities, bunny that talks to main character, anti-social, violent deeds, main character has bleak look on life, and both Jhonen Vasquesz's, "Johnny", and Donnie Darko's, "Donnie" have sleep troubles, to say the least. I'm not saying either is borrowing off the other, just some similarities, and they are there. (ha, a bit of side tracking there sry)Back to the movie. (SPOILERS!!) The movie follows young man, Jonnie, through his daily life after he starts seeing a strange "bunny man". After he sleep walks into a golf course and has his first encounter with the bunny, he finds out he finds out that he has just bairly missed being crushed by a plane engine that fell on his room. From there he meets a girl, goes to therapy, and tries to understand the cryptic messages the bunny gives him.  From an amazing plot to an great, if only a little odd, pace, the movie reaches its climax leaving the viewer with more than they bargained for. Although most of the characters are pretty thin, Donnie is deep and rich. This is forgivable, since Donnies character is so deep and likable. You feel his anger, desperation and lownliness, and you can sypathize completely. Yet the real winner is the plot and atmosphere. You feel trapped, like Donnie, in a suburban nightmare, constantly wondering if your really awake, or just dreaming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heh, I finally managed to talk my mom into running me down to Blockbusters after hearing good reviews on the movie Donnie Darko. In the end, I don't regret my selection one bit. I mean, wow... what a movie. Really tends to make you think about things, causes you to wonder. For those of you who are yet to have the pleasure of watching, Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a troubled young boy attending high school. While he may appear to be normal, Donnie is actually plagued by visions of an monstrous rabbit who not only orders him to commit acts of violence on the community, but predicts the end of the world as well. The acting couldn't be better in my opinion, Gyllenhaal does an unforgettable (in my opinion) performance as Donnie. It's a shame that he was overlooked when it came to the the Academy Awards that year. Either way, Donnie Darko will forever be a winner in my eyes. The director, Richard Kelly, combines (dark) comedy with so much more and scores big. I give Donnie Darko a prefect 10/10. Enjoyed every frame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Destiny and free will clash in the Fourth Dimension.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is not only a savvy satire of recent American culture, but a clever, passionate cocktail of genres. Richard Kelly has brought psychology and philosophy to a new level as he explores the life of 16 year old Donald Darko. Misunderstood from the start, Donnie is awoken one night but what he believes to be a man in a bunny suit. Seduced by the rabbit, Frank, Donnie is led from his room, which is pummeled by a rogue jet engine in his absence. Frank uses his introduction to tell Donnie that the world will end in 28 days.Donnie spends the next 28 days of his life experiencing not only more hallucinations, but social and moral conflicts that bring the audience to understand Donnie's purpose. Frank manipulates Donnie into a series of destructive acts that expose corruption, reveal truth, and prepare Donnie for the world's end.The audience follows Donnie through 28 days of drama and teen struggles as he begins to understand the grim connection between time, the universe, and all people. Ultimately, we are all faced with the same questions...and must make the most difficult choice of all...To conform to destiny's plan, forsaking life and love...or to betray our paths. Donnie Darko is the bittersweet story of what could have been, and what should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As man people do tear apart this film, I love to defend it.This is a film designed to have holes (if you read the original script it actually makes more sense) to make the film as perfect in Richard Kelly's mind eye possible.It was not only amazing artistic vision that made this film so perfect, but the fact that every time you watch it you follow a different story. There are so many to see in it, the parallel universe theory, the idea that he knows he is going to die because he is psychic, the idea that his God given path led him to that point. As well as the over-riding (in my opinion) that it is aimed to be a whole life journey carried out in 28 days etc.This film has it all, love, hate, love, SMURFS, rabbits with apocalyptic theories. This is a film you will either love or hate, and i believe to truly appreciate it you have to ignore the hype, don't decide on a specific story and just let it roll over you the first time you watch it.This is my favourite film in the world, without a doubt.

		<fullReview>My friends made me watch this film, they even bought it for me because they said it was amazing and after watching i felt slightly put out.It was only yesterday when i was sorting out my DVD collection i decided to watch it one last time before i threw it out and i was glad i did! The film is amazing and really deserves a high rating. The way it is written keeps your mind on edge and crystal clear because you want to know what happpens next and then after that. The only down-side i can see is that it is the sort of film you have to think about to get your head around it. That moves me onto my next point, Donnie Darko is not some Bridget Jones Diary film where you can sit back and enjoy it without using your brain too much, you have to keep attentive. That is why i can see some people don't like it because it isn't a straight forward a-z story that most people like. The different mixture of characters, from the well known (drew) to the not so well known (jake). They all produce a happy medium which makes the story more understandable and more interesting. Some might notice a familiar face from ER (noah) and i think this might be one of his first movies. He is very good in his role as the science teacher and is certainly an actor to look out for, i think so anyways. The main actor(jake/donnie darko)is amazing and works with all the situations he is faced with well, working well also with the other actors and making a firm setting for which people can enjoy.</fullReview>

It's a story of a teen named, Donald Darko, who is awakened in the middle of the night by a demotic bunny rabbit who tells him the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds. The movie is totally understandable until the last 15 minutes. Your mind will be boggled for days after viewing? you will ponder day in and day out.

As the cinema release of the film in the UK was limited i never got to experience this masterpiece of a film on the big screen. Hopefully if it gets back into the cinema in a cult film season soon, i will be there watching it to experience it in its full glory. I think for all of those who are fans of the film have to be grateful for Drew Barrymores financial input into the film as without her, there would have probably been no Donnie Darko.</fullReview>

Before I saw it, I had heard it was great from others, and when people tell me that it usually heightens my expectations, so I try not to listen.

		<fullReview>This movie is in a class all of its own. It is bound to become a cult classic with such great movies as The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The storyline is a tad confusing but worth the watch. It has a great blend of comedy, horror, and drama. While Donnie is a genius (and also very easy on the eyes for those females) he still has his issues and one of them is a 6 foot tall bunny rabbit. The rabbit goes on to tell him about the end of the world and tells him to do some not very nice things even if they were deserved. The ending has a great twist. this is not a movie you are likely to forget anytime soon. Excellent movie. If you like this movie you will probably like most movies with Jake in them. Enjoy :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i just saw the Director's Cut... WOW!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>last night i went to the SEATTLE INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL's gala viewing &amp; reception for the Director's Cut of Donnie Darko. Richard Kelly (director), Drew Barrymore and a few other cast members were in attendance. it was spectacular! all of the extra footage and the song rearranging (killing moon now ends the film and inxs' never tear us apart opens) make it so much better and a bit easier to comprehend. the extra dialogue between donnie and his teachers &amp; therapist were greatly needed and now i consider it a perfect film. it's really hard for me to find ANY fault with the director's cut. after last nights showing, there was a Q&amp;A with mr. kelly and the cast. i have nothing but respect and amazement for this director. he's super intelligent, amazingly handsome and downright sincere. i can only imagine fantastic critical success for his future. thank you, tika bordelon (whom has never doubted his commitment to Sparkle Motion).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this film was OK! until the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the starting of the film did well to lay out the plan of the story it was fairly predictable all the way through. however i thought that the film still deserves a lot of credit as it wasn't awful in fact i thought it was actually quite entertaining. it wasn't as good as i thought it would be either! i have been told it is a ground breaker in its field and that the film has made people change their lives. i can see how it was good but i think that the people who want to watch this for the sorrow in the plot, stick to a film like shawshank redemption. people wanting the mad devil sort of character then i dnt know many films like that and maybe this is a good choice! if you want a film with a plot to confuse the hell out of you then i suggest there is only one film that can truly do that!identity. i watched that in the cinema about a year ago it must have been i have seen it twice since and some bit still manage to confuse me.i thought this film was an OK film until the end. up until the end i thought that the film was fairly average. there was nothing in the film up until the end to keep me into the film but then the ending makes this film what it is!!!excellentJazi know that there is a lot of contradiction in this but i have a headache</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weirdly brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko's a great film, its a bit like a dream where your not really sure what's happening this weird rabbit thing (Frank) appears and tells Donnie to do all this stuff. That's part of the reason its so amazing because it's confusing, normally that would be annoying but here it just adds to the film. You don't have to understand it to enjoy it, Donnie doesn't understand and neither do you. I sat for the whole film with my eyes glued to the screen, wondering how this whole thing would unravel. The music is another reason I like this film; it's present from beginning to end and adds a lot to it.I read something somewhere that seed a "wonderful beautifully twisted masterpiece' that sums this film up. You don't understand it but you don't need to, watch it once and be confused. The best bit: 6 foot guy in a rabbit costume.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the few movies that really hit me in a profound way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few movies that really can touch me, especially when I'm nearly recovered from a severe depression as I am now. This movie was one of them. I think it was partially the overall atmosphere of the film that did it. Of course, the character, I just loved his personality. I think "Darko" was a good name for him due to what I think could be called a dark sense of humour. The bunny, Frank, I think was a pretty cool character as well. It gave the movie a certain pleasurable sort of creepy feel if that makes sense to whoever reads this. I have a feeling there's a number of layers of meaning in this film and this is certainly one I will be watching again as soon as I get more clarity in my head (and my powers of perception grow stronger than they are now). I am curious to see that if it hit me this hard while I am like this, how much better it might be when I can really appreciate the multiple levels. Oh, this film also strikes me as being rather psychological and philosophical as well. I intend to look into the ideas they put forth about time travel as I'm curious if it will allow for a better understanding of the world around me. (why not? after all, doesn't a little kernel of truth lie in everything? :) )</fullReview>

It is an amazing movie and the only movie I can watch over and over again and never get bored of. The acting is awesome, and although the plot is often confusing for people, after the second time you see it it starts to make even more sense. It has an amazing soundtrack that I own, and has a director's commentary worthy of watching that reveals little things that can be seen in the movie. Everyone I have shown this movie to has loved it and showed it to all of their friends, I recommend everyone watch this movie to see what a good Thriller/Sci-Fi movie is made of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I stumbled upon this movie accidentally, and when reading the back of it, I thought it sounded ridiculous. An evil rabbit controlling the mind of a teenager? But once I watched the movie, I found myself unusually sucked into the plot and I couldn't help but think about everything that the characters talked about. I didn't find the movie scary or unnerving @ all, however, it is one of my number one favorite movies. The idea and the plot behind it goes so much deeper than it seems. It forces you to think about a lot of things that you wouldn't necessarily think about without having watched the movie. Not only did I think the movie was extraordinary, I think it's one of a kind. There will never be another movie like this. If you haven't seen it I strongly urge you to. Any sci-fi, fantasy, horror, comedy, or even drama lover will appreciate it. It's a deep, thought provoking, psychedelic venture into the minds eye. Very VERY cool...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko.... how should I put this.... is an AMAZING film. It was recommended to me so I went out and bought it and I was BLOWN AWAY. One of my favorite aspects of this film was how well the music went with the film. It takes place in the late eighties and the soundtrack includes such artists as Tears for Fears and other popular bands of the age. The musical sequences in this movie are fantastic. They carry along the story w/o using dialogue, using only the actions of the actors. Which brings me to yet another reason I liked this film. The acting was superb. Jake Gyllenhaal was FANTASTIC as a troubled, confused teen. I am a teenager and although I do not have psychological problems, his portrayal of Donnie Darko was SPOT on with all of the other troubles and dilemmas of every day life as an adolescent. The actual script is also VERY well done. The scenes are well written and directed. My personal favorite is one in which Donnie is fighting with his family at the dinner table (lord knows that happens to all teenagers). Overall, I absolutely LOVED this movie and as a first time writer and director, I thought Richard Kelly did an absolutely FANTASTIC job. I bought this movie for TEN DOLLARS at Best Buy, so if you have 10 bucks to burn, GO BUY THIS MOVIE. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What if you were given a chance to change your fate? Would you use it? Would it work or would the repercussions be enormous?Donnie Darko is a brilliant movie about a boy who struggles with his everyday life. He understands the world in a different way than most people, and sees patterns and truths to events. He is also bothered by "nightmares" after which he wakes up in strange places and not remembering anything. What is wrong with him?Director Richard Kelly has made a jewel of a movie with Donnie Darko. As far as I know, this was his debut as a feature movie director, and what debut. He debates philosophy in a highly existensialistic way, weighing the pros and cons, ifs and ors of everything from solitude to time travel. This movie is a nice counterweight to the thirteen-a-dozen superficial movies being spit out of Hollywood. For once I felt the director and writer saw me, as a spectator, as an intelligent being, able to understand things they want me to get. Unlike most high school movies and sitcoms, he lets you figure things out for yourself, which is rare in American movies.The actors and actresses do a wonderful job portraying Donnies family, friends and others. They really make feel like a part of the story. Even though the only "big" names are Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze, the less known actors are the ones who really brings this fantastic story to life.If you are at all interested in toying with thoughts about the world, reality, life and your own existence, this would be the movie you should watch. This is a perfect movie from beginning to end, though you might have to watch the movie twice to catch all the details which makes this movie so great.</fullReview>

I think every trick in the book was used, well to say trick would be an insult but Kelly seems to have an imagination most directors would give an arm for. His choice of music compliments the movie superbly. Steady-Cam has never had a better friend. Long scenes, slow-mo, fast-mo, a feast for the eyes and ears. What more can I say. Hopefully my first short will have half the class of this movie. I look forward to seeing more from Richard Kelly, but he has given himself an awful problem, how can he possibly beat Donnie Darko.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary Unexpected Mind Fluff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit upfront, when I saw the poster of this movie advertised at the local multiplex, I thought the movie was going to be another mindless teenage horror flick...so I skipped it altogether.About a year later, my roomate (who has a $10K surround sound system) was practically waiting for me at the front door as I opened it and said, "Dude, sit down. You HAVE to watch this."Keep in mind, we had the volume so high, the walls shook the first time the bunny spoke. Chills ran down my spine. Not the kind of chills you get when you're psuedo-scared...the kind you get when excitement pierces right through you. The next hour and half was so amazing...so completely opposite of what I expected the film to be...that I walked away knowing it would be in my top 10 list of favourite films...forever.The movie is more like a drug than it is a film. Watching it over and over is like chasing the dragon...so I highly recommend viewing this film for the first time without interuption, and on the best system you can get your hands on. You don't need extra substance help to trip out on this movie...trust me.Now the mechanics. First of all, the script is near genius. I say "near" because the "ending" isn't as accessible or cohesive as it could have been...and some people may walk away shaking their heads in bemusement, total confusion, or agitation because it's not linear. Ebert phrased it well in his review of the movie. The cinematography was dream like and silky smooth. Great shots &amp; angles throughout captured the mood and intensity each scene required. Speaking of mood...the soundtrack could not be more perfect. As far as I'm concerned, Michael Andrews is a genius...and so is Richard Kelley for picking him.I do hope Kelley continues to make films like this. Surreal and magical. Philosophical masterpieces that question the very foundation and fabric of the universe. I love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>most people here will have summarized and analyzed this movie, so I will refrain from doing it myself. What I will say to anyone who struggles to understand the story is "don't". At last a movie whose ending doesn't give you all the answers along with another boring "happy end", and you'd want to spoil it by explaining... For me this movie is to be read on an emotional level, most people with a normal childhood will remember times when things seemed strange and weird("growing up"). I am a big sci-fi fan, so maybe it is easier for me to forget the "technical" part, but I really enjoy any story that leaves me with the impression that I didn't understand anything, but with comprehension just one insight away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, i was recommended this movie from my brothers girlfriends brother (:P) and i thought it would be a stupid movie. But i watched it, and i realized that it was one of the best movies i have ever seen. And then, i was reading all of the bad comments on this site (it took me 4 days) and i realized that more than a third of them havn't even realized what this movie was about. So, i think i will write a little something on what I think it is about, and what others don't realize.SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!! Well, this movie is a low budget movie. and most of you think that the "bunny" is supposed to be a monster rabit or something. BUT if you watch the whole thing, you realize that it is a costume worn by frank. They even bring it up when he gets shot at the end because he runs over donnys gf. Also, you say it makes no sence. Tell me how it doesn't make sence. Its all about psychology and the event of time travel. and the time travel isn't even shown. So right there, there is no bad effects right there because nothing is needed. Also, people say stuff like "why did he kill himself when he could just go back in time and not fall in love with this girl because she starts all of the stuff?". heres the answer. In this movie, FATE is a real thing. and when frank led him out of the house, he avoided his fate, his fate being death. And so fate has to change its course, because free will changed fate. So he has to die, just in a different way, so it started the end of the world. So donny will die, as will everyone else. So one fate changed everyone elses fate. I hope this helped. And don't only watch it once, watch it 2-4 times, you will really understand this.PS: The engine doesn't kill him, the engine breaks the bed and one of the pieces of wood imapes him into the wall. Very bloody scene.PSS: Im obsessed with this movie!</fullReview>

Great acting by Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie and a beautifully picked soundtrack, sets you back to the eighties. Philosophical and indeed dark. Donnie Darko is a great mix of music, theories on time travel, the strains and wonders of puberty and eerie dark fatalism. Thank You!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people may dislike it (most likely from lack of understanding), but this movie really is perfection. It makes you think and it makes you feel. It would be more logical to just say, "YOU MUST SEE IT" a million times then to try and explain the plot. The plot is something that can't be so simply written out.. (well, it can, but it wouldn't be sufficient). It's something you kinda need to understand on your own, through watching it and thinking about it.Pretty much all I can say is that it left me feeling really disturbed and confused, moreso than any movie I've ever seen, and the music fits it SO well, and I could watch it over and over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>watching the movie u see an movie. watching the movie over and over and over and over you finnaly (think to) understand the movie and know the meanings of the events. i think the main plot is about the love donnie has for his "juillet". trying to change future he learns not one decission is the best.I think he travelled "in the past" in time. every decission he made changed the future, but his girl every time gets hurt. setting the school under water results in getting the 2 bad boys almost raping his girl, he prevents it by walking her home. burning down cunninghams house prevents cunningham to molest his girlfriend (her mother was stabbed by her father, she's an easy prey for cunninghams smooth talking about getting a nice life). slamming the axe in the massive schools mascotte is an sign of mighty force (love). all his actions he made to change the future didn't had the result of protecting his girl. the final end was the death of his girlfriend.at the end he knows the only thing that will do the less harm to her is getting killed by the engine of the plane from the other future (because he time-travelled he created an second past-now-future for 28 days).thats why he's laughing at the end in his bed, seconds before the enige will kill him. he knows he loves a girl, he knows she loves him, he knows the only thing wich can save her is getting killed, knowing she never will know him, she never will love him....But he knows he loves her 4 ever).at the end she rides stopped with the bicycle in the front of donnies house after the enige crashed. the neighbour kid askes her: "did you knew hem" a moment of silence ..... "no, i didn't".the best movie I ever have seen.</fullReview>

Taste or not, thats just the facts. If you feel that every movie has to be compared to "The Matrix" sit this one out, but if you are a fan of art films, this is a must see. This film was an instant cult classic in the UK but wasnt advertised much here in America (read the last "critics" post and you'll understand why) because it wouldnt be as popular here. Sit down, pop some popcorn, dim all the lights, turn the sound and bass up real loud, sit back, and be awed. If you're a Stanly Kubrick fan like I am, this will become an instant favorite.

		<shortDescription>Brainy movie, nicely set</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is about a boy with psychological disorders, who is possessed by visions of a giant rabbit urging him to commit acts of destruction and predicting the end of the world.The movie touches a mosaic of subjects like youth, destiny, time, idealism, love, sex and violence but still copes to pack them together in a harmonic integration. The ingenuity of the movie lies not that much at the multitude of subjects it touches nor in the mind game it plays (as many remark, this last one, is similar to "Sixth Sense" but as some would recall this is rather a copy of the much more sophisticated time paradox in "12 monkeys") but more on the teenager point of view of the issues, which makes it more lively and interesting. The only negative is that some may be struck by the oversimplification of time theories.This is a must see movie and it deserves its rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie, not least for the great acting, the terrific plot, and how the characters interact so naturally. The music, and cinematography were just amazing. So many movies have the odd weak character/stereotype or the characters just don't interact like real people do. IMVHO the most credit should go to the editing. If I were a film maker I would aspire to make a movie such as this. The title of my comment is also the title of the movie Donnie saw before burning down JC's 8-] house. So.... Donnie Darko, a person who travels in God's channel and gives his life to make it all turn out for the best. Reminds me of another JC...Since this is a deep movie, let me get deep for a moment. Skip next paragraph if bored easily.Strange thing time. Maybe there is no such thing as time in the linear sense. Clocks tick. We say time passes. But what if clocks did not tick, and nothing were to change? Would no time pass? If the speed of light were to change suddenly, would we know? The answer is surely no, since everything including all our brain functions would slow down proportionally so we would not know any difference. The truth, if there is such a thing, is probably that time and the speed of light are related and derivatives of a higher "entity", hence the existence of dark matter (where time and the speed of light are locally different). OK you are probably thinking, what the hell is he on about :-)</fullReview>

When I tell people they should watch it and they ask me what it's about I don't know what to say. You just have to see it. Over and over. I'm addicted. It's an obsession, I can't ever see myself turning down the opportunity to see it. It's so intense on so many levels. What makes it so amazing? I think the casting was excellent, the music makes a deep impact on me every time i hear it. As for what the movie actually is, I can't even touch it. It's easy to talk about what it's about, and discuss the plot, figure out what happened and solve the mysteries that it leaves. Every time I figure something out and it makes perfect sense, I hear the same question a day later and I can't remember my exact answer that made so much sense just a day before. There will always be that one unanswered question, but to think about making this movie, thinking about this movie, it's truly amazing to me that somebody wrote this script and directed it perfectly. Now I will become overcome with the need to watch it, and I will x infinity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing all of the critics raving about this film and having missed it on the big screen I bought the DVD without having seen the movie before. I new only the basic plot of the movie, that it was a bout a teenaged boy dealing with mental problems and his imaginary friend Frank, The 6 foot rabbit. Now with that kind of background I just new that this film could not have a happy ending and I had had the DVD for about 2 months before I got up the nerve to watch it. That was 2 months wasted time.Without doubt this is one of the greatest movies ever made. It's original, well shot and well acted. Please don't be put of by the subject matter and the Sci-Fi side plot. I won't discuss the story of the movie here as it would give too much away. All I will say is that much like in The Sixth Sense, once you get to the massive plot twist at the end of the film you will be watching it again immediately, just to see what you missed and to pick up other hints as to what is coming up.I have now watched the movie at least 15 times now and have forced nearly everyone I know to watch it as well, 90% of who have then gone out and bought their own copy of the movie for further viewing and dissecting.Truly a modern masterpiece</fullReview>

As the choosing challenge came, and everyone wanted to see "the gladiator" for the millionth time, i made a good move convincing the driver of the exellence of DD! That's how I got my whole class (well, almost, because one guy was too stupid to understand one bit of it) that this is a movie to view again and again and again!the whole coach was shaking of laughter when they heard what Donnie said their incompetent teach about her lifeline card. :Palso the best video to view when you're smoking the weed... and we do that a lot here in holland ;)have fun with this movie... i command you!100/100! absolutely!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has everything. In a good way.Without recourse to current Hollywood trends, the director divulges little by little what he wants us to see and know, slowly asking us to get closer to the subjects and themes that are prowling around his audacious screenplay.Donnie Darko is a revelation. Everything fits perfectly, yet nothing is answered. The art of the movie is to instil a profound and thought-provoking response from every person who watches - Donnie Darko delivers. Besides from the exemplary performances, there are a million and one more other reasons to watch this film.If you haven't seen it yet, buy the DVD, keep your companions quiet and be stunned into submission to its divine brilliance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been many thought-provoking movies that I have seen in my lifetime thus far. Donnie Darko is one that tops that list. Almost serving as a catalyst to learn more about worm holes and time travel.I myself am not a Sci-Fi guru by any means, but I am a sucker for a good mystery and this dish serves a balanced blend of both with splashes of irony as well as dark humor. Yet it lacks a certain closure or clarity that most movie-goers almost expect in an ending. Perhaps leaving too much of the end up to the viewing audience. Who are by the end of the movie still trying to fill holes in the plot of this mind-twisting story.Overall, it is a movie of a certain caliber that most young writer/directors strive for when beginning a promising career in the film industry. Along with great directing and dialogue this amazing cast, led by the talented Jake Gyllenhaal, allows the viewer to really feel the heartbeat of the film. A beat that whether you want to dance to it or not, keeps the audience's attention throughout the film. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Badly promoted but amazing movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Donnie Darko was just another teen thriller, and didn't bother to go watch it. It took three years for the good word-of-mouth to reach me, and now I have just finished watching the movie! It's truly amazing movie and I just don't know how to describe what I experienced through the movie. No wonder the distributor could not promote the movie properly 3 yrs ago. It's just too original and new and it's so hard to explain what this movie is. It's a Sci-Fi movie and a coming-of-age drama and suspense thriller all at a time! I just think that Donnie Darko is such a bad title as it didn't stir my imagination before actually seeing the movie. Or maybe it sounds differently to me as I am not a native English speaker.... Anyways, I think the creator of this movie is super genius and I am so happy that I actually watched the movie even though it took three years since its original release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely amazing! This is mainly due to themes and mind bending features all rolled into it. This film benefits all ranges of people, intelligent to stupid, as the minute the film ends you try to grasp the true story behind it all. It promotes thought from the most unlikely people, and all because the jumbled up reasons stay widespread through out. Yet they do appear to come out in one scene, but proves hard to interpret. Overall this film is a healthy change to the usual stuff we see in the cinemas, super humans and unfathomable horror stories that grip no true audience, just temporarily baffles people, into a false sense of liking, until they see a truly good film, much like Donnie Darko. 5 stars, shiny stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twisted look at a boy who's imaginary friend may have answer to future events. Jake Gyllenhaal brilliantly plays a confused teenager facing hallucinations that lead him to lash out against society. The plot gets even more bizarre when a jet engine from a passenger airliner falls through the roof of the family house and no one knows where it came from. Donnie sets out to understand where his hallucinations are sending him. On the way he develops a romantic relationship with a school friend. The events of the film suggest things are leading to impending doom. Definite reminiscent of the late eighties (time the film takes place) and fully disturbing but non the less very entertaining. This film is entrancing from the get go. Scary and thoroughly unpredictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN HANDS DOWN!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pros: Deep and thought provoking and most will never totally understand it, which means this movie's main point is not really for entertainment, but for strengthening of someone who feels and understands it completely! Cons: NothingI have watched this movie several times. I not only love the music, but the fact that it goes where most movies never go. I find the character of Donnie Darko in sync with my own life in which I feel and see and understand at a deeper level than others. Also it shows how others simply do not understand who I really am and as a matter of fact, never will in all ways. And that is actually good. It is what makes me unique and this gives me strength as well in my own heart and life. Most will be lost through the movie because they are expecting something else. Of course that is how most people perceive any movie when they go watch it and that is why they would never understand a movie of this caliber and nature in the first place. Very deep movie and I am glad it was made the way it was. The director and author were not interested in the money issue, but rather they really wanted to show us and create for us. This movie is certainly as a fact not going to be understood or grasped by everyone, but that does not mean it is a bad movie either. 5 stars is not good enough for this movie. Should show how selfish and mean people can be, and Donnie through the looking glass is where most of us miss it. By the way, no one should even think this is anything like "American Pie", movies which I totally detest and think are very sick and immature in nature and not meant to have any real meaning of a sensitive nature. Donnie Darko movie most definitely does. Way to go!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deep and emotional story about a sane man troubled by his gifted insight into his world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a small part of what I thought about it:Donnie sees the world around him differently to everyone else. He is not wrong or misguided about what he sees and how he experiences it, just different. I think he sees the complexity and is unable to summarize people and attitudes into neat reduced packages. To illustrate this - there is one scene where one of his 'teachers' tells him to choose where on a simple scale ranging from 'fear' to 'Love' a simple story falls. Everyone in the class has a different story to 'interpret'. Donnie's story is about someone who finds a wallet, returns it, but keeps the money found inside. Donnie cannot place the story on the scale - he refuses reduce the story to the simplicity required. Another point about that scene is that there are people (not least the teacher) who are willing and able to make such a reduction.Anyway, a profound and emotional film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a film to be watched multiple times to appreciate fully. You will be thinking about it long after the movie has ended. Great acting, and a plot that is atypical of Hollywood movies, which is what makes it so interesting. I recommend this movie to those who like "non-mainstream" movies. My son told me about this movie initially. Apparently it has a "cult following" on the college campus he attends. I was not going to watch the movie, but decided to one evening while I was home alone. It was so weird. I waited a long time before watching the movie again, and then I wanted to watch it more to try to figure out certain aspects of the plot. I asked everyone I knew if they had seen the movie so that we might discuss it. Not one person had seen it, but everyone I talked to about this movie that subsequently watched it has liked it for various reasons. It is on my list of "must-own" movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of the indie film scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) lives in a quiet suburban town called Middlesex. We enter his story during what seems to be a typical family dinner. Set brilliantly in 1988, the movie opens with a reference to the Presidential race, with Donnie's sister (played by Jake's real life sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal) announcing her support for Dukakas. What ensues is a heated family debate. The head of the family, Eddie Darko (Holmes Osborne) and his wife Rose (Mary McDonnell) seem to have little control over their children at the dinner table as argument persists and expletives fly. We soon learn that Donnie is not only on medication but seeing a psychiatrist. Rounding out the Darko family is the young, adorable Samantha (Daveigh Chase).The audience is quickly drawn into Donnie's mind as we experience his first encounter with the six foot tall talking rabbit Frank (James Duvall). Frank carries a message concerning the end of the world. Having lead Donnie to a local golf course, he gives Donnie the exact number of days, hours, minutes and seconds until the universe's demise.When Donnie awakes the following morning with the course owner and Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze) looming over him, he quickly stumbles home. As he approaches his home, he realizes that, over night, it has become the scene of a disaster narrowly avoided. For reasons unbeknownst to anyone, including the FAA, a jet engine has fallen through the Darko's roof and straight through Donnie's bed. What follows this incident is Donnie's struggle to understand why this has happened, what is going to happen next, why Frank has chosen him and to answer many, many questions that have complicated answers.While this may sound overly complicated (and be sure that it is not easy to figure out), there are several characters along the way that add pieces to the puzzle. There's the new girl in school, Gretchen (Jena Malone) who begins a romantic fling with Donnie; there's the annoying gym teacher Mrs. Farmer (Beth Grant) who reports Donnie's behavior to the principal; there Donnie's English teacher Ms. Pomeroy (Drew Barrymore) and his Science teacher Professor Monnitoff (Noah Wiley) who both introduce clues that will be largely beneficial. Every single one of these characters, amongst others, is vitally important to understanding the complex story at work.As Frank plants the ideas of time travel in Donnie's head, the viewer is forced to constantly question everything he or she has concluded up to a certain point. Donnie is involved in some criminal activity while following Frank. All of this leads to new discoveries. Nothing is a coincidence in this movie. And nothing is exactly what it seems.Is Donnie insane? Well, I can answer that one way and you could, after watching, answer it another and we could both be right. The beauty of this film, which defies classification, is that it seamlessly blends many genres to tell a story that is entirely new. It would surprise me to find someone who could honestly say they `got' the entire meaning of the movie on first viewing. There is a definite satisfaction when you watch it for the first time, but it requires several viewings to uncover the many rich layers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At work one of my friends had seen this film and didn't understand it at all. She immediately asked me to watch it as apparently I understand weird films. I did as she said and saw the film. Jake Gyllenhaal was great, I'd never seen him act before but I was impressed, also the girl who played the love of his life was excellent. Drew Barrymore wasn't anything special and the rest of the cast made me angry. I wanted to punch half of them. The horrible thing is that I understood the film but I'd never be able to explain it to my friend or anyone else and make sense. It's very good nevertheless and I'll no doubt watch it over and over again. I could watch it another 100 times and still not find the words to explain whats going on though. Sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this film. Then I read some the comments on this site. Yes, this movie is a little hard to put together. So what! Just because Donnie Darko doesn't wrap up all the loose ends so that an eight year old can understand it doesn't mean the movie is valueless. One of the reasons I liked this movie is because it didn't follow a typical Hollywood "focus group" formula (refreshing). I am not a big fan of Poetry, but there are some poems I love. Poetry is cryptic and filled with symbolism. It is often hard to find the meaning in some poems, but these are the ones that will make you think and wonder and ponder and question etc. Donnie Darko shares this quality with poetry. If you want to watch a predictable movie that you'll forget 3 minutes after the credits roll stay away from this one. If, however, you dare to be challenged to use your imagination you should give Darko a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this film is my alltime favourite because... It captures you the viewer and puts you in the daily life and place the protagonist is experiencing almost immediately, it is full of places that everybody loves watching in a film...starting with morning dew mountainy landscapes, beautiful neat american neihbourhoods, high-school to overwhelming skies that leave you in awe as the movie nears its end. The main character, Donnie is a cool, funny, mysterious &amp; inspiring teenager that sees a large bunny rabbit which tells him to do some acts vandalism etc which lead the plot of the movie in a way but the whole meaning and interpretation of the plot is quite difficult to understand from the first viewing. It is about time travel, in the least futuristic and extravagant way...in fact, in a way relating to the forces and destinies in life. All this being left for the viewer of course to think about. Most of the movie actually doesn't show or talk about that stuff but shows a teenager with an irritation towards the stereotype american high school living, has a girlfriend and does stuff like flooding his school and burning a house, which he can remember non of, set in the 80's, which gives the film a KILLER soundtrack including the famous soundtrack Mad World. Donnie tries to find the meaning of this all throughout the movie and even his parents or his psychiatrist can't easily understand him. The best part of the movie is how everything falls into place in the end. 10!</fullReview>

It's very dark, very emotional, very disturbing, very funny, and deeply profound in a philosophical and artistic way. I wouldn't recommend it to people who can't stand to be frightened or who are bothered by movies that make you think. As for the rest of us, this film is a gem that is not to be missed! Every aspect of the movie is, in my opinion, superb!

		<shortDescription>Here is the real meaning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler ok, I have been reading a lot of people's comments and it seems that nobody(that I have seen...didn't read all 1000) got the real meaning and explanation of the ending. To figure this movie out...you have to think!! Sorry if you don't like to do it, but you must. Some have said that the entire movie took place in a dream and that it is pure coincidence that he was killed by a jet engine, and also saying that it is the only realistic answer. Hate to burst your bubble...but the answer is actually time travel. I can prove this by give a few select examples.1)The entire movie is a linear track of time in which Donnie is able to see events of the future by the aid of "Frank". Two things about Frank: 1) He is in Donny's head 2) he is a echo of what is going to happen in the future. The only reason why it is shown by the character Frank is because he was the last person that Donnie had an affect on. Every single time that Donnie was seeing Frank, he was actually traveling through time (if you listened to the conversation...anything can be a vehicle to travel through a wormhole...ie Donnie is a vehicle, and the wormhole is those fluid like manifistations)2) OK..the ending. Remember that linear track of time....it's important to know what the start is and what the end is. The start is him leaving the house before the plane engine crashes and the end is when he travels back to the start. Want to know why he was laughing...it is because "Frank" was there telling Donnie that he had to leave his room to be safe. Because he was able to see the linear future of that action...he now had the CHOICE to follow that linear path. Thus he chose not to, and stayed in the room. (Go back and recall the conversation with the science teacher). By him changing the future, everyone that he affected was able to see the destroyed linear path that showed what would have happened if Donnie left the room. By doing that, each person was was given the ability to CHOOSE if they want to continue on that know linear path.3)Finally, if you noticed at the end of the movie, it was Donnie's mother who was waking up in the bed. Thus she was not on the plane that crashed unlike what was sceen in a previous scene. This shows that Donnie was able to change events (ie TIME TRAVEL!!)The main concept that the director was trying to get accross was the fact that we are all controlled by choice, and if given the opportunity to see the future; whould you change it knowing the personal consequences.Hope this helps all of you who are confused. By the way...it took me 2 minutes to figure this out...it's not that hard to understand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i just had a very cursory glance at the comments on this film, but it seems to me that no one has made the connection between the rabbit and Alice's rabbit. I haven't listened to the director comments on the DVD, but whenever I see a very large, somewhat disturbing rabbit, mixed with altering realities I tend to think of Alice in Wonderland. I am in no way stating that Lewis Carrol was eating mushrooms and dropping acid while he was writing this fantastical book, but especially during the eighties(which a couple users commented the children of as being the target for this film) this would be a foregone conclusion,its as clear as a CRUCIFIXATION so if the rabbit is an allusion to Alice in Wonderland well its a pretty f%^&amp;*% dark wonderland.....the world has changed and innocence is lost to psychosis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an amazing movie. In addition to the obvious parallel to Harvey, another Jimmy Stewart movie seems to have been an influence. Christmas classic It's a Wonderful Life has a similar plotline, with Frank serving as a sort of darkside Clarence. He shows Donnie what life would be like with, rather than without him in it. Just as George makes a life affirming choice, Donnie does (for others, at least). As far as a denouement,I believe Patrick Swayze's character does himself in on the golfcourse. A fantastic movie that manages to mesh its soundtrack perfectly with the action . One of my new favorites. )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie really summarized alot of what i have been through/going through mentally. The look on his face when he sees frank describes this strange feeling i had within. you must see this. thank you to all who have posted comments about the end, i now understand just how much of a hero donnie is. Don't be put off by "weirdness" when watching this because life is weird, posting hostile comments about a wonderful piece like this is just a waste of mental energy so don't do it. This movie deserves more recognition and it will soon fade away into the archives unless it is preserved through its fans. I hope to see another piece by richard kelly someday but oh well. The score in this song is absolutely perfect, especially the song mad world at the end, created by tears for fears and sung by gary jules in this one i think. the only problem was i became massively depressed afterwards when i was reminded of several different problems similar to those in this movie, not a good sign.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film "Donnie Darko" opened my eyes to see that life's choices are not just a random set of rules that govern us. We have choice that is put on us or a decision made by us. How we deal with lifes bumps and the mundane without foresight lets us be ruled by happenstance. There is a path laid out but do we see it or just fall into it? It is good to walk with your head up and eyes open and not let the slavery of the "every day life" get us down. It is good to know that we do make a difference to those we come into contact with. It is a good film open for much discussion in a wide realm from God to humanism (or self determination).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Detailed Review of 'Donnie Darko'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a truly brilliant, electrifying, first-rate, visually and intellectually challenging, provocative, mystifying, surreal, disturbing, and utterly unique film [debut]. It's also an unforgettable edge-of-the-seat goose-bumps raiser and in an sheer way ends as a poignant tragedy.The film is basically a clever tale that combines the elements of time travel, mental illness, apocalypse, religion, child exploitation, teenage romance, paranoia, societal milieu, sole and soul sacrifice, a potential ghost lurking, and one messenger or higher being in the form of an ominous young man dressed-up as a bunny. Despite the movie's early commencing or foundation may be a tad obscure at first, as where the film is heading, the mishmash of narrative lines, genre elements, and ambiguous statements or intended messages by the end all ironically prove to be of over-all favorable effect to the film's vision as an original whole. Such films can clearly be a bit too much for some viewers to handle, or even come to appreciate. One aspect that has been of controversy is its blend of various generic elements; such as the black comedy in the beginning, the romantic drama, and the coming-of-age and finding one self's place and purpose in the world in the midst of period milieu and societal context; age of change and madness (recall it was set in late1980's, at a time when the nation was deciding its future leader, and the onset of the gulf war as we know). But is also a cinematic tapestry rich in psychological suspense, supernatural horror, [black comedy, romantic drama,] 'time travel' sci-fi, dream-like fantasy, mild period/societal satire, and has thriller rudiments and religious connotations; and features a stunning surprise finale, and ultimately ends in the form of 'tragedy'.All of the latter entirely suggests a kind of unique, artistic execution. Especially when it came the film's use of a few clever metaphors, for example, the satirizing statement on the lack of attention in the typical American home, the focus on politics, things in the news, and widespread, etc. instead of on one's children, neighbors, students, etc. Another such statement is made in a quick school scene, when the principal is sure everything's just fine in his school (the 'you're in control' and 'just expect the unexpected' themes) when a couple of students pass right in front of him with drugs, and the music in the background, he is also in a way making a satire out of onset of the common societal and period values of the epoch surrounding Donnie Darko's character, as well as the perceptions, and thoughts of the time. For instance, most of what takes place in the film can be perceived as funny, albeit mostly in a dark way, yes, but then again, can also be perceived as deeply ironic, somewhat disturbing and utterly sad, depressing and/or tragic. It's this sense of sheer complexity and contemplation that he brings to such subtle, short and witty scenes that show in this remarkable debut an apparent 'trademark' throughout, that I think sadly makes way for the battle of people to take sides on the "absolutely admired it" or "absolutely despised it" claims. Like one replying post stated, the movie seems to require a personal sense of perspective to fully 'decipher' and 'understand' its 'intended' statements or 'messages'. For instance, in most of the scenes, including the ones above, one could have easily found the irony [of say, the shot of the druggies crossing paths with the school's principle] as funny, ironic, disturbing or sad in a tragic way or perception of the situation, or simply just as true as the former, is that the scene could also be perceived just as true as a 'combination' of all these emotional reactions to it; as you can see: it depends on the viewer's individual beliefs or given effort that a viewer applies to the scenes' significance. In fact, one of the film's most subversive tactics is to expand upon the idea of identity, and ultimately cross over into audience's identification with the odd protagonist of Donnie Darko. It's this often lack of dichotomous standpoint, in the vein of the greatest films of Lynch and Kubrick have been, that definitely does wonders (and blunders by some) for this movie.Although at times it may admittedly seem to be a little too much to handle, incoherent, bizarre exploration of its themes, choice of cinematic execution, and weak dose of suspension-of-disbelief, that is simply due to its inherent, surreal nature, one with an open mind can easily come to appreciate the movie's exceptional attributes; especially when one compares it too all the clichéd, formulaic and shallow films of common day Hollywood.Although the general viewer may fault the film for its deliberate mismatched composition or pacing, while the ending or 'climatic' final act was indeed slightly vague and suddenly abrupt, and seemed lurk in ambiguity, it just appear the ending* seems to have caused the film its greatest squall. Although what's most paradoxical and likely for this is, again, that it's due to the clichéd flaws, erroneous expectations and misleading popularity of most common-day 'thriller' finales; where with a 'surprise' or 'twist' ending, one is supposed to be 'spoon-fed' some sort of 'explanation' or even 'purpose' to suddenly wrap things up; instead of a rarely used, utterly dazzling revelation: that both stuns, needs a further analysis, and tad reflection -- and yet leaves one still thinking about it after the closing-credits reel.* Even so with all its hindrances, I doubt many people should be entirely disappointed with this movie. Especially for those who savor an involving, multi-layered, truly thought-provoking, and genuine multi-genre edgy yet somewhat poignant film experience. Masterfully handled with the superb ingredients of classic cinema; screenplay basis, smart directorial implementation, and compelling performances, -- and a heck of a noteworthy and auspicious directorial debut, -- the film more than measures up for any of petty 'flaws' and well compensates in return, in spite of maybe requiring multiple viewings! LOL. It's ironically funny this film did not run in theatres, it may have caused over-night sensation, and people who enjoyed it would have most likely wanted to have seen it again and again! Maybe in another universe it did, just like the very thing that impeded its theatrical run; the terrorists attack on 9/11/01! Which also involved airplanes and death! Creepy coincidence.But a true shame the film was not allowed to the public at the time. Anyways, in conclusion, I simply found it to be one the greatest, and most unpredictable movies in recent memory, among other things, and so I praise Donnie Darko a contemporary classic and mesmerizing masterpiece of the unexpected, that stands in its own right. Truly, one of the best films of 2001! *By the way, for all of those who are highly perplexed by the ending, as I was too at first - and - still am, I have to admit, if you want a more profound glimpse into an explanation or better understanding of the ending, you can get much help from the official website as well as the DVD; which features some deleted scenes and commentaries. In fact one of the reasons, director Richard Kelley decided to leave most of these scenes out is because they were a bit too 'revealing'; not to mention visceral and gory, among other things, and 'gave clues too easily and too quickly away'. So this way, he opted for a more ambiguous approach to his film's substance, style. stance, the very ending's shock, and so as of a result altered the very substance and style of the film, and thus, the very ways the film would be perceived; therefore the hype and crowning achievement for the utter uniqueness and given controversial brilliance behind Donnie Darko.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After having seen this one four times I finally decided to put it numero uno on my list - yes after the godfather trilogy, the question bugging me now is why this movies deserves so much credit. Maybe its the wonderful cocktail of image and music - Gary rules!, the eyes of the Gyllenhaals, Kelly's brainstorming on the script, I don't know, it just gave me the right feeling. Something slips away everytime I see it, think of it and I still want to keep on watching. For me, that's how the magic works, hopefully it will never show its trick ;) People, this is great filmmaking even Tarkovski would be proud of (Nosthalgia is number two on my little list). To anyone who hasn't seen it, run to the nearest videostore and have the time of your life Favourite scenes: Donnie's girl opening up at the party and of course the final scene accompanied with Jules' Mad world - never has a song fitted so well a movie - like a glove ;) Godspeed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm shocked at the level of dissatisfaction of the viewer comments about Donnie Darko. I thought it was refreshing and interesting. Compared to the parade of insipid, uninspired movies playing in theatres like Lord of the Rings or The Italian Job, this movie offers something for all the senses. I think it was shot creatively, the sound track is fantastic, and the story leaves the viewer thinking. What more can you ask for? It's something original. What Hollywood seem to be lacking these days is imagination and this film delivers. Is it the feel good hit of the summer? No, but it doesn't pretend to be. If you are looking for something different and something outside the norm then this movie is for you. Don't listen to the nay-sayers on this one. Do yourself a favour and rent Donnie Darko.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler I've seen negative comments about this movie posted on here, and I can't believe it. I mean, yeah, this movie is weird. I'll give you that. But it'd take a small minded person to bash this movie. It's weird, and maybe thats a turnoff, but the weird aspect makes you think about it... about maybe that you're missing a message. And when you start to realize what some things mean, and a few pieces fit together, its a great realization. Maybe I'm too much of a fan of Stanley Kubrick, but I'm wondering just how important each of the characters are to the story. I get the general point: Donnie Darko was a person chosen by whomever to save the world... and he had to let the path of the "end of the world" play itself out to see what needed to be done. And when the skies began to open up, and Gretchen died, he knew that he couldn't let that jet engine miss him, or else everyone would suffer. So he found his way to time travel back 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds and saved the world by sacrificing himself. Donnie is a true hero, and anyone who misses that needs to open their minds. Wonderful movie. Besides, Jena Malone is pretty cute. And then there's Jake Gyllenhaal for the ladies, so who can argue with this movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I'm reading the negative comments here, I can't help but get a little frustrated. Here's the deal with this movie (in my opinion). Don't worry, no spoilers.The style, soundtrack, and script of this movie come together to be something unique. It's a sci-fi movie that doesn't feel sci-fi for large segments of the film. The details of the 80's style and lingo and the entire Patrick Swayze character are so great and work well as a sort of comic relief (as well as being part of the plot). However, when it goes sci-fi it goes all the way.You learn along with Donnie as the movie goes on. It is a fantastic journey IF you don't want everything spoon fed for you. Yes, at the end of the movie you don't get the solid answers you're used to when you watch Navy Seals. The point is: it doesn't have to be that way!I thought the coolest part of the movie was coming up with my own interpretations after the credits started rolling. It is really interesting talking with other people about it to see how everyone understands it differently.After you see it a time or two, I highly suggest getting into the DVD special features to learn about what the director's intentions were. There are also some good online chats that explain things as far as you want to get into them.If you like sci-fi and/or you like brain teasers you need to see this movie. If you liked Dark City or Memento for example, check this out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friends and I have all seen Donnie Darko and an overwhelming theme encompasses all of our thoughts on the movie. We all really liked it. As the credits rolled, we sat and talked about the movie, each person putting in their two cents on the meaning of the movie. Much unlike all the other crap big-blockbuster movies out there that are driven by elaborate special effects, weak plots and the latest popular actors, Donnie Darko is heavily plot driven and invites the viewer to actively participate. Rather than just sitttin there allowing the plot to be revealed to you, the viewer must actually think about the movie and come to conclusions based on the movie based on your own interpertation of the movie. In closing, Donnie Darko was a great movie. I recommend watching the movie with the commentary, it provides a lot of insight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: THIS COMMENT CONTAINS PLOT SPOILERS!!When I first saw Donnie Darko I thought, `wow, that was good, wasn't it?' But it was subsequent viewings that made me realise just how amazing this film is. I've seen it several times and consider it to be something truly special.You cannot categorise the film into any genre. Drama, Sci-fi, comedy, horror, religion, art house or period piece perhaps? No, this is ambitious mixture of many genres, ideas and concepts.There is the idea of Donnie as a boy who has been chosen. There are religious parallels such as Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) as Jesus and Jim Cunnigham (Patrick Swayze) as the false prophet. There is a crossover with Donnie believing he is travelling within God's channel for him, his destiny. Does he have a choice in going back in time and changing everything? The time travel theories are boundless and are brought into focus if you read the 'Philosophy of time travel' on the DVD extras.The cast is amazing without exception, the direction out of this world, the soundtrack score is beautiful, haunting and uplifting. The songs in the film are dark, brooding and full of nostalgia from bands such as Echo and the Bunnymen, Tears for Fears, Joy Division and The Church. Donnie Darko has introduced a lot of people to these bands and reminded others just how good they were in the first place.The look of the picture is amazing. The film is set in the eighties, yet does not seek cheap laughs from fashion and hairstyles of the time. The editing is crisp, with no scenes outstaying their welcome, and Richard Kelley keeps us focused on the time travel/alternate reality theme through slow motion shots but never doing it as a gimmick.I love the little details and references in the film being set in 1988 (in itself a form of time travel) which is the same speed the car goes to time travel in Back to the Future. It's interesting on Halloween The Last Temptation of Christ is showing. And of course there is the Alice in Wonderland reference of following the bunny down the rabbit hole.I really cannot praise this film highly enough. I haven't written a comment on IMDb before, I just had to here. Donnie Darko is a film of beauty, humour and tragedy. It is a masterpiece in its own right, not just as a indie flick. Complete and perfect.....oh, one other thing, my friend reckons that whatever Donnie does, 'sparkle motion' are doomed anyway as they will still get on the plane that crashes, along with Mrs. Farmer. But I think that if Donnie dies Samantha would be too upset to dance with sparkle motion and as she is the lead dancer, they couldn't have replaced her in time. What do you think? Who is right?Andy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its hard to write a review about Donnie Darko because there are to many great issues about it: sanity/insanity, happiness/loneliness and the most important one life/death. Some reasons why i like this film: 1) It treats the audience with respect. 2) It makes us think. 3) Its not an all out, guns blazing end of the world disaster film. 4) It is a very cleaver teenage film.For the normal viewer its another drama film, but for the other viewer it travels deep into all the characters minds especially Donnie; is he really insane? is the world really going to end? is the bunny rabbit his only friend? At times this is disturbing viewing: Donnie has visions, sleepwalks and becomes obsessed with time travel. Patrick Swayze is also good as a high powered speaker. This film asks a lot of questions but the most important: Can we control our own fate? After viewing this picture questions will be asked!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clarity in Madness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a troubled teenager who has emotional problems and to control the effects of this he has to take medication. It is while under the influence of these pills that he learns that the world is coming to an end, with his only guide being a giant rabbit called Frank.The name 'Darko' is symbolic of the perception people have of his mental state and his mad world in which the film takes place.The use of soundtrack within this film helps to convey in my opinion, the rollercoaster of emotions that the viewer will be subjected to over the course of the hour and three quarters. The most noticeable example of music being used to build up emotion was 'The Killing Moon' by Echo and the Bunnymen. This is a great tune and its title fore-warns the audience about what is to come in the narrative.The camera work in this film is some of the best I have seen. An example that really stood out for me was the opening of the film where rather than staying with the main character, Donnie, the camera pans around the village depicting the general town life that will eventually be disrupted.Although there were some comic moments, for example the self-help video, on the whole I didn't find the comic touches as funny as they otherwise would have been, because the general mood of the film instead made you feel sorry for Donnie Darko. I felt that the use of a rabbit as a figure of Donnie's imagination was not necessarily comical, as I have heard suggested, given that Donnie was under the influence of medication at the time. Frank would therefore have seemed very real and non-comical to Donnie.I thought this film was a great film with a good soundtrack and poetic camera movements. I felt that the main message from this film was that even in madness, moments of clarity are present and the person can actually be saner than the people around them.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You sound like some kind of super-hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Kelly's debut is cinematically stunning, fresh and full of complexities. The plot is twisted round a discussion on God, family, teenagers and sex, and leaves the viewer considering exactly what Kelly is trying to say. This is definitely a film which requires repeat viewings, and may still be throwing up questions concerning plot and intention on the nth viewing. However, that is not to suggest this film is not worth taking the time over.The film covers a variety of genres and is an excellent pastiche of them all. Firstly, it is clearly a teen drama, with the stereotypical characters this type of film demands (the geeky hero, the bully, the picked on victim etc). However, this is done with such flair that the viewer, whilst acknowledging the representations on-screen, still manages to identify with - or loathe - individuals.Secondly it is a sci-fi exploration of the concept of time-travel. Time is an essential part of the film, constantly referred to in a countdown to the end of the world. But time is also played with, Kelly speeding up or slowing down certain scenes to reflect how Donnie is feeling. I think these slips in time help reflect this sci-fi genre, but also imply the constant state of confusion of Donnie with his schizophrenia, and indeed of all teenagers.The nostalgic Eighties feel (with a score of classic 80s bands)helps to make the film a more serious discussion of time travel and the place of God by removing any futuristic elements and setting it in a very obvious time period, with constant references to culture (the Smurfs, Back to the Future). In this way, I feel that the audience can consider the topic in a more grounded way; that is, it could happen to us at any time.Of course there are the usual problems of any film or novel which deals with time travel - the plane engine only falls because of events which will occur in the future, and these events only occur because the plane engine falls, but if the engine kills Donnie, how can it ever fall again, then he won't die, and all the events will occur again, and ultimately Gretchen will die... it makes your head hurt to think about it, so as with most time travel texts let's not bother!Overall, this is a clever, inspired film which although not without plot holes, will make any viewer think. It is worth noting, though, that constraints on money and time meant that certain scenes have been cut, including Frank explaining something very important about himself... but rather than spoil it you can rent the DVD!</fullReview>

I wanted to like this movie, really, and I went into it thinking "I want to be entertained" but then there were to many plot holes that made me think "hold on"... so the kid lives, and then all these "bad things" happen because of him living, so many bad things that when he sees the chance, he goes back in time and kills himself...either he goes back in time willingly, or he just resigns himself to the fact hes going to die and these events are not going to happen... I think the story hinges on his statement that life cannot be boxed into "good vs. bad" or "fear vs. love"....since the events that happened after he lived were actually "good" events or actually bad events that were only caused BY him being stupid..not just being alive..... 1) kiddie porn king gets arrested by him...thats a good thing, would not have happened if he had died... 2) girlfriend gets killed..she would not have been there except he told her to come along... 3) teacher gets fired...would not have happened if he had not flooded the school... 4) Frank gets shot..again caused by Donnie being up there with his GFfinally, the infamous casuality loop....engine drops and kills him, right..but the engine was from a plane a month in the future...meaning that in a month from that point, 10/31 that plan will still fall over and still drop an engine again going back in time and again flattening donnie and starting everything all over...meaning that the entire univerrse is caught in a 30 day cycle... i did like the refrence to back to the future..that was slick and a way to bring the luddites in the crowd up to speed... editing, camera, lighting, were all good... would i watch it again, hell no, would i recommend it...yes...theres lot more to a film than being pedantic about the story... cheers Q</fullReview>

One sequence which cuts between Donnie burning down a house and a dance show in slow motion is incredibly moving and makes your heart race.Unlike most directors, whose first movies are not well known or good, Richard Kelly has made an excellent debut. I doubt he will be able to top this. The only other directors who spring to mind who have had great debuts are Sam Mendes (American Beauty), Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects and Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs).Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect in the role of the main character/hero. What makes him so good is he is able to display a wide range of emotions convincingly, making him a new talent to look out for.Occasionally it can be confusing and lacks pace. The ending especially is quite hard to understand and requires repeated viewing. Even then its all open to interpretation.The story of this film is really quite absurd and when you try and tell it to people it sounds like a really bad comedic type film, and it could be really lame or pathetic if it weren't served by a great script and great filmmakers. This film left me in awe of the talents both off screen and on. Definitely worth seeing and buying 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko, a must see film, set in the late 80's the film is about a teenager and his troubles. At only 4 million dollars, its hard to see how this film did not cost more. The film stars big named characters for such a low budget film (Drew Barrymore) and even though the film has the big stars they are all bit parts to the lead character who is a relatively unknown actor but plays the part to perfection, as well as adding his own style to the part giving the film so much more. Without any doubt this film scores 10 out of 10, with a great storyline and superb acting this film has everything. If there is one film you should see this year this is without a doubt the one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most haunting movies I've ever seen, a movie that hasthe power to stick into your mind and linger there for a very longtime. From every frame of this movie it is evident what a heartfeltproject this was for everybody that was involved. The casting of theroles is phenomenal and the performances are all top notch (evenif Jake Gyllenhaal owns this movie!), and it really is pretty amazingto see such a young director have this confidence with his actors.The cinematography is evocative and beautiful, and so is thescore, and the 80's songs are very well chosen and used withexquisite taste (The Evil Dead homage is a gem too!) But to me, what really puts Donnie Darko in a league of it's own isthe fantastic warm feeling it gave me. I can understand peoplehaving different tastes, but for those of you out there who didn't'like it... well, really this just makes me feel sad for you, becauseD.D. is real magic, a flight of imagination and originality which hasbeen so rare to see in recent times. Really, to me it's depressingto know that a lot of people just don't get it. They surely didn't get ithere in Italy, where the movie hasn't even been released! Not evendirectly to video!? (To see it I had to order the DVD from the UK).I read that Kelly's new project `the Knowing' has to do with timetravel and possibly separate realities again. I just hope it will bedifferent from Darko, and if he can keep his work up to this level,well then there really is `so much to look forward to?' 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>superb, haunting and masterful piece of filmmaking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its hard to write a quick brief describing what this film is about, so all I can say is what I knew before I saw it.Troubled teenager with sleeping problems talks to a scary 6-foot rabbit called frank who tells him the world is going to end in 28 days.-I basically thought I was going to see your average, run of the mill, teenage slasher film. That is what I was expecting, a couple hours of pure escapism, end of story. How wrong I was!The first time I saw Donnie Darko it left me confused, breathless and slightly disturbed. I didn't know what quite to make of what I had just seen but I couldn't wait to see it again. I never thought a 6 foot rabbit costume could unsettle me so much.After a second viewing my conclusions had been drawn, Donnie Darko is a superb, haunting and masterful piece of filmmaking.The film starts out as a suburban family drama but quickly transcends into an enticing mix of high school teen film, science fiction, time travel, horror and suspense. The film is set in 1988. The main reason behind this I felt was to give viewers an automatic feeling of nostalgia.The cast is faultless, Jake Gyllenhaal is mesmerising in the lead role switching between confused high school kid and something a lot darker effortlessly. The supporting cast in the shape of Catherine Ross, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Drew Barrymore and Noah Wyle fall into their parts with ease and deliver everything expected of them and more, but the biggest surprise is Patrick Swayze who absolutely nails his role, as a self help guru with a sinister secret, with almost frightening conviction.The soundtrack is awesome, featuring Echo and the Bunnymen and Joy Division and a haunting cover of Tears for Fears Mad World.I have seen this film several times now and still feel that i don't only honestly understand all of it but understand as much as I want to.It is refreshing to see a film that makes you think and come up with your own ideas and conclusions, instead of spoon-feeding you a start, middle and an end.I consider this film as a fantastic piece of filmmaking, and I cant wait to see what Director Richard Kelly does next.I would urge everyone to see this film at least twice, if you still don't like it then fair enough, but you may just discover something wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko -- as insane as the plots turns are in this movie, there's something about this movie that is so abrasively real. It grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go. Testaments to fine directing: all the actors give excellent performances, and the atmosphere throughout the movie is intoxicatingly alien and foreboding.Jake Gylenhaal is so deep in character as Donnie Darko that one has to wonder how many weeks it took him to decompress from his role as an achingly intelligent and troubled young man who seems almost too good for this world. Mary McDonnell is wonderful as his mother. There's a scene when she's in deep despair smoking a cigarette; when a neighbor girl rides by on her bike and kindly waves, Mary McDonnell manages to give a slight, tearful smile and wave back -- a surreal and touching moment. And here's the stunning jewel of the movie: Gary Jules' exquisite cover of "Mad World," which plays over a montage at the climax. If that doesn't move you, you're dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misinterpretations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been scrolling this forum a bit, and i couldn't believe how many of what i felt were misinterpretations of the movie there were.I've seen alot of people criticize Donnie Darko for being just a jumbled mess of sci fi, romance, drama, comedy, etc. with no real point.First of all, I'd like to say that Donnie Darko's production value alone is enough to set it apart. The cinematography was brilliant, the soundtrack was incredible, and the editing was superb. Everything fit together seemlessly.Secondly, people criticize Donnie Darko for its whole time travel thing that it has going on, and disregard it as complete rubbish. I think however, that the time travelling scenario was just a device to get across the message that the writer was trying to convey. Many times through the film we are shown the contrast between superficiality something deeper emotionally (i.e. Sparkle Motion vs. Autumn Angel, Jim Cunningham vs Donnie Darko). Donniefeels isolated because everybody else is so consumed by that which is right in front of them and they never take the time to take a deeper look into things. Everyone around him (save a few people) is completely apathetic towards actually thinking and analyzing something on a more philosophical and emotional level, and would just rather be amused by the obvious than become more wise from the obscure. Donnie, on the other hand, realizes that this kind of life is shallow and meaningless, but because no one will listen to him (something evident in the scene with the line seperated into the spectrums of fear and love) he is becoming more and more isolated from the rest of the world.I'm kind of discounting the actual time travelling scenario in this rhetoric, but that is because the that scenario deals more with Donnie's fear of dying alone than the whole social commentary that I'm trying to explain.The movie was brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a thought provoking film. As far as I know its the first film for which it is necessary to view the website after viewing the film in order to more fully understand the climax. This idea is sure to catch on.To judge by the number of sites devoted to discussing what the film "really means", its cult status seems guaranteed. I am sure it is best viewed the first time knowing as little as possible about what to expect. You may well want to view it a second time, and you are certain to run across people who want to ask you if you noticed certain small details - a sure sign of a film which will be appear in lists of "favourite films" for years to come.Like most good films it is easy to recognise eclectic influences.The family interaction around the dinner table is more Roseanne than Cosby. Donnie's attack on the school and its mascot are straight out of The Simpsons. The discussion on the sex life of The Smurfs is Tarintoesque. Characters such as Cherita Chen (especially at the talent show) and Jim Cunningham could fit into a David Lynch film - they are neither simple caricatures, nor are they given a chance to explain themselves.However, I personally think that the film's originality is overstated by its passionate advocates.(SPOILER ALERT)It is closer to the Back to the Future Trilogy than you would expect given the intense debate for hidden meanings. But closer still is the Gwyneth Paltrow vehicle, Sliding Doors which is actually a more challenging attempt to explore the "what if" nature of the fact that every little thing we do will (or at least can) deeply influence the lives of other people we know, as well as our own.More intriguingly, the film's creator seemingly wishes to draw parallels to The Last Temptation of Christ in which Jesus is given the opportunity to see the future if he chooses not to die, and rejects that future. The possible alternative reality theme can trace its lineage back through Its A Wonderful Life, all the way to A Christmas Carol. Can it really be true that some of the reviewers who find this film unique (not to mention those who say they cannot understand it) are not aware of that history?To me the film is very reminiscent of a Star Trek: Next Generation episode called Yesterday's Enterprise, which encapsulates all Donnie Darko's themes and more. Just like in Donnie, the whole episode is set in a universe which is "not meant to be". Just as in Donnie, the characters (a whole ship's crew, and not just one character) have to make a choice to go back and sacrifice their own lives to make sure a "better" timeline survives. There is no religious connotation (unlike the creators of Donnie apparently intend). They just do it on utilitarian grounds; their sacrifice is for the greater good of the greater number. What the Star Trek episode has which Donnie lacks is a clear sense that there is no easy "right" or "wrong" choice. A character (Tasha Yar) is alive in the alternate universe even though she had previously been killed off in the Prime Universe. By going back in time and behaving differently, the old Enterprise crew are denying her the right to live (as well as improving life for the remainder of the regular cast).Nonetheless, Donnie Darko is a funny and well-crafted movie, and I think anyone who sees it will be glad that they did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not going to even attempt a synopsis here, for two reasons. I couldn't do it justice, and its really very worthwhile to view this movie dead cold. Besides, I'm pretty sure I don't exactly understand the movie. I watched it a bunch of times, listened to the director's commentary...and I still don't get it!! I mean you end up sort of understanding everything, but a part of your brain just doesn't click with total comprehension. Having said that, I love it! The director threw a major bulls-eye on virtually all counts. The performances are bizarre, but so well done and the style, which really defines this movie, is your basic blast of fresh air. When you listen to the director and how incredibly budget strapped he was, you gain total respect for what he was able to do here. There are so so many films that have unlimited cashola, that are utter crap. Not to say, this chap might not do the same on a bigger film, but here he gives us one that if not for the brilliant way it was shot, well it could easily have been pretty awful. The cast again, some really big names who were obviously just totally on the wavelength of the idea and did an art for arts sake good deed, giving just absolutely first rate performances. Just nice to see and nicer still to enjoy. Good job too with the soundtrack if I may say so. Bully!!!</fullReview>

It is not strictly a science fiction, it is not strictly horror, it is not strictly fantasy, and it is not strictly a drama. It is a brilliant combination of all of these genres. Some may view this movie expecting everything to be cut and dried at the end, and they will be disappointed.Donnie Darko is a disturbed young man. You will question whether he is a schizophrenic suffering hallucinations or if he really is communicating with a 6-foot tall demon rabbit from the future. It sounds strange and it is, but I guarantee that if you don't go in with expectations you will enjoy this highly intelligent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie that gets better everytime you watch it. At first the ending made me think too much, but then the next time I was even more blown back. Donnie is not your typical teen: he's smart, sarcastic, and insane, just a little. But when his 6-foot imaginary bunny friend tells him the world is ending, things really fall apart. This is not an end of the world thriller, it's sort of a mix between coming of age tale, dark comedy, and mind-bender. It's well-acted, with even the most cardboardly written characters being brought to life by good actors. Jake Gyllenhaal is a great screen prescence, and his performance is gold here. The writing is witty, and the film is visually enriching. Overall, I can't say much else about this personal favorite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why was this wonderful film marketed as a teen thriller? It's so much more...This movie hit me on so many levels, it would be hard to go into detail without divulging sensitive information about my personal life. That aside, the cinematography is excellent (the Tears for Fears "Head Over Heels" sequence runs through my mind constantly, which brings to mind the excellent soundtrack, such as Joy Division's "Love Will Tear Us Apart" during a pivotal scene with Gretchen arriving at the party.) The use of the time frame 1988 is a mystery to me, because it is a rather timeless story, and my concern upon hearing this was that the costumers would attempt to enhance aesthetics by outfitting the characters in outlandish 80's regalia. Not so... the students were in uniforms (nice touch.) While it's true their is more fiction than science in this sci-fi-- given: the physics are a little hokey-- I actually like the fact that it leaves "too" much to the imagination. Going into great detail about abstract physics would have completely ruined the point, and refrain from doing so adheres to the point: Donnie's experience transcends known science, and truly delves into the "spectrum" of human emotion that we all feel so intensely as adolescents but can wholly appreciate, despite our repression, as adults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thinking &amp; a stunning soundtrack to boot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS?In my mind, there are two films which you can always rely on to make you think for hours on end &amp; which can confuse even the most clever mind. The first of these is K-Pax, the second of these is Donnie Darko.It's about this point where it's worth attempting to explain a plot, but the thing is that this film has so many different interpretations, that I can't help but feel that whatever I say can be questioned. So with this in mind, I'll just simply state that the film is about the life of the title character Donnie Darko. Donnie behaves differently to everyone else whom you might consider "normal", (explain this how you might - insanity? fate? genius?) and during this film we grow to really feel for him. Donnie, majestically played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is an amazing character &amp; I must confess that whoever came up with the idea of this film must be a genius in his own right.The thing which seems to appeal so much about Donnie is that at times, he's just so obviously right. Theres a scene with one of his teachers, the infuriating Kitty Farmer (played by Beth Grant), and the way he reacts to her teaching is the way so many of us have wanted to act towards teachers/lecturers/etc over the years. Donnie recognises stupidity and rather than just tolerating it, he seems to condemn it and act against it. I think it's quite possible that the world needs more Donnie Darko type characters.The thing with this film (and be warned DEFINATELY do not read this if you don't want to know things about the plot as it's a BIG SPOILER) is that it seems to almost show two viewpoints. Many people think of it as some sort of time travel escapade, but in my view, it's more a sort of inverted "It's A Wonderful Life". Gyllenhaal takes on Jimmy Stewart's role in this version &amp; whilst Jimmy discovered that his world needed him, it's almost like Gyllenhaal realises that the world is better off without him. When I first saw this film, I considered that perhaps this film is some sort of ideal of what life is like once we die. What if when we die, to help us WANT death, we experience how our life would turn out if we lived. Anyway, in the end of the day, this is only my view of this film. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.YOU CAN CONTINUE READING WITHOUT MAJOR SPOILERS NOW. But you're better off watching this film before reading any reviews anyway.This film makes people think, it is dark, it has some superb acting in it &amp; by far and away, it is one of the best films of the last 10 years. If you desire something thought provoking, watch this, if you desire something mindnumbing in which you can shut off to, watch "Pirates Of The Carribean" (I've reviewed that today too).Full marks to everyone involved in the creating of this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Analysis of DD **SPOILERS**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CAUTION**SPOILERS**I think that Richard Kelly threw a hundred red herrings and a thousand ideas to us all at once but I have also developed several other theories. Not saying everything is wrong or right but I haven't found many comments that have actually helped me to understand the film better.Donnie is in a tangent universe where he is guided by Frank and ultimately in the end he has the choice to continue by traveling through time or dying, and by doing so saving Gretchen, but not exposing the pedophile, so he is not necessarily doing what is right, but what he wants. When Gretchen dies Donnie realizes that as he has always said when you die you alone. He wasn't there holding Gretchen's hand. In death she is alone because at the time no one else is experiencing it with you and ultimately in the end Donnie dies alone, too. Grandma Death said that every living creature dies alone. Ultimately the 28 days, or end of the world, become the end of Donnie's world, where he is forced to make a choice of sacrifice. He chooses to allow Gretchen to live, Frank to survive, etc by sacrificing himself. Everyone has a path and those are the liquid spheres protruding from everyone's chests and this is the key to the time travel. You have to change where the path is going in order to travel. Everyone's paths already exist but Donnie is chosen to decide for himself what his path will be. He is given life and death at the same time. I think Donnie is laughing because in the end he realizes that death isn't the worst thing that can happen to a person. Being able to see your future changes it and Donnie sees his own future and escapes his death but in the end finds it to be inevitable. Donnie is faced with tangent universes the future of what can be, which he lives, and the unknown with him dead. The tangent universes meet but eventually separate leaving Donnie with his ultimate choice. I don't think this film has a lot to do with God because the teacher said that he could get fired if he continued the conversation and being at a Catholic school and all God must be responsible. I don't really understand Frank, although he is the manipulated dead which is guiding Donnie. There are two parallel universes but eventually the paths meet and Donnie must decide what path he has to take.I know all my ideas are jumbled but I have seen the movie twice now and new theories keep developing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a mess or a masterpiece?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A review below called this film a mess - a collection of 1000 ideas Kelly had to throw in it.I watched this movie for a second time recently (first time being more than a year ago). This time around I was able to put everything together much more clearly (after some reflection at that). I was amazed at how well everything came together in the film this time (even the time travel subplot). In fact I can't believe how Kelly came up with such an incredible story. It actually might have been that he got the idea for the script from that song that is played in the end - 'Mad World - Tears of Fears.'In any case, this is a must see imho...10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a terrific and challenging film. Everybody prays that they can go to the cinema or hire a movie and see a film that doesn't talk down to them or insult their intelligence. It doesn't happen often but when it does it can be spectacular. And "Donnie Darko" is spectacular. Gyllenhaal's screen presence is there for all to see, he commands attention and you really feel his anger and frustration at living in a world that he doesn't fit into. Swazye's cameo is also marvellous, what a come back! A must see, must own modern classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched "Donnie Darko" several times. Everytime I watch it I come away from it with something new. I am not really a fan of fantasy/drama/thriller movies, but this one was the exception to the rule. This movie is made to make you think. YOU do the work, not the director. (Although he directed this movie splendedly). Some look at Donnie as a Christ-like figure, put on earth to save the world......and to destroy some of the bad before he goes, i.e. burning down Patrick Swayze's house. A Great Movie.</fullReview>

I consider myself to be a pretty philosophical thinker; You can call me deep.I still can't get a grasp on this movie though. For every explanation explained there is another question asked. For every solution there is another question. I'm not going to get into a summary of the movie here or even hint at the plot.

		<shortDescription>A Breathtaking, Thought Provoking Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko. If you just read the name of this amazing movie, you can understand that it's dark, and by dark, I mean seriously DARK. It is a very nice change to see a teen movie that isn't brainless and stupid, although Donnie Darko is no teen movie. Donnie Darko is one of the most mind-twisting movies there is. One can even compare it to the one and only Mullholland Dr., though it is not as complicated. Donnie Darko is one of those classic small masterpieces that didn't get enough recognition as it deserved.Having an in-depth story of a teenage boy going through different changes in his life, Donnie Darko also focuses on the arts of philosophy, psychology, and time traveling. The movie starts off with Donnie having a hallucination of a strange insect-like bunny who predicts the end of the world. By taking this information, Donnie automatically takes responsibility into his hands. This insect-like bunny is then said to be one of Donnie's many hallucinations for he has mental problems and visits a psychiatrist, to which he explains what he is feeling through hypnotism. On the way to his comprehension of what the bunny tried to say, Donnie meets Gretchen, another teenage new girl at his school who's mother has been abused by her father and so was forced to change school and town. Donnie mixes his feelings about her with all the other strange feelings he starts having about the people in his life. One of these, a depressed overweight Chinese girl called Cherita, who likes Donnie but refuses to say anything and who is constantly teased. At the same time, his school features a lectures by a 'feeling-expert', who tries to show these teenagers how to divide their anger from their love. As the story evolves, the days become numbered until the so said, end of the world and Donnie searches and finds a banned book featuring Time Travel. By using this element, Donnie tries to stop the dreadful event from happening and at the same time tries to prevent a tragedy in his private life from revealing. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a spectacular performance as the trouble-filled Donnie. The young actor unfortunately has been very underrated with his acting ever since he played in Bubble Boy, a dumb and very silly comedy. His portrayal of Donnie is very convincing and makes you feel compassion for the character. Gretchen is played by the rising star Jena Malone, who first played in the Julia Roberts hit Stepmom and the tear-jerker Life As A House. Jena's Gretchen is an amazing character which makes you fall in love with her. Amongst the cast are also Drew Barrymore who plays Donnie's literature teacher and who once again gives an excellent performance.Richard Kelly's direction is simply brilliant. Mr. Kelly fixes up such an atmosphere as to actually scare the audience. Some of the scenes with Donnie's insect-like bunny hallucinations are quite freaky. Richard Kelly has successfully captured the essence of filmmaking by creating this hell of a film, which is also his first feature length movie. The visuals are outstanding. As I noted before, Richard Kelly creates an atmosphere with his breathtaking visuals. The cinematography is excellent giving us a rather dark and mysterious movie. The editing is very special, but it manages to capture the whole idea of the movie's symbolism which is actually pretty good. Since the movie is based on the 80's, you can expect good music, and this good music is edited quite well with the scenes and simply 'hits' you and so you have a desire to watch the movie over and over again. Overall, Donnie Darko is an instant modern classic that needs to be recognized more by the rest of the movie audience. A movie that gives us a blend of horror, psychology, symbolism, comedy and drama, Donnie Darko is a fantastic movie.Savvas Stavrou's Rating: 10/10 - A Modern Classic</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am extremely glad I have taken the time to watch this film. I think if anyone reads these pages to decide what films to see, they merely need to see the calibre of commentary above. I would not say though that I loved this film because it was labeled 'indie.' (dear me, whoever THOUGHT of that dreadful term anyway?!) I liked this film on its merits. (neener neener) It never came to this country's theaters, was unhyped and unknown. I am lucky in spades. Were I to slam some 'indie' film I could do no worse than targetting pap like 'Chasing Amy.' Film sickness bags on hand for that one.Maybe I'm a romantic butSPOILER PERHAPSAVERT YOUR EYES (if you wish to remain a spoiler virgin)!!!So,as I was blithering...maybe I'm a romantic but the first person had it right- Darko returns to save the life of the girl he loves. Hey, he's all flush with the wild hormones of what we can only assume is his very first bedding! Lucky hapless boy! My additional spin is that Frank came to help Darko put things right...to make up for having run over the girl Darko loves. Frank was not good or bad but meant to keep things in their original balance-Farmer,Barrymore,pedophile and all.On the message boards, one person made a sweet comment about how Darko finally seems to be actually happy when he wakes up in bed near the end. He's found love and now knows how to show it. He's at peace. That was lovely. Truly.Oh, and even if Barrymore's delivery is less than stellar, at least she had the wits to keep her part relatively minor,eh? A wisdom beyond her years.I say folks should see this film if they're not into blockbusters and overhyped pap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Donnie Darko' has all the elements of a truly amazing movie: excellent script, great characters, terrific mood, superb one-liners, wonderful mood, splendid soundtrack and originality. There are scenes that will make you laugh, cry, tremble, and stare with wide-eyed wonder. It is a movie about a kid who is obsessed with time travel. He also happens to have an imaginary friend who looks kind of like a rabbit. But those are about the only "normal" parts of the movie.Don't let the comparison with 'Groundhog Day' keep you at bay. That only relates to an element, not the script or the style. If you liked the good parts of 'Blue Velvet,' you'll love the entirety of 'Donnie Darko.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering a writers debut into the world of film, I was shocked. It was one of the most visually astounding movies I've seen in a long time. The view showed the beauty that is associated with a Psychological Thriller. It brought back the hope that there may be a movie that would live up to the disturbing beauty that Staley Kubrick once displayed. This movie became a Cult Classic immediately in United Kingdom. While it was almost not even heard of here in America. I just wish people knew what they were missing. The movie keeps you considering and reconsidering your idea of the meaning of the ending. The movie relates to the feeling and emotions that a young adult go through everyday. It was pliable in the meaning of the story. You took what you wanted from the film and thats all it asked for. This movie gives me hope for the movies to come and maybe Kubrick made the impact he wanted on the film industry. A beautiful movie with an even more beautiful score. I gave Donnie Darko a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So great...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie from the first time I saw it, but it took me much more time to understand the whole point of the movie. But even without a point - the movie it self is just... interesting, the plot is a bit blurry, but it's interesting, and a little twisted. The funny scenes of the movie really are funny, like with the smurfs, or when Jake tries to kiss Jena, for the first time ( you know, the scene with the fat guy:)) ). And the cast is great. I think all the actors did a great job. Even Jake seemed to be... well... too tired from time to time, he WAS supposed to have emotional problems in the movie, you know, so that makes sense.The point of the movie is that people live not only for themselves, but for other people, who are part of them, and when they die or just get out of our lives- we no longer care for anything (morals/rules blah blah blah).And there's another one- people live for the future, but if we'll suddenly find out, our future will end in a month, we'll have nothing to lose, and we'd do all the things we ever wanted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not given to exaggeration, but I have to say that this is all-round the best film I've ever seen. Sure, there are other films that are great (The Star Wars films for instance) but no film has had the emotional and intellectual effect on me that this one has. I have never seen a film and still been thinking about it ten days later.The film has a very different feel to any other I've seen. Its time travel theme does mean it has elements of sf - however, to pigeonhole it into one of these narrow categories is to do it a disservice. One suspects that the reason it didn't do so well commercially is that nobody knew what to market it as.This film will leave you with many questions. The information garnered from "The Philosophy of Time Travel" extracts on the DVD/website will help with a few, but some will probably never be answered. That is one of the things which makes this film great.The casting is very good. Richard Kelly was wise to pick mainly relative unknowns in the three main roles of Donnie, Gretchen and Frank as the presence of big names would have overshadowed the film.The overall look of the film is great, with some memorable scenes (e.g Donnie, Gretchen and Frank in the cinema, "They made me do it" sprayed on the ground in front of the school) and the choice of music is pretty good (such as Echo and the Bunnymen (appropriate given what Frank is)), but then most of the artists are British so I'm probably biased.This is not just a film you watch, it is a film you feel.10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am so tired of predictable movies. I had no idea where this one was going, and to it's great credit, I didn't care. I was along for the ride, and happily so. But when all the seemingly-unrelated threads started weaving together so beautifully and unexpectedly, I was just completely delighted. And I'm so tired of "nerdy" characters in movies who are really just Cindy Crawford in bad glasses. I mean the kind of character that everyone treats as untouchable when there's really nothing remotely challenging about their world- view and their "nerd" problem could be solved with a better haircut. In this film the title character isn't ugly; there's nothing you can put your finger on, but he puts off such a weird, disturbing energy that you totally believe everyone would avoid him. POSSIBLE SPOILER? Another thing-- I was also SO happy to see a character be GENUINELY HEROIC. Not some sting-ray-bike-riding, fist-pumping, yelling-"YEAH!" -to-the- heavens PHONY bullsh*t hero, but someone who does something brave and selfless even though no one may ever know or appreciate that he did it, just because it was the right thing to do. Great film. God bless Drew Barrymore for having the courage to produce it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spoiler free review of a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a high school student who, one day almost randomly, is visited by a giant rabbit called Frank. Frank tells Donnie that the world is going to end in just a little over twenty-eight days. Then Donnie returns to his normal life?But the question is, is Donnie Darko little more than another David Lynch wannabe or is it something more profound? Well, initial impressions of the film suggest that this is no more than gimmicky, philosophical posturing (something many people accuse the Matrix movies of being). However if you did deeper as a viewer, bountiful rewards await as Donnie Darko (like the character itself) has more to it than meets the eye. After the slightly detached opening sequence, the first thing that strikes you about the film is Jake Gylenhaal. Even at the film's most conventional (i.e. the dinner table scene near the beginning of the film) he practically leaps off the screen and envelopes you whole with his movie star cred. Forget Colin Farrell (well, maybe) but Jake is the real deal. He brings an arrogance and a vulnerability to Donnie which is never short of touching. He has good support too. Patrick Swayze is the epitome of superficiality as the self-help guru while Drew Barrymore pulls a superior version of her usual doe-eyed performance. Also, something else interesting to note about the film is the use of music. The opening uses music quite efficiently in encapsulating Donnie's character but it's the penultimate scene in the film with the Tears for Fears song `Mad World' that surprises you the most. That scene rates amongst the most heartbreaking of any modern film. I will stop myself there, because I want you to discover it for yourself.If the film did have a flaw, t would be that it often feels like the debut movie it is. Its not that Richard Kelly's writing or direction is pretentious or dull- it just seems a little precious at times. There are some striking elements of the film (like Donnie's form of `real' spirituality versus Swayze's fake version) that scream `film school graduate' due to their simplicity- which does slightly mar an otherwise exceptional piece of work.Not quite the ground-breaker it would like to think it is, Donnie Darko is still one of the most captivating, soulful, ambiguous and thought-provoking (and possibly one of the best??) films of the last few years. And for that, Mr. Kelly- I salute you</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is THE most original and thought provoking film that I've seen in years. Right from the opening shot over Carpathian Ridge to the films climax, every shot not only looks gorgeous, but is there for a reason. That reason only becomes clear after a second and third viewing. Its rare that a movie is released that actually gets better with multiple viewings, but Donnie Darko is definately one of those rare gems.I loved almost everything about this movie. The cast are faultless, Jake Gyllenhaal, based on his performance in this movie and others that I've seen him in, has the potential to become one of the finest screen actors of his generation, however the rest of the cast cannot be overlooked. Particular accolades must go to Jena Malone, Holmes Osborne, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore. While the rest of the supporting cast are on top form also.Finally, special mention must be given to Richard Kelly, I cant wait to see your next movie man!!! Steven Poster, who's cinematography was just amazing, and Michael Andrews who somehow managed to create the perfect soundtrack.The only disappointment that I have with this movie, is that some unbelievable scenes were dropped (why I ask you?????), and that there is no soundtrack of the 80's music that was played in the movie. Michael Andrews did a wonderfull job on the soundtrack and I have bought it, but I couldn't help but feel slightly disappointed that the songs from the 80's weren't on it. Lads, if anyone of you read this, I cant stress enough how big a demand there could be for a cd of the 80's music played in Donnie Darko!!!My final words about Donnie Darko are watch it, then watch it again, then buy the soundtrack, and then re-watch the movie :-)Richard, I cant wait to see your next project. Keep up the good work !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is difficult to know where to begin. I suppose by complimenting the outrageous idea of Richard kelly and then complimenting the sheer bravery to realise it and pull it off. I was gripped by the mentally disturbed Donnie throughout (thanks much in part to Gylengaard's performance but mostly to fantastic writing). It's the type of film that demands repeat viewing, basically because the ending is so baffling, so its probably best not to make too much sense of it.Also the use of varying editing techniques such as slow mo, fast forward and rewind adds to the unique effect it has. The genre is difficult to classify with sci-fi, black comedy, drama and even a subtle element of horror (check out the shot of Donnie with the axe and the haunting score deployed at key moments) but again this just adds to the uniqueness of it. This is not the type of american teen film you watch with your mates over cans of lager, it requires a more focused attention than that to be appreciated. And appreciate it I did.</fullReview>

I can't say much that hasn't already been said, but I found the acting to be amazing on all fronts, special congrats to Mr. Patrick Swayze who's portrayal of the "little-too-clean" self help guru Jim Cunningham was DEAD ON perfect and the Gyllenhaal siblings for being two of the most promising young actors in Hollywood that I've ever seen. The movie is billed as a horror move "in the tradition of Final Destination..." and NOTHING could be further from the truth. Both movies deal with fighting destiny and that's it. Donnie Darko has some rather frightening moments, but it's not a frightening movie. The only reason it would keep you up all night would be if you were trying to unravel it's complex and profound plot, most especially the ending. The ending has received the most heat from critics of the movie who cite it as a cop-out or lacking any substance, but nothing could be further from the truth. I was a little skeptical after my first viewing, but just now I watched it again and so much more clicked. It still doesn't make complete sense, but I'm told if you watch it with commentary on the DVD the director explains a lot of it. The very end, as it shows everyone's gut reaction to the shocking event that the film ends on before they even know about it, is underscored by the song "Mad World" performed by Gary Jules and is one of the most moving and genuinely sorrowful scenes I have ever seen in my life. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The cleverest film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are certain films that if you are seriously into films, you will never forget watching the first time. Shawshank is one, Usual Suspects is another, Seven, Forest Gump, Godfathers etc. This is up there with any. Make no mistake, if you like puzzling films, this is absolutely genius. Nothing less - GENIUS. Every aspect from dialogue to undertones, from score to simple mis-en-scene is there for you to read and analyze e.g. 'Cellar Door.'The story tells of a teenage boy, who guided by a giant bunny Frank is saved from death and has 28 days until the world ends. In this time he discovers a child porn addict to the community, and finds his female soul mate. The ending tracks back to the start and this time he does not escape death because Frank the Bunny is not there. The total beauty in this film is; NOBODY KNOWS THE ENDING FOR SURE. Was it a dream, is that why Donnie is laughing? Was it another universe? It is purely a personal reading, even more than a Lynch film. Personally, I like to think the end symbolises missed opportunity and peacefullness in death, and what an absurd place the world can be. It takes on ideas from Groundhog Day and lots of other films into a new level. The performances are breathtaking, especially Donnie. This is the most original and absurd film I have ever seen, also the thought-provoking it provides will keep you thinking for weeks. Did it happen? Those days happened before the start, or after? Did he die? Who knows. Watch it three or four times and you start to grasp the idea more. Totally brilliant and an absolute joy to analyze if you do Film Studies on any level. The final scene is beautiful - the mother and girl seem to know each but have never met. Surely they have, haven't they?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best film of 2002</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>by far, the best movie of that year, and possibly one of the least expensive. no point in even attempting to describe the story as any idea could ruin the experience. as a debut film from director richard kelly, he should be very proud of this. this is the movie of which all his future movies will be judged against. the film is so very intimate, and intricate, using small town locations, and complex plotting to bewilder the viewer but to also wrap them up in the atmosphere of the movie. donnie, played by jake gyllenhaal is a mystery, his character is so down to earth, yet so unworldly that he becomes an instant contender for best character in a movie. and the score by michael andrews is hallucinatingly beautiful, touching the right notes on the right scenes. it all adds to an incredibly light, haunting film, with a pitch black heart. and one hell of a head trip afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To speak of "Donnie Darko", I must digress to tell you I feel like the astronaut Dave in the sequel to 2001, the movie most people didn't like at all, 2010. (I liked it and make no excuses even though 2001 is among my favorite five films of all time. 2010 is not a favorite of any kind, I just liked it). Dave the astronaut said, when he cosmically appeared, "Something wonderful is going to happen", or words to that effect. He was referring to the second sun which would appear in the sky and how our absolute awe would save the day for a foundering mankind.I say to you who will see Donnie Darko one day, "Something wonderful is going to happen". An unexpected original and exciting treasure awaits you. It is a horror, sci-fi, teenage angst, family disintegration, superhero, philosophical exploration, sacrifice film that leaves the viewer so satisfied in the end and so filled with unexpected hope, he or she will want to immediately rewind and watch again.</fullReview>

The film is really ambitious, and I couldtell that it was Richard Kelly's brainchild, probably from the time hewas a teenager, within the first fifteen minutes. I am currently a filmmajor at Temple University, and although I would never attempt totackle the metaphysical and supernatural themes that DonnieDarko deals with, I must say I greatly admire Kelly's convictions asa filmmaker.

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a film I've been meaning to watch for about a year now, since it has become something of a cult film. Also, a lot of people I know who have seen it have an opinion about it and appeared to be one of those "love it or hate it" films which intrigue me even more. Interestingly enough, the main praise I have heard is that it is a movie that makes you really think, which is the biggest complaint I've heard about it as well. **Possible spoiler if you don't read the back of the VHS or DVD, I believe**Donnie Darko stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Darko, a suburban teen who is emotionally and mentally disturbed. By day, he lives a quasi-functional existence, but generally at night, he is visited by a nightmarish rabbit with a scary skull head who tells him to go out and perform destructive acts. Why would Donnie do this? Because on October 2, 1988, Donnie is beckoned outside by Frank the rabbit, just in time to avoid the plane engine that comes crashing through Donnie's bedroom. Therefore, Donnie feels indebted to Frank, who tells him that in 28 days, the world will end. The film then follows the next 28 days of Donnie's life.I was enjoyed this film for so many reasons. One primary draw is a great character, and Donnie Darko is definitely an incredibly multi-dimensional character. I was so thrilled to see a figure who is conflicted, eccentric and disturbed, yet incredibly intelligent. His continual questioning of authority because of his expansive way of thinking is extremely refreshing because so many times we see films where youths question the status quo but don't have the bones to back it up. Along with the main character, there is an impressive supporting cast - most notably Mary McDonnell as Donnie's mom and (words I never thought I would utter) a small but effective performance by Patrick Swayze as a local self-help guru. I have to make a special mention for Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Darko. I had never seen him in a film before this week, and I have now seen him in two, this one and The Good Girl. I am really looking forward to watching the progression of his career and to see what types of roles he takes in the future because he is extremely talented. He seems to bring a very believable soulfulness, maturity and intelligence to his roles which was personified in this film. Films that leave many aspects of the plot open for interpretation is another genre that I am attracted to, and this film does just that. The director, Richard Kelly is still young and has the potential for having a very interesting career if this movie is any indication. His style is a mixture of two of my favorite directors, Paul Thomas Anderson and David Lynch, a very attractive combination. Like PT Anderson he has rich character studies and uses the soundtrack in an extremely effective manner. I absolutely loved the 80's new wave soundtrack, because you absolutely believe that those songs would be on a mix tape Donnie would put together. And like Lynch, he explores dark elements to every day life and isn't afraid to insert bizarre characters into his vision. (Hence Frank the rabbit who, and maybe I missed something if he was supposed to be funny, didn't make me laugh once - I actually took him very seriously and was a little frightened by him).One wouldn't expect to find any humor in a movie that explores mental illness, an impending apocalypse and even the existence of God, but I did laugh a few times. Most of the laughs were at Jim Cunningham's (Patrick Swayze) expense, and were usually extremely subtle which is again extremely refreshing.Don't bother with this film if you are not interested in suspending disbelief for two hours, and don't even attempt it if you like your stories handed to you on a silver platter, with beginning middle and end explained complete with charts and diagrams. If you are interested in cinema that takes chances and is going to make you think about it for hours, possibly days after then check this film out immediately because it is outstanding.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambiguity is popular again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***There are spoilers in this review***This dark, layered film almost hits the mark, but unfortunately it falls short, leaving too many unanswered questions and unresolved plot lines. We're living through another film renaissance, almost like the 1960s, with films such as Being John Malkovich, L.A. Confidential, American Beauty, and Chicago. Everyone laments the largely pathetic output of today's corporate Hollywood production machine, but these films are among those who prove that high-profile culture isn't dead in America just yet. Donnie Darko might belong among these thoughtful, painstakingly assembled films if only it had more substance.For some reason, this film is set in 1988, apparently only to include 80s music in the soundtrack like Echo and the Bunnymen (was this a coincidence?). The only 1988 reference in the entire film is the presidential race. So why 1988? By the way, it's always amusing to see the number of ways that time travel, an old Hollywood standby, is incorporated into films. This time it's some nonsense about worm holes.The film isn't all bad: Frank is one of the most fascinating, layered characters since Dr. Lecter, and watching the unraveling of who he really is is like a mystical journey. Though the idea of Frank as spiritual guide is intriguing, it is an empty gesture. What purpose does it serve to teach someone a life lesson if they're, ahem, ultimately unable to use it? As beautifully subtle as most of the film is, it is the jarring baseball-bat-to-the-head inferences that bother me the most. Donnie's teacher could not be any more conveniently repressed; any teacher who doesn't know the difference between Lorne Greene and Grahame Greene should be fired. Then later on, the same teacher tells Donnie's mother that she believes she `isn't committed to Sparkle Motion' (the high school dance troupe). I think it's supposed to be a funny vignette, but it's not at home in this movie; John Waters would have more use for it.No purpose is served by exposing Cunningham. It adds nothing to the story other than that it hints that Frank might be real, and even then it's a stretch; you would think that an omniscient time-traveling one-eyed man would be powerful enough to set the fire himself. And even then, the pessimistic expectation that the entire house would burn down and leave Cunningham's porn collection untouched for the authorities to discover would be just the motivation not to do it and instead simply alert the police. Whatever.It's easy to see why this film and the Matrix are so popular with young people: they fulfill the aching question about the supposed unseen, influential force that directs peoples' lives. Predestination was always a popular notion in uncertain times, because it meant that everything really wasn't your fault. Since times will be uncertain for years to come, expect to see more of these fanciful films that reduce humanity to cogs in a giant wheel, like Magnolia. I guess it's easier to believe in that than the fact that you make your own decisions and have to live with them. In other words, if you're unhappy, most of the time it's your fault. There are sites devoted to picking this film apart, endlessly searching for buried symbolism; someone needs to tell these people that if you look hard enough, you'll find what you're looking for. You need to be over thirty to understand that.On the plus side, the acting is good all around. Drew Barrymore is wonderful as a liberal english teacher, and it is great to see Katharine Ross again. This film is worth watching if you want to see something that breaks out of the mold, even if the effort falls far short of the mark. With more editing, this could have been a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Kelly's love letter to outsiders is eerie and finally heartbreaking. It's hard to think of anything quite like it in contemporary American cinema. There is a passing similarity to the work of Lynch, at least in the hypnotic narrative style that gives the film its sense of dislocation and alienation, but Kelly's concerns are less idiosyncratic and his work more accessible. Thematically, there's also something of the compassion found in the early work of M. Night Shyamalan (although none of the syrup of "Signs"). And the acute social observation brings to mind another extremely gifted young writer-director, James Gray ("Little Odessa").All this in a horror film. Why not? Horror is undergoing a renaissance now that it is the most subversive of genres left in the corporatized, nerve-deadened film industry, *the* place to smuggle meaning into the movie theater. Like 2001's rather good "Session 9," "Donnie Darko" is a film that looks through and beyond its genre, knows and cares about more than its effective scares. Its technique of unsettlement also takes into its ambit the American appetite for cultish pop psychology, the savagery of our schools, the wreckage of community, and the crowbar of conformity - material that it handles with some very well-aimed satire and also a deepening, Pynchon-like paranoia. But its biggest accomplishment is the creation of Donnie himself, a Holden Caulfield to whom has been whispered the most terrible secret of all. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is something quite special.On the merits of this film alone, Kelly looks to be a major talent; encore!</fullReview>

The reason why I watched it was because all the raving reviews about it... the film is amazing and there IS character development for the audience to care about people in it. It is a film that requires some thought as there's quite a few metaphors and imagery used. It is intelligent, weird, funny and sad and it has made me more open-minded about independent films like these. For those who say it is garbage, I would like to say that they have not spent the time to appreciate the complexity of the storyline and of the hidden messages. Gyllenhaal, Malone, Barrymore etc. their performances were amazing so that didn't distract from the weirdness of this film at all. All I can say is that it's amazing and people that say it's trash- well I say give it another try because it is a film that people indeed haven't seen before that's why it may come across as pointless.

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a difficult film to explain, but I'll try. The film starts confusingly, and this is really the shape of things to come. We see a boy wake up on a road, stand-up, and smile to himself. Then get on his bike and cycle home. Once home things seem normal until that night when a strange voice seems to be talking to the same boy, at which point he gets up and sleep walks out of his house. A few minutes later a jet engine crashes into the house. Confused yet? :-)Donnie Darko is literally very dark, and also a highly original film. I don't think there are any easy ways to gauge whether someone will like it or not. It doesn't help to hear too much hype about it, as expectations will be driven sky high for what is a very different type of film. Also the film will for most people require repeated viewings to make the most sense, and probably a visit to the DonnieDarko.com web site will be in order as well for those that want to understand the most about the story. Some moviegoers will not want to do this and/or not appreciate this. You have been warned.I was fortunate to see Donnie Darko in mid-2001 before a lot of the hype surrounding the film had built up. I caught a trailer, and was very curious as to what this film was about. Personally, I wasn't dissapointed. A first time effort from Richard Kelly, this has that wonderfully original feel of someone new to cinema and with a childlike perspective, someone who wasn't adhering to convention. The movie plays a little like a stream of conciousness. Things happen, it isn't obvious whether they make any sense to begin with, but you soak it up and think about it later. As I thought about the movie, watched it second and third times, and read a little more about it, it all began to make sense. I don't think it requires a genius to understand it, but it does require some imagination. People often compare this to David Lynch's films, but it is not like Lynch in my opinion. Jake Gyllenhal, although not a total newcomer to Hollywood, puts in a fantastic performance as Donnie really capturing what is a difficult role. Everyone else puts in good performances, the only exception being Drew Barrymore, and although she helped produce the movie, her characterisation seems very patchy. In terms of cinematography, there are some particularly nice sequences. The music is fantastic for any fan of the 80's and "resurrects" some strangely timeless and apt tunes, and an original score my Michael Andrews is also extremely well done and suited to the film. Overall one of my all time favourite movies. 5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko, if nothing else, has a sense of humor, and that, if nothing else, keeps it intriguing. An alternately funny and poignant troubled-teen story is threaded together by a sci-fi time-travel theory and a central conceit based on variable realities. Donnie's story is fun stuff, handled well, and delivered with a satiric edge that generally amuses and intrigues. A remarkably good genre film by a first-time writer/director, particularly when you consider the competition that's out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is one of the best movies i've ever laid my eyes on. The added beauty of Jake Gyllenhaal also helps. That bunnie has a frightening voice at first, but it doesn't at the end...I find that a little odd. I know i'm going to see Daveigh Chase in the future...good for her for getting rid of the parental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hands down. Extremely funny and surprisingly thought provoking film. Many great performances in this film despite the unusual cast. Noah and Drew work great as high school teachers and its really neat to see them in more serious non comedic roles. Amazing cast, unusual but thought provoking story, and a touch of humor that will make you see just how funny real life is. A must see for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very difficult to understand ... but I love it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is one of the most confusing film I've ever seen. It is difficult to understand because it is based on the fictitious theory of time travel invented by Roberta Sparrow (Grandma Death), one character in the movie. The theory is elaborated in her book "Philosophy of Time Travel". The book appears in the movie but unfortunately the audience never get the chance to know the detailed contents of the book, and without knowing the details of the theory many things happened in the movie become unexplainable and misterious.I saw the movie twice but it was still a riddel to me, but even I could not fully understand it it still attracted me a lot, which I think it was mainly due to the performance, cinematography, sound effect and music. It has an enchanting dark atmosphere which I like. Then I searched the website and found the book "philosophy of time travel" and understood the movie.I think the plot still has some flaws, although it may be my misunderstanding. One thing, if my understanding is correct, at the end of the movie Donnie sent the engine of the airplane from the tangent universe back to the primary universe to eliminate the tangent universe because otherwise the tangent universe will collapse into a black hole which will devour everything. But the problem is where the engine at the beginning of the movie come from. Because at that time Frank already guided Donnie away from his house it should be happened in the tangent universe.Any way, this movie makes me think. And after seeing it I see the world with different eyes. What if I am actually living in a tangent universe and the world will end in a month? Is it possible? Such questions may pop up in my mind, and also the emotions which have been experienced by Donnie Darko.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been told to see this movie by many of my friends, and I dragged my feet about it. But I am happy that I did watch it, because I think its one of the best movies that I have seen for a while. I have read other people's comments about it, and I understand that not everyone thinks it is a decent movie. Some people have insulted each other about it, which is rather immature. Not everyone is going to like this movie, which is fine with me. That just means there are more copies of the Special Edition DVD for me to buy when/if it is going to be released. I love this movie because of the soundtrack, the irony of the casting choices, the plot, the acting, and Evil Dead. I have not seen a movie similar to this, so I have nothing to compare it to. The soundtrack was awesome. I give this film a 9.5 out of 10. But feel free to ignore this review and instead if you have some free time watch the movie for yourself. And form your own opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mind blowing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read summaries of this movie and thought that it sounded like a cheap cheesy b-horror flick, but saw some of the actors involved and thought I would give it a chance, not high on my to rent priority list. Then a friend demanded that I see it at a special re-showing at a local independent art house. My friend already owned it but was still willing to pay $8 to see it. In doubt of a 6 foot rabbitt possesing a troubled teen, I gave in to see it. Thank god I need. I reccommend this movie to any one who is willing to sit back, take everything in, make mental notes for later and not give up on it after the first 15 minutes or so. One of the best most suprising movies released in 2001, I was shocked and almost brought to tears by the ending. Wonderfully creative, the suspense builds and keeps you on the edge of your seat then thwarts you back in shock as all the pieces finally come together. A must own for any true fan of movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people thought there was too much going on in this film to keep track of, but I think that's one of the beautiful things about it. There are so many sub-plots to follow that you could easily become lost. I think that what those people missed was the fact that every single thing that occurs after October 1st happens ONLY to steer Donnie to the event on October 30th.Throughout the 29 days, the characters (especially Donnie's shrink, his girlfriend Gretchen, and Grandma Death) are all there to assure that the main event takes place so that they all can be saved. If you didn't understand that, watch it again! It's brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess this movie is OK if you've never seen a movie made before 1990 &amp; if you don't have any big demands in the areas of plot, character, structure, logic or original ideas. It probably also helps if you see yourself as a "victim" &amp; an "outsider" at school &amp; at home, at least by the standards of such films as Ice Storm, Pleasantville &amp; American Beauty. Otherwise the movie is a completely brain-deadening waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Temptation of Donnie Darko (possible spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched this film at my friend's house. I didn't expect much but I was, to say the least, surprised. The film follows Donnie Darko, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, over a period of 28 days as he confronts bizarre visions of rabbit and falls in love with a girl, played by Jena Malone. According to the rabbit, the world will end in these 28 days and Donnie begins to see signs that the rabbit may be telling the truth. The plot get more complicated as the movie continues but there is one important theme. In the middle of the movie, Donnie and his girlfriend go to see Evil Dead on theater. The director, Richard Kelly, focuses on another film playing at the theater, Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ. Kelly doesn't just show this title by accident; he's hinting to the theme and message of his film. In Scorsese's film, Jesus receives a vision of what his life would be like if he hadn't died on the cross. Donnie Darko, like Jesus, receives a similar vision. He sees how important his death is to everyone else's life. Kelly's addition of The Last Temptation of Christ shows that Donnie Darko isn't another thriller, it's a film with a lot to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do you wear that stupid rabbit suit?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tried to keep quiet. I thought someone else could write a better comment on this A+ film than I could. But since the current comment on the front IMDB page for this film is by someone who never even bothered to watch it.... you can't have ignorant people influencing honest, hard-working IMDB-readers like YOU.Just go and rent Donnie Darko, and please do expect it to be a 1980's teen romance. It is and it isn't, of course... "Donnie Darko" is one of those films where describing it is kind of like describing a painting-- you'll never do it justice. I had to bribe two friends to see it with me, knowing only that it had played the film festivals, and Richard Kelly was getting rave reviews-- and that Drew Barrymore liked it so much, she helped get it made.For me, I give it a 10 out of 10. Of my two friends, one of them despised the ending, and said it dragged on too long... but hey, there are a lot of loose ends to tie up. Mary McDonnell is the most underrated female actress of the past ten years, dating back to her nuanced performance in "Dances with Wolves." She held together "Sneakers," too, which was a really fun movie, no matter what you say.Already I'm taking up too much space. This film is not for the mainstream-- most people, especially kids, like their movies easily describable. You can sum up any Vin Diesel movie in one sentence. "Donnie Darko" might take 500 words or more, and why shouldn't that be a GOOD thing??"Darko" is more layered, more subtle. It takes its time. It relies on more than just the soundtrack to get an emotion across. This is what a movie should be, but I guess more people don't like to think and watch a movie at the same time. And so "Daredevil" makes $100 million, and "Donnie Darko" plays a few screens, then slips quietly off to DVD...So do us all a favor. See the movie before you comment. If you don't understand it, that doesn't mean it stinks. That just means there's a new J.Lo movie opening that you're late for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leaves you thinking days after</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would not have even known about this film but for a small plug from Megan on Tech Tv's Screen Savers. My only regret is that I didn't rent it sooner.Donnie Darko is truly a remarkable film - one of the best I have seen in a very long time. That being said, it is not for everyone. It is very complex, and requires some effort to understand it.For those of you who need to have all the questions answered by the end of the movie, Donnie Darko is not for you. Viewing the movie leaves a myriad of questions - the movie does not end with one big happy ending where all the issues are resolved.However, research (director's commentary, "The Philosophy of Time Travel", etc.) reveals so much more, and helps to answer some of those questions. At times, it is difficult to wrap your mind around what exactly happens - but its worth it. One of the qualities that makes science fiction/fantasy good (or at least believable) is the adherence to the rules of that world. Darko's rules are not readily apparent, but once discovered, they invoke a clearer understanding and greater appreciation for the film.There are very few films that stay with a person; this is one of those films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is far from a stinker or a bomb. This is in fact an extremely significant and in-depth movie, and it is not an accident that it is extremely unknown. However, I don't mean that in the sense that it is poorly written.There are many things that escape the publics eye. Some may feel that is a sign of incompitence or a reflection of the movie as a whole. But you must however realise that many things escape society and are not appreciated for what they are because they are not understood. Donnie Darko is a dark comedy who's theme is entwined with science and the divine.Symbollism is present in almost every scene of the movie. The characters are written to such a depth that there are emotions and struggles present in even the most insignificant character that reflect the thesis of the main body of the plot.Much of this movie is left unspoken and for your mind to figure it out. Those who refuse to appreciate this movie are only vitims of their own ignorance. The movie is far more than "timespace crap". There is actually very little science in the movie...although there is a very apparent theme of physics and metaphysics present.If you feel you can understand, watch it... if not.. enjoy it for what it is classified as... a dark comedy. And for ____'s sake, if you feel that you cannot understand this movie... don't try, you wont like what you find and your X will be to the far left of the lifeline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very, very mad world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a twisted tale of one boys struggle to hold his world together till its inevitable end. Disturbed in his dreams, not only by his sleep-walking, but also from a "vision" of a 6 foot tall evil black bunny rabbit named Frank, Donnie is "saved" from being crushed in his bed by a falling jet engine that is sent back through time. Donnie is then allowed to follow his destiny for the next 28 days, unwillingly and unknowingly setting up the chain of events that eventually lead to the initial point where the rip in space-time occurs. This film raises twice as many questions as it answers, about time-travel, religion, society, conspiracy, fate, choice, love and fear.The musical score, and the choice of songs add to the dark claustrophobic feel of the movies, disturbing and intriguing plot. Since first seeing the movie I have been "looking for answers in all the wrong places", as there are several plot strings that have either no end, no beginning or no explanation which leads me to the lyrics of the final song which sums up this movie perfectly. "and I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad, the dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had, I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take, when people run in circles, its a very very mad world".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the strangest films I have ever seen, and to be honest it's one I would have avoided based on what I'd seen and heard of it. But a friend of mine saw it and didn't shut up about it for days, so in order to silence him, I gave it a go, and I am so glad I did.Okay, so the idea sounds a little bit crazy ... A 6ft evil-looking rabbit telling troubled teenager to commit random acts of destruction. But trust me, it's a million times better than it sounds.I don't want to give anything away about the plot, I just want to convince the doubters who think that this is going to be a stupid movie to go out and find it, block any ideas out of your head and concentrate totally on what is happening on the screen in front of you. I can't guarantee you'll like it because people have different tastes, but I'm sure you won't want to turn it off, even if you hate every second of it.A word of warning though, don't watch this film late at night while eating cheese because I WILL guarantee strange dreams.Anyway, in conclusion, Ladies and Jellyspoons. Donnie Darko is worth watching, whatever your expectations.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be the best film I've seen in a long time. Donnie Darko is a movie that leaves you thinking about what exactly happened for days after, and you still can't be sure, much like American Psycho. It's a very clever and original fantasy film, and it's emotional for the most part, and very funny in between. I disagree that it has any underlying reference to the effects of society on troubled teenager Donnie, while I agree that you can identify with some of the feelings and opinions. Except for the imaginary friend- Mine's not a giant bunny. At least I didn't get any hidden meaning from the film. It's a movie that you have to see to appreciate it, as none of the reviews I read made it sound even slightly interesting, but it has leapt straight towards the top of my list of favourite films. Seen it twice now, and waiting for the DVD release. Hoping for some good extras. And the 'Mad World' Tears for Fears cover by Michael Andrews and Gary Jules is an amazing song.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie a couple of hours ago and I just have to say that this is one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time (and having a roommate that is a Film and Video Studies major, I watch a lot of movies). It was very clever and had a very nice storyline that it followed the whole movie, unlike a lot of the movies made today. Jake did a great job of scaring the hell out of me with his facial expressions and how he acted and delivered his lines. This is one of the few movies that I will get on DVD that I have seen recently because most of the movies that have come out in the past few years have been garbage, pretty much. The ending to this movie maybe the best that I have ever seen in a movie. I love this movie so much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching Donnie Darko many times over it finally hit me. I had tried to figure out what it was all about and I had some pretty good theories, I also read many of the other user comments trying to find more insight into this great film. When Donnie walks out of the theatre you see the second film on the Halloween Fright Night Double Feature is "The Last Temptation of Christ". After all the time travel theories, portals and time machines it became clear to me that DD is somewhat loosely based on Scorsese's Film. I haven't seen it in many years, but the whole part where Christ gets off the cross to go and live another life only to go back in time and back onto the cross as if he'd never left it - to save the world. Think about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" is enigmatic, yet ingenious. No film could better capture the turmoil or the apotheosis of a troubled teenage boy. Donnie's character may seem repugnant and insane at first, but we later realize that all of us have been through what he's been through: feelings of being unfairly judged, paranoia, depression, and self squabble. It shows what this judgmental, chauvanist society does to this innocent boy. Don't rent it unless you're prepared to have all the morals you were taught warped and rebuked. The acting is also wonderful. And the song at the end, Gary Jules' remake of Tears For Fears' "Mad World," is such a rapt, powerful work of music. Everyone should see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen a lot of films, of all genres and from all times, yet none have had me so involved in the plot, so completely enraptured in the lives portrayed, and sharing the various characters feelings of pain, joy, anguish and clarity, as Donnie Darko.It is perhaps the darkest comedy I have seen, and yet doesn't over-do it to the point of unbelievability. Teenage angst at his highest point in cinematography - no cheese, no cliches. A truly modern drama, with such touching emotional honesty from the whole cast. Truth at its most daring and despair at its most stark, beautifully contrasted with the purest love and such amazing clarity of feeling. Left me speechless, gasping for air in amazement, unsure whether I wanted to laugh or to weep.The final denouement of the tale creates a sense of such amazing clarity, beauty and sacrifice that just makes me want to cry even when just thinking about it.I think the last film that made me feel like that was probably American Beauty - Donnie Darko deserves at least the same amount of acclaim easily.I wish I was in a film like that.</fullReview>

We laughed so hard, we were practically rolling on the floor. My friend and I analyzed the ending for what seemed like forever.

		<fullReview>What a movie. I can see this is not for everybody. It takes some level of weirdness, intelligence and knowledge to accept this as entertainment. But if you have these characteristics, this is the best movie in years. It went straight in to my top 3 of all time favorite films. So many scenes I could watch a 1000 times. An example of a terrific scene: We watch Donnie go in to his school, all filmed in slow motion, by steadicam. All of it set to the Tears for fears song Head over heels. Watch this and see how it flows, perfectly in balance with the music. We see the girls outside practicing for the dance, which we see later on in the film. This is so brilliant, it's one of my favorite scenes ever.Some say this film is pretentious and incomprehensible. It's not. It is supposed to make you feel confused. But it has a heart, it has wit and takes you into an other world. Want pretentious? want witless? See Magnolia. P.T. Anderson: this is how it is done...A perfect 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had wanted to see this film since September 2002 and I finally got to see it in January 2003 when I cault one of only two showings at Gloucester's guild hall and it was worth the wait. This is the most brilliant and most confusing film I have ever seen and it is not like any other film I have seen. it stretches the bonders of fantasy and reality as well as dealing with teenage confession, love, life ,fear, and death. Written and directed by Richard Kelly and crated with an outstanding cast in 28 days with a tiny budget . Ultimately the story is about 15 year old Donnie darko played by Jake Gyllenhaal. Donnie is a complex, frightened and disturbed wacko ? Donnie also knows that in Twenty-eight days... six hours... forty-two minutes... twelve seconds the world will come to an end, he knows this because he was told by a six foot bunny rabbit called frank. Now you begin to understand the madness of this film but it is only after you have watched it do you begin to under stand the brilliants. If you see one film this decade please make it Donnie Darko .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that makes you think (for a change!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko has created quite an internet buzz and it deserves every good thing that is said about it, and some of the bad.This is Richard Kelly's first direction and he really outdid himself because he has a film that has comedy, horror, love, drama and more.The story follows Donnie around and shows that he's a little crazy, and generally not a great guy. He sleepwalks and sees a bunny rabbit named Frank that tells him the world is going to end in a month. Since he feels that Frank saved his life, he feels obligated to do what Frank wants him to.The story alone isn't what hooks the viewer. It's the overall visuals, the performances by the actors and the overall mood that is generated. Most of the movie is very dark, but not in a gory way. It just reflects the mood of the characters and the story it is telling.Some of the additional perks are the incredibly great soundtrack featuring Tears For Fears, Duran Duran and a wonderful cover by Gary Jules. The references to things from the late eighties are also very welcome and incredibly funny.Some will love the ending, others will hate it. But it really works as a topic of discussion. What else could one ask for? I love this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Hell of a Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely has a film touched me in such a way as "Donnie Darko". When I left the theater my friends and I were truly speechless. That's saying a lot considering that we always manage to critique films. The plot is very unique and well written, it is complicated at times but it's emotional direction and metaphorical richness never seems out of place. Many critics mistook these qualities as convoluted scripting and direction. I am lucky to be one of the people that "got" this great work.It is so peppered with psycosocial/sociopolitical references ranging from the obscure to obvious that it would take much analyis to identify them all i.e:trampoline Reagan mask=Gonzo journalism, Attitudinal Beliefs=pseudopsychology,The Evil Dead representing the trivial nature of fright whereas the schools social program overemphasizes the aspects of "Fear" ect. Elements of German Expressionism are prominent, as well as a strong undertones of Black Comedy, but this film breaks traditional categorization. "Donnie Darko" is truly an Avant-Garde work in a sea of films that are afraid to take risks and go in unconventional directions. I applaud all of the people who gave themselves to this project. Richard Kelly has shown great imangination and directorial skill and cinematic bravery. Drew Barrymore for having faith in the Script.The Gyllenhaals of course did an amazing job with the material. And finally much recognition should be given to Katharine Ross for coming out of retirement to add her great skill to this project. I apologize for this rather long winded review, but I truly feel the need to spread the word of this great film. Plus everyone should know that feces=baby mice!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching Donnie Darko for your first time is an enjoyable experience.Watching someone else watch if for their first time is even more fun!Without any expectations going in, I was pleasantly surprised at how brilliantly the film is pieced together and is polished so nicely. The soundtrack and musical selections were fantastic; I can't remember Tears for Fears songs sounding so good.For a first time director, there are some great shots, including a remarkable unbroken shot through the hallways of a private school, observing the observances of the staff and students as they all intermingle, with "Head Over Heels" loudly playing in the background. It has to be seen to be appreciated.The casting is perfect. Each actor and actress couldn't have been chosen any better. The entire Darko family just works. Jake Gyllenhaal has those dark cold eyes of a troubled teenager on a mission.Researching the creation of the film is quite interesting too...filmmaking on a budget...without everything and everyone falling into place the way it happened, this film might not have ever been made. It's a shame to think about all the films that would have been at this level of quality that have fallen through the cracks, without a Drew Barrymore to save it.A good film to study for starting filmmakers and DVD collectors, it gets better with each additional viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and I haven't done that since Charlotte died at the end of Charlotte's Web when I was seven. It's not like I think there is something profound here. The characters in this movie have a depth in an everyday life way. You get to know them as if you have lived in the neighborhood, and see them for a few minutes at a time throughout town at different parts of life. I felt there was a little clunky polarization of the whole liberal-conservative sorta bit, although that may have been intentional, like fear-love. I had wanted to see this movie since I heard the name of it when it was playing at the festivals a while back. I was gonna rent it, and buy it, but I was kinda sick of anything that took place at a highschool or where someone had to go to class and do homework-ugh. Then it came on cable last night! I am waiting for the DVD to be shipped to me because this is a movie worth watching over and over. I don't necessarily think there may be a "true" line to this story. I am reminded of the line, "In measuring a circle one begins anywhere". But I didn't feel like crying because of the death at the end (the final one), but because it's almost like a twisted Jimmy Stewart movie. I could say more, but that little bubble thing is leading me to a late night bath. Definitely a movie worth watching more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Was Awesome!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been a long time... I'd have to actually sit down and think about it... since a movie has touched me in such a profound way. A friend recommended it, and after her synopsis I thought, "A giant rabbit... riiiight!" Amazingly, the next day, I found it at K Mart on the bargain DVD rack. Sometimes you find some real surprises there! So, I got it... just over a week ago. And I can't stop watching it! I've probably seen it 10 times already! Donnie experiences a phenomenal occurence. Whether I would actually like to know "what might have been" is something I'm not quite sure about. Perhaps we're better off not knowing. Regardless, this is an amazing experience - to get to see, hear, feel... LIVE the chain of events that will occur based on one simple decision. Do I stay in bed and ignore the talking giant rabbit? Or do I follow him? I suppose some form of time travel must have occurred with the airplane, since there was no crash. The engine must have been hurtling through space and time, through one of Roberta Sparrow's worm-holes. Roberta Sparrow must have known about Donnie's experience - that's why she kept going to the mail box. Donnie is a tragic, yet heroic figure. In order to prevent all of these tragic events from unfolding, he must himself become a tragic event. But, in the process, is Jim's kiddie porn NOT uncovered? hmmmm I could go on and on about how much I love this movie, and how it has somehow awakened something in me... and I'd never get it quite right. I'll probably have to buy another copy if I continue watching mine over and over over! Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most poorly marketed movie of all-time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure the studio behind this was thinking "Scream" when they made trailers, posters, etc. But whoever they were, they made a huge mistake. Not only was the tagline (Dark, Darkest, Darko) the worst I may have ever read but I rejected this film more than once for the retarded poster alone. Thank god I was convinced (against my will) to see this amazing film. Razor sharp dialogue, an award-worthy cast (okay Drew Barrymore can't even slam a door convincingly but she did help the film get made), sci-fi camera tricks that enhance rather than disrupt the film. Somehow this potentially disturbing film is turned into a winning black comedy by its writer/director. He may never be able to top his debut but I certainly hope he does. Jake Gyllenhall launched his career from this film with good reason: He becomes Donnie completely. Maybe the highest compliment I can pay this movie is that it demands and deserves repeat viewings and after 3 times it hasn't disappointed yet.</fullReview>

However, the fact that I am STILL thinking about the picture seven days later would imply that this had a bigger effect on me than I at first imagined. Jake Gyllenhaal turns in an exceptional performance as the lead character, making the viewer feel exactly as he himself is feeling throughout the film. Add to this the sparkling inclusion (and inspired casting) of both Patrick Swayze and Drew Barrymore as sleazy self-help guru and schoolteacher respectively, as well as a breathtakingly original idea, cleverly shot and well scripted, and you will understand why "Donnie Darko" has achieved the acclaim it deserves. So far, I have given the movie 8 out of 10, but I'm beginning to think I should be nudging it up a notch, given the lasting impression it has made on me. We'll see...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To try and categorise 'Donnie Darko' is to limit its definition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You could be excused for feeling a sense of prejudged disappointment while walking into the cinema to watch 'Donnie Darko.' Besides, it is a low budget first attempt at movie making for writer/director Richard Kelly. I admit I did. And now I admit I was wrong. Very wrong.'Donnie Darko' is 'Donnie Darko'. I don't think I can make any other comparisons. 'Donnie Darko' must win the most original screenplay award. If it doesn't I would like to see what does. Kelly wrote this gem based in the eighties focusing on a main character (obviously Darko acted by Jake Gyllenhaal) who is either a future seeing hero, or a schizophrenic villian. He meets a new imaginary friend named Frank who is a six foot bunny rabbit. Sound strange, well that's just the beginning of a rollacoaster ride of an amazing screenplay. Frank's character being a rabbit might make this movie sound like it's a comedy, but it isn't, and in fact it works, with the scenes being very creepy and amazingly twisted which supports the possibility of Donnie suffering a mental illness.'Donnie Darko' isn't a comedy but it is comedic, it isn't a drama but it's dramatic, it isn't a thriller but it's thrilling. It even has a touch of science fiction. This movie is everything. Probably the most holistic effort I've seen. To try and categorise 'Donnie Darko' is to limit it's definition.Very deep, emotional, entertaining, intellectually stimulating, conversation starting piece of movie making. Great characters with great development. Great movie. I can't wait for Richard Kelly's next movie. This movie should have been on mainstream cinema. There is so much rubbish out there and in my opinion this is the best movie of 2002.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual and ambiguous film that has a lot to say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie a lot, because of the story and for its style, ambiguity, and filming techniques. Though not for everyone, this somewhat cynical story has much to say about a teenager who is dealing with his own fate. I think we can all get different meaning out of it, though, because everything is so complicated from the very start of the film.I don't want to be a spoiler, so if you haven't viewed the movie, please don't read on.To me, this seems to be a movie where the main character, Donnie Darko, must deal with his own fate ... the realization that he is dying and only has 28 days to "time travel" to his grave and accept his own death. There are also a lot of other stories within this story (i.e., youth rebellion, political and religious dichotomies, the American way of life, and simply the complications that come with being a teenager).The bunny Frank, I believe, helps carry Darko to his own destination ... his own death. When Darko finally kills Frank, he kills his own human existence and opens the "cellar door" to his own death.The reason I think Darko is really already dead after the fatal accident, which occurs in his own bedroom, is because his whole persona changes after this point. Before this point, he seems like your typical, rebellious teenager, calling his mother a "bitch" and arguing with his sister. Then, after the accident, he walks around almost like a zombie with a funny expression on his face. He acts silly, and nothing seems to bother him anymore. He also only starts taking his medication after the accident. But Darko having to deal with his own fate is juxtaposed with other themes, such as looks at American suburban life, teenage turmoil, and religious and political themes.Donnie wants to go back to his human existence but knows that he can't. Frank the bunny tells him the world is going to end in 28 days. Perhaps what Frank means it that Darko's world as he knows it is about to end.Perhaps this movie is also a look at our modern medical association and how rebellious and mildly depressed teenagers are viewed by our society. Is there really anything really wrong with Darko, or is he just your typical, pissed-off teenager who must go through the motions to figure things out for himself? After Donnie is already dead and takes his medication, that's when he starts drooling, a possible effect from his medication. He also stops acting like he did in the first five minutes of the film.This movie is really good. I liked how it is set in the 80s. It made me feel nostalgic. Everything-- the music, the fast-forward motion-- seems to coincide with the storyline. The fast forward motion seems to illustrate the routine motion of teenage school life with the same stereotypical students (i.e. the good kids, the bad kids, the picked-on kids) and teachers (the young, idealistic teacher versus the conservative, overbearing and even fanatical teacher).I gave this movie an 8/8. I watched it twice, but this movie is one of those films that you must watch several times, and every time you watch it, you will probably pick up something you hadn't before.</fullReview>

I'd put it up there with American Beauty.Most script writers know the basics of foreshadowing, setup/payoff and "make the audience wonder what the #&amp;* is going to happen next". Donnie Darko employs these techniques with such virtuosity that I was absolutely stunned. This film is destined for cult status (it's probably there already).

At its most complex: time travel &amp; messages from God.The film is ambiguous, but wonderfully so. We have no idea how Donnie does it, or if he even does. We don't know if Frank is God, with Donnie seeing his future through the humanly form of Frank.Yes, this movie is bizarre, but truly beautiful on every level.

		<fullReview>I almost stopped watching this film in the first few minutes, assaulted by the brash 80's music and bizarre visions. But I'm glad I stuck in there! Donny is a sweet, bright suburban teenager who just happens to be going completely insane. In fact, the whole world seems to be losing it. Early in the film, Donny's home is hit by a falling jet engine. Unfortunately, the FAA cannot find any record of a plane flying overhead at the time!Donny is tormented by evil visions, prophesying the End of the World. The film becomes a countdown to that date, as Donny's visions force him into more violent behavior, and the world itself seems to be rushing to some strange end. The film's finale is consistent, satisfying, and haunting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most amazing, unique, and creative film I have seen since Being John Malkovich</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very beautifully made film that is both visually and intellectually stimulating where the story is as compelling as the characters. To me this film is a work of art, and a true work of art appeals and revolts the viewers equally. Those people who found this movie dull or boring have every right to do so - it just didn't yank the right strings for you, I guess. But it is totally unfair for you to judge the people who liked it as dumb, juvenile, and tasteless. The same thing goes for those of us who call you too stupid to understand the movie.One thing everyone must realize - this movie is a total success, not because of whether it appeals to a certain audience, but because of the controversy and debate it stirred. Look at the 500 or so comments and all the discussion going on with this movie... I honestly have never seen such an overwhelming response for any other movie here on IMDB. Like it or not, this movie is a cult classic, and will be remembered for a very long time. No one in his/her right mind should call newcomer Richard Kelly a bad director - the worst thing that can happen to a bad director is that he/she does not get noticed, and Richard Kelly is the total contrary. Do not let your personal opinion blur this downright fact.***SPOILERS*** Now this movie does have its shortcomings, I agree... the part that bugged me the most about this movie is that crack-sniffing bully and his friend. Now this is supposed to be an ultra-conservative highschool where teachers are banned for teaching controversial material (Drew barrymore's character) and kids are suspended for swearing and calling teachers bad names in public (Donnie Darko himself), and these two punks just roam around the school with knifes and cocaine. The fact that they last in that school for anything over a half-a-day is completely beyond me. Other than that, the rest of the movie captured me like a kid in a candy store.I can't say I understood the movie completely, but this is the beauty of Donnie Darko. In my book, any movie that does all the thinking for you is a waste of time. (i.e. Die Another Day and many others)9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>new talent as exciting as the film is quality...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the films hilarious opening scenes through to its quiet conclusion, this film will take you on a ride that is emotional, heartwarming, deep and bizarre.Perhaps the film's greatest selling point is in Jake Gyllenhaal, the arrival of a true talent and an actor who is a joy to watch. He carries the film and barely puts a foot wrong in the varied demands the film makes of him. Praise must also go to writer/director Richard Kelly for crafting a unique experience which i defy anyone to not take something from.The plot, for what its worth, revolves around Gyllenhaal/Donnie's encounter with an "imaginary" rabbit called Frank who has come from the future to tell donnie that the world will end in 28 days - on hallowe'en, 1988. That's about as much as i want you to know, because the film rarely takes the path most expected - in fact, its almost impossible to figure out where the film might go.Along the way, there are musings on good and evil, fear and love, teeenage angst, space-time, fate, coincidence and sacrifice. And if it all sounds heavy - dont worry - its not. Which is what is so clever. First and foremost it is an entertaining film with interesting characters and good actors (Gyllenhaal and his real-life sister, Maggie, Patrick Swayze in the best form he's been for years, Drew Barrymore and an overlooked Noah Wyle in what could be one of the most important roles), but for those looking for a bit more, there's plenty to dig into.Certain scenes where Donnie is trying to act normal or fit in, or just express himself honestly are undercut with a dry wit seldom seen in american cinema - his scene in the park with Jena Malone is perhaps the comic high point - and the more bizarre aspects - his dealings with the eerie Frank - are strangely intense. A scene which starts and ends in a cinema screening of The Evil Dead is brilliantly handled, notching up tension and atmosphere, without getting in your face with it.The film for many will ultimately fail or succeed based on its final act, where all the strands are woven together and we slowly realise, as does donnie, what the meaning of everything is, both in the narrative and in life. While certain visual aspects may not blow you away, the style and simplicity of the storytelling means that its hard not to be engrossed and some might feel let down by an emotional pay-off rather than an effects bonanza. This isn't that sort of film. And its all the better for it. I loved every minute of it.And the eighties setting is wonderful, as is the soundtrack. Look out for references in the story style and design to Donnie Darko being a teenager's perspective version of ET. There is too much here to take in in one viewing. Do yourself a favour - go see it and see it again.*****/*****</fullReview>

His performance was not just excellent it was mezmorizing. God I couldn't even get up to go to the bathroom for fear of breaking the bond the film had made with me from the opening credits. #2: Interesting plot. Never had anything quite like this been made. It was a drama, a sci-fi, a dark comedy, a romance in the most subtle way. #3: The set, the darkness of a small suburban town. The darkness of suburban characters.

The descriptions were brief and somewhat misleading.Donnie Darko is a brilliant tribute to the 80s John Hughes movies aboutteenage misfits, but seen through an incredibly twisted lens. Thoughout the film the viewer is not entirely certain whether the protagonist is violently insane and heading towards a climactic bloodbath, or whether his hallucinations are in fact supernatural visions dealing with time travel. The movie is saturated withimages and music from the 80s which were incredibly funny and nostalgic, even while Donnie draws strange and delusional connections betweencommonplace events which may actually be omens or messages from anothertime or universe. The conclusion of the film is shocking and profound,attempting to answer theological questions without being preachy.I saw the film. It suddenly became one of my favorites instantly-- and I have a massive movie collection-- and I bought the DVD. Even having it on tape would be frustrating, because I knew that it would be a film to watch until the tape wore thin. It is both great filmmaking, and something which affected me very deeply.What is revealed on the DVD through the commentary and extras is that this film had a great deal more character development and the mythology of thesupernatural explanation of the film is extremely well developed. The pacing is dramatically improved and minor loose ends are resolved. After seeing theFellowship of the Ring extended edition only a month ago, I am convinced that a director's cut for this movie is in order.The cult status of this movie is growing by word of mouth, as I've experienced firsthand. And I'll bet they'd be eager to have a copy of this film shown the way it was intended, because there was clearly too much depth to be covered in twohours. Those two hours pass by in an instant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the most original films I have seen in a long time with a perplexing yet gripping narrative, superb acting and technically amazing, particularly the cinematography. Richard Kelly and Jake Gyllenhaal and definitely people to watch for the future. A film that will stay with you for a long time and one you need to see more than once in order to truly appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ONLY THEMATIC COMMENTS WITH SPOILERS, PART 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PART 2: **SPOILERS EVERYWHERE**That is the very general outline and now I'll get into it a bit more. The essence of what the film is about is summarized in the quote, `every body dies alone,' which is repeated throughout. What that means is that your death is only your own. No one can help you deal with it or help you understand it. DONNIE DARKO is about Donnie understanding and coming to terms with his own death. By the end of the film he sees the relevance of his death. As a result he ends up saving a lot of people's lives. The final shots of the film are brief cuts between faces of people that his death will affect. It is as if to say that all these people have no idea what a sacrifice he is making for them. One of the people whose face you see is Patrick Swayze's character. He happens to be crying, which again indicates that he is a sad and confused man rather than an evil person. Now the rabbit that visits Donnie has little to do with the character that Donnie kills later except to bridge the present with the eventual future (the same way the engine device does). The rabbit can be compared to the devil. He saves Donnie's life and as a result, Donnie listens to him unconditionally, before realizing that he has been fooled. I'm not sure about the old lady, but I think that she is a character that missed her chance to do what Donnie does at the end. Since she knows about the `time travel' she may have had a chance to use it, but chose not too. She has grown mad ever since. I cannot say anything about her definitely since I just did not pay enough attention to her story in my one viewing.So now the film takes on a few meanings. Donnie Darko is like a superhero (hence the name) because, using his powers (time travel), he saves the lives of many by sacrificing himself. Like any hero, he is an outsider with deep thoughts and doubts about his destiny. His character dying for the people in his community can also be compared to Jesus Christ dying on the cross for everyone (Only symbolically, I'm not saying that Donnie is Jesus' equal). Donnie dies so that people's lives can be preserved. He even dies for the flawed ones such as Patrick Swayze's character (who now can be seen as a sort of false prophet) just like Jesus died for sinners. The reason that I am comparing Donnie to Jesus is because there is a very specific and very obvious reference to Scorsese's THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST in the movie. Donnie walks out of a theater where THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST is playing right after the movie he is watching. The shot moves up from Donnie's face to the title up on the board. It's a pretty obvious juxtaposition. THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST has a similar plot structure. Jesus imagines himself getting off the cross and continuing a normal life. He eventually realizes that he has been fooled into doing this by the devil and returns to die on his cross as intended. It is a mental struggle inside Jesus' mind. This is why the rabbit that visits Donnie can be seen as the devil. He leads Donnie on the wrong path. Both films have key sequences at the end that evoke similar meanings. Jesus climbs back onto his cross and Donnie climbs back into his bed. Both have come to understand the importance of their death and are no longer scared to die. But don't get me wrong. You do not need to have seen THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST in order to understand DONNIE DARKO. The reference is probably only the director's way of quoting his influence. Others have pointed out some references to Faust, which could lead a discussion in a similar direction.Having said all that, I did like the movie. I do not think it is genius as it is nothing revolutionary and does have some holes. My main complaint is that while the atmosphere is out of a David Lynch film, the dialogue (like about the Smurfs) often seems to be Tarantino-like, and the actual themes that the film raises are seriously dramatic rather than scary as the atmosphere implies. It's a little bit messy. The ending does not come out of nowhere as it fits in fine with what has been built up, but the atmosphere created throughout most of the movie conceals what is significant. If you want to see a film that deals with the issues of fate, identity, and sacrifice more head-on, see THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST. In my tedious explanation of the themes in DONNIE DARKO, I regret that I did not even get into what the movie's good qualities are, such as Richard Kelly's direction (for the most part; some complaints above). More important than all my answers and opinions are the questions that the movie raises. For example: Did Donnie actually decide that he should die, or was that predetermined fate anyway? I think I know what the movie says, but I don't know if I will watch it again any time soon to review my thoughts. Any movie that inspires some debate and discussion can't be bad. It made me write way more than I should have. I give it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ONLY THEMATIC COMMENTS WITH SPOILERS, PART 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PART 1: **SPOILERS EVERYWHERE**I have decided to write a thematic explanation to DONNIE DARKO since I was not satisfied with the majority of the user comments I have seen. Because I have only seen the movie once, this is not a definitive discussion of every single element of the film. And since after I began to write it became difficult to stop, I have written a little too much. For those who give a s**t about my ramblings, this lengthy comment comes in two parts that should be on the same page.I am always pretty disappointed to read comments of angry viewers screaming about how a movie makes no sense and therefore it is bad, or it is weird for weird's sake, or that people who like it don't understand it either. You couldn't be more wrong. Just because you don't understand it, doesn't mean that other people (whose intellects must be far inferior to yours) don't understand it either. Of course, I'm not saying that everyone who thinks that DONNIE DARKO is a bad movie is wrong. I'm saying that anyone who says that it is a bad movie without understanding it is wrong. On the other hand, there are people that believe it to be the greatest film ever made, comparing it to other works of genius such as MEMENTO or FIGHT CLUB. Those are certainly good films, but if you think that those are the best ever made then you still have a lot more movies left to watch. Plenty of great films were made before 1999, believe it or not. Many also hail DONNIE DARKO as genius without really understanding it. How do you know that you are not watching a Nazi propaganda film that just happens to have a `cool' style? In their defense, they are at least open-minded enough to respond to it even if they don't fully understand it. They are accepting it as something artistic rather than dismissing it immediately without thinking about it.Now I'll get into DONNIE DARKO. I have seen the movie only once, but I have thought out the themes well enough to write about them, I think. First of all, I will not try to explain the logistics of every single plot point since the film has some surreal moments that are meant to symbolize states of mind rather than physical actions. For example, I do not care how exactly Donnie Darko travels through time. It might only be inside his mind, or he might actually be moving physically. It may have been that he went back in time at the end of the film to make things right, or that he went into the future at the beginning to see what might happen if he survives. It is not important. Movies like this are not puzzles where every piece must fit. I think this film is pretty easy to understand as long as you try to find themes and understand the characters.Donnie is clearly a thoughtful outsider in his school. He is not a genius, or nerd, or an average person, or the most popular kid. He is an outsider that thinks about his place in the world. He is visited by a creepy looking bunny that saves his life. As a result, Donnie feels that he owes the rabbit something. He carries out destructive deeds, which the rabbit asks for, without even thinking about the consequences. It is not a `cool' thing when Donnie floods the school or burns down Patrick Swayze's house. Even if Swayze's character had child porn in his house that does not necessarily make him an evil person. He is a confused character that tries to guide people along some religion that he himself does not follow. As the movie progresses, Donnie continues to do harmful things including killing a person. When loved ones around him start dying, he begins to understand that his survival eventually lead to more harm than good. He travels back in time (physically, mentally, in his dream, whatever) because he knows that he should die as intended.End of Part 1, look for Part 2, if you care!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read a lot of reviews of this film. Some adore it, and some hate it and loathe it and want to destroy it and warn off the rest of the world from wasting anytime with this "stupid movie for stupid people." These people seem full of anger at something...and as for the person who said that he didn't want to have to THINK too much about a movie, he just wanted to ENJOY it...oh boy.I loved this movie. This movie has layers, and the fact that it keeps you thinking long after the final credits is testament to a director who wasn't "too lazy to come up with an ending" as one particularly intelligent reviewer said. It makes you think, and it certainly makes you want to watch it again, as each time, a little bit more of the puzzle is revealed. This isn't a quick fix. If you're after a dumb movie that make two hours fly by, go rent Rush Hour 2.Some people are offering explanations for what it all means, and I think thats great. I have a few theories but the fact that I'm still thinking about it just lets me know that this movie is staying with me, long after the memories of some recent films have long gone.If you like to be challenged, or presented with something original and thought provoking, give it a go...you may not like it, or it may become one of your favourite movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, what can be said about this movie? Is it good...? I would have to say yes, but doing so I don't necessarily mean that the movie is good. This is more of an experience. I've been thinking about it now for a couple of hours, because when the end credits came I just sat up in my chair and asked out loud "But what's the point, what is the message?" There was just so many pieces that didn't fit together for me. Then I found the homepage. Although it is almost as confusing as the movie it did however provide me with some answers. (Now, don't visit the page until you've seen the movie). The fact that the movie is so closely tied to the webpage bothers me... alot! I still haven't figured it out 100%. And from what I'm told the director did make this blurry ending on purpose so that the audience had to ponder upon it. I like when a movie gets the old brain to work, but at the same time I'm not entirely happy when it gets too twisted. I think the hints from the webpage should have been incorporated into the movie, because the clues in the movie just isn't enough by a longshot. Besides that, it's intelligent, has good (not great, but solid) acting, that eerie feeling that mixes American Beauty with 13th Floor and Memento. And I even see some Lynch and Cronenberg related things in it. Will you like it? I'm not sure, but you should definitely see it! But remember, this is bigger than just the movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A definite multi-view film(SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a dark edgy Sci-Fi masterpiece that has to be viewed at least twice to be fully appreciated. An excellent cast led by bright new talent Jake Gyllenhall take you on a journey that will bewilder and beguile you only to leave you with a totally ambigious ending. This may not sound like a compliment but it is. This is one of the few films I have ever seen that left a lot of the conclusion to your own imagination. Is Donnie some kind of saviour sent by God to right a Universe that has lost it's way? Is he crazy? Was it all a dream of an alternate future? Who controls Donnie's (and all of our) destinies? Does he have any choice but to take his final act of self-sacrifice? This is the kind of film that should make $100 million dollars and it's a real shame that it didn't receive the kind of support that it deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most pleasant surprises of last few years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I had no idea when I was starting watching this film what it will be about. I only heard somewhere that it's a good movie. I didn't know anything about the director,cast or the plot. From the title I supposed it might just be another stupid teen-comedy. How totally I was astonished! All kudos should go to the first-time director (and screenwriter as well) who in some intelligent and charming way done this uniqe movie. The plot of the movie is a real awesome puzzle as the story runs towards the end of the movie. On the other side the director couldn't handle all this without some magnificent cast. Jake Gyllenhaal's title role is one of the best young actor-role in recent history. Playing a boy with some real problems with his personality he gave us some haunting and mature performance. Right next to him is awesome young actress Jena Malone, which amazing talent we could see f.i. in Contact as young Ellie Arroway. There is a magical "chemistry" between Gretchen Ross(Malone) and Donnie when we see their relationship on the screen. The director shows an impressive sensivity while filming those scenes. Gyllenhaal and Malone are supported by some old veterans like Mary McDonnell, Katherine Ross and Patrick Swayze in very not-in-his-style role. The strong vocals used in score of the film (piece "Ave Maria") make this movie both unforgettable and moving. The picture also brings us a great feeling of the 80's (the time setting of the film) also by using the songs from those times. We've got to do here also with time travels and problem of our destination, but I won't reveal anything here about that :) .The brilliant combination of sci-fi and romance led this film straight to the bests of just begun decade. The next day after watching it I must see again some key-scenes to partly understand the amazing idea created by Richard Kelly, and right now I'm not sure of understanding every detail of this incredible story, because my mind is still full of questions. I'm looking very much forward to the next film of Richard Kelly, who did here some ethereal job. I'm recommending this one for everybody who are searching some really true emotions in cinema, not only f/xs and shootouts which feed us today's movies. And sometimes it is really worth not seeing any trailers and knowing anything about the movie. I consider this one along with Memento and A.I. as the best picture of 2001. Truly memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DAMN good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read through the comments for this film and feel that a lot of people don't understand that perhaps not every (supposedly) good, thought-provoking, intelligent film is going to appeal to them. I myself felt cheated slightly (and confused greatly) by the ending the first time I saw this film but on a second viewing I believe that I, like others, had missed the point. The ending is deliberately ambiguous and confusing because the director wants you to think about the film as a whole and ponder on what might have happened.Anyway, enough mock-intelligent waffle. I loved this film and thought Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was fantastic. Despite being moderately sane, I was able to relate to a Donnie portrayed as a misunderstood, depressed teenager (can't we all!) and thought the family interplay was excellent. The arguments with his sister (interestingly enough played by his real-life big sis in case you hadn't already noticed) were believable but in other scenes it is clear that they really do care and are perhaps quite close. Donnie's mother is an amusing character, especially when paired with the stereotypically repressed Christian, Kitty Farmer, whose intensely conservative (and often incredibly naive) views lead to some hilarious play between her and the other adults.Drew Barrymore and Noah Wyle also give good performances in surprisingly small roles as two teachers who try to give a little more to their pupils than the designated curriculum. Barrymore's character has an interesting way of finding the new girl a seat...I would give this movie ***** but can see how many people would be put off. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a film which requires your full attention throughout, e.g. Memento, Twelve Monkeys, Apocalypse Now [Please note, I make no comparisons between Donnie Darko and any of these films]. However, those who prefer less complicated and psychological films probably wouldn't enjoy this. "C'est la vie", as the Germans say...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the year's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They say that the sign of a good movie is that you're still thinking about it after the credits have rolled. I was certainly thinking about this film after it ended - what had happened? Had the schizophrenice Donnie imagined the evetns of had he travelled back in time to make the ultimate sacrifice?This film is both excellently written and directed by Richard Kelly, some of the highlights of the script include a discussion of the sex-life of smurfs and a scene in which one of the characters gives Donnie a cigarette and says 'good s***, huh?' To which Donnie replies ' Its a f***ing cigarette.' The film's dark atmosphere is reflected in the filming techniques, casting a lot of the screen in shadow.The characters are all believable and identifiable. In particular, Beth Grant's psychotically conservative, god-loving Mrs Farmer. One of her best lines is when she tells Donnie's parents during a meeting with the principal that 'he told me to forcefully place it in my anus!' and Donnie and his father find it hard not to laugh. Again, Donnie's mother's frustration as she deals with this woman is fun to watch. Donnie's guardian angel, Frank the Bunny is chilling, from his terrifying mask to his rough voice. 'why do you wear that stupid bunny suit?' 'why do you wear that stupid man suit?' Drew Barrymore and Noah Wyle convey their characters well as great teachers struggling to teach their kids something beyond the prescribed syllabus and risking their jobs in the process and Patrick Swayze as an oh-so-eighties self-help guru with a chilling secret. Finally, the performance from Jena Malone as Donnie's bored, depressed girlfriend Gretchen Ross is excellent.The story begins when Donnie is guided away from his house by an apparition called Frank the Bunny on the second of October 1988 and is told that there are 28 days left before the world ends. He returns home to find that the engine of a plane has fallen in to his bedroom. The bunny has saved his life. From them on, he does what his guardian angel tells him to do and tries to discover as much about himself and about time travel as he can before the world ends.After the credits had rolled, I interpreted this film as the opposite of 'its a wonderful life'. I can not go into any more detail about this without spoiling the movie for me. What I will say is, do yourself a favour and see this film. It is one of the year's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, something can only be considered to be a great work of art when it is loved and loathed in equal measure. After reading some of the comments on this site, I think that Donnie Darko falls into this category.Some people have called this film David Lynch-lite, which is fairly misleading. I think that DD is a much more interesting film than Mr. Lynch's last effort and all the more impressive considering it is the director's first film.The nods to 80's culture (loved the E.T references - especially considering Barrymore's involvement with the film), sci-fi, horror, time travel, fate, religion and black comedy make this one the most interesting genre bending films I've seen since Ghost Dog.The best advice for anyone watching this film is to suspend disbelief and make your mind up after the credits have rolled.Highly recommended - 5/5</fullReview>

This movie is very similar to Mullholland Drive, there is no straight line.There are two diffrent time lines.Donnie survives "The accident" and has a month to live his life in a diffrent way, because Donnie is going to die. Time is always coming back to point one. And a month later, when the "The accident" accurs again, time takes it course...I _STRONGLY_ recommend this movie, the soundtrack to this movie is also excellent. Gary Jules version of "Mad World" in the end is such a great finish of the movie.If you diden't enjoy the movie, watch it again. And again. Trust me. You will love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After waiting way to long to see this movie, its questions and amazing performance by Jake Gyllenhaal still cling to my thoughts days later.DD is a genre flouting cross between Jacob's Ladder, Twin Peaks and Pretty N Pink. The biggest reason to see this piece is Jake Gyllenhaal. His astonishingly subtle and layered performance of Donnie Darko is what drives the rest of the movie's intensely different plot and makes it credible. In the hands of a less skilled actor..this movie would go from thought provoking to camp in no time flat. Donnie Darko is a troubled teenager, possibly going mad, trying to deal with adolescence in the late go-go 80's. He lives in suburbia utopia hell with his parents and sisters. Plagued by mental illness and a past criminal record, Donnie is in therapy. Jake Gyllenhal's Donnie is beautiful, sad, sinister and goofy all at the same time. He has been informed of the end of the world by a giant imaginary rabbit who diverts Donnie from and untimely death. In exchange Donnie must follow the rabbit's orders...after that the plot becomes continually strange and twisted and you are left wondering if Donnie is mad, awake, asleep or hallucinating...or perfectly sane and touched by God or other higher powers. There is a romantic sub plot involving the talented Jena Malone which makes Donnie more sympathetic and tragic at the same time. He is the flawed hero and Gyllenhaal is intensely charismatic conveying that aspect. While this film is not for everyone, it is thought provoking, well writing and well made...and very strange. That's what I liked about it.and the jokes about the smurfs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now THIS is the kind of originality 90% of modern films are lacking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film gets a lot of bad press, largely from those who do not understand it. The critics, on the other hand, loved it, and for once, are bang on target. Donnie Darko is a masterpiece.I'm not going to rabbit (sorry, bad pun) with the basic plot here, as it's already been done in so many reviews, and really, the less you know the better. I'm also not going to put forward my own spoiler laden interpretation of the film: this is truly one which I believe all should take their own thoughts on, not to be influenced by another's.But what I am going to say is that Donnie Darko is easily one of my favourite films of the last 10 years. Virgin director Richard Kelly has created here a masterpiece that is equal parts hillarious and depressing, bitingly funny and traumatically sad. Through his utterly believable, and bluntly real, characters, he manages to almost make you believe in theories you might normally ridicule. Add to this a plot so far warped it'll leave you thinking for (literally) weeks afterwards, and some truly memorable scenes, and you have got what is that rare thing, a real achievement in film. Take what you will from this film, con yourself into thinking you fully understand Kelly's own intention for the film's meaning, or even spend weeks musing over it like I did, but watch it unbiased, don't expect too much or too little. Donnie Darko is so open to interpretation that one should watch it with a completely free mind.A like it or loathe it achievement, Donnie Darko is a film you just have to watch. I love it, but I don't want to sway you, go watch it yourself and see what you think. And whether you leave gobsmacked or asleep from boredom remember you only have 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds to live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a haunting, genre bending masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On registering my vote for this film I noted with disbelief that a small minority of viewers had rated it as a 1. The most likely cause of this is the confusion caused by the lack of answers to the myriad of puzzles that the film provides. However it is this very ambiguity which adds depth to the film, forcing us to think hard to decipher the labyrinth of themes that we are presented with. The complex plot subverts genre as it tracks the delusions of the titular anti-hero, Donnie Darko, a disaffected, schizophrenic teenager in late 1980s America. One of Donnie's visions caused by his illness is of a giant demon rabbit called Frank who saves his life before telling him that the world is soon going to end. Donnie is then forced by Frank to perform tasks for him as we count down the days until the apocalypse. Here begins an engrossing discourse on fear, destiny, time travel, society and the complexity of life (something that those confused 1 star voters missed) that manages to capture the horror of Donnie's mind and yet is both darkly comic and emotionally engaging. This is in part down to Jake Gyllenhaal who is fantastic as Donnie, instilling in his odd ball character a sympathetic side to counteract his weirdness and alienation. Newcomer Kelly's direction creates a film that looks superb and has an eerie feel to it. These qualities, aided by the fact that we are never sure of ourselves during and after the movie, create a film that keeps you thinking and haunts you long after it has ended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko took over a year to reach us in Oz. Its a shame because not only is an extremely original film, but up there with the best films release of the year.Its everything Vanilla Sky tried (and failed) to be... Its a mindf**k that doesnt let go and has a twist that, unlike Vanilla Sky, works even if you have to suspend some disbelief.Kudos to Drew Barrymore and her 'Flower Films' for helping get this mini-masterpiece out to an audience who wants more than just remakes and high concept films.What a debut from Richard Kelly. I can't wait for him to make another movie. Lets hope it doesnt take as long to get here as Donnie Darko did.*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The script, the cast, and the soundtrack are all superb! A perfect first effort from director Richard Kelly! Can't wait to see Kelly's future projects! Too bad when "Darko" was first released theatrically, it received little press, had poor marketing, and was poorly distributed. But "Darko" has found a home in DVD (I now got a copy), and it's one of those films that lives on through word-of-mouth. Tell all your friends!If it's your first time seeing "Darko", please be sure to wait for the whole story to unfold, and you will not be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best movie I have seen in a very long time. As a connoisseur of films of substance this one surely suited my taste. This film combined the right amount of humour with darkness, and I was brought up and down emotionally at every turn of events. I was waiting on the edge of my seat to see what would happen next. This was an unpredictable film, and the turn of events kept me interested throughout. The acting was of a very high quality and Jake Gyllenhaal was well cast as the character of Donnie Darko. The plot intertwines well and I was left with a lot to think about. The only downside of this film is the ending. As the film is so enthralling up until the end you are left to linger with a disappointing ending that you wanted to answer some more of your questions. Its subtlety does not quite fit with the rest of the tone of this movie. This has to be one of my top ten movies</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie is a troubled young man.He's on medication and visits a psychiatrist;Oh,and he occasionally is visited by a six foot rabbit... This debut feature from Richard Kelly is a masterpiece,bordering on genius.It somehow manages to mould together so many genres without any of them interfering;With an overall sense of doom and gloom,you get romance,comedy,drama,sci-fi with a good chunk of 80's high school fun.There are so many things to look out for,It raises so many questions and really does get you thinking.The story begins with Mr.Darko being called outside his house in the dead of night by a mysterious voice,who turns out to be Frank the rabbit.He simply tells him that the world is going to end.Shortly after whilst out sleepwalking,a jet engine falls out of nowhere and lands on the Darkos' house.Right where Donnie should be sleeping. As the film unfolds,Frank visits Donnie a few more times,only to coax him into performing some random acts of violence which in turn have a significant effect on Donnie and the people he knows.But throughout all this,theres a sense of desperation within him to find out what it all means and,most importantly,whats going to happen.Where this film succeeds the most is how we,the viewer become so involved with Donnies life,you will wonder what he wonders and you will be just as confused.Not only that,but all actors are so convincing we're all captivated by all the other characters in the film.The direction is flawless,with the unique angles Kelly uses in some scenes and the way hes captured the films beautiful look,it just makes you feel really good whilst watching it.The use of 80's music to set the scene is very fitting.Each song sounds as if it was written specifically for this film.While it will impress many though,it will confuse the hell out of others.You cant simply watch the film,it needs to be worked out and even when it ends you're still left scratching your head for a long time after,possibly enough to encourage you to go see it a second time. In closing,Donnie Darko is one of the most engagingly beautiful films ever produced.It will leave you in a dreamlike state with all sorts of questions about where life is going and what if you chose a different path in life?Given a wider theatrical release,this could well be the top of many film lovers' lists.Something that has to truly be seen to be believed.</fullReview>

Dark, very Dark not everyone will like it, for some it will just be a blank of nothingness but for the people who truely understands life and enjoy the beauty of art, this will be the ticket for the best ride this year. I really love everything about it, the ending was sad and strange but I am sure it has it's value and meaning. Wouldn't mind Richard explaining it to me through. Ohh for for those who have seen it, please tell me you wanted Donnie to kill that stupid teacher? The one Donnie told to stick The Fear and Love line up her anus?

		<fullReview>This is one of those love it or hate it scenarios. I don't think I've read a single review so far saying it was only okay (although some people seem a bit confused and didn't know what to think). Personally, I loved this film.My friend had given away the ending but it didn't spoil it one bit. In fact, it helped me to understand about 99% of the film because it helped me to notice all the little things that contributed to the end. I saw the film last night with two friends, one being the person who told me the ending, and he said he understood it more the second time when he knew what was going to happen.The film is wonderfully structured, brilliantly written and directed and I can't think of a single bad performance. It is also one of those one in a million films which has pretty much everything in it; Sci-Fi, comedy and fantasy mainly but there are also moments of love, hate, violence and tragedy. You can't put this film into one single genre.So even if you absolutely despised this film, one day, when you've nothing better to do, make the time to see it again. Although I haven't seen it twice myself (I had the advantage of already knowing the ending), I'm pretty sure you will enjoy the film more the second time. I hope I will because I am definitely getting this on DVD.</fullReview>

Whatever you do, SEE THIS FILM.It deals with the very difficult subjects of mortality, mental illness, and - of all things - time travel skillfully, beautifully and with a sense of humor.I will be very surprised if this doesn't win at least one oscar. In my view it deserves best screenplay, best actor and best cinematography. Every scene made me want to cry with delight, every item is so perfectly placed, every line of dialogue perfectly executed. Not a second is wasted.Donnie Darko has shot straight to the top of my top 10 movies of all time. SEE THIS FILM.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was one of the best I've seen in a long while. It woke me up from the first scene. " This was different". And it certainly was. And i mean that in the most complimentary way possible, for this film is not to missed.It starts with Donnie (Gyllenhaal) waking up in the middle of the road, his bicycle tossed to the side, with a complete confused and disorientated look on his face. He's been sleepwalking again. And so begins the rollercoaster of confusion, fear, love, hilariously dark humour, and sorrow. This movie truly does have everything, in all senses of the word. The camera work is innovative and mysterious, and it features some superb performances from Gyllenhaal, who simply IS Darko.A definite must-see, whoever you may be, refreshing and thought provoking, you will be amazed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw 'Donnie Darko' on Friday night.I can say with absolute certainty that I have never been as blown away by a film as I am by 'Donnie Darko.'In fact I went back to the cinema on Saturday afternoon and saw it for a second time. It's that good. Like 'Fight Club', it's definitely the sort of film where a second viewing is really beneficial.  I went in knowing little to nothing about this film, and that's the best way to approach it. The less you know about 'Darko', the better your enjoyment of the film will be. This is the sort of film that doesn't treat it's audience like children. It doesn't provide a simple story, it doesn't offer up any easy answers. This is the sort of brave and innovative filmmaking that makes up for all the insipid 'paint-by-numbers' films that have become standard multiplex fare. It's this sort of film that restores your faith in cinema. Every performance here is no less than first class, every moment no less than totally engaging. If there were any semblance of logic in the world then this movie would be #1 at the box office. 'Donnie Darko' is a cryptic, haunting gem of a movie that will stay with you long after the final credits roll.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had no idea what this movie was about before watching it, had only heard it recommended, and was plesantly surprised. And it isn't without some flaws, but it's a pretty good film. Jake Gyllenhaal is really good in this, bringing to life such a disturbed character. And, by the way, how can you not be totally creeped out by that freaky bunny that looks so much like a bug??? The rest of the acting is all pretty good, even from the people you so wouldn't expect it from, like Patrick Swayze and Drew Barrymore. The story's good also, it has some kinks that probably could've been worked out (like most of the ending which becomes kind of goofy until you realize what's going on, and then you're just like "oh." nothing big), but for the most part it works. The directing and overall execution is very well done too.In conclusion, Donnie Darko is not a film for every, that's the kind of good it is. Great acting, good story, very good execution. Would recommend. 3 out of 5 stars. EDIT AFTER SEVERAL VIEWINGS: 5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

This movie is so deep that it took my Philosophy prof 6 times to even begin to comprehend the deepest darkest points of this movie. The director does a great job of setting up Donnie's life. Although most people see this movie as a bleak movie, I see it as a hopeful one. The ending brings hope to me. This movie is genre bending because it has every element of horror, sci-fi, comedy, psychological thriller, and action movie. It is so hard to classify, that walking into 5 different stores, it was placed in 5 different categories. I recommend this to anyone who wants a thrill ride through the human psyche and wants to experience the darkest parts of the human experience. Dark, Darkest, Darko!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny and modern Faust .. and more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is something else. It's very funny, it's deep, it's well acted, and everything fits some way or another. It is in no way forced, too obvious or, worse, too philosophical. Still, it is pure literature. The story is about a high school boy, Donnie, who suffers from hallucinations about a huge rabbit ('Frank') telling him how to act and what to do. Frank is also predicting the end of the world. There are so many layers in this movie that it's impossible to mention them all. The story follows, in one way, the classical tragedy of Faust, who wants to learn more than book-wisdom with the help of the Devil. (There are clear references to Goethe's Faust in the movie: Donnie's girlfriend is called Gretchen and the final episode takes place at Halloween, at midnight. You should find out all the allusions for yourself.) However, this movie is more than 'just' a search for the meaning of life. It is a search for the role of time in our lives, for the meaning of love, of human company, of society in our time. It also offers an interesting retrospective at the 80s. It is, most of all, a searching for, and finding of, Fate. Go see this very original and wonderful movie, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i was dissapointed to see how many positive remarks there were regarding this movie. donnie darko is mostly just poorly writen, but that's hard to ignore in film. i can possibly see how the high school young, and people with no ability to be objective might like this for it's basic hollywood entertainment, but it just didn't add up.there were so many problems with the script! like what about the plane and the space travel idea: wouldn't his mom and sister have been sent through the portal, and not donnie?**just to throw it in** drew barrymore's part was obvious: executive producer wants a role(enter pout) lets just stick her in there! she added nothing-but she rarely does.basiclly, the whole thing seems to ride on the hope that the public won't try to put the puzzle together, and just accept it for visually entertaining--and it was visually entertaining, but that's all. and that would be ok if everyone took it as just that instead of tring to claim it's a great film (ahem, piece of art)...whatever.watch it if you want to, it's got good parts...but you've been warned.(enter dungen theme music:dom-dom-douuummmmm)i did however like his imaginary friend being a huge rabbit, i.e. harvey the giant pooka ;}</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see so many perfect ratings and rave reviews. These people are either very bias or total liars. I can see why this might shine at an independent film festival, but it does not hold its own when pitted against the world. "Odd" does not mean "good".Camera work was decent.Acting sucked, especially Donnie. Mary McDonell is the only one that carried her weight at all.Script and story sucked. The writing tries too hard to make too many trite philosophical statement in the film. The moments when Donnie was supposed to be the misunderstood genius, I thought he sounded like a doped-up highschooler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this as a preview showing at the frightfest festival in London and I can't wait to see it again.It's an emotional ride, beautifully told with a wonderful soundtrack and great acting. But you cannot believe anything I say here. For I am in love. It happened once before, when I saw Requiem for a Dream, but luckily I'm not a monogamist and I can love them both.I must admit I almost didn't see it. Six foot tall bunnies and timetravel are not good selling points with me, but it seems right somehow. Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect as Donnie Darko and I will be sure to keep my eye on what Richard Kelly (director) does next.See it if you like something different. If you want an original experience. An experience I cannot recommend highly enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interpretations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The obligatory stuff: This movie was fantastic -- the screenplay, the cinematography, the acting, the use of FX, the absolutely chilling and beautiful score by a first time movie composer, and an altogether great job put together by first time writer/director Kelly. The fact that this movie was made for about 4.5 Million is amazing enough -- it looks like it cost ten times that much, and many of the older and more "experienced" directors could learn a thing or two.Now to the interpretations: I've seen this movie 7 times -- twice in theatres, three times at home (both commentaries and the movie itself) and twice at two different friends' house.The first time I'd seen it, I immediately thought I had "gotten it." This was with a small group of friends, which was stumped but not unimpressed by the film. My first interpretation was a bit more elaborate and complex; to me it was a story about possibility, two different time lines and two different outcomes -- both in which the main character was doomed (this I picked up from a conversation between two characters early in the movie) and about learning to accept fate -- a fatalistic outlook, if you will. This would seem a bit downbeat and overcomplicated, not to mention confusing, but I didn't feel that way at all -- instead, there was a glimmer of hope at the end, Donnie laughing in bed, the little wave, the general tone of the whole movie, and especially the score -- which sounded intensely religious and fatalistic, but is not without that important flit of hope. That was just the first viewing.The second viewing was different, because this time I went in much more alert to the subtle hints dropped. My second interpretation: two possibilities -- one in which the protagonist lives his life as a normal member of society and dies at the end, and one in which he sleepwalks and escapes certain doom at the cost of endangering everyone around him. This time, the time travelling seemed like a conscious decision made by Donnie. Hints I picked up: Mention of Deus Ex Machina, "They are in great danger" says Frank, "I have the power to build a time machine", and again, the laughing in bed at the end.Then I didn't see it for another five months, until it came out on dvd. I watched it again, and pretty much got a combination of the first two interpretations -- although I didn't so much focus on the plot as I did the subtle details -- Frank driving off in the morning -- and the overall atmosphere of the whole thing. I probably liked it the most this viewing.Then, inevitably, I listened to the commentary, both of them, and scoured the website for more evidence. As clearly as I can piece it together the movie is about changing the past to put right the future -- the movie takes place primarily in a parallel universe that has been thrown off course and will ultimately collapse if Donnie does not die -- something he is destined to do. Frank the Bunny is a vessel used by some greater power (aliens? god?) to guide Donnie so that everything is set up just right for him to fix the fluke. If you have a chance, take a look at the "Philosophy of Time Travel" piece. The other charcters are also guides, being manipulated so as to help Donnie fix the world. The ending, according to Kelly, has two possibilities -- that Donnie is laughing because he REMEMBERS everything and thinks it was just a bad dream, or Donnie understands and accepts his fate. The jet engine, as Kelly explains, is an artifact, and the only remnants of a collapsed universe -- something, explained in "The Philosophy of Time Travel", happens every time a human being is called upon to fix a fluke that involves that very person. There is so much more, that I won't go into, that is available on the website, the dvd and the commentaries.Don't be pompous and assume you know exactly what happened, like Lynch, Kelly is masterful at creating a very involving tale whose denouement is as open as it is compelling and beautiful. People who think the ending is muddled or founders should be shot -- speilburg makes movies that overexplain, you won't find that here, and that is simply Kelly's way of saying he respects you.By the way, one of my favorite lines in the movie is when Jim Cunningham is being arrested and he exclaims "you are a product of fear!" which is a bit difficult to hear in the theatres and on Dvd if you don't crank up the volume.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most original movies that I've ever seen Donnie Darko is one of thost few and far between movies that are truly different. I remember going to Thomas Video and going to retn this and it was always out. People there would always talk about the movie and I never heard anyone say anything bad about. When I finally did get to rent this movie, I found that it is truly amazing. I like the mystery of the plane engine and the weirdness of the movie, but I also thought that Patrick Swayze was really funny in this.Some people might not take this movie seriously. Oh some movie about a 6 foot rabbit. No, it is so much more than that. It is very tragic. But also very intriguing. Who is Frank? What does he look like under the rabbit suit? Why is Donnie having these dillusions? These are some of the questions you will have as you go through the movie. But after seeing this movie, the first question you will have is why didn't I see it sooner?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time travelling and destiny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This a great movie about time traveling and destiny. In the movie we follow Donnie Darko during, what he believes to be, the last few days of the existence of the world. During these days he is accompanied by a rabbit he tells him how to spend his last days on earth.Spoiler-------This movie really is about how Donnie beliefs he should spend his last few days on earth. In reality the rabbit is Donnie. The rabbit is the vessel that Donnie chooses to travel back in time. He does this to teach himself to travel in time. This skill will allow him to fulfill his destiny. That is, to find his soul-mate and reaffirm the relationship with his mother. See, if one can travel in time, then it does not matter when one acquires this skill, because you can travel in time. Donnie uses this irregularity of time traveling to fulfill his destiny.Donnie dies due to an airplane engine falling on his house. Nobody seems to know where the engine comes from, but in reality the engine also comes from the future. In the last few minutes we see his mother and little sister in an airplane that experiences turbulence of some sort. Most viewers think that the airplane is a vessel that allows them to travel in time. But this is not the case. We do not this in the movie, but in reality his mother (and probably his little sister as well) dies in an airplane crash in the future. This is why she is not upset that Donny has died. She understands that he has fulfilled his destiny in life.The rabbit steers Donnie during his last few days in his life. The rabbit is Donnie himself. God has allowed Donnie to go back in time and extent his life in order to let destiny prevail. 'Grandma Death' knows how to time travel. In reality she has died as well. Donnie's English teacher and his Physics teacher are being used by the rabbit to help Donnie to learn how to travel in time. These teachers are not dead, the simply contain valuable information that can help Donny.Everybody dies alone.End spoiler------------</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird, freaky yet insightful and stimulating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best movies of 2001 that went under the rader of most was Donnie Darko, an excellent drama set in the 1980's sprinkled with bits of strange humour and social commentary of both that time period and our own. Richard Kelly's tale of a young boy saved by death from a six foot tall rabbit and forced to do the rabbits bidding stretches far beyond the simple storyline and adds in many different subplots and a great deal of valuable insights. The story cannot be summarized on the movie's back, a trailer or even this review. It is a low budget movie with a great look, amazing cast and one of the scariest characters I've ever seen in Frank the bunny. The aliens from Signs were nothing compared to this guy. I can't betray the story by revealing too much but this is one of those movies that must be seen repeatedly, that works on so many levels, the Tyler Durden of teenagehood, this is one of those movies that could be bought without seeing. The dvd contains more scenes which serve to further flesh out the story, add new plot lines and reiterate certain points, a bonus. While this year I have yet to see a good movie, Donnie Darko was the last good movie I've seen, following Ghost World and the Royal Tenenbaums. It may have been shopped around Hollywood for several years, been slowely suffocated by the september 11th censorship and have made next to nothing at the box office but it remains a twisted yet remarkable tale of a boy who gets a second chance at life, and the affect he has on those around him in a short 28 days. Must be seen to be believed 10/10!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading some of the other user Comments I decided that I had to add my opinion. Firstly, I have come to the conclusion that several retarded baboons have gained access to computers and submitted their thoughts (or random key mashes) regarding this film. In fact, when reading the comments about many movies I am worried that these people are out there, perhaps even operating heavy machinery. The World is not a safe place.This film is one of those films that you watch in awe and feel as though you have really gained something at the end. I read someone say it was poorly written whereas I personally feel the writing is one of its best features, along with Kelly's skillful direction and the acting jobs from all the cast. The soundtrack is good in an 80's throwback kind of way (even got joy division in there) and very fitting.Pure Class likes.Death to the mongos who bother to write up ill-founded, negative reviews.</fullReview>

The opening shot of Donnie waking up on the asphalt as Echo &amp; the Bunnymen's Killing Moon rises on the soundtrack should be considered one of the great moments in recent film history. It literally gave me goosebumps. The material is not necessarily original, but is treated in such a way that it becomes new and vibrant. The characters are real, and the film is emotional without being manipulative. Like a particularly vivid dream, Donnie and his bizarre situation stay with you long after viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful, thought-provoking film, more than just a thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie, thinking it would be an off-beat horror-type flick. I watched it halfway through - twice! - because I just wasn't paying enough attention to get what the real story was. After munching on it overnight I realized I had to see how the story ended (possible spoiler ahead). I wasn't keen on the "Beautiful Mind" paranoid-schizophrenic plot line, but the acting, the story, and especially the imagery (Frank the bunny is a frightening/funny sight) and score are very compelling. But the payoff montage at the end of the film to the Gary Jules song "Mad World" is just amazing. That song sets exactly the right tone for the whole film and wraps it up beautifully.What more can I say? With such a high-concept story line, it would have been easy for the actors to give over-the-top performances (like in "American Beauty"). Each performance was so natural and effective that I was never separated from the story, I was never aware that here was "Bubble Boy" delivering his lines, there was "Stands with a Fist" chewing up the scenery. I am still haunted by Mary McDonnell's last scene, smoking the cigarette by the tree, sensing her connection to Jena Malone while already mourning her loss.Great story, great cast, great music, great film!</fullReview>

The line on the box for the movie says "It'll knock you flat!! **** " It isn't kidding. At first it seems a little odd...a teenager visited by a giant evil rabbit that tells him to do things?? Weird....but that's only the surface. What you don't see is the brilliant world of "Donnie Darko." To me, this was an incredible movie...one that I haven't been able to get out of my head for the past few days. Without giving anything away, you find that Donnie's world has a real sense of purpose, but the buildup to revealing that purpose is the best part of the journey. Some may find it hard to follow, but if you watch it (like "Memento"...however, this movie goes in a "normal" sequence of events) you will agree that this is one of the best movies in recent memory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is nearly impossible to explain or categorize, but most great films are this way. Even the style is difficult to describe, but the creative credits could read like this: Story by Rod Serling, Screenplay by John Hughes, Produced by Terry Gilliam, and Directed by Tim Burton. Donnie Darko is alternately frightening, hilarious, touching, and disturbing. If you are a true film fan, it will exhilarate you the way that Pulp Fiction, Boogie Nights, Memento, and much of Spielberg's early work has done. While watching it, I could not shake the feeling that I was watching a new, great talent; a feeling I felt when I first saw the work of Shyamalan, Tarantino, P.T. Anderson, Christopher Nolan, and Robert Rodriguez. Do yourself a favor and make it appointment viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>&gt; !!!!THIS MESSAGE IS LOADED WITH SPOILERS. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE DO NOT READ FURTHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The murdered kid Frank is a ghost from beyond the grave who (through God's divine power? or somehow) comes back in time to change his course of events to warn Donnie so that Donnie cannot be crushed by the engine; Donnie lives and he is commanded to do things by Frank's dead ghost which inevitably lead him to kill Frank (to create his eye-less spirit?) and Donnie will inevitably go on to create a time portal on a plane engine causing it to fall into the past and land in his home where he will be sleeping and this time the rabbit will not warn him because Donnie stays there and gets crushed therby altering the future so he does not exist to murder this Frank guy so his ghost can't come back to make him sleep on the golf course and live?OK again...Consider this: As the time machine (plane engine) travels backward in time we see a sequence where events transpire backward at a great speed and everything up to the point where the time travel craft arrives is undone (like in Superman -- essentially time goes backward). Donnie is not visited by the bunny, instead he laughs (because of newfound revelation in an existence he has not experienced yet?) and is crushed by the engine thereby dying and not causing his girl's death?? Two things I can try to conjecture from seeing this backward sequence:1. time travel erases the universe up that point (Superman I)or2. the backward sequence is merely shown from the engine's point of view (nothing in that future is really changed -- I mean how can that future change if those exact ordering of events as directed by Frank is necessary to cause the engine to time travel back?)Assuming 1. implies that Frank can't be killed since Donnie is not there to shoot him so Frank cannot come back to warn him in his sleep so the reality he creates is the one at the end of the movie where Donnie is crushed and his girl lives??? But since this becomes the correct flow of things (remember time was erased backward up to the engine's arrival), how can Donnie live on to cause the engine to come back and fall on himself if he is dead and crushed? So the time travelling engine can only exist if there is a flow of event where Donnie doesn't get crushed. So this would imply time cannot reverse itself; it would undo the possibility of the engine coming back to create the normal (Donnie gets crushed) flow of time. A paradox.OK, I admit 1. was silly to assume in the first place now lets Assume 2. Then we have an excuse for the "Donnie doesn't get killed, Frank gets shot" universe to exist. Now we have the criteria for Frank to come back and warn Donnie. But this would put him in an endless self-perpetuating time circle where the bunny always warns him each time and Donnie always does the same thing each time? Even assuming there was a point in this endless cycle where Frank doesn't get shot and Donnie can be crushed now we must accept that both universes must exist simultaneously. Even worse, if you really think about it we have really have three possibilities: a) Donnie gets warned by Frank b) Donnie doesn't get warned and is crushed. c) The engine does not fall in his home. Since Donnie is crushed in (b) he cannot live to cause the engine to travel back so the engine never falls in his house. There are probably even more possibilities. So inevitably we fall into this discussion of alternate universes. If we scrap the alternate universe concept and take on the pre-destination model (only one reality can exist), there is no way to organize any combination a,b and c in a continuous flow of events to create this so-called God's pre-ordained timeline. Try it yourself....go on.I understand the concept of time travel leads to paradoxical conclusions (alternate realities, changing the future so the future can't exist to time travel back and create its own existence, and whatever) but will someone please tell me what is the point of Kelly's "puzzle"?Other than grappling with Kelly's diahretic time travel concept, I found this movie to be a complete waste of time trying to carry itself with 80's nostalgia (Kelly was born in 1975 -- go figure) and weak self-intelligent assumptions. The smurf discussion was funny but you can't carry a movie on it.</fullReview>

I dare you to make those claims and have anyone respect your opinion afterwards.Consider the comments made by the numerous people who loved this film. Clearly there must be something here, lest you consider yourself so presumptuous as to be more enlightened about what is entertaining than the average joe, as inexplicable and ridiculous as that is.Personally, I consider this one of the best films I've ever seen for many of the reasons others list. It's something vastly different and new, well acted for the most part and visually appealing. And any movie that paints Patrick Swayze as a degenerate has to be good, don't ya think?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing I can say about Donnie Darko...Do not read -anything- about it before you see it. I hadn't. I was completely in the blue, and the experience knocked me off my chair. I sat frozen all movie trying to 'foresee' what was going to happen like I always do with movies, but it kept surprising me.Not a lot of movies have done that before. I've seen others mention Memento in this thread, and I think the two are similar. Not because of the plot but because of the sheer unpredictability of the movies. The fact that it's nothing I've ever seen before and thus I can't predict what's going on.Again, do not read -anything- about it if you haven't seen it already. Just sitting there, letting it wash over you like a tidal wave, is the best. This is one of my favourite movies of all time. Ten out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so anxiety producing. I love psychological thrillers and this one keeps you tense all the way through. I want to watch it again now that I know how it ends. It keeps you guessing, is VERY creepy, I love the leading guy, you love him and are afraid of him at the same time. The decided LACK of music throughout is reminiscent of older genre films, like Bullit, and it really adds to the feel of the picture. It's beautifully shot, strongly acted for the most part, and quite thought provoking. This is definitely one to see if you don't need blood and gore to keep you interested.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Under-rated and Overlooked Movie of the Year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this movie last night I knew little to nothing at all about it aside from what I could figure out from the cover. People had told me it was a good movie but when I would ask them what it was about, nobody could really tell me. Now I understand why. Probably the single best compliment I could pay this film is that I could not take my eyes off the screen for the entire movie. From the opening scene I was hooked. This is a movie that crosses genres. You could call it a mystery/thriller/romance/drama/sci-fi and it would be accurate. All the actors give a flawless performance. Parts of this movie will leave you confused but intrigued; there are parts where you think you have figured it all out just to have something thrown in your face! The movie deals somewhat with mental illness; and although this movie is in a different ballpark than A Beautiful Mind, there are parallels that exist with regards to determining what is real and what is imaginined. Actually now that I think about it, the main characters in both movies are schitzophrenic! (sp) I left this movie thinking I had just solved the mystery, but later I wondered if I actually had. This kind of movie does that to you. This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. [9.5/10]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first great film of the 21st Century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have already commented once on this film, but having seen it a second time I find myself connecting with it on a much deeper level. In the latest New Yorker there is a capsule review of a thirties French film by the late Pauline Kael, which she desribes as "poetic fatalism". That is "Donnie Darko" on the nose. It has been edifying to peruse the other comments-you'll note a decidedly polarized response. Those in favor love it, while those not in favor despise it. It is significant that no one seems unmoved in some way-this isn't a film you can shrug off. The people who seem to hate it tell you as much about the film as those of us who love it-they are feeling a strong emotional pull, but one they're not comfortable getting from a movie, so they resist and resent. But they can't ignore or forget. This is one of the great debut films, ranking with Beneix's "Diva", and Laughton's "Night of the Hunter". Beautiful, mysterious, haunting, thought-provoking...no wonder it tanked. Michael Bay and his ilk are a mere pimple on Richard Kelly's ass.</fullReview>

I just wish to say that I don't have ever seen a film like this before, a film I felt very much at home the whole time, a film I cared about this much. I love this film. And I feel kind of angry that a film of this unique quality did not get a theatrical release in Germany, where I am from, or many other places, where it did not receive the kind of treatment it deserved. From all the the young "up and coming" directors Richard Kelly is the one I hope the best for, and the fact that the imdb has not listed anything Richard Kelly might have "in the making" I interpret as a good sign for lots of future surprise cinematic masterpieces we're about to witness. I just hope for them. And Donnie Darko surely is the best reason to hope for them.</fullReview>

Jake Gyllenhaal as Donald 'Donnie' Darko and Jena Malone (who I just saw in Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys, she's no less impressive here) as Gretchen Ross, and an excellent supporting cast. Love the placement of the story in October 1988 in Midwestern suburbia, all the more identifiable for me, just bang on. Richard Kelly II is going to be huge if this film is any indication.

God, interesting doesn't even begin to approach what I experienced in watching this movie. What an interesting take on time travel, and on spirituality, and how the paths we choose are chosen and the ways in which we can alter them. Jake Gyllenhall is absolutely brilliant in this movie, and the supporting cast, which includes a surprising performance by the long thought dead Patrick Swayze and an excellent small role for ERs Noah Wyle is remarkable...simple remarkable. What a tremendous debut as a writer-director for Richard Kelly. I am in desperate need to know what he is planning for his follow-up. How in the WORLD did this movie get ignored by the Academy. I was mad when Memento got ignored for Best Picture, but I'm wondering why this movie didn't even turn up on the radar screen. i know it was small, but didn't Jim Broadbent win an Oscar for Iris for God's sake?

		<fullReview>I've recently been getting so sick of films that bore me. I'm honestly not that tough of a critic -- all a film has to do for me to like it is entertain me. I suppose I've gotten to the point where the puerile crap that Hollywood churns out can no longer even amuse me.Enter Donnie Darko.I'd seen the trailer awhile back and it looked wonderfully bizarre, but it never came to the theatres in my hometown. I forgot about it until I saw it on the DVD shelf in the video store yesterday. And wow, am I glad I rented it.I was entertained -- my minimum requirement -- from the very start. Donnie, as played by Gyllenhall, is amazing. He's an apparent nut case who doesn't take his meds -- and we all know it from the very start. Donnie's adventures in the 28 days after a freak accident in his house are surreal and to put it lightly, trippy. It's funny, touching and unreal.I do agree with a previous reviewer that if you don't relate to Donnie, you won't like the movie. I do feel that most people have something in common with him, however, unlikely as it may seem, and I hope that people will give this movie a chance.</fullReview>

The movie follows, Donnie Darko, a disturbed teen who was a pyromaniac as a child. His psychological problems come to a head when he begins to see visions of a strange rabbit named Frank, who has some chilling news for him. The plot often leaves the viewer wondering why, but, as usual, it all comes together in the end. Moreover, it is an astonishing reassembly of references made throughout the film.

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a strange little movie. It has sealed a place at the top of my DVD rack with Requiem For a Dream, American Beauty, and Evil Dead 2.There are so many wonderful things about this movie that I can't begin to list them all, but I'll list my favorites.Donnie is a wonderful and brilliantly written character. If you didn't either identify with him, or like him, then the movie just isn't for you.Richard Kelly did an amazing job of pulling mind-numbingly grand performances out of even the smallest characters. Cherita Chen, for instance, will stick with me forever. Mr. Kelly also did a wonderful job of writing what I think is the best script ever adapted to the big screen. Every character oozes personality, and you can tell that each one has a special place in his heart.The toughest character for most people to wrap their heads around, it seems, would be Patrick Swayze's Jim Cunningham. I love this about his character. I also love that Mr. Swayze, after starring in movies like Road House, could bring out what he did to play Jim Cunningham so flawlessly.Finally, I like the overwhelming feeling of hope that this movie gives the viewer. Not only for the future of independent film, but also for your own life. Donnie is such a wonderful person, that you're sad to see the movie end because you want to see more of him. However, that being true, I didn't feel let down for a second of this movie.So don't listen to the trailers you've seen, or the reviews of people that just didn't understand it. Just see the movie and make your own conclusions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drifting on the Darkside...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, "Donnie Darko" certainly was an otherworldly film experience. This movie has everything: comedy, tragedy, and time travel. Yes, you heard me correctly. I said time travel. I waited for months to see this movie and when I finally saw it, I was blown away. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the film's title character, Donnie Darko. When we first meet Donnie, it's obvious that he is a very disturbed individual. He's a borderline schizophrenic and has an imaginary friend named Frank, who just so happens to be a giant monster rabbit. When Donnie is nearly crushed to death by a falling jet engine, his "friend" Frank tells him, that this is a sign of an impending apocalypse. Frank then informs Donnie that the end of the world will occur in twenty-eight days and during that time; he must commit several acts of violence. This means vandalizing the school, defacing private property, and burning down the house of a local self-help guru. This is a remarkable piece of artwork right here. So many elements of science fiction that were thought to have died in the eighties are brilliantly brought back to life here. Jake Gyllenhaal, who has done some pretty amazing things in his past, is excellent as the disturbed Donnie Darko. First time director, Richard Kelly, makes a very impressive debut here as well. I really think that it is best to view "Donnie Darko" with an open mind and it's best to be prepared for anything this movie is going to throw at you. Once you begin watching this film, you may not be able to take your eyes off it. "Donnie Darko" succeeds largely because instead of suckering the viewer into thinking that this will be just another freaky science fiction flick, it instead pulls you into its own dark world. This explains the title of my review "DRIFTING ON THE DARKSIDE" because when you watch this movie, you may start to slowly DRIFT into the DARKSIDE of your personality. Donnie Darko himself has a Darkside that is clearly present in every facial expression. His Darkside is his schizophrenic personality, which we see when he talks to Frank and goes on his "missions". When I saw this film for the second time, I kind of felt a strange euphoric feeling coming over me. No, I was not under the influence of any drugs when I watched this. It's really weird though. I don't normally get any kind of feelings when I watch movies, well maybe a few, but this one was the exception. It may have been because of all the topics being discussed in this film. All the stuff about time travel and the destinies that God sets for people are a lot for the mind to take in one blow. I mean if you really try to think about this movie, I mean really think about it; you are going to be in for a total mind trip.I really like the concept of time travel that this film presents us with. One of the concepts shown in the movie is the wormhole. These "wormholes" as they're called, will open up right in front of a person without them even knowing it. When we first see these wormholes, it is almost as if they are leading that person to a destination. It seems to me that with the way the wormholes are formed on people that their destinations may never be reached.However, it does seem that if the wormholes do come to an end somewhere, that time will be when that person dies. Then there is the mystery surrounding the origin of Donnie's "friend" Frank, the giant monster rabbit. ***SPOILER*** Although we quickly learn that Frank is imaginary, soon elements in the story begin to arise about the possibility that he may very much be real. This becomes most evident to us when Donnie is speaking to Frank in the movie theater (they're watching "The Evil Dead"). Donnie then asks Frank to take off his stupid mask. Frank then tells Donnie to take off his stupid "man" costume. It is now that we see what Frank looks like without the mask. What we see is not pleasant.The ending to "Donnie Darko" may prove to be one of the most confusing and enigmatic conclusions to a film I've ever seen. I've seen this movie four times and I still don't fully understand the ending, but I'm starting to. All I know is, that you would have to really have paid attention to all the stuff about time travel to fully understand what happens in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely do movies manage to get you thinking as much as a good novel. It happens, but it's rare. David Lynch has that gift. Of course, David Lynch also is really confusing.Richard Kelly has managed to write a movie that is incredible enjoyable and thought-provoking. It changed the way I look at the world. This movie is incredible.On top of that, the acting is incredible. The dialogue going on between the actors just works. Even when Kelly slips up and provides a line that is slightly sub-par (ex: conversation between Donnie and "Gretchen" where "Gretchen" says "you're weird" and Donnie responds "sorry" which leads "Gretchen" to say "no, it's a compliment" which seems somewhat out of character for her part, in my opinion), the actors make it work. The dinner conversation near the beginning is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.On top of all this, Donnie Darko almost makes me believe in a God.Wow! That's good stuff.</fullReview>

Not since "Miracle Mile" (1989) have I been so entranced to the point of obsession by one movie. The story line on its own would be enough, but the brilliance of the casting takes it to another level. I'd like to think that Noah Wyle took his role because he believed in the film, using his "ER" paycheck to see him through. I know nothing at all about writer-director Richard Kelly, but even if he never gets another shot at glory, he'll have been responsible for a work of exceptional brilliance in both concept and execution. My thanks to him and all involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One word: fantastic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie literally blew my mind. At the time I saw it, all I knew was a 10-word summary from imdb, so I had no idea of what kind of movie this would be. However, it quickly turned out that this movie is something special. One of the first things that comes to mind when one watches this movie is the quality of acting and directing. As this is Richard Kellys debut I'm amazed that he managed to make the movie so complex and surprising without the typical stupid errors and confusing plot holes. From the beginning to the end, Donnie Darko is a fantastic surreal movie that never disappoints once, and left me drop-jawed in the chair. Jake Gyllenhaal clearly shows his diversity on the screen in this one. He is so convincing in the role as Donnie that you could sometimes doubt if this is a fictional movie or a documentary. But he's not the only one - it seems that every single actor in this movie were cast perfectly for the person they play. Jena Malone is the typical american teenagegirl who is sure to leave the males in the audience howling for more (she's actually a very talented actor, too). Beth Grant is truly outstanding as the sickening mrs. Farmer, so much that every single person in the audience is sure to hate her (Mrs. Farmer, not Beth Grant). Patrick Swayze managed to be in a movie without dancing and still act very convincing - his portrait of the "holy" Jim Cunningham was just hilarious.Generally, every actor, no matter how small the role, fits perfectly into the Donnie Darko universe. Ultimately I think it all comes down to the directing skills of Richard Kelly - I hope we're gonna see more of his work in the future. The photographing in this movie is nothing unique, but we do get a few strange angles and cuts once in a while. A good example would be the scene where Donnie sees Frank while he's in hypnotherapy and yells "I can see him right now!"... the following 5 seconds reminds me somewhat of David Lynch.Generally, I think this movie tries hard to be extraordinary and strange like most Lynch movies - and it succeeds. While it's not all about some twisted surreal world, it relies heavily on this to build up the excitement. The scenes with Frank in the bathroom are just breathtaking, so is the scene where we see the "liquid workers" for the first time. The soundtrack itself is amazing - who in the audience can stop tapping their feet as Tears for Fears' "Head over heels" begins to play? The movie takes place in the 80's, so of course every single song is from that era. Besides the pop classics, the darker, more intense scenes feature some very melodic and plain out beautiful piano-pieces which support the mood perfectly. All in all, Donnie Darko is a very complete movie. I suggest you go rent it right away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully surreal with true elements of greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is an amazing work of cinema on a few different levels. First, the story touches upon so much without seeming forced or edgy. Donnie is, at first glance, your average slacker high school kid, which means he deals with peers who do not like him or understand him, homework which he finds ill suited to his reality, and his first attempt at a relationship. Other than those elements, Donnie deals with delusions or realities involving a giant evil version of Harvey the Rabbit named Frank who claims to be time traveling. Instantly, Donnie's world becomes surreal, but we can all still understand his world, even be part of it. Thats the joy and danger in this film... it would be just as easy to live in his world because it is our world, just out of order. Moreover, the movie keeps pulling you onward with new developments, the characters are all interesting and real, and there are true life moments of sadness and humor. Also, what cinched this for me is its ability to appeal to the film expert or the "fanboy" of pop culture. Ripe with allusions and scenes from movies such as Evil Dead, Martin Scorscese films, and even E.T., The Extraterrestrial, Donnie Darko is one film to watch and bound to be a cult classic a la Cemetary Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark, original, and imaginative masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the creation of up-and-coming director/writer Richard Kelly, DONNIE DARKO is the brilliantly bizarre story of a young man who is far from normal.Donald Darko (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is a troubled high school with an intelligent, but cursed, mind. He is depressed, on medication, and likes to voice his opinions without any regrets. One night, he is visited by a monstrous, 6-foot tall, rabbit named Frank. Frank has come to Donnie, from an unknown dimension, to deliver a terrifying message: 'In 28 days, the world will end...'.What follows is an absolutely incredible movie that, unfortunately, did not get very much notice or publicity. DARKO is truly one of the best films I have seen in a VERY long time. Kelly has filled his story to the top with twists, turns, and enough dazzling images to last a lifetime.Jake Gyllenhaal (OCTOBER SKY) is extraordinary as the title role. You can tell, just by observing his performance, that he is aware of what acting is really made of. He is backed by a stellar ensemble cast, including Jena Malone (STEPMOM), Drew Barrymore (RIDING IN CARS WITH BOYS), Mary McDonnell (DANCES WITH WOLVES), Patrick Swayze (GHOST), Noah Wyle (TVs "ER"), and even real-life sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal (HOMEGROWN)!In conclusion, if you are ready to take a psychological roller-coaster ride into a dark universe, look no further than DONNIE DARKO!Rating: A+!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great overlooked movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie recently not expecting much of anything, because it wasn't advertised much and went in and out of the theaters really quickly. However, once I saw this film, I couldn't believe how little attention it got during its release, nor could I believe some of the bad reviews some well-known critics gave to it (Ebert, Wilmington, etc.). This movie is SO GOOD on so many levels: the score and the soundtrack are catchy and used in scenes REALLY well to establish a great mood, as well as the memorable montages and long takes during some of these songs.My favorite scene is during the beginning of the film, where we see Donnie and his friends coming out from the back of the bus, and we get a great introduction of the important characters that will come into Donnie's life later in the film. One of the best movie-watching experiences is when you know NOTHING about a film's story or content, expect little of it and then come out completely blown away by the movie's originality. Of all the big-budgeted summer sh*t coming out soon, go out and rent this film instead, because it is like The Shawshank Redemption: even though it wasn't a hit at the theaters, it's quickly becoming a huge favorite on video or DVD. I mean, look at the IMDB user ratings already for this movie! 8.4! RENT IT</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darkly-funny, mind-boggling and intriguing! This genre-twisting fantasy ranks right up there alongside such original movies as "Memento" and "American Beauty".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who is Donnie Darko?That is the question raised in the provocative indie-film, "Donnie Darko". One of the most-talked-about movies at last year's Sundance Film Festival, this modern-day fantasy combines suburban drama with dark comedy and gives it a little sci-fi twist for a film that is unlike any other. What makes the film so one-of-a-kind is that it takes you into the mind of this unique teenager, Donnie Darko, as he sets off on what star Jake Gyllenhaal describes as "a fantastic journey through dreams, sadness, comedy, and madness" in order to discover who he truly is, learning more and more as time passes by "that every little thing he does counts on a cosmic scale."1For writer/director Richard Kelly, Donnie is an intelligent, but delusional young man whom, he claims, "has a lot of big problems and a lot of big ideas." Some of his problems include sleepwalking in the middle of the night and seeing hallucinations of things that are not really there all the time. One of these hallucinations is a monstrously eerie bunny rabbit named Frank. He appears to Donnie one night, standing outside his house, and tells him that the end of the world will come just in 28 days. The next morning, Donnie comes home to find his family standing outside their house, with everyone in the neighborhood watching as a large crane lifts out a jet engine that had crashed into Donnie's bedroom just a few short moments after his departure. Without any clue where this thing had come from, we see later that fate had something other in mind for Donnie. Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays Donnie Darko, says that its through this "incredible experience that he comes to truly understand who he really is and the effect he has on other people."From then on, Donnie begins to look at both his life and the world around him from a dark and terrifyingly apocalyptic perspective. After he credits Frank the bunny with having saved his life, Donnie feels that he is obligated to listen to whatever Frank has to say to him and do whatever it is he tells him to do without question. Frank allows Donnie to see that, under the veneer of society, lies something not at all right with the world. He helps Donnie try to understand all the "secrets and lies surrounding him"1, and convinces him that he has the ability to adjust them by simply changing the course of history.Unlike other movies that urge people to find their place in the world, "Donnie Darko" challenges them to question their existence, about who they are and what is their purpose in life. It shows us that we have to determine for ourselves what we believe in and that everyone should learn to follow his or her own dreams. Nancy Juvonen, one of the film's executive producers, says that one of the many things she thought was inspiring about Donnie was the fact that he really believes "anything is possible and that he can make a difference by making his own decisions and doing things the way he sees them." "And that's what makes you follow him," adds co-star Drew Barrymore, who also served as an executive producer. "Even though he goes into alternate worlds and questions the rules of the universe, Donnie Darko's experiences at school, with his girlfriend, with his family and in his dreams seem incredibly true to life."So, the question remains, who is Donnie Darko - a hero, a rebel, a genius, a prophet, a schizoid, a messenger, or a menace to a society? The concept of who this boy is ? it is all very strange. Even his name makes you wonder about him. "Its really unique," says Gyllenhaal, saying that you have to "discover what it means for yourself." The producers of "Donnie Darko" say that through repeated viewings, you begin to develop a deeper understanding of the film. Being that I have seen this movie about a dozen times already, I couldn't agree more. I found that the more times I watched it, the more I understood how Donnie is a little bit of all these things. But don't take my word for it. See the movie and decide for yourself. Rating: 4 out of 4 starsReferences Used (this is where I took my quotes from):1.

		<fullReview>This was a movie that I heard a lot about before seeing it. I was told by numerous movie buffs, who all happened to be male, that because I'm a female I wouldn't like this film. They said I wouldn't understand it, they said I'd be asking my boyfriend questions though the entire film, they said it just wasn't for "chicks". This is one of my favorite films of 2001. I was entranced the entire time. It was so dark, and at times I wasn't sure what was going on. However, after seeing the movie, going to bed thinking about it, and waking up, I feel I have such a better understanding for it. It's definitely a movie that makes you think. Lazy movie watchers need not waste their time. There is no movie to compare this movie to.... possibly a mix between American Beauty/12 Monkeys.. however, it stands on it's own as a uniquely individual film. There really isn't anything like it.10/10</fullReview>

It's funny, creepy and sometimes sad. It's a brilliant freshmen effort by Richard Kelly. It can be confusing and it is much better if viewed on dvd with all the deleted scenes and commentaries. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a great performance. The supporting cast is excellent as well. The music in this movie is unbelievable. Kelly intentional picked songs that go with the story..in a weird kind of way. I get goose bumps every time "Under the Milky Way" comes on. Simply put, this is the kind of movie that inspires future directors and writers. I highly recommend this movie to all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Dorko: or the freak from the future from the past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Dorko is sort of a mess, but it's more like six or seven annoying student films crammed into one feature. It has an interesting beginning and finish, but the middle is frustratingly awkward and dull.The best thing about the film is its premise and its impressive visual style. The weakest aspects of the films are its weak characterizations and acting, its phony late 1980's setting and overall bad scenes. It's kind of a riff on the play and Jimmy Stewart film HARVEY, about a man who has a rabbit friend he calls Harvey who of course is just a product of his imagination. HARVEY, however, is a comedy -- a good comedy at that. This film on the other hand, like an insecure teenager, takes itself way too seriously.What really bugged me the most about this film was how horrible and unconvincing the high school setting was. I went to high school in the 80's, and this school in this film did not resemble any American high school that I have ever seen or heard of. This was supposed to be a private school? This had to be the single dumbest and most pathetic group of privileged white upper class students ever portrayed on film. These kids (especially the boys) would barely make it, academically, at Inglewood High much less at a privileged academy. At first, I thought it was supposed to be a reform school or military academy because all of the boys at the school were such violent-prone waste case losers. But with all the intelligent, well-behaved girls at the school you realize that it supposed to be some bogus co-ed private school. The teachers at the school are even less credible than the students. Drew Barrymore gives the absolutely worst performance of her career as a self-absorbed English teacher. She also has one of the stupidest lines in movie history; when a new female student asks where she should sit, Barrymore utters, "why don't you sit next to the cutest boy in the class." My friends and I were openly making fun of the film at this point. Also, inexplicably, Noah Wyle agreed to take a part in this film at the nice guy teacher. Bad move. A furniture polish commercial would have made a better career choice. Then there is Patrick Swayze's character: a millionaire motivational speaker who seems to have nothing better to do than to hang around this Stepford Wives setting of numbed out teenagers. How did this man get so wealthy and influential? He's not convincing to anyone at all. The director wants us to believe Donnie Dorko is somehow enlightened, intelligent and well adjusted, when he openly insults Swayze's character at a high school assembly. Unfortunately, the only way the director can relate Donnie's intelligence and insight is by making all of the other characters in the film out to be complete idiots. Even Donnie's Harvard bound sister seems instead like she should be bound for Sacramento State University. Then there are Donnie's parents who are Republicans, but not disciplinarians. Of course Donnie would have emotional problems, because everyone else in Donnie's hometown is a figment of detached movie reality.One scene that represented everything wrong with this film was the obligatory 80's culture discussion, which in this film is a discussion about the role of Smurfette in the community of the Smurfs. The discussion had no place in the film except that it served to make Donnie seem insightful, when in fact many kids in the 80's (or any other time) seemed to have much wittier and interesting discussions than in this film. No one in this film says anything funny or clever -- ever. There is no wit, no teenage recklessness or unabashed nuttiness. There is just Donnie and the community he comes from, in which everyone is dumbed down to make Donnie seem interesting.What did I like about this film? I suppose I liked the bunny, the jet engine thing and the twist at the end. But I don't care to piece puzzle films like this back together. I'm not interested in what a film like this "meant" or "what happened" because a film like this is too pretentious to have any meaning or depth. Ultimately, what matters to me is whether I enjoyed the film while it was playing before my eyes. And in the case of this film, the answer is "no." There were too many scenes with no real tension or suspense and there were too many scenes that didn't need to belong in this film but were simply there to try to indicate that the film took place in the 1980's. By the way, I couldn't think of a single good reason this film needed to be set in the 80's. In fact, it would have worked much better if it were set in the present day, and it would have worked much better if the audience didn't know ahead of time that the film was counting down to Halloween.Then there is Donnie himself, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, who unfortunately resembles a creepy, morose, dark haired version of Seth Green. I kept waiting for Dr. Evil to pop out of the bunny suit and say "shhh." Gyllenhaal is decent in the role, but he doesn't have much to work with except when the bunny is also on screen. Also, when he has visions, the visions are the most uninteresting creations of CGI effects. In other words, Donnie has visions of special effects.On top of there is a whole time warp, portal dimension plot that belongs in another film. Then there is the mental illness aspect that seems to be the focus of the film and then suddenly disappears. There are simply too many movies, too much going on in this film -- more than this director has the talent and capability to handle. He needs to go back to film school take a course on Italian neo-realism. However, he does have talent as a director. He probably simply needs to grow up a bit and live life some more. There are some images in this film that are very striking. Strangely, the image that caught my eye the most was the image of the chandelier trembling over the stairway after the jet engine falls on the house. This was a very striking image -- perhaps because it contained what much of the rest of the film lacked: simplicity, tension and a feeling of strong emotion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert! A flawed but eminently watchable film about a youth who undergoes an epiphany of sorts as an engine from a damaged plane is about to plow him six feet under. He imagines all sorts of odd happenings and even odder people, while a 6-ft.-tall rabbit become his emanuensis. The whole thing comes down to how one interprets the ending. To make sense, the film is best viewed as a dream, and everything that occurs is happening inside Donnie's troubled mind. This looks like a time travel movie, but I don't believe it is. It has a terribly sad and elegiaic ending, but the knowledge that everything going on is a dream will make or break the movie for you, depending on your point of view. For some folks in my house, the belief that everything was a dream meant that Donnie did not really kill anyone or burn down a house. For that they were grateful. Donnie dies an innocent's death. For me, it was a major disappointment. Kind of like the ending of CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON when the princess takes a header.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank is creepy, but the movie left quite a bit to be desired. i find it amusing to watch people rave over this movie and try to find the "hidden meaning" of certain characters. the problem is that this movie has so many holes that one has to try and fill them. I had this movie recommended to me and was eager to see something "dark and edgy" as the recommendation went. unfortunately, there are too many plot holes that distracted me away from really finding it so great. I'll point out a few. -------------POSSIBLE SPOILERS-PLEASE BE AWARE---------- Ok, so now at the end you have a plane engine that comes from nowhere, or does it? is it a timeloop that will continue to happen forever seeing how that plane will be flying again? no explanation or attempt at reconciliation of this matter. The interest in characters such as the chinese girl and drew barrymore's charater...other posters here have tried to place great importance on their involvement, but honestly, they are so underdeveloped and unnecessary that they just fog up the picture more. Another poster mentioned how "everything had to happen to get donnie in the right place at the right time". that's a load of crap. even if he doesn't flood the school, or burn down the house so his mom gets on the plane, the plane will still be flying over his house at that moment. so we have the creation of a line of events that is totally unnecessary. donnie could have sat on his butt until that day and it would have made no difference. And finally, HOW did donnie get back to the past? did he go through the tornado/wormhole? did he just cease to exist on the hill and get warped back to that night in his bed? and the drugs played what role exactly in his seeing frank and having this experience? ---------------------END SPOILERS------------------ In conclusion, these are just a few of the problems that i have found with this movie. my brother and i have actually coined a new idiom based on this movie. whenever we encouter an element of a story that goes unresolved or has no possible way of existing based on the rest of the story we refer to it as "making sure there are no airplane engines"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard of Donnie Darko, I was intrigued by the demonic bunny rabbit. I was watching the indie spirit awards on IFC and I saw that it was nominated for a couple things, including best actor, Jake Gyllenhaal, so I decided to check it out. Lets just say my first reaction was wow.The story is about a teenage boy, haunted by a daylight hallucination. A demonic bunny rabbit named Frank, who tells him the world will end on October 30, 1988. He is driven to do things he wouldn't normally do, like flood his school or burn down a "Love yourself" guru played by Patrick Swayze. Not normally a role you would see him in. Throughout the story we meet the girl (Jenna Malone) Donnie falls in teenage adolescent love with, "Grandma Death" a woman who wrote a book called the Philosophy of Time Travel, An English teacher (Drew Barrymore) trying to get through to her troubled students, a chemistry teacher (Noah Wyle) who tries his best to explain time travel to Donnie without getting fired, and best of all, Frank, who we aren't really sure actually was a person of just a figment of Donnie's imagination. There is a point where they are sitting in a movie theatre and Donnie asks, "Why are you wearing that stupid bunnysuit?" His chilling reply is " Why are you wearing that stupid mansuit?" Donnie then says "Take it off." And we see a boy with a ruined eye. It makes us think. Why do we wear "Mansuits?" The diologue fits well in it's minimal amount, and the scenes with no diologue are even better. Actor Jake Gyllenhaal transforms his character magnificently, changing his voice from normal when he is awake, to scared childlike when he is hypnotized or talking to Frank. Jena Malone strives to meet his character, but doesn't quite get there. But then she isn't in it enough to make much of a difference. The conservative parents voting for Bush and Donnie's sister voting for Dukakis represent a tension between generations, and simple messages written on the white board on the fridge ("Where's Donnie?" or "Vote Dukakis") leave us wondering, "what was that for?" Director Richard Kelly wrote this as a teenager and as a teenager myself, it is inspiring to learn that we can create beautiful works that traumatize the mind and relate to our lives and experiences. I recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind, or wanting to confuse the hell out of themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thanks to all critics alike on this website, I have read up on this film, read numerous reviews about this film and have decided to give it a shot and run out and buy this film on DVD. I must say, I was completely enthralled with it.****MILD SPOILERS AHEAD****This is a story about divination at it's utmost beautiful, shall I say, "real" existence. Many humans have experienced divine intervention in many different forms. This story just happens to be a twisted and possible perverse tale about the subject. If you do not believe in God, don't fret, this is still a story you can relate to. Everyone had their own paths they wish to follow in life.I can't really hit the nail on the head about this movie with the "divination" subject, but you must see for yourself. The film takes on many different topics such as god, time travel, schizophrenia and or mental illnesses as well as teen angst.Performances by the stellar cast are incomparable with their other works because of the situation they're in and how the director portrays their characters. This being said, if you're a fan of other movies that the cast has been in, you may think differently of them when you see this movie. Most importantly, Jake Gyllenhaal. If you've seen Bubble Boy, you may know what I'm talking about. I have found this young actor to be quite an amazing new talent and will see his upcoming films.I don't know where to begin or end this review, so try to bare with me....All you have to do is go out and buy this movie because it's worth it. Where was this movie? It did NOT get the attention it so well deserved. I highly recommend this masterpiece to anyone who has an open mind to the art of film making. Please do yourself a favor and take my advice.I give it a VERY easy 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To the reviewer who said: "This is a film about MY generation." This is a film about every generation. It is about a need to see where our paths lie in this world. Where are our lives going? What is the purpose? Do we follow a set pattern? Do we control it? Can we defy it?It is also a film about embracing one's emotions and to change their world. Drew Barrymore teaches us this with the reference to Greene's short story in her classroom. But what does the asian fat girl mean? What is the significance of her dance. She loves Donnie but runs away from him screaming: "SHUT UP!" She is asked to read from a problem card and Donnie is soon asked to read one after her. Donnie finally touches her and promises her that one day everything will be better for her. He sees his name written on her schoolbook--she loves him. What is their connection? The closer I get to it, it seems to allude me. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but I know she is VERY important to the meaning.Anyway, I rank this up there with some of the best cult mind-blowing films of all time. A must see for David Lynch fans and fans of the Swedish epic "The Kingdom." I will view this film many times, this I know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I initially only heard a tiny amount of information about this film, I was intrigued by the underground following it was developing.As I was in the UK, and it was on a peculiar release schedule even in America, I saw it first as a crummy AVI video CD. I then got hold of the DVD, and saw it in its full glory.The story is a peculiar tale and operates on a number of levels; encompassing everything from time travel, to school days, to deep questions about the Universe. The plot is highly original, complex, and intelligent, but leaves questions for the viewer. The direction is also fantastic, and although possibly described as that for the "MTV generation", it is much more than that. It is in a style of its own. Also, the hero, and supporting cast, are wonderful, with some peculiar cameos!If you like films that are intelligent and original, go see this film! I loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" is one of the best-written, original, interesting films to come along in a while. Not to take anything away from it but it reminds me of a really, really great, long episode of "X-Files." I kept waiting for Mulder and Scully to show up after the jet engine crashes down from the sky. Thankfully, Chris Carter's brain didn't dream up this idea. Writer/director Richard Kelly dreams it up first. Donnie Darko is the real name Jake Gyllenhaal's character. In a great exchange between he and his girlfriend, Gretchen (Jena Malone), she says 'What kind of a name is that? It sounds like a super hero or something.' Donnie's reply: 'How do you know I'm not?' The irony, for what it's worth, is that 'Gretchen Ross' is not her real name. This film is filled with great exchanges, great scenes, great ideas. Example (for those who've seen it): Ms. Pomeroy (Drew Barrymore) making a girl move so Gretchen can find a seat "next to the guy she thinks is cutest," who is of course, Donnie. It's just one moment in which the world of the film feels like it's just someone's fantasy and not really happening. The film's marketers (Newmarket?) wisely use Frank the giant bunny rabbit prominently in the "Donnie Darko" campaign. A giant, scary-looking bunny rabbit is as good a reason to check out a film as any, I suppose. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply touching, emotional and beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Possible Spoilers...The week I bought Donnie Darko was special to me: I first picked up Session 9 and was exhilarated by that, and then I bought Donnie Darko and was touched so much I had to watch it again, then again with the audio commentary....This film manages to reach into us and pull out some strong emotions. It took me back to 1988 when I was losing many friends to AIDS, trying to find out where I belonged in the universe, and wondering just what the heck was going on around me. The songs chosen for Donnie Darko touched me as well, since not only did they fit each scene they were in perfectly, they were songs that meant a lot to me back then and now: from Echo And The Bunnymen, Tears For Fears, Joy Division, The Church, and Duran Duran. The new interpretation of Tears For Fears' "Mad World" is pure brilliance, I think that Tori Amos could have been the only other person to pull that one off (hear that, Tori? Give it a try....). The film's score as well could not have been more perfect, it managed to give the film more depth (as if that were even possible!).For me, Donnie Darko was about many things, but the idea of sacrifice was very strong. I've been told that nothing is a coincidence and that we are all on a path, so the fact that Donnie went through all these ordeals and had to perform terrible deeds in order to place people on a certain path then sacrificing himself to actually save them (and the girl he loves).....WOW. When I saw the look on the Cherita's face near the end, I got it and I felt so overwhelmed. What would have been a good thing to leave in the film though would have been the fact that all the time Donnie was taking pills for his alleged schizophrenia (which he really wasn't), he was actually taking a placebo. Watching the deleted scenes brought many things to light. The people all waking at one moment at the end and feeling they remember SOMEthing, and the wave of slight recognition between Jena Malone and Mary McDonnell at the very end left me breathless.The actors...so many wonderful people giving their all for next to nothing (this project was very much a labor of love). Some critics say Drew Barrymore appeared more than necessary, but I don't see it that way. She was a messenger and very pivotal to the story. When Noah Wyle looks at her and just says Donnie's name, her response of "Yeah..." means a hell of a lot more than one would realize. Mary McDonnell gets some extremely effective emotional scenes, Katharine Ross is a welcome sight as Donnie's therapist, and Beth Grant is always a joy! Patrick Swayze may seem like an odd choice to some, but that's why it works, and Jena Malone was a good choice. The lead as Donnie, Jake Gyllenhaal managed to have us like him despite everything he did. The shifts from regular to hypnotized to his expression when visited by Frank the bunny....what a range. He wasn't a bad guy after all, and you really see this when he tells Cherita that everything will be okay and he smiles at seeing his name written on her book cover. And that Cherita, played by newcomer Jolene Purdy...she was SUCH an important character to the story. I cried when I saw her sitting alone outside while the dance group Sparkle Motion swept the talent show glory. And as I mentioned, the look on her face near the end...I still get emotional each time I view Donnie Darko, there is something very personal to this film that hasn't affected me so much since the 1985 Keith Gordon film Static. It's beautiful, sad, imaginative, expressive, emotional, dark, and very hopeful all at once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. This is not so much a review as a recommendation. Wonderful offbeat film directed by newcomer Richard Kelly. Really looking forward to future films from Mr. Kelly as Donnie Darko will be tough to top. Thought-provoking and mesmerizing, the script will play games with your head as you attempt to keep up. Excellent turn by the well cast Jake Gyllenhaal (October Sky) as Donnie. He really captures "all" of the character(s). Jena Malone first caught my eye in the putrid "Stepmom" and she shines again here as the only one really trying to accept Donnie. Great to see Katherine Ross back on the screen, albeit with the worst make-up since the original "Godzilla" films. Nice cast, nice script, nice directing. The pressure is on Mr. Kelly ... we're waiting!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is far more creative than average. It manages to take the pacing of Ice Storm, the angst of American Beauty and the confusion of Memento and wrap them all together in a relatively original package.IT IS NOT A HORROR FILM. It is funny that it has been packaged as a horror film, because as I said before, IT IS NOT A HORROR FILM. It is only mildly dark on occasion and never tense in that "Oh Dear God What Is Behind Me!!!" sort of way. It has more in common with Magnolia then with EVIL DEAD or Halloween. (Both in my personal top 5 horror films) If you loved the movies Brazil, being john malkovich, 12 monkeys, Slaughterhouse 5 you will enjoy this film.IF you are a fan of Kurt Vonnegut you might not consider this movie as original at all. (If you read this part of the review and think that I am full of crap and that this movie was "way so original" (no disrespect intended) then you need to read Kurt Vonnegut, esp. Slaughterhouse 5.I liked this movie. I would recommend it to my friends. If you hated it you probably aren't someone I would consider much more then an acquaintance. xoxoxox art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overrated. Donnie Darko is a movie that I would describe as "A smart movie for dumb people", there is no way around this.This movie offers less insight into time travel than it does into depression and schizophrenia. Another failed attempt to force cult. To sum it all up, this depressed suburbanite is fed sugar pills by a rat doctor that has no interest in his well being, and as a result he gains universal insight and uses it to burn down buildings he doesn't like. Granted he got lucky when he torched a some diddlers workshop, but he didn't know this man was a diddler. No one likes to be told to smile, everyone likes fire, and few people understand temporal physics, which is good news for this guy, who by the way was done s%&amp;t all since.IMDb score 01/10 to offset it's already too high 8.1 (at the time of this writing).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave 5 just because film contains really good music score and it's set back in the 80's. Most of the time the movie is really predictable and naive in it's slow and not quite finished try to make something out of not really much. Scenario which is constantly in collision with itself and needs additional "How to understand it" manual is not the weakest point, but the Director who is stucked up with infinite loop in making things alone to collide with itself is the real problem. In order to put such a story in a successful frame, you need much more experience behind the directors position, and it would be analog to Kubrick choosing his first ever feature to be the 2001, everything said. So, because obvious holes and non-linearity in this work were impossible to achieve on screen, Director had written the manual for using it, but he also added another switch if the manual doesn't work as it's supposed to work - Schizophrenie. So film has no true and meaninful ending except "ending" which is to be interpreted in few million different ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless, brilliant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Describing Donnie Darko in 1000 words is impossible, however, I will still try and do it!This film is probably one of the most multi-layered in existence. It is probably of the psychological thriller genre, but it is much more than that. It is very funny in parts ("he told me to forcibly insert the lifeline exercise card into my anus!"), very scary (who isn't scared of Frank) and of course, very sci-fi.This film investigates the struggles of a troubled teenage boy in a very unconventional way.I'm surprised at how hard writing a review for this film is, due to its incredible complexity, I don't quite know what to say.At the end of the film you won't know what has happened, by the third or fourth viewing (provided you haven't googled it) you may have some clue, but its obscurity takes nothing away from the film.All in all, this is probably my favourite movie of all time- the acting is great, the dialogue is either witty or genuine depending on the scene. It's cleverly directed (such a shame that everything else that Richard Kelly has directed has been so uninspiring). The storyline is very interesting and draws the viewer in immediately- and keeps you hooked throughout.One of the best cult films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chills in the brain during the whole movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie just grabs you from the beginning through the brain with a slow and dramatic soundtrack, which suddenly gets excited about Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) going down the hill by bike up at home, arriving at dinner time with the Darko's family, which ends in a discussion between Donnie and his sister Elizabeth (Maggie Gyllenhaal, who is also his sister in real life, UOL). Soon afterwards we see that Donnie is a troubled young man, insults his parents and sisters, take drugs, have emotional problems. Suddenly the film gets a dark and somber tone with a dying voice calling by Donnie. Donnie wake up and goes outside and comes across a man dressing a rabbit costume saying to Donnie that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 12 minutes and 22 seconds.Soon after this Donnie's room is invaded by a turbine aircraft. Donnie suddenly wakes up in a golf course and get back home and see his room destroyed. After a few days he returns to school and the film features almost all the students and teachers of the school. At the moment we think that we are watching a teenager's scary movie. But over the somber tone doesn't leave the film with the dying voice of the rabbit-man named Frank, forcing Donnie to do certain crimes. Such crimes with several consequences for the lives of all and Donnie.I know, the story is very strange, as the film itself. But just pay attention in Richard Kelly (writer-director) to see the masterpiece that the movie is.As said before the film looks more like a teen movie (which it is), but Kelly manages to put in the story several ideas and theories (one of them is the sexual activity of the Smurfs). Mixing a lot of elements of sci-fi like time travel, and elements of drama and teen romance. And also as someone's fate can change with just a little one thing happen.Since the great direction and the formidable writing with great ideas, along with fabulous performances, and a final exciting. The masterpiece of Richard Kelly is creepy, hilarious, exciting and memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most captivating and compelling cult movie I have ever seen. The blending of religion, time travel, destiny and the end of the world is just done almost flawlessly. And constantly kept my interest from beginning to end. Movies like this show that you don't need a huge budget to make a entertaining and intriguing doomsday movie. The story is basically about a teenage boy that has emotional problems named Donnie Darko(Jake Gyllenhaal) that deals with family and high school life and has interactions about different philosophical views on the meaning of life. While also finding out about time travel and destiny and the end of the world. And how he copes with it all and what route he decides to take in the end. What is great about this movie is how it dives into the mindset of Donnie and what is happening to his surroundings without giving too much away. And that is one of the key elements of this movie, it gives enough but it leaves enough for the audiences imagination. By leaving certain mysteries around everything that happened. In another words it doesn't insult the audiences intelligence and yet doesn't purposefully try to be all confusing in order for it to seem like a clever movie. Overall, this is a must watch film.9.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a nice psychological film which is held firm by the nice acting and the cinematography. The story revolves around a kid named Donnie who has delusions most of the times. The delusional part says that the world will come to an end in some stipulated time. He follows what he says. The twist comes in the ending.PROS: The movie has everything to interest all types of viewers. There is school comedy along with funny incidents. The weird part is that the delusional character is in the form of a Rabbit and that is the funny thing, to make the rabbit scary. The makeup did scare sometimes but you will never really have a fear feeling towards his character. The acting is above satisfactory. The soundtrack also is good and helps creating the atmosphere.CONS: If you think again after seeing the film about the incidents and activities than you will find that most of them seemed to be linked weirdly. But you definitely will not find any detachment while viewing the film.VERDICT: "A recommended watch."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly one the greatest independent debuts of the decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When reviewing a sequence of excellent films in a row, it is inevitable to fall into the horrid dimension of adjectives scarcity. Thoughtless repetition of terms and ideas is something I try to avoid as a plague, and as the nefarious manifestation of bluntness that it truly is; however I cannot refrain from designate Donnie Darko as a brilliant, mysterious, inventive mind-bending and after all melancholic piece of art. Certainly one the greatest independent debuts of the decade.One may presume, before watching the film, that all this ridiculous adulation over a troubled teenage movie may be a misleading interpretation of a melodramatic story filled with unjustifiable angst over foolish juvenile notions. Nothing could be further from the truth. While Richard Kelly's debut does indeed deals with troubled youth and its consequences, the whole universe of Donnie Darko incorporates with efficiency a non-linear storytelling, disseminating vital importance among all characters and even presenting parallel dimensions and distorted timeliness for the sake of subtle sci-fi impression.Needless to say, the plot is not quite easily digestible; there are particular physical allusions that may border on the unintelligible, and for the ones that insist on straight forward, chronologically simplistic narratives, disappointment is almost certain. For the open-minded, however, it is a perfect chance to inspire the sensibility, as the movie will most definitely awake your human side by the final scenes, when Tears For Fears' ''Mad World'' carries the credits, ending one of the most compelling and challenging dramas ever produced.There is a huge chance that you may be a cold-hearted bastard if this movie did not affect you in any way. Everything from Jake Gyllenhaal performance, the grim suburban atmosphere, complexity on psychological and (meta)physical realms, not to mention the superb Indie/Post-Punk soundtrack, all converging to one of my favorites finales, that would not reach this grandiose without that large amount of pretension, once again and always, used as compliment term.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By the end of this movie, my mind was reeling. This movie is a portrait of the difficulties in life with a bit if a sci-fi twist, and it is both confusing and satisfying.Donnie Darko is a disturbed teen with mental issues who is suddenly thrust into the role of saviour of the world. Seems like an old trick, but the character depth and imperfections save it from being tired and used.The whole movie is like a fast mental game that will leave you struggling to keep up. I, personally, enjoy this very much in a movie. I get a bit tired of the ol' blockbuster clones. Donnie Darko is a welcome island of complexity in a sea of mindless genre-clichés.The characters are wholly realistic, despite seeing giant rabbits or the future. Donnie himself is something I enjoy in a movie, a dark hero. A lot of the time, our protagonists whine and moan about their responsibility, then suck it up and save the day. In the end, they are all comforted with the thought that the act of saving the world has made them "perfect." There are no such delusions in this script.Overall, Donnie Darko is a refreshing look at the old story of boy saves world and has more twists than one can count.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An endearing character in a mad world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko, a teenager going through life with his family, school and small town events. His condition (apparent mental illness for which he is treated by a psychiatrist and medications) makes him sleep walk and see life around in a surreal manner - speaking giant bunny predicting the future or instructing him to perform acts, vision of vortex connecting space and time, the character is overall very likable in his struggles - his behavior may not be aligned with the rest of the town but would would like to be? His nature and character seems true and it is easier to empathize with him than many of the other characters: he does not buy-in the local showman motivational speech (and turn to be right to doubt his motives), treat people around with interest and sometime care (his newly made girlfriend Gretchen or the lonely depreciated Karen) or paying interest in an old lady (in a sense a key character to his hallucinations).Donny is simply a normal teenager trying to go through life with a sweet side, mixed with apprehension, confusion, awareness, fascination for the unknown but always trying to make sense of the life around him. I really felt the character was one of the most endearing character I have seen. Forget the cast including more famous names such as Patrick Swayze and Drew Barrymore - they get near unnoticed as the principle actor (Jake Gyllenhaal) delivers a stunning performance in his incarnation of Donny Darko. Gyllenhaal as Donny convincingly goes through a range of emotions from happiness, shyness, clumsiness, rage, fear, hopes, care and love as Donny tries to escape the reality of sordid life in high-school and the mad-world around him. At the end, Donny's choices seem to be the right one ending with the ultimate sacrifice for love and saving the one he cares for. And throughout the film, you follow his life completely absorbed in this very stimulating (intellectually and emotionally) master piece.My only disappointment is that I discovered this movie as a near random accident as it seems to be more of an underground movie than a top classic. I watched ti three times already and certainly considering a few more as you always get absorbed by the character, the story line, the orchestration and discover more and more details in this complex maze of intertwined stories and interpretations. Pure art form, very stimulating, this one gets a high rating from me and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't remember why I decided to watch this the first time, other than the strange allure of the concept and the creepiness of Frank. But I do remember why I've watched it every time since.Everything about this assemblage of pictures, sounds and ideas works. From the eerie opening scene to the thought- shattering climax, you will love Donnie Darko, Kitty Farmer, and everything in between.A major aspect of the film's success is its quirky atmosphere. The licenced soundtrack, including Echo and the Bunnymen and Joy Division, perfectly sets the 80's mood. Even greater though is the original soundtrack, which can't be described as anything other than haunting, is perfect. Mixed with great camera-work and lighting, Donnie Darko engulfs you in its world.Inside its world are the characters, and there are very few movies with an equal cast. With a mix of stars like Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze, and up-and-comers Jake Gylenhaal and Seth Rogen (!) , Donnie Darko's characters will steal your heart. Donnie is the confused, lonely teenager everyone can relate too, the bullies are legitimately scary, and even the annoying Ms. Kitty Farmer is so sensitive you just won't be able to help yourself from smiling whenever she has a scene. Completed by amazing dialogue, (the dinner, talk of smurfs), the characters and acting in Donnie Darko are another reason to see this movie.Lastly, the story. Simply put, you can't see Donnie Darko once. You may think you understand it, but then the end comes and WHAM you mind is in shambles. It demands several viewings. I've seen it on YouTube, rental, and three times on Blu Ray and still don't understand what truly occurs. Eventually, you might give up.Donnie's tale has it all, and might blow your mind by the end. 9.8/10</fullReview>

Rarely do you sit and watch the entire slew of credits, but the song that is playing is so intertwined with your thought process that it is impossible to turn off. The movie is one of the darkest I have ever seen. Though the film focuses on every area of evil (domestic violence, drugs, alcohol abuse, sex, bullying, fights, pornography, and more) the message is altogether heroic. Christ is mentioned several times in passing within the film, and Darko goes out as a new-age Christ. He decides to sacrifice himself so that others can confront their faults, even despite losing the recognition of the only love of his life.The movie is shot beautifully, the soundtrack is great, and the message is superb. The timeline of love and fear mentioned in the movie turns out to be the prevailing theme. Overall brilliant.</fullReview>

Anyway, Donnie is whomever you wish him to be--your secret self, your tortured adolescence, your unknowable friend, life in general. He wanders alone, finds out whatever he can about life alone, and dies alone. It is the predicament of all humans. What in the end is the meaning of anything? Things happen, we're pulled into them and left to decipher things later. Everyone gives an opinion about what 'we' have gone through or felt. We go from wondering if it is a god's will or fate to the simple fact that it is. God is just another explanation (rather a childish one) of what is. If we are honest, nobody from the afterlife has visited us and no beings who aren't there speak to us. We imagine these things at times, particularly if we are schizophrenic. It is still fun to see images on the screen coming as close to an understanding of things than anything else. Unless Santa and the Tooth Fairy pop up on our doorsteps (That's a lot of doorsteps!)to reveal all the hidden facts about life, this will have to do.</fullReview>

But it will definitely stick in your mind for a long time.But one of the most interesting things I feel I should mention about this movie is that Donnie is the one who's supposed to be crazy, but in reality, he seems like the most normal one. Except for his family, his girlfriend, his English teacher, and his therapist, everybody surrounding Donnie is crazier than he is.You're never going to forget this movie after you see it. Why did they have to mar its good name with a sequel?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lot of People Love This Movie, I Didn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years I kept hearing "You have to see Donnie Darko" and "I can't believe you haven't seen Donnie Darko". It kept coming up on my list of recommendations at Amazon.com and on Netflix. Well, I finally sat down to watch it last night and fell asleep. So this evening, I sat down to watch the rest of the film.Why? Because I bought into all of the hype surrounding Donnie Darko. That it was a movie that you cannot just watch the first hour of and walk away, that the payoff in the second hour makes the whole thing worth it.Don't buy into that. If you're watching this film and you just don't like it after the first 30 minutes, don't waste your time on the rest of the movie, it's just not for you. It certainly wasn't for me.However, I can see how some people might find this movie fascinating and riveting. It didn't do anything for me.The story is fairly straight forward, albeit from a slightly unnerving point of view. In many ways the way this film was shot was a sort of tribute to the way that Donnie experiences his world.The Soundtrack was a great amalgam of late 80's pop that anyone growing up at the time will identify with. However, the emotions that are experienced and the scenes just seemed overly contrived and at time farcical. There was little flow to this film. In it's attempts to be hip and cutting edge, it distracted the viewer just enough as to disengage him or her from the film.I couldn't identify with any of the characters in the film simply because they were all over characterizations. The brooding Teen, the bully, the preppy girl, none of them seemed at all believable, and in a story such as this, believability is what would drive the viewer to engage in the characters and their actions.This film is certainly not for anyone, and I think, really, the emotional investiture that's necessary to draw the viewer in was lost on me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DD is a teen-oriented fantasy about a troubled young man who has a series of odd visions, including of a six-foot-tall rabbit that looks like Harvey's evil cousin. The rabbit advises Donnie on and off throughout the movie, while Donnie goes off on some apparently time-tripping adventures. Early on in the film, Donnie avoids a close call with death in the form of an errant airplane fuselage. From that point, the movie unspools like ALICE IN WONDERLAND on acid. My initial take on the movie, back when I was reviewing under another name, was that Donnie's visions were spurred by his schizophrenia. Thanks to my wife, the nurse, I have come to understand that his problems were more likely the consequence of being heavily and perhaps unnecessarily medicated. While the film is hardly perfect, it is interesting to read the endless interpretations posted here. Younger viewers tend to see the film as literally involving time travel while older viewers see it as a nightmarish dream. Whatever the answer, Jake G. is note-perfect as Donnie. And among the supporting players, Drew Barrymore stands out as one of his teachers. For reasons I have forgotten, the director has set the story slightly back in time, which in the end does no harm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not perfect, but definitely worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is absolutely stunning in its originality, and will blow you away with its intelligence, creepiness and individuality the first time you see it. It might just have you looking over your shoulder for a few days.That said, it might not have reached its full potential, because it almost couldn't decide what kind of film it was. Though no movie should limit itself to one genre and set of conventions, 'Donnie Darko' tries to cover too many bases - haunting supernatural sci-fi story, outcast romance, condemnation of hypocrisy, social commentary, and even high-school movie. The confusion is most apparent with repeat viewings, and as a result the tone can be somewhat erratic. But don't let it dissuade you from checking out this movie, because it's powerful enough to overcome its flaws, and sets an example of the kind of thought that should go into more flicks these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting but satisfying experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko has an unconventional plot that is intriguing but absurd. It follows the experiences of Donnie, a boy that survives a jet engine landing on his room by listening to an eerie voice that persuades him to leave the house. A man dressed in a bunny suit then becomes a normal sight in his life. The movie brings together many apparently unrelated events that cumulate in an effective conclusion.The music that is played between significant events fits very perfectly, both thematically and stylistically. The lyrics help watchers penetrate into the mind of Donnie. The character of Frank is visually impressive, leaving a haunting impression after every scene with him. Jake Gyllenhaal does a great job as Donnie, but the other acting was nothing special.The plot is creative but not without problems. The physics behind the time travel is a stretch, although I admit that is not the main focus of the film. Some of the individual segments are flawed and need additional explanation, but fortunately it all comes together nicely towards the end. The conclusion is wide open but at the same time gives complete satisfaction.Donnie Darko is one of those films that will stay in your head for a long time. The ideas very creative and carry several philosophical messages (many of which are directly mentioned during some of the scenes). The plot, despite some faults, is so far out of mainstream material that it is hard not to enjoy. The bunny suit will remain an image connected to the content of Donnie Darko forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about the wonders of time travel and the beauty of life!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may very well be the best movie ever! Never have I, at the end of a movie, sat with an open mouth and stared at the TV in awe as long as i did when i finished watching this. And never have i wanted to scream so loudly in anger, at all the dumb people in it who refuses to see reason and quality.What's best about "Donnie Darko" is the mood it sets. You have to keep watching because if you understand what's going on you think this movie may just give you the meaning of the universe. Sadly it doesn't.. But it gives you ideas.The fact is that no one knows if time travel exists (it probably doesn't when you think about the obvious paradoxes) but that's just what this movie is about. It would make no sense trying to explain time travel because no one ever could.In short, it is a movie FOR intelligent people, BY intelligent people. And only the most intelligent of us can ever hope to grasp the full depth of it.I am in awe!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm just not impressed with this movie and let me tell you why. It's generic. It's not as intelligent as it pretends to be. No matter what people claim, you don't have to see it more then once to understand the movie. The movie is simple and not complex. I understood it completely the first time. Donnie has to die in order to keep his loved ones from dying. He realizes this, and he's brave enough to sacrifice his self for them. The 6 ft. tall bunny Rabbit named Frank roaming through the movie is annoying. And the costume is just stupid. I thought Darko's imagination would have been able to come up with something better, but i guess i was wrong. I dislike all the trailer park swearing, and how this film tries to prey on common fears that people have like, clowns. And the infomercial that constantly played on a TV somewhere about love not fear made me want to kill myself. The worse part of this whole movie was there were a handful of dead spots. I think they should have condensed the story so my tears of boredom didn't cry on for so long. However, Donnie Darko did have a handful of redeeming qualities, which is why i ranked it a 7. The acting was top notch, and for the most part the dialog was intelligent, and worth hearing. There were scenes that were so emotional and pure that i would recommend this film to be watched. The butter-fly effect came in loud and clear</fullReview>

When i heard all the hype about it i figured it was to good to be true, but i was wrong and after i watched it i had Donnie darko fever, cause i could not shut up about it. Donnie Darko is one of those films you can discuss for hours cause it has a lot of mystery and has a broad plot.I suggest this to everyone, except people who don't enjoy a intellectual film, or a film with profanity cause they do use harsh language but it dosn't bother. Other than that everyone should enjoy this film.</fullReview>

I found everything about it to be exceptionally well done, and it's impossible to just walk away from it after you're finished watching. It'll linger in your mind as you develop all sorts of theories about what happened.But IMDb demands at least 10 lines of text so I guess I'll say more :PThe film has superb performances from all the actors as they spout extremely well written dialogue (it even rivals that of Joss Whedon at times) in order to portray their intriguing and well developed characters.The film will make you laugh out loud, cry and potentially scream.

		<fullReview>This film is really weird. In the best possible sense. Part coming-of-age high school film, part horror, part sci-fi, part drama, part Harvey. What I really like about this movie is how it has a bunch of seemingly disconnected story lines and at the end you realize why each scene fits together. Because of what Donnie does. But really it is just one idea. Not a story idea, or even the vaguest premise. It is about challenging movie goers and movie makers alike to create an active role for the audience. You can't passively watch this movie without ruining it. You need theories and online research and discussion to get the most out of this movie. But it sure helps having an excellent cast and stylish directing. Also a mindbender of a story. and, of course, a six foot tall bunny rabbit that tells you exactly when the world will end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is the best movie I have seen in my life. I know it sounds cliché, but it is very intellectual, and comical at the same time. I have probably watched it 10 times, and not caught everything. Highly recommended. The way the characters speak for themselves, and are totally self descriptive is amazing. For his first movie, Richard Kelly did an awesome job. I have only seen the director's cut version once, and it shines a lot more light on what is going on, and I recommend that over the original theatre version of the film. Although the movie is rated R, for whatever reason, it doesn't involve nonsensical violence, and unnecessary scenes with sex or drugs and whatnot.</fullReview>

Though there is time travel and some pretty far-fetched ideas, it is a movie that anyone can relate to and enjoy. At it's core Donnie Darko is about a boy who makes the ultimate sacrifice to save the ones he loves, in doing so he also saves the entire universe. I would recommend this movie very highly though it isn't for everyone.I loved Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as the teenage hero. He was smart, funny, twisted, and surprisingly normal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Might have been superlative but for the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should mention at the start that I saw the Director's Cut, not the original. Also, I don't want to go through my thoughts on the whole thing since other people have written far more capably on this movie than I have.Overall, I thought the film was filled with excellent acting and ideas, especially Gyllenhaal, Barrymore and McDonnell. However, the ending wrecked it for me.In essence, Donnie Darko gives you two choices: Donnie is either schizophrenic, or he is actually involved in a wild sci-fi adventure to save the universe.Since Donnie is already, as far as we can tell, seeing a psychiatrist / therapist and on "medication" prior to the first appearance of Frank the rabbit, it is reasonably clear that Donnie *does* in fact have genuine mental problems (otherwise, why is he seeing the psychiatrist? unless the rabbit has been preparing things for a while?). We are later told, however, that Donnie has been taking placebos. We are (and, again, I assume) therefore supposed to assume Donnie is *not* schizophrenic, even though the film's strength would be its portrayal of a schizophrenic's world.If Donnie is not schizophrenic, then the second choice presents itself: everything we are seeing is in fact real, and Donnie is genuinely following the tenets of a book written by a woman about time travel / multiple universes. But the "reality" approach is also a problem: the tenets of the book read like pure hokum - they seem two dimensional, childish almost - yet they are supposed to be grounded in science. Assuming that we are supposed to believe the world is real, the time travel book looks like it was written specifically to justify the plot of the movie. No explanation is given, for example, of why it is necessary to have "manipulated dead", or quite why this relates to Hawking's theories on space time which are referenced earlier on. Actually, I felt that the book worked better as a product of Donnie's schizophrenic imagination, since it sounded so obviously ludicrous that only Donnie himself could have been expected to believe it, and it is simply not tenable that Donnie's physics teacher would actually refer Donnie to both Hawking and a book that sounds rather like a children's story of which he happens to have a copy in his briefcase.So, Donnie is either schizophrenic or really following the book. At the end, Donnie is back at the events that took place at the beginning of the film. Instead of escaping the fall of the aircraft engine, which led to the original course of events, he chooses to lie in his bed, the engine falls, and he dies. And with him dies the film.If Donnie is schizophrenic, then the effect of the ending is that the entire episode was a dream, because he dies before the events happen - i.e. it never happened, so has zero emotional impact. This is the same problem that, incidentally and in my opinion, ruined David Lynch's Mulholland Drive.If Donnie is *not* schizophrenic, then we are expected to believe that Donnie has successfully time travelled / whatever back to a point in time when he had a choice. On *that* interpretation, there *would* be an emotional impact to Donnie's decision. *But* the principles by which he has proceeded are so patently ridiculous that the film loses all believability and becomes the worst kind of science fiction, where the rules can be made and changed at the will of the author (much in the way that Tolkien managed to save Frodo and Sam at the end of Return of the King by flying in eagles without any prior explanation, destroying the otherwise convincing sense of three books' worth of writing in one fell eagle-swoop). All the hints in the film that Donnie is a Messianic figure, choosing his sacrifice, come to nothing because the rules Donnie follows are not credible.In essence, to me at least, the movie was a choice between a fantastic look at mental illness with the most cop-out ending possible or simply a pathetic excuse for a science fiction movie. Either way, the ending ruins it.Which is a crying shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent, intellectual and an eerie thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Review of the original 2001 version of Donnie Darko* This movie is a great psychological and philosophical thriller that takes place in Middlesex, Virginia during the year of 1988. The film revolves around a mentally troubled, yet intelligent teenager that is taken on a subconscious thrill ride that broadens to a vast story of incredible philosophical depth. As this movie progresses, you get to know more and more about the daily life of Donnie from his and other people's accounts. Once the movie is over, not only are you left with answers to previous events, but with so much information left to uncover and decipher. By repeatedly watching the movie and mapping out each individual detail, you can fit together many pieces of this amazing puzzle.The http://www.donniedarko.com website also reveals a great amount of important details revolving around the concept of time travel (which has a huge impact on the resolution of the movie). I won't spoil how time travel implicates so deeply into the story, but once you've carefully inspected the website and all details that you can prospect from the movie, the film becomes even more amazing to unravel piece by piece. I recommend that if you haven't seen the movie, don't visit the website so that you don't reveal any information that you aren't supposed to know about yet.Overall, Donnie Darko is an incredible, eerie thriller movie with great science-fiction attributes that make this movie a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Über Cool Teenage Angst.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko has become a sell-out hit amongst angst-ridden/fashionably uncool/persistently 'individual' teenagers the world over, primarily down to its slit-your-wrists soundtrack 'Mad World' Its 'über-clever' plot twist and freak out scenes remind us kids just how terrible our own lives are and make us want to be as insane as the title character.Donnie Darko is a troubled, but undeniably clever young high schooler, not only traumatised by the usual teenage worries, but by a six foot bunny rabbit named Frank who tells him when the world will end.Superbly talented Jake Gyllenhaal again impresses with his creepy, somewhat sinister portrayal of Darko and shows us just how evil he can look by staring crazily into a mirror.However clever the writer/director Richard Kelly wanted it to be, it's still a teenage film. Most people over the age of 25 will deem it 'self loving' and 'ostentatious' but unfortunately few people under the age of 18 will actually understand what this film is all about.Donnie is troubled and meant to relate to us as an audience, and Gyllenhaal as always does that superbly, perhaps his talent was over-shadowed by the films overly pretentious ending.Donnie Darko's blink and you miss 'em jokes and dark humour might be wasted on some people who are wanting laugh out loud gags, which they aren't going to find in this film.If you're thinking of slitting your wrists Donnie Darko will only remind you of how awful the world is and how little you actually mean to anyone - so give it a miss.If you're looking for a light little piece of cinema to entertain you one evening, you might be shocked to find that Donnie Darko requires some thinking and might just root up some unanswered questions about your life - so give it a miss.If you're immune to psychological hallucinations and become freaked out easily then Donnie Darko might just terrify you - so give it a miss.If on the other hand, you're in for a little 'deep thinking' and want to be moved, then Donnie Darko is the perfect film for you, and will give you some wonderful topics of conversation over the coming months.If you like your 'indie-cool' flicks with clever plot-twists and meaningful scenes of silence then this film will open your eyes to how a slight pause here and a little look there can create a whole lot more than reels and reels of drivelling script.If you have a slightly odd sense of humour and are fed up of the 'Frat Pack' comedies like Anchor Man and Wedding Crashers then this little gem will take you away from the gags and offer you a darkly humorous, intelligently funny film.If you're a fan of any of the (surprisingly) star-studded cast including a fantastic Patrick Swayze and a slightly weird Drew Barrymore then that won't fail to delight.Or if, as most self-acclaimed fans of this movie will be, you just want to join the ranks of pro-mainstream teens who think they're making a bold statement of their intelligence and individuality by listing Donnie Darko as one of their favourite films, then watch it. You might ask what the fuss is about, or you might just end up being in awe of this film, which under all the fuss and hype is a frighteningly beautiful and well-acted piece of teenage angst.</fullReview>

Broadly, said themes are philosophical and far reaching - the nature of being, place in the universe type questions, in other words impossible to satisfactorily resolve to any degree and if thats the kind of fantasy that makes you neck a bottle of Stolie and then forcefully cups your genitals then Darko is probably one of the best films of its type ever conceived, destined to be mulled over and picked apart for a long time, unless that is you've made the mistake of watching the idiot's guide, sorry Directors Cut that extracts all the delicious ambiguity and joins all the dots for lazy viewers. So there you have it - funny, touching, intelligently scripted, great soundtrack, emotionally stimulating, Swayze getting hauled in for child pornography - everything many films promise but don't deliver, all on the same bill!

At the same time, Donny discovers that the 'crazy' old woman down the road once wrote a book about time-travel, and he begins to believe he can see people's path through time as well as wormholes.

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is an absorbing movie that captures your attention and doesn't let go until the movie ends ? in fact it holds on much longer than that! My vote of five (5) only indicates that I would not choose this movie for entertainment purposes ? but the movie is probably an excellent movie for this genre. In fact, when the movie was over I was left with a feeling of not really knowing what was part of Donnie's visions and what was the reality of the movie. The movie was full of imagery that left me with a disturbing feeling and probably caused me to have the nightmare I had the night following watching the movie. Donnie Darko is played by Jake Gyllenhaal who does a good job of portraying a teenager who is searching for answers and is disturbed by what is happening to him. Beth Grant play Kitty Farmer an absolute disgustingly over-righteous teacher who has been drawn into a simplistic answer for life's problems being pushed by the infomercial type snake-oil salesman Jim Cunningham played pretty well by Patrick Swayze. Drew Barrymore plays Karen Pomeroy, a teacher that is trying to challenge her students to think about the meaning of things, methods which lead Kitty Farmer to call for the ban on some books.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko: 6/10: Some movies just pass me right by. I found Amelie by the end more irritating than cute, I didn't laugh once at Rushmore, and only a hostage situation could coerce me to watch The Piano again.Donnie Darko has a large legion of fans and I certainly understand its appeal. The acting by both Jake Gyllenhaal and Drew Barrymore is some of their best work. The rest of the cast also shines with a special kudos to Holmes Osborne as the father in what is almost always a throw away role. The school and kids remind me of my high school from the eighties (Though this being Hollywood the music is much better than what the radio actually played in those years.) and the filmmakers certainly know how to frame a shot. I was even able to look past the Holden Caulfield and Harvey flashbacks the movie caused me to suffer.So what went wrong? the plot. Oh up until the payoff it's fine enough, in fact it is better than fine. One wonders how the filmmakers are going to pull it off. The answer is simple. They don't. If anything the end of the movie reminded me of that atrocious horror film from a few years back Soul Survivors. Like Soul Survivors the movie holds your interest with more and more implausible plot twists and coincidences then cheats at the end like a bad junior high school English essay. Now Donnie Darko is otherwise superior to Soul Survivors and other films where the ending is a groaner (cough The Village cough), but after all that goodness the magic is gone and they couldn't pull a rabbit out of their hat. Even a six foot demonic one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of nice aspects, but ultimately disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie belongs to a personal sub-genre of movies called, "everything but a story".Movies like this ultimately make me mad. Why? The cast is good. The acting is better than good, there's some great character work here. There are beautiful moments, dialog that is alternately interesting, funny, scary. The music is good and enhances the visuals.But, with a movie like this, one that depends for its dramatic tension on a countdown to a tragic event punctuated by increasingly strange psychic events, when the countdown gets to zero, the film story had better make sense. I'm not saying it can't be ambiguous. I'm saying that the plot at the end has to make sense in relation to what came earlier.This movie utterly fails to do this. There's an old "Far Side" cartoon where a scientist has filled up his blackboard with calculations. Then, just before the result, he has drawn a cloud surrounding the words, "...and then a miracle occurs". That's what this movie does. The writer has simply plotted himself into a corner, can't get out of it, and so depends on vague edits and moody music to finish the movie without bothering to really have a finished story.I ultimately come away from movies like this feeling that the writer and/or director has wasted my time, and the time of all the talented people who took part, because he/they just didn't work the story enough. So I end up disappointed and angry. It's a shame. This was nearly, very nearly, an excellent movie.</fullReview>

However, the director did an excellent job with the camera: the angles he took and the slow motion. the plot was done in a nice but subtle way, and the story kept going into different directions, personally I was not able to put a feel on it. I was not also able to read into his family especially his dad. Some of the scenes were not needed, I believe the director added them to throw us off? maybe. I had to give this movie a 5 just because how I felt when I finished watching it. One last comment, I did not think that the music was really synchronized with the actions or the scenes. Maybe I am wrong, but this is my opinion.l</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Me and my girlfriend decided to watch either other's favorite movies. Initially, I was gonna put on a short one so she wouldn't lose interest, American History X (a brilliant masterpiece, but not my fav.), but after this I made her sit through all 3 hours of Amadeus. Its not a bad movie, don't get me wrong. The acting discovers new levels of mediocre and the plot is pretty cool. It means something different to everyone who watches it. I guess I expected too much after hearing how "inspirational" it was. I didn't find what I was looking for, the idea of emotions was far too shallow for me. As if they were some kind of "either you have it or you don't" thing. My views seem to be further askew than all, parts some take of the up most sincerity I find to be satirical. The characters are simply average people w/ average lives. It is the human complexity of which interests us so much. Over all, I didn't care for it. If you know wit and seek revelation...stray away from this, if you're of dull mind and seek to facade your travesty, then have at it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Startling, Unsettling, Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is without a doubt one of the best and most captivating movies I have ever seen. If you have yet to see it, let me preface this by saying--leave your house this instant and see it at once. If you consider yourself at all a fan of the art of film-making, you must watch it. It is a refreshingly original concept done so beautifully and so painstakingly, it is a movie that everyone should at least see once. I found it brilliant, thought provoking, entertaining, and moving; not everyone will. It is a deeper, different type of movie than your typical Hollywood blockbuster--yet for this very reason I recommend it to everyone. See it once and then judge it. But do see it. Truly challenging, exceptional movies of this caliber come along once in a blue moon. I cannot guarantee everyone will like it, but at the very least I can guarantee that everyone will have something to say about it after they have seen it. I advise people to see Donnie Darko so certainly precisely because it is the kind of movie that took me years to actually see myself. I would hear people talk about it, little by little--mentioning the convoluted plot, the arguments they had with their other friends about what the movie actually meant, or simply the 6 foot tall bunny rabbit named Frank who visits a possibly schizophrenic high school kid to prophesize the end of the world--And it never really occurred to me that this would be the one movie above all others that I should rush out and see. And it was, of course; I wish I had gotten to it back when it was first released. But people can make it out to be so dark and bizarre, not to mention the fact that the original advertising campaign was god awful (the back of the original DVD box likens it to the same sort of movie as "Final Destination", and frankly, no two movies could be more disparate at heart. It's like saying "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is in the tradition of "Rumble in the Bronx"). But I was wrong. For one thing, it is NOT that dark at heart. Darkness plays an important role in the context of the movie, of course. Yet once you understand it, you realize that it really doesn't have much to do with horror at all. There are elements that seem a little scary before you understand them, and there is an inescapable element of tragedy by the end, yet this is ultimately intermingled with so much hope. And that is what makes Donnie Darko so exemplary a movie. I dismissed it originally as just another failed attempt at being strange and different--come on, I thought to myself! Who are you trying to kid? A movie about a six foot tall demonic prophesizing bunny named Frank??!!??--but I made a tremendous mistake. Donnie Darko is in fact one of the best movies ever made. It IS strange and different, sure--yet in an engaging way that achieves film-making greatness. What is so superb about it, exactly? To be honest, everything. Perhaps what I like best about the film is its depth, a feature appallingly absent from the vast majority of modern films. Donnie Darko is a movie that pulls you in, not only because the world it creates is so rich and interesting and teeming with so many wonderful characters, but because the plot itself is not spoon fed to you. It encompasses a great deal more than first meets the eye, and the viewer can't help but find himself increasingly drawn into Donnie's world, trying to figure out with him precisely what is going on and what it all means. To be honest, I wasn't quite positive of what it all meant even by the end the first time I watched it; seeing it again, coupled with the added information provided by the director's cut, helped it all to make sense. (As a note, I personally felt that the original movie, brilliant though it was, left too may loose ends open to the viewer's interpretation. In my opinion, the Director's Cut provides information that makes the movie far more coherent as a whole. However, both versions are superb, and not everyone agrees with my preference for the DC. If, however, you have seen the original and walked away thinking it all nonsensical and incomprehensible, do try the DC. It renders things much clearer, as does a trip to the website [www.donniedarko.com].) But the movie DOES make sense; those who don't think so simply haven't wasted the effort to figure it out, whether by rewatching the movie, visiting the web site, or trying the Director's Cut. Donnie Darko, despite often being pegged as otherwise, operates in a rational universe where everything adds up to a complete and very intelligible whole. It is simply a matter of piecing it all together, which is, of course, a great deal of the fun. Even beyond its depth and the fascinating world it affords us a glimpse of, Donnie Darko is amazing for so many other reasons. The satirical look it provides at life in the 80's and the often misguided self-righteous authoritarians found in charge of private high schools--not to mention the way they tend to react against those who stand out from the herd and refuse to conform--is quite telling, and not a little humorous as well. The music is fabulous. It sets the mood for the 80's perfectly, and nearly all the songs were chosen not only because they suit the period, but because the lyrics make sense within the context of the film as well. Very well done. And the film has been put together as all good art should be (but usually is not)--every thread was chosen for a purpose that contributes to the cohesiveness of the whole. This is made clear when you listen to the director, Richard Kelly, in the commentary on the Director's Cut; the numerous subtleties and nuances placed into the movie which all were employed for specific reasons in order to contribute to the plot, its themes, its symbolism, and the overall tone of the movie really are quite remarkable. It is a painstakingly attentive alertness to every detail as a way of creating art which has characterized nearly all the truly great films (as well the truly great novels, paintings, and just about any other medium conceivable), and it shines through in Donnie Darko. The sheer degree of thought that went into pretty much every scene is quite incredible, and while this will not ensure that everyone likes the movie, it is something which just about everyone can appreciate. The cast, as well, was pretty much flawless. Jake Gyllenhaal was utterly perfect in the role of Donnie; Drew Barrymore was brilliant as Donnie's individualistic English teacher; Patrick Swayze was every bit as brilliant in his role as the other two, and was easily one of the very best elements of the movie; and everyone else, quite frankly, was just as magnificent. The brilliance of the cast is yet another reason to see this film as soon as you can. Finally, I have to say that the overall theme and message of Donnie Darko is superlative. It comes off at first as being interchangeably perplexing, dark or sadistic, but it ultimately amounts to a reaffirmation of the strength of love--love both for that one person who touches our life, as well as love for one's family--and the subtle strand of hope and optimism that permeates even our darkest hour. Donnie Darko is about finding one's place in the world, realizing it is possible to escape alienation and loneliness and find all the brightness that is there if only you are willing to reach for it. It's about taking control of your own fate, searching for some meaning in your life, and doing what is right. It is also about time travel, tangent universes, and a six foot tall bunny named Frank. Honestly, what more could one ask for in a movie?? That said, I think I have made it fairly clear what I think of Donnie Darko.I absolutely loved it; it stands out to me as the perfect example of what can happen when the craft of film-making is done right. It is at once challenging, fascinating, complex, humorous, confusing, engaging, glorious, tragic, and triumphant. It is at the very least a movie quite unlike any other, and whilst I cannot promise that everyone will like it, be able to relate to it, and ultimately find it as supremely poignant as I did, I can recommend it in good conscious to the highest degree. Suspend your disbelief, turn out the lights, and take a metaphysical journey to the potential end of the world with a misunderstood kid named Donnie and a bunny named Frank. You won't soon forget it. I promise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SpoilersThe problem with this film is that the people who see it fall in to two categories of either loving it too much or hating it for not understanding every last detail. I thought a little more explanation was needed throughout (Frank is Donnies' sisters boyfriend though nothing suggests that in the film). Overall its good but also overrated by too many teenagers thinking they've found a philosophical nugget of knowledge. And all the talk of time travel gets mixed up with an alternate reality - two subjects which aren't really directly linked.A major plot hole (of many) is that when Donnie dies he then doesn't flood the school or burn the house down therefore his mother doesn't get on the plane which in turn doesn't fly over his house which then doesn't kill him.Watch it, but don't preach about it like it'll change everyones life and don't knock because it dares to be different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a review and among the review there is going to be some spoilers or clues give away about the movie, if you haven't seen the movie read as you please but it might spoil the greatness of the movie so here we go. Donnie Darko is one of those movies that you have to see at least 2 or 3 times, the first time you watch there is no way you can catch all whats going on. Every actor delivered no matter how big their roles were, the movies uniqueness alone is genuine and very thought provoking. The movie gives off clues and some are obvious, but the story intensifies and you ignore whats really going and more care about the characters. Thats why you have to watch it a few times. Donnie is a struggling adolescent and has visits from "frank", and escapes death when an airplane engine crashes through donnie's room. His therapist gives him sympathy and knows he isn't crazy, he feels left out with his family and feels very lonely (on the DVD there is some very compelling scenes that unfortunately were deleted, there are scenes with donnie and his dad and a great scene thats quiet and shows donnie watching his family and they are all happy together, and he realizes they are better without him and don't enjoy his presence). this movie requires thinking and a great attention span, its so easy to fall in love with this movie cuz its so good but to understand it is quite a journey. The filming was great and above all very original, the film doesn't have any weaknesses, people who don't like it don't like real movies. spoiler here!, what happens to donnie is purely an act of god and in scenes with his science professor, donnie and him have great conversations about time travel, and those scenes alone help you understand the movie better. all i can say is that i love this movie, and its quite the journey and quite the experience you should get when you watch a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning, unique, intriguing--and not everyone's cup of tea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are countless reviews of this movie stating that Donnie Darko is "the best movie of my generation," "the best movie ever made," etc. I agree with these people, but only for myself. Stunning as the imagery is, compelling as the storyline is, believable as the characters are, this movie just isn't everybody's cup of tea. My sister and I (I'm 19, she's 17) loved the movie.The Sci-Fi type group at my college loves it. My dad thought it was okay, and we can't convince my mom to watch it with us; it really might be a generation gap, I'm not sure. Now, that having been said, I'll get on to a real review of the movie.Donnie Darko truly is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The acting in it is great--Jake Gyllenhaal as the title character, Donnie, is detached but likable. Drew Barrymore really surprised me as the English teacher; she wasn't in the movie for long, but you got to like her a lot (but, in all fairness, I may be biased--I'm getting a degree in secondary education, with English as the focus). The character that's the most surprising, other than Donnie himself, is Frank. Frank is a demonic bunny. We're not talking small, fuzzy animal that hops through the fields and is sold in countless petshops across the world, though. This guy looks like a school mascot or something--blue, tall, and with one *scary* face. His voice is low and distorted, and it may take a repeat viewing or two to understand everything he says. It's worth it, though--I can assure you that every time you watch this movie, you notice something new.I don't want to risk giving anything away in the movie, so I won't do a summary of it--read all the other ones here. Instead, I recommend that if you like the movie, you go to the official website: it's full of a ton of extras that help flesh out the movie and explain the confusing bits. It's an extremely well-designed site, and it's actually *fun* to navigate it.Overall, this is an intelligent, engrossing movie. I give it an 8 out of 10, but if you are in the mood for a movie that doesn't require you to think, don't watch this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>so the film starts of as donnie being the choosen one who has to save the world this is due to the fact that a 747 jet engine has fallen into a blackhole and in order to save the world donnie must send it back through the black hole 28 days later.This is not done alone as donnie has a number of helpers including frank to haep him on his way.Frank is a demonic looking rabbit which is ironic as rabbits are normally seen as cute and cuddly, frank is a premonition from the future as at the end of the film donnie shoots him in the eye.The other helpers that are put in place to guide donnie to his set destiny are his teachers who gives him advise and clues to where he has to go.Also Gretchen is a very important part of the story as if she had'nt of met and fallen in love with donnie then there would of been nothing worth living for as he would ultimately be alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a film that defies description. A friend referred to it as, among other praise, "highly unique." What Kelly has crafted is an odd sort of masterpiece, one that is thoughtful, philosophical, painful and thought-provoking. I first saw this in theaters, following a poor descriptive write-up outside the theater door. What I found was a childhood that *I* remembered. Not the glossed-over Leave it to Beaver family and childhood, but the 9th Circle oppressive high school experience and a certain mad desperation on the part of the main character. Perhaps that's what draws me most. Characters. Although the temporal loop always leaves me thinking, the fantasy-sci fi element somehow takes a back seat to the question of character motivation and what qualifies as "better off in the end." The parents, instead of being a two-dimensional stereotype, are a real and supportive family. The music is the music *I* loved, brought to life in a proper setting. Joy Division and Tears for Fears are among other musicians that grace the haunting soundtrack. In the end, the parents lose a child. The town loses a citizen they never knew existed. The lead character gains a sense of self-worth and fulfilled destiny while ending a life that had become increasingly painful and tragic in the month behind him as he sees the eye of the supreme being that shapes his life, and an embittered soul is put to rest after a death of bad circumstance. Again, the movie defies description. I recommend just renting it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw "Donnie Darko" at 12:am this morning, for me quite frankly - have no idea what the big hue and cry is over with this purported cult classic... It is vaguely reminiscent of Philip K Dick, but that's about all!It is trying real hard to simultaneously justify what is sanity, the virtue of justice vs. sacrifice and what do you do to achieve nobility - kill one or many?Jake as Donald is suitable nevertheless, he has the right parts of victim, psycho and hero - I thought that the film should have attempted to justify his questionable sanity a lot more and only went part of the way by destroying Swayze's home to reveal his charcter's secret pervitude.Should Donnie have lived? Thus killing his girlfriend, or in her living allowing the sublime - yet slime - Cunningham prevail? Where did dead Frank come from, what was his inspiration? How did the engine from The Future (interestingly off his Mother's return plane) get there? Did the second Oct. 2 hold Judgment for those who lived 28 days 6 hours and 42 minutes hence?? Use of "the end " held interesting connotation, Donnie was not sure nor viewer that it was for whole world, but it was narrowcasted down to Don as a singularity - does the writer see death of an individual as end of All, therefore is write potential Atheist? This is not a picture to watch while tanked up on Maui Wowie!More importantly, why did Drew Barrymore seek to pricetag this project??Just an interesting anachronism.... I heard in the picture the use of "Duh!" as a rhetortical response, it was set in 1988??? Duh! That phrase in that particular context was not in vogue 'til circa 1994? DuH!</fullReview>

It is undoubtedly a film that has a 'cult' following, as many I have spoken too about it think it is a film of life changing proportions, but personally I do not think this tag is justified, as it is merely a film that is strange rather than getting its viewer thinking about their life.

		<fullReview>I see a lot of people talking about how 'deep' this film is and that you have to watch it multiple times to truly appreciate the overwhelming depth and profoundness of it. Actually, I don't feel I do have to watch it multiple times to 'get' the film. What it is trying to say isn't really all that new, but says what it says with ambiguous plot points and slow-moving profound sounding dialogue, so a lot of people get fooled into thinking that it is some piece of high art.The fact is, you can pretty much deconstruct any movie made. I remember a class at UC Berkeley where we did a fascinating analysis of 'Robo Cop,' for example. The point is, the mere fact that this is a movie that some people like to pore over with a fine tooth comb looking for answers to the meaning of life, doesn't really say anything about the quality of the film itself.For me, the film featured an interesting style and had some very 'unique' elements, but in terms of editing, pacing and compelling dialogue, the film left a lot to be desired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very interesting debut from writer/director Richard Kelly. Watch this guy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard a lot about 'Donnie Darko' for a long time before I got to see it (it has only just been given a belated cinema release here in Australia for some reason that's difficult to fathom), and it seemed like something I'd flip out over. However I can't say it quite lived up to the hype, and I expected a bit more than it delivered. Even with a few qualms it's still an extremely interesting debut from writer/director Richard Kelly, a guy I now have a lot of confidence in. I hope he manages to live up to the potential 'Donnie Darko' exhibits. Jake Gyllenhaal, previously unknown to me, is excellent in the title role, and heads up a largely obscure cast who are all also fine. There are one or two familiar faces along for the ride. Drew Barrymore, who is also one of the executive producers, didn't do very much for me as one of Donnie's feisty teachers, Patrick Swayze was adequate as a shallow self help guru, and Katherine Ross, who I can hardly remember seeing in anything of note since 'The Stepford Wives', is even better as Donnie's concerned but clueless therapist. I also got a kick out of seeing Gregg Araki favourite James Duval in the bizarre but memorable role of Frank. The scenes between Frank and Donnie being the high points of the movie, and almost worthy of David Lynch at his finest (Lynch being an obvious reference point for the movie as a whole). I advise anyone who has yet to see this to avoid all descriptions of the plot as the less you know about this movie the more enjoyable and surprising it will be. I don't consider it to be a great movie but it is a very good one, which is a lot more than I can say for 90% of Hollywood's output these days. Flawed but fascinating, 'Donnie Darko' is a movie definitely worth making an effort to catch. And keep your eye on Richard Kelly. I eagerly look forward to his next project!</fullReview>

Tears for Fears amongst others soundtrack. Acting is a bit like a very young Dustin Hoffman. Slow fast frames. Oscar material ? except it seems, from disclosures made since its release, that this may have been almost luck rather than judgement on the director's part, as his original cut had given the movie a religious slant that would probably have weakened it greatly. Having seen no end of directors make a fool of themselves after an initial hit, the Academy voters may, as they have been known to do, exhibit a tendency to expect people to ?earn their spurs' rather than voting for what may have been a fluke (cf Sam Mendes with American Beauty, followed by the lamentable Road to Perdition).

The writing was exceptionally dull and the plot of the movie is very unclear (which is why there are websites dedicated to the explanation of this movie). Most of the character's actions lack a definitive purpose, and those actions mostly revolve around poking fun at how big of a whack-a-doodle Donnie is, which is highly offensive in my view. Sometimes offensive actions can go unnoticed by sharp writing and a dynamic plot, but they just exacerbate the tediousness of getting through these 2 hours of film. I truly fail to understand how this movie can get a "cult" following status. Cult movies usually are highly exciting, whether they be via comedy, horror, drama, romance, or thrill. This film does not meet any of those standards in my view, which is why I rate it a 1.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darkness is as Darko does...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad / The dreams in which I'm dyin' are the best I've ever had... -- Mad World, Tears For Fears.The Tears For Fears song, Mad World, closes DONNIE DARKO. As it softly meanders under the closing montage of characters, everything in this movie clacks into place in your head... it is like tension released between your shoulder blades; like the exhalation of breath after holding it in sympathy with Gene Hackman trapped in THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE. DONNIE DARKO will quietly enmesh you in its intrigue, spiraling to a morbid climax where nothing makes sense - until everything makes sense. Or not.The jet engine through the bedroom roof is the key. Or is it the giant sinister rabbit? Some might say the death of Donnie's newly minted girlfriend Gretchen (Jena Malone) was the catalyst that caused Donnie to make the fateful decision of restoring balance to the universe... Movie opens with young Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) awakening on a hillside road, disoriented. Just before he moves out of frame, something catches our eye and disorients US: instead of retaining the worried look on his face, a wry smile crosses it. There is more here than meets the eye. The opening song gives away more of the theme than we realize - INXS's Never Tear Us Apart: "I was standing / You were there / Two worlds collided / And they could never tear us apart..."The normalcy of Donnie's average American family makes everything that happens to him seem doubly strange. Besides sleepwalking and waking in strange places, he sees visions of a person in a rabbit suit, named Frank, who tells him in a Vader-like voice that he has 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds, before the world will end.The space-time continuum is out of sync and teen outcast Donnie is somehow connected with its repair. We cannot begin to understand how, and neither can he. Set in the tree-lined suburbs of Anywhere USA (maybe California?) during the year 1988, two parallel time lines are inexplicably interwoven, and only Donnie's unwitting power of mentally accessing both can restore balance. DONNIE DARKO could be the most subtle "superhero" movie ever made - one in which the superhero (Darko) is unaware of the powers he accesses and in which we the audience are also kept from knowing his true powers. Never realizing we are watching a "super" hero because there's no dead giveaway of wearing his undies on the outside of his pants. The writer's own explanation: that someone from an alternate, tangential universe (Frank) is trying to get through to this universe to rectify the rip in space-time. And Donnie is the willing, though unknowing, receptacle.Unlike BACK TO THE FUTURE (Donnie gives a nod to the "time machine shaped like a DeLorean"), where events in the present are traced to events in the past, time here is juggled and twisted back on itself in a tip-of-the-tongue madness. Writer-director Richard Kelly constructs a time travel mythology - not scientific in any way - based around this movie's plot; expounded in a mysterious book that Donnie is bequeathed by his science teacher (Noah Wyle, who has the misfortune to resemble vanilla-pussy Breckin Meyer). Thematically touching on alternate universes, time portals, membrane theory, this movie itself is some kind of time capsule, as it captures Patrick Swayze at the tail-end of his dancing career (DIRTY DANCING was a loooong time ago), Katherine Ross from an era before that (BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID), Jake Gyllenhaal at the start of his storied career (sowing the seeds of intensity that would bring him many acting awards and an Oscar nod), Seth Rogen as a glorified extra with two lines, long before he was the ribald voice of a generation (in true Rogen fashion, his first line to Jena Malone is "I like your boobs!"); Drew Barrymore's interest in this film enabled its funding, yet she seems to be in a strange space-time sandwich here (between two Adam Sandler turds and two CHARLIE'S ANGELS debacles). Holmes Osbourne is Donnie's fun father and Mary McDonnell his strangely detached mother. Then there is Jake's sister Maggie, playing Donnie's sister Elizabeth, spectacularly beautiful and young, her smile as radiant as Donnie's head-bowed sneer is ominous, like a supernova in a universe of sputtering candles, simultaneously cherubic and hotter than a devil's pancake. She is the cutest thing I have ever seen. Quite the sensual feat when up against the jailbait-cute Jena Malone (grown to legal age since her pivotal role in CONTACT).DONNIE DARKO was released in the United States just after "9/11," so was lost amidst the psychological debris of W's inadequacies - at preventing the attack and then at botching its response. A messianic tale of sacrifice too layered to be appreciated in one viewing does not usually play well with dunderhead American audiences at the best of times, let alone the worst of times. Ignorant marketing as a teen comedy didn't help. Luckily, the dweeb brigade rediscovered the film and cultified it.Donnie's cheerful laugh in the final scenes, when he knows his timeline is about to collapse under a jet engine, is as ominous and incongruous as his opening wry smile. But maybe Donnie should not have sacrificed himself. Look at the timeline we ended up in: W's reign of terror after abrogating his vow and constitutional duty of keeping America safe. Might we have been better off if Donnie had let the rabbit live?--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko Explained</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've decided to write this review because of the so many people who miss the ridiculously obvious meaning to this movie and then go on and on about what it means. It is a simple "Finding God before you die" story. Early in the movie, Donnie Darko is killed by the engine falling through his roof, but instead you see him being rescued by becoming Schizophrenic - symbolizing that he's out of touch with reality and living in another world. This is where the tangent universe begins. From there we see him go on a soul searching process that ends with him seeing the face of Jesus in the clouds just before the tangent universe collapses and he is killed by the engine that killed him earlier. That's it, that's the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Theories on why it became cult</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, it wasn't as good as I remembered although it does have its strong qualities. I think it became cult because of 3 of those in particular: the memorable confusing ending, the great eighties soundtrack and the central character who's a dark (;), troubled and rebellious teen. I should also say that the overall mysterious tone and "impending doom" atmosphere helps a lot in its appeal. When that weird surreal guy in a rabbit suit with the freaky mask tells Donnie the world will end in 28 days at the very start of the movie, you want to know what will happen and the plot slowly builds up on the suspense while being clever enough to make you doubt Donnie's grip on reality. I quite enjoyed the jabs on American conservatism. Jake Gyllenhaal did very well portraying the awkwardness and ambiguity of Donnie. The secondary characters were all very good and you wish there was more with them (probably in the Director's cut which I haven't seen). It's definitely worth watching for fans of teen or quirky movies.Rating: 7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, but with a few flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can understand how some people may dislike the movie: the confusing ending, the overrated praises of a few movie elitists, and whatnot.Some of the theories presented within the movie are rather contradictory, or half-baked. For example, when Donnie talks to the science teacher about time travel, the teacher states that Einstein's theory of time travel would allow Donnie to go back in time. However, the theory states that one cannot go back in time, but only slow down time for themselves. That is my only flaw with the movie, but it's understandable, since the theories must be bent in order to make the movie flow.I enjoyed watching everyone's performance, especially the talent Jake Gyllenhall. The subtle actions of others, and the fragility of everyone's emotions. Everyone from Cherita(the obese girl with a crush on Donnie) to Mrs. Farmers(gym teacher), were brilliant in portraying their characters. Oh yes, if anyone wants an explanation for the ending: Consider in the Terminator theory. The Terminator(yes, the one from the movie)is sent back in time to stop a nuclear holocaust from happening. However, if he succeeds the mission in the past, he would not be created in the future, because his existence depends on the holocaust happening. Meaning that parallel universes may exist to support this theory. In one universe, the nuclear holocaust occurs, and the Terminator exists; in the other, there in no nuclear holocaust, the Terminator does not exist. Apply this theory to Donnie Darko then; in one universe, Donnie survives the jet engine falling into his room, he meets the girl, enjoys the last few days before Frank's prediction of the end of the world. In the other universe, he dies in the jet engine crash, he never meets the girl, Frank never appears. Sorry if I hurted your brain. :)</fullReview>

One thing that made me watch this movie was the text "time travel" and the fact that it is labeled as sci-fi movie. I do not know what this movie is, but it is not a sci-fi movie, psychological drama or something like that maybe. In truth this movie was huge disappointment. If you like a movie where nothing makes sense, this is the one for you. Some people might say that the movie is smart and you have to understand it to appreciate it. Pfff.

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is an amazing motion picture. What does this movie really mean? Did Donnie find a portal to another dimension? Was it at all real? The film is wide open to interpretation. Its relatively flawless and a true gem. It is funny, it is scary, it is ominous, it is bittersweet and terrifyingly beautiful. Jake Gyllenhal's performance was fantastic as was everybody else. The cinematography is great and the music is some of the best ever put on film. The cult status this film now has is largely due to its wickedly twisted plot. What did it all really mean?

		<fullReview>What an incredible movie, absolutely amazing.. If I could give it more than ten stars, it would probably end up with the highest marking again. I'm a(n) (amateur) philosopher myself, often wondering what would happen if a time line is changed, what would happen in parallel universes and what would've been the impact in doing so. This movie greatly describes one or more of many theories I came up with too. I may be very prejudiced about this movie; I like bizarre schizophrenic/haunting (The Jacket, Cube, Truman Show), confronting/disturbing (Requiem For A Dream) and complex (Eternal Sunshine Of A Spotless Mind, The Jacket) stories. This is all accompanied by an exquisite soundtrack, probably one of the best I know, and I say this as a fervent collector of movie scores. The music was as psychedelic as it had to be at the right moments, but as tender as it could be at the more delicate moments. Very subtle and beautiful.Simply a "wow" to this movie, I can't think of a better way to describe it. I wish more movies could be so simple yet complex or making you think about life, just like Donnie Darko.. It just kept me quiet.</fullReview>

I didn't mind the additional information from playing the truly unique hunt-n-click game on the official websites (yes he even gave us fake newspaper websites), but the director's cut is like being hit over the head with a sledgehammer. It's clunky and all too well spelled out. A blind baboon with dyslexia could follow it. Truly credit must be given to Sam Bauer and Eric Strand (editors) who valiantly cut out enough of Kelly's idiocy to make him look brilliant.

		<shortDescription>Gutsy and brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes a lot of guts to purposefully make a movie that makes no sense, especially if it's meant to be serious. But strangely, "Donnie Darko" works because it hints at so many things, which are explained with just enough information, that it's always captivating.Donnie Darko (a terrific Jake Gyllenhall) is an already troubled kid when the movie starts. But when a mysterious bunny rabbit draws him away from his house, thus saving him from a fatal accident, the real story starts.Apart from what Iv'e said before, there are two things that are really surprising about this movie: how professional it looks, and the star power it has. According to the IMDb trivia, "Donnie Darko" had a 5 million dollar budget. But this film looks as professional as any other film that's released with a budget fifty times that. That's especially interesting considering the star power it has. Either Richard Kelly was very good at selling his script, or all the actors immediately got everything just by reading it (which I would have thought impossible because a lot of the stuff that happens is very visual). I guess it also helps that Drew Barrymore is an executive producer. Whatever it is, it worked, and the movie is all the better for it.This is a love it or hate it movie. If you don't like to think when you watch movies, you'd probably be better off staying away from this one. You're not "invited" to think during this movie, thinking is pretty much a necessity. It's that complex. But for those who are willing to give this a try, the experience is well worth your time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely unique</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is, well, a perplexing film. Trying to describe the full plot here would be nearly impossible.Let's just say it centers around a teenager who is nearly crushed by a jet engine that lands in his bedroom after falling off a passing plane. After this, very strange events begin to occur. As if a jet engine crashing through his ceiling wasn't surreal enough, he starts to get disturbing prophecies from a guy in a demonic bunny suit. He notices "ripples" in reality and begins reading obscure astrophysics texts about time travel and fate. My interpretation is that some sort of rip has occurred in time and space. It seems he was supposed to be crushed by the jet engine, but wasn't in the right place at the right time. Somehow, by cheating fate, he has entered a tangent reality. For the remainder of the film, Donnie is trying to figure out exactly what's going on before the "real" world comes to an apocalyptic end. There are plenty of other interpretations, including that maybe none of this ever really happened. Maybe it all occurred in Donnie's dying mind as he was crushed by the jet engine. Alternatively we learn that he does see a psychiatrist, so perhaps he's mentally disturbed and this has all been some sort of fantasy. It's impossible to say for sure. Be wary of anyone who claims to have figured out what actually happened. I'm not sure the film gives the audience enough clues to make a definitive hypothesis. It's a fascinating plot that's sort of like a Rubik's Cube you can never solve.In the process of hatching this intricate and baffling plot, the movie is wonderfully atmospheric, creepy, funny and clever. It's sort of a mix of different genres, and does them all well: teen, sci-fi, horror, fantasy and dark comedy all rolled into one. I'm not sure what the filmmakers were trying to say. Perhaps something about fate or destiny? Something about self-sacrifice? I can honestly say I have never seen anything quite like it. How many movies have you ever seen that separated themselves from the pack as one-of-a-kind? Just on that basis alone it's worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dreamy, intriguing and paradoxical story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An intriguing, paradoxical and dreamlike movie about...well, that's the question. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie Darko, a teenage boy who, one day, has a jet-engine drop onto his bed, seemingly from nowhere. We learn some things about Donnie...he is on medication...he sees weird things. Maybe the things he sees are the result of his medical condition, or the drugs he takes for it...or, what happens in the movie is real...could involve time travel and alternate planet Earths. The entire movie plays like a dream-which is to say it is dreamy. Some of it is a bit creepy and disturbing...so, this isn't really a movie for the kiddies.The main 'hook' of the movie is a countdown to some impending catastrophe which Donnie is trying to avert...every now and again text on the screen alerts us to the time remaining until something horrible will happen.Hopefully this description isn't too off-putting. There is humour in this movie and it is very poignant towards the end. I said before that the movie was paradoxical...which is to say that any movie dealing in this sort of subject matter will bang up against the same kind of wall. However, for me at least, I didn't let the paradoxes get in the way of appreciating this story. It probably doesn't really make sense, but you know what is being attempted and you are happy to play along with it. In any case, the movie does tie up neatly (sort of!) the issues it has been dealing with.Can't omit a truly wonderful sequence in this movie...when I saw this movie for the first time on SBS TV a couple of years ago, I think, I was reminded of what an all time classic song "Head over heels" by Tears For Fears was. That is one of the great 'pure' pop songs of all time. It is featured in this movie...brilliantly. The sequence is dreamy and a bit like a music video. Can't tell you how aesthetically pleasing it is (presumably it works better the more you like the song though!).Seth Rogen cameos in this film-his debut? Check out "12 monkeys" if you like this kind of territory. It too is dreamy.</fullReview>

At the start Donnie's out of the house and doesn't get killed by the falling engine but at the end he goes back in time than Splat! He dies. The look that Donnie's mum gives at the end is a mystery to me and still confuses me.

		<fullReview>There are many ways to interpret Donnie Darko. Many seem to take this all very literally and it's SF/Fantasy film. Some find it pointless and too full of plot holes and things that can't be explained (the SF hardcore have explanations for these things...). To me, it is a view of what a functional psychologically challenged young man might see - and how everything is fits with his different internal logic and how beautiful that world can be. The non-standard associations that he makes are akin to what an artist (or for that matter, a good scientist) might make. This is really, really hard to do - most of the time it comes off as super-lame or at best forced art-house stuff but Donnie Darko brings it off and we are able to accept Donnie's magical world (props to Jake Gyllenhaal).Sort of a magic psycho-realism (if you -like - get what I'm trying to say man...).The hardcore SF people would probably say that is a cop-out explanation and normally I would agree - but not this time. If you know paranoid schizophrenics - you know and understand Donnie Darko...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent blend of Sci-Fi, Drama and Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought this movie on DVD like 2 months before I watched it. The reason why I didn't watch it was that I was expecting one of the most disturbing films ever, so I never wasn't really "in the mood" so to speak. I wanted to see it, but it seemed like there never wasn't time for a movie like it. So one day I decided "What the heck? I have to see it in some point anyways.." so I watched it with my brother and friend. Looking at the trailers, the reviews, the plot outlines and everything it had to be sick, right? Well, the disturbance level wasn't even near the level I personally was expecting. Honestly, it isn't even disturbing apart from a couple of scenes.The movie tells about what the title says, a teenager named Donnie Darko. Donnie may seem like an ordinary American guy, who lives with his family in a sleepy suburb. Nothing could be farther away from the truth; 18-year old Donnie has a large bunny rabbit named Frank as his imaginary friend, who inspires Donnie to do things which seem to be unreasonable. Frank saves Donnie's life when a huge aeroplane's engine falls in middle of the boy's room. Donnie "investigates" the bizarre accident and finds out unbelievable things that lets him to manipulate the streams of time and space. Donnie travels through daring and secret paths, he tries to understand the chaotic, raging universe around him and he finally sees the truth; Even the smallest acts can have serious consequences.The film itself is a great blend of science fiction, mystery and drama. It cleverly leaps between the real world and the imaginary world, and it does it with such a credibility that the viewer won't get lost in any part of the movie, it stays in a tight package throughout. The screenplay is fantastic, it doesn't bother you with any unnecessary or pointless subplots or scenes, it stays in the main theme all the time and the end solution is just brilliant. Through the vision of Richard Kelly, who has written and directed the film, "Donnie Darko" offers you an intensive and interesting movie experience, which can not be compared to any other films because it's also original and pretty unique in its own genre. Although the film is pretty dark and gloomy, it still doesn't affect you as much as you could imagine, as the story's just so interesting you'll get hooked to it and instead of thinking how dark the movie is you keep on thinking of the twists and turns, and how brilliant the movie itself is.Donnie is played by Jake Gyllenhaal who is outstanding in the role. Just like the leaping between the real world and the imaginary world in the story, also the character itself changes between these leaps which makes it pretty enjoyable to watch because of Gyllenhaal's strength on the screen. The character progresses really well too, as when we start off the movie the character is totally different in both of the "worlds" but as we move along the character crafts into a person who's surprisingly similar in the real world and the imaginary one. There are good actors in other roles too, for example Maggie Gyllenhaal, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore and Katharine Ross, but they are left out in minor roles as the film concentrates on Donnie after all. These characters of the supporting actors do not have that depth like the main character does, but their purpose is in fact more like complimenting the character of Donnie, which is also pretty genius. Soundtrack is also marvellous; The music's composed by Michael Andrews and like the movie itself the music also mixes between soft and dark pieces of fine compositions. It's sometimes beautiful and it's sometimes really dark like the main theme, which works really well with the build-up of the film."Donnie Darko" is definitely one to watch, but only if you're open minded with films or if you just happen to be a sci-fi addict. If you're expecting heavy disturbance like I was don't be fooled, as even when you get something disturbing it isn't nearly as disturbing as you could imagine, so don't let the plot outlines or trailers fool you. To me "Donnie Darko" is all in all a great movie and at times it's pretty thrilling as well. It isn't sick or gross, it's a fine piece of film making which works really well in all of its styles, drama, mystery and sci-fi. Although it is a short film you should watch it when you really have the time for it, as it's just not one of those movies you can watch when ever you want to, it requires that certain mood which I was telling you about. Even when this is a movie which probably (and still) gets mixed opinions from really negative to really positive you should just see it yourself and make up your own mind. No-one's going to make it up for you anyways, so it's your decision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though I think Donnie Darko is the best movie ever, its not for everyone. I'm not quite sure what it is about this movie but half the people who watch this movie either completely love this movie or they completely hate it. Of course the people who don't like science fiction and horror movies won't like this movie.The main plot of this film is a very different one indeed. A high School student that suffers from emotional problems under goes strange events of seeing a 6 foot tall Bunny Rabbit at night. This bunny rabbit had woke him up late at night, and told Donnie to come to him. After Donnie reaches the rabbit at a golf course, the rabbit tells Donnie the world will come to a end in 28 days. Donnie then wakes up at the golf course and hurries home finding that a jet engine has fell from the sky and landed in his room. Through out the film Donnie must realize his dark destiny, under go high school, and life as we know it. This film is truly a masterpiece containing mixed genres such as science fiction, drama, romance, mystery, and much much more.After I saw this movie I went to the store and bought it right away. I then showed it to my cousin Joey, he loved the movie and it became one of his favorite movies. I showed it to my friend Nathan and he didn't see the point of the movie and called it retarded.So honest to god truth, there's no way to know if you will like this movie or not. Some people see this movie and it makes them feel good inside and reminds them about life in general but they don't understand the movie itself. Its a very hard thing to explain but when I see this movie I get this feeling. But some people will watch this movie and call it the most ridiculous movie ever. So all I can say is to watch this movie yourself and see if you see this movie the same way I do.</fullReview>

I also enjoy offensive language in film, especially when it is blurted out at just the right time. Vulgarity, vandalism, overbearing authority, teen angst, psychotherapy, time travel, uncomfortable silences - this film has it all! It's also VERY SPOOKY! It's the perfect cult film to watch every Halloween - along with many other great psychological/horror films. I love it so much, I cannot find fault with this movie. Every artist plays his/her part perfectly. If you grew up in white suburbia during the 1980's, you will feel like you are back home! This film will lure you, entertain you, trap you, excite you, disgust you, and enthrall you! It's like an emotional roller-coaster that swoops through popular American culture, young lust, clinical depression, bold individualism, the deteriorating nuclear family, and the supernatural without losing the viewer's interest for a second. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Purely peerless piece of art!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I was sitting up late at night one day when Donnie Darko was about to show. I didn't really watch it that intense at first, nor did I care about the film due to its title. But as I start watching (at about the middle of the film) i suddenly fell for it. After watching it through I went and bought it to watch it again."Donnie Darko is a film about mystery. A thriller that will leave you shivering for days to come." Is that true? Oh yes... In fact it might just be one of the best thrillers out there. The story is greatly well balanced, the characters are great as well, and the actors (especially Gyllenhaal) have made such a great contribution to this film.Even though it's a thriller the story is quite complex. Really, it all depends on how understanding YOU are when it comes to films like these. I had to watch the film like three of four times until I had the complete pattern before me regarding this film's story and meaning.Also, the music composed is simply PERFECT for this kind of film. It gives you this kind of spooky feeling which makes you shiver from the great perfection of this film.To sum it all up: Donnie Darko is not just a great thriller. Donnie Darko is one of those thrillers that will stick to your memory for years to come. It's simply a film you won't deny watching over and over and over again. Clearly this must be the best film of Richard Kelly. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What? Huh? ... Really?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie's plot was unbearably incomprehensible. Simple as that. There are hundreds of different explanations as to what the heck was going on and the only one that really matters is the director's. But guess what? His explanation is the worst of them all and exposes what a fraud this picture is. Tangent Universes? Artifacts? Manipulated Dead? Tell me he's joking.There is no way, NO WAY, anyone watching this movie could come to the director's conclusion without hearing it straight from the horse's mouth. The movie certainly doesn't contain the answer the director has given us.Now think about that for a second. Nobody (even the people who love the movie) could have truly seen the director's vision on screen. What's worse is that it was more than likely purposefully withheld from us. Like the director worried we'd think it would all be too simple so he hid his "secrets". Your supposed to be telling a story A-Hole! Not painting a Picasso. Even once you've been spoon-fed all the answers on the web or through the director's commentary, they're still full of holes and the actions of Donnie Darko still make little sense. At times his actions are the equivalent of blowing up an entire country just to kill an ant hill.Does that sound like a top 250 movie to you? A movie where the directors vision can not be seen without him explaining it to you? To me, that's the very definition of a FAILURE! The movie should be the explanation, even if it's subtle. Donnie Darko stands alone in it's creators mind. Now only if he would have let us in during the 2 hours in which the movie was actually playing. How in the world was I supposed to surmise tangent universes, alternate time and space continuum's, living receivers, manipulated dead and the like by watching this movie? If I was even possibly able to surmise such events I would be handing this movie a 10 in a heartbeat, but as it stands I have been left out in the cold by the director and this is never a good thing.The acting was good, the mystery fantastic, the suspense unbelievable, the delivery ... horrid!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different angle: Frank is an evil one, sort of Bob from the Twin Peaks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is my Top 3 movie of all time. It is similar in its impact to the Mothman Prophecies with its dark optimism, but way bigger.I haven't read The Philosophy of Time Travel yet, but saw vague allusions to Twin Peaks, and came up with a different approach to the plot. The idea of "corrupted" Universe being "fixed" by Frank through weird acts has its grounds, but after all black holes and E-R wormholes are permanent phenomena and don't necessarily imply on "corruption" of the (infinite) Universe. These portals simply exist, and some beings can make use of them.I think Frank on one side is a thoughtful serial killer who enjoys his supernatural powers and plays with people and their dreams the way he wishes, spies after them, push them to death and even kill some here and there. On the other side he's a young guy that has a name and even a girlfriend (his cover).Franks says, his male ancestors were named Frank, and judging by Ed Darko's comments on a bed in the hotel, a guy named Frankie died on his way to a teenage party in days of D's parents' youth (strange coincidence!). So it is probable that Frank's clan has always been doomed to die of young age (early 20s, it seems). Knowing this, F might have tried to cheat his own future too or maybe even was a multi-dimensional thrill ride freak (like in "Retroactive")! I might be wrong, but Frank looks a bit like a native Indian to me, which only adds to "the other reality" spice, ensuing typical means of interacting with it (hinting on Don Castaneda and Indian magic and all that there is in altered states).Suppose Frank is a being similar to Bob from Twin Peaks. Is F a good guy? Over the course of the movie I couldn't find any proof to that. He's got some Master Plan of his own, and only the events and end results reveal his real nature: a spider playing with a fly. Franks is an ESP being that sees the world in 4D, and he lives in both realities and is also capable of reading other people's minds and affecting them through their dreams. That is he exists in many realities and it's even hard to say which one is real. I'd even call him an eternal being that sheds his skin and cheats his fate or plays games with it. He is also capable of sharing his enormous powers by inducing those in his preys as well (Donnie's power to be invisible, drive an ax deep inside solid bronze sculpture etc.).The movie more or less delivers 3 "time loops". Loop 1 ends in the episode with the plane engine fall in Donnie's room. Loop 2 can be called "Frank playing the cat-and-mouse game with Donnie" ? finalizing with death of G &amp; F (and possibly Gretchen's mother + Rose, Samantha and those on the plane, too). Loop 3 realizes Frank's plan with eventual death of D from the loop 1 engine. In the end we see F still alive (sitting on the floor touching his right eye as if to check that this time it's there ? so he's won, the game's over). G is also alive.If Frank would have wanted to save D (and D believed he would), he'd have done it. No matter how you turn it, the cause of all Donnie's troubles in loop 2 is Frank. That's why the theory that he's a serial killer in a rabbit's suit (or the one trying to escape his own death in loop 2) appears plausible to me.D is not sick, he's pretty sane and is much smarter than most of his peers, but he's affected by F most of the time. The treatment he gets is water placebos and useless talks with his shrink. I can easily suggest that Frank KNEW that in one of the possible realities (universes) Donnie would kill him after death of Gretchen. And F could manipulate/ foresee the events, let's not forget that. When D+G were happily sitting in the movie, the Manipulated Dead Frank (with the already smashed eyeball ? which he kept hidden behind the rabbit mask from the very start) asked D to forgive him ("I'm so sorry" ? for killing G!) and soon D FELT (thanks to his superpowers) that F was "going to kill" someone (hypnotherapy episode ? but he didn't know WHO the prey would be).Now what if F enjoyed using his superpowers and simply played with objects and people as a crazy juggler? What if he was an evil being who simply drove others to craziness or death? He had known beforehand that in THIS reality he'd eventually get killed by D after hardly unintentional (F could see the future!) killing G! He didn't want to end up like his ancestors and he started playing that fishy game. He played "saving" D and the Universe on one hand only to reverse the situation and kill G &amp; D. It slightly resembles of Bradbury's "A Sound of Thunder" (doomed to die T-Rexes are hunted on by thrill-loving guys from the future). And if we weigh positive and negative end results, the bad outweighs.Re. R.Sparrow. She's gone through some experiences of 4D nature (as a heavily praying nun she might have found herself in an altered state or gained the ESP abilities. She simply KNEW about the parallel universe(s) and saw things and tried to explain them, but couldn't change/ affect things or people, it seems. And ended up in seclusion and mental disability with the only thought that someone would send her a letter (clairvoyance). Again, if she'd be sane or as powerful as F, she'd somehow save G and D (and don't forget: she after all caused F make a turn resulting in killing G!).</fullReview>

Director's skill is do not tell us how Donnie has learnt all this, but everyone can construe in different way: from this it will depend if you like the movie or you hate it. Neither Donnie really has understood how can he know destiny, perhaps it's all an omen, but he had to consider these premonitions to verify if it was just a joke or he really can do something to modify happenings. An excellent cast and an impeccable direction do this movie a real masterpiece; perhaps a little bit complicated to follow: if you don't value at the first watching, try to watch it again and you will agree it's worthwhile!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the Director's Cut Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Troubled adolescent, Donnie Darko, receives a disturbing vision that the world will end in 28 days. With the help of various characters, including a 6 foot rabbit called Frank, he slowly discovers the mysterious physical and metaphysical laws that govern his life and that will lead up to the destruction of the universe.I have just finished watching the director's cut of this film, never have seen the original (finally!). I have to say this movie makes you think a lot, like Mulholland Drive. It turns out something more than you expect the plot to be, which is why I liked the movie.This film is also confusing and needed some help for some explaining that I didn't get in the film. Now I finally get this whole movie and thought it was clever but not as much as you follow on with the movie, which is why I'm not giving this a perfect rating.This film is dark, disturbing, and sometimes shocking like Mulholland Drive and The Butterfly Effect, a similar movie to Donnie Darko. The acting by Jake Gyllenhaal is really good with this weird role.There might be a time where you watch the movie, think about it, and you've thought of a plot hole. There could be a plot hole in the movie but some people may think it isn't. If you like movies that make you think, turns out to be really clever, watch Donnie Darko.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has some interesting ideas but they aren't well executed. It's also poorly written and poorly directed - notice how little Kelly has accomplished in the years since? It's also worth noting that "Executive Producer" Drew Barrymore's performance is execrable. I feel compelled to emphasize this film's downside because it is so vastly overrated by fans who are willing to supplement its many shortcomings with their own imaginations. It is worth seeing and it is gratifying to anyone who wishes they had had the courage to take a stand against nitwit teachers in high school the way Donnie does.

		<fullReview>In short, this film had very few good points. The music was one of them, but even then I despair because the best piece is a cover.Plot summary: Kid becomes a superhero of sorts by being able to manipulate events in a 'tangent universe', a sort of 'what-if' world that may have been if a certain crisis would have been avoided. In the end, the angsty-wannabe-superhero realizes that, like, the world totally would have like, been better off and stuff if he would totally just have like died. So, he does. Which, in turn, makes the angsty teenage population of the US think that they can, like, wow, totally relate and stuff because sometimes they totally feel like the world could be a better place without them and that they should die, too.I wish that were the message of the film, but there really wasn't a message at all. Had that been the message of the film, and were that message to be taken seriously, the world might indeed be MADE a better place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-hyped, Faux Intellectual Guff (With some nice moments)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tried to like this movie. I really did. No one can deny "Donnie Darko's" unerring popularity, especially among teenagers; the impact of many of its images; the valiant effort of a first time writer director attempting to do something a bit different. These are noble aspirations for a new auteur, attempting to be original; and many newbies fail even to reach these giddy heights. But these, alone, are not enough to render this movie a classic. Indeed, Donnie Darko fails to come together on any satisfactory level.In discussing this movie, I will try not to spoil, for fear of incurring the wrath of the Mods, so those of you who have seen the film can work out which bits I am talking about.First, the story. Donnie Darko is a modern filmwork par excellence. It is all impact and without lasting aesthetic merit. Think to the power of the opening images: DD with the axe; the Rabbit; the Greene quote; the Old Woman looking for the letter. This cacophony of high impact "visual bites" are blasted at us one after the other. But they are simply not examined: not rigorously taken apart - in an aesthetic sense. Those film works which endure are those which go for quality over quantity, enable us to see things in a new light by recreating the familiar anew; by deconstructing a few visual ideas: not machine gunning us with poster images.The Master of the Best Way, ironically, is one Robert Rodriguez. At 23, he begins a shootout with a Police dude throwing a bag of food at his colleague and switching on the TV. At 27 he's beginning a story about a dead whore in a hotel room with a Dad trying to comb his son's uncombable hair. You want enduring aesthetic brilliance? Look no further. You see, Rodriguez works because he understands that the story is a conveyance for the images. Donnie Darko neglects this essentially important fact. Its images stand alone, pulled together only by their own strength, not by the action reflecting the image, as if it were a prism. By the end of Donnie Darko, I was waiting for the payoff that would pull together all these vaguely interesting but increasingly tiresome little vignettes. And it never came. The ending, I have to say, was pretty lame.I could go on, but I can't be bothered. That's one facet of the movie. It's an amateurish work - but then it was made by a newbie. FOR A NEWBIE, it's very good. Excellent. FOR A TEEN MOVIE, it's very good. Excellent. But in terms of lasting intellectual or aesthetic merit from the point of view of the great tradition of cinema that we enjoy - hell, even from the point of view of sheer entertainment - I really wanted my two hours back by the end. And don't get me started on the dialog... :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite by coincidence, I watched this film back-to-back with "Harvey." "Donnie Darko" was definitely the inferior giant rabbit movie.Every once in a while, a movie aimed at teenagers comes along that just completely zings past me. And when I run to catch up with it, I find that it wasn't worth the effort. This is that kind of movie. I simply found the pacing too slow, and the message too obscure, to become really involved. Most of the pleasure I got out of this movie was in seeing good actors who have been out of circulation for a while.I'm not saying that this was terrible by any means - it's got a good atmosphere and a good build-up, but it poofs out at the end - rather like a big, clunky, plummeting, malfunctioning jet engine.</fullReview>

Toward the beginning it was a little intriguing, but quickly degenerated into what amounted to a very bad Stephen King novel (the person reading "It" toward the beginning was interesting...). I could imagine King writing something like this, and I can also imagine myself putting it down before getting 1/3 of the way through.The ending made no sense to me whatsoever, other than the fact that "time went backward" or something, and he had really been killed by the engine (?). Gosh, how original. The characters were all dull oppressed zombies, and the final 15 minutes of this insufferable film had to be the most painful of all... this almost became the first movie I turned off *in the last 15 minutes*.Someone commented that you had to have had emotional problems to understand this movie. Don't think so. "Pump up the Volume" I liked a lot... this one was a total waste of time. Can I go back to before I put the film in the VCR and have an airplane engine fall on my head?

The first three quarters of the movie are interesting, an exploration of mental illness, blurring lines between imagination and reality and interesting camera shots that I thought illustrated the workings of a mind of a schizophrenic.How very wrong I was.The last quarter of the movie answers a number of questions, and opens up several new ones that you can't understand if you watched a movie. Literarily. You need the DVD commentary and the web site and an imaginary book to understand what happened. After you read through those (the web site includes much of the imaginary book, but it requires you figure out different passwords), you find out the plot is actually on the level of one of the particularly poor Star trek episodes. The mental illness a red herring and the interesting camera shots were ... just that. Interesting camera shots. Not intended to show anything at all, apparently, since all the vital points are in the material that comes with the movie, and so pathetic you're better off not knowing them at all.Overall I find the movie extremely overrated. I gave it a 2 because if your house caught fire half an hour before it ended and you'd never go back to see the ending and figure out the plot line, you'd be left with an impression of a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did Donnie the pyromaniac set fire to the script's ending?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard about the large bunny before seeing this large lump of confusion, I was instantly stricken with fear - fear of getting as bored as with the damn unfunny rabbit in "Harvey", one of the worst comedies of all time. Ironically, the rabbit in DD was the best aspect of the movie; the appearance and the voice were effective. However, the story is a bit of a mess; many loose ends, too many irrelevant characters, and an ending that is a major f**k-up. The "grand finale" is a rushed job, so lacking in logic that there is nothing to redeem it. The way Malone gets killed was absurd: her and the gay cowboy getting jumped by the school-bullies was incredibly dumb, and even worse was the way that whole segment was directed: did Kelly run out of money? I doubt it; his inexperience as a 25 year-old writer and director showed. As for the time travel, all we're shown is something vaguely resembling a worm-hole, an absurd scene in which DD's mother and sister are in a plane that is about to crash - and suddenly we're back to day one: DD is dead, killed by that soft jet engine (soft, because it failed to crush the entire house as it should have), and DD sacrificed himself for his love, Malone. Get your handkerchiefs out!Kelly is the son of a NASA scientist who worked on the 70s Mars mission. That pretty much explains how he managed to get his foot in the door and be a writer/director of a major production at 25. However, it contradicts his lack of understanding of science. Apart from the jet engine failing to completely annihilate the Darko house and everyone in it (due to modern airplanes being made out of sponge, apparently), Kelly also has trouble with the concept of time-travel. Actually, he should have asked his Dad to explain to him a few things about it. Time-travel is VERY tricky in any story, especially when you touch on it with such a lack of seriousness as Kelly does.Kelly's DD is one big indulgence piece. He plays his favourite childhood songs in their entirety (which in the case of the first Tears for Fears song was quite pleasant, actually), he introduces unnecessary characters just for the hell of it, and he proudly exhibits his left-wing leanings by siding with Dukakis. Kelly was smart enough, though, to know that a script gets sold in Hollywood FAR more easily when it has any kind of pro-liberal Reagan-bashing in it. So predictable...Any of you aspiring Hollywood writers, remember this: throw in as many politically correct/anti-Republican messages in your stories, and the odds of you selling your script quadruple, at the very least.The cast is weak. I have rarely seen a movie with this much nepotism in it. Both Gyllenhaal kids are nepotistic brood; but while Maggie is charming (though almost non-present with only several scenes), her brother Jack is an amateur. This gay cowboy's grimacing was occasionally embarrassing to watch, and he simply isn't the caliber of actor/gay cowboy to carry a movie. Jena Malone is cute and quite solid. Swayze, another nepotistic actor, is unconvincing; both the accent and the line-delivery are quite awful. Drew Barrymore? What can I say about Drew?? Awful as ever! However, while I can bear to see her playing airheads, trying to watch her as an English teacher(!) was a chore. It would be like watching Susan Sarandon playing a U.S. President in a drama, complete with her Southern twang, the one she uses so often. Drew's brain is fried with drugs and alcohol she massively stuffed herself with in her PRE-teens, and it really is obvious. She looks as if she hasn't read a book in her life, so the casting is idiotic. But why be surprised: she is one of the executive producers here, so who could stop her from materializing her wish to finally play someone with a three-digit I.Q., that way stroking her own inferiority-complexed ego.Nevertheless, not all is bad in the DD universe. The movie is close to 2 hours long, yet kept my attention throughout. The drawback about the plot being senselessly convoluted also meant that it wouldn't be as dull. Not exactly riveting and, sure, not much of a story, but few movies are watchable nowadays, which is why the rating here isn't (too) low.If you want to see my Hollywood Nepotism List, with over 400 photos/explanations entries, contact me by e-mail.

		<shortDescription>It's time to put an end to this twaddle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film shortly after it came out, knowing little about it. I read the short synopsis in the cinema foyer and thought, "This sounds ok- let's give it a shot."I was slightly put off near the start of the movie by the family dinner scene. First, we have it rather badly shoehorned into the dialogue that Donnie is on medication, and closely followed by some "look how big and clever we are" swearing (before you get your back up, allow me to point out that one of my very favourite films is Goodfellas...). Uh-oh, it looks like this is going to be a film version of a teenager's diary.Sure enough, while there were some cracking moments in the dialogue ("I'm sure we've all seen Bonanza") and some genuinely stylish ideas (Donnie 'seeing' worm-like forms emitting from people's chests), there were also the well-worn gags about late 80s TV evangelists; self indulgent moaning about how 'nobody understands'; the frankly embarrassingly written discussion about the sexuality of the Smurfs (cinematically, a pathetic and childish attempt at the "Royal With Cheese" scene from Pulp Fiction); and quasi-surreal characters like Frank the Rabbit- surreal and amusing to the sort of people who think Avril Lavigne is Alternative, no doubt.I think the point where I really started to lose patience was when the psychiatrist pleads with Donnie, saying there's no way he could possibly not believe in any higher power or that there is no point to life. Could it be that Richard Kelly is emphasising Donnie's teenage worries that "nobody understands"- not even somebody who should remain impartial like a psychiatrist, or is it, as I suspect, just uninformed, melodramatic nonsense?Now to the ending. Surely the reason I don't like this film is because I don't understand it. Wrong. This ending is a cop out. It is not ambiguous in order to enhance the film or inspire the audience. It is ambiguous because the writer has painted himself into a corner and can't think of any other way to get out of it. The ending to Kubrick's 2001 enhances the film. This just feels tacked on.I came out of the cinema feeling that I'd seen a bit of a mixed bag. Some cracking, stylish moments, but overall a rather adolescent mess. Not one of the worst films I'd seen, but probably not one I'd be renting, either. Imagine my surprise, therefore, when I log on to the normally respectable IMDb and discover that this film has been voted the 91st greatest film ever made. I discussed this with friends and found to my distress that people I would consider intelligent put this up in their top 10 favourite films. Why?!Now, I'm not saying this film is awful; that it should be banned; that it should never have been made etc., but I really do think it's time more people came forward and cut through the dung on this one.I notice that the highest votes from this film came from males under 18. Perhaps this reflects my assertion that this is like a celluloid teenager: confused; moody; attention seeking; and annoying.Richard Kelly has produced some interesting ideas with this film. However, as a Director and especially as a Writer, he needs to mature in his work a lot more. A hell of a lot more. The hype for this film, crowning him as a great young director and the producer of a masterpiece, will, I fear, cause Kelly to stop growing and maturing, and start disappearing even further up himself. I await "Knowing" with interest, but not with much enthusiasm. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie is awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie tries too hard to be a lot of things - black comedy, parody, social commentary - but it fails miserably on all accounts. Bad acting (Jake's "acting" consists mainly of him making weird faces), lousy script, boring storyline. Yeah, it's pretty weird, but that doesn't make it good.I had to force myself to keep watching this disaster. Which is something, because I can usually sit through almost anything, but this really is that bad. It did not make me think, did not make make contemplate my existence, it didn't even make me think about what I wanted to eat for dinner. This movie isn't nearly as intelligent or complex as people are making it out to be.I do recommend you see it though. If nothing else, it'll prove to you how strange people can be...I'm not talking about the characters in the movie, but those who voted this into the Top 200. What is that all about???I can't believe this is rated higher than The Graduate and The Deer Hunter...seriously, that's absolutely ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An average, but long winded, OUTER LIMITS episode laced with modern four-letter words.Those who sat in awe watching FORREST GUMP, did not see NO TIME FOR SARGENTS nor were viewers of GOMER PYLE, USMC. Those who fell out of their chairs at the end of THE SIXTH SENSE, were never fans of THE TWILIGHT ZONE series. And likewise, those who claim that DONNIE DARKO is a never-before-seen breakthrough motion picture event, have probably never heard of David Lynch's ERASERHEAD.As the ol' saying goes, a fun soundtrack and excellent production values do not always a good movie make. DONNIE DARKO has fine actors (although they are too old to be in high school) and nice special effects. However, the screenplay and pacing have the feel of a grad student final film project.DONNIE DARKO honors David Lynch and Rod Serling. But after realizing this truth, the viewer is left thinking -- been there, done that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a film for rookie Richard Kelly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is interesting to look at some recent films by young filmmakers. Robert Rodriguez did "El Mariachi." Luc Besson did "The Fifth Element." M. Night did "Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable." And now, 25 and two years out of So. Cal. Richard Kelly did "Donnie Darko". All of them both wrote and directed. "Darko" was done on a very small $4million budget with cheap or free actors. It is true what they say about growing older, we lose our imagination, our ability to think like children, without boundaries. "Donnie Darko" is without artificial boundaries, is a work of great inspiration. However it is not easy to view and understand on its own. Watching the film twice on DVD, the second time with director commentary, is practically essential. I did just that and this is a film that will stick with me for a long time. SPOILERS - This is pure Sci-Fi, playing on the concept that time-travel is possible through a wormhole if conditions are just right. At midnight on October 2, 1988 such a thing happens, a break in the space/time continuum, and the consequences threaten the very future existence of the universe in 28 days plus a few hours. Through Devine Intervention, "Frank" is chosen to be Donnie's guide, disguised as a six-foot rabbit, and Donnie is chosen to be the super hero that will figure out how to put things right and save the universe. So Frank first has to save Donnie from the time-traveling jet engine that is about to fall into his bed, so goes to Donnie in a dream and has him go out onto the golf course. Donnie's family and many friends think he is mentally disturbed, he sees a shrink, but the medicine she prescribes are just placebos. There isn't anything wrong with him, he is just ultra-aware and very intelligent. In his waking hours he senses that he has a mission, and must piece together clues provided by Frank and others. Everyone is manipulated in this parallel universe gone off kilter, to provide situations which will lead to Donnie's correcting things. The flooding of the school. The burning of the house. The shooting of Frank in the right eye. The running over of Gretchen. Everyone, teachers, students, family, strangers, all act in small strange ways, consistent with a universe being slightly off kilter.In the final act Donnie figures out how to build a portal and pull the engine off his mom's return flight. We are not shown all the ways he does this, but when he does, time reverses for those 28 days, back to midnight October 2. Gretchen and Frank are alive again, the house has not burned, the teacher was not fired, the "proper" universe has been restored and the parallel universe non-existent. But the jet engine still falls at midnight, Donnie is in his bed. He has sacraficed his own life for everyone else, saving the whole world.This is Science Fiction. Donnie Darko is a comic book name. The writing, acting, and filmography are all first-rate. The director's commentary reveals a maturity way beyond his age of 26 or so when the commentary was recorded. My only complaint about the film is that it is bit too vague, and most audiences will not be able to appreciate its full intent without listening to the director's commentary. That's why I rate it "8" of 10, but could very easily have been a "9".</fullReview>

They speak softly, and that is supposed to create drama. Horrible movie. The entire thing was like watching a deleted scenes special feature on a DVD disc. None of the scenes made any sense.

Actors are non-existent and dull and dialogues are cheap. ...and above all the end is TERRIBLE, when they try to give a feeling of continuity with the mother and the girl who wave hands... how COULD have ever anyone said anything good about this film?

		<shortDescription>Great cast, brilliant idea.... awful film 1/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK firstly i think if this director makes another film he first needs to do some research into the topic he is addressing. As a former paranoid schizophrenic myself I consider myself one of the few people who understand the harsh reality of the condition. Therefore to see it utterly taken apart for the sake of a film, as in this case makes me extremely offended. This is a film which promised everything but gave none of it with a predictable storyline from the start. The idea of time travel aided by an imaginary creation is an amiable one and could have been developed into an awesome film, however this is not the case with Donnie Darko. I rented this film with anticipation, hoping it to be a story of a teenagers struggle for sanity in the confusing modern world, with all the heavy contemporary pressures upon his shoulders. However Donnie Darko turned out to be a crude manipulation of schizophrenia in order to make a film which essentially had more to do with time travel. I found this very frustrating! I am not a script writer and am not going to suggest how amendments could be made. But the most important thing for me was, for this film to carry the international weight that it does and to be held in such high regard simply demonstrates the public ignorance and naivety which is endemic in our modern society; concerning disease, both physical and mental. Though my word holds no real weight in my outcry i felt it essential to make my thoughts on the matter known, as it is one which, for me was a very real and traumatic experience, one that i have spent the last years of my life trying to recover from. I hope i have not offended the vast masses of Donnie Darko fans, by all means watch the film and enjoy it, i am simply highlighting the appalling manipulation of a serious medical condition to make a blockbuster. Thank you, David Rawlings</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>different strokes... if you know what I mean</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There seem to be a lot of people who like this movie. I won't argue taste, but different strokes for different folks, if you know what I mean. I won't claim to have better tastes than the average movie-watcher, but we have a group that meets every Thursday night to watch a movie and talk about it. Initially two people out of eight liked this movie, and one changed her opinion halfway through the discussion, Why are the people who do like this movie so vociferous? In my group, we all decided that it was pretentious because the filmmakers couldn't decide on what to say-- or even if they had anything to say at all. Most of us complained at some point during the movie about it's lack of authenticity. There were several points where we had to actually stop the movie to argue about whether it was worth continuing with. Again, I don't like to say i have better tastes than 90% of the rest of the country, but quite frankly, what is the appeal of this movie among IMDB viewers? Reviewers keep remarking on how much of a genius Richard Kelly is, how great the performances are, and how good the soundtrack is, but what is your basis of comparison? In my group, we finally decided the movie would appeal to persons under 23 years of age who were 6 or 7 years old and heard the music of the film through their older siblings' doors during playtime.</fullReview>

They had no real insight to the sci part of this sci-fi piece, which makes it pretty hard to enjoy much less swallow. As far as acting goes, Jake Gyllenhaal was unbelievably bad. The fact that he was cast in this part goes to show how amateur this director is. He showed no ability in any part of the film, especially when he was supposed to be either hypnotized or under the spell of Frank. And speaking of Frank, the satanic bunny, it seemed like a bad rip off of Paul McCarthy at best or just bad make up design at worse. Every once in a while during the film a title card would appear saying, THREE MORE DAYS, and that was reassuring to know that the film at most could only go on for 72 more hours.

		<shortDescription>Excellent film, but don't miss the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a wildly creative film, well directed and acted. I never thought that I would enjoy a Patrick Swayze preformance as much as I did here. Perhaps he should be cast against type more often.I have noticed, though, that a lot of the comments here have been focused on "figuring out" the ending. I have to think that's not really the point. If the ending was to be understood, it would have been explained in the film. Rather, it's an aspect of surrealism that the movie freely mixes into the film's story. Moreover, I don't think that the surrealism is simply a stylistic device, as it often in the films of David Lynch, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, or even Terry Gilliam. Instead, I think that all of the unreal aspects of the film serve as a metaphor for the film's exploration of the psychological landscape of late 80's suburbia, with it's simplistic pop psychology masking the fact that reality is never discussed. Also, everyone seems to have missed the importance of Graham Greene's short story (you should read it, by the way) in which the act of destruction is seen as the only option for escaping a reality that stifles creativity. Donnie's diversions into the unreal represent the fantasies of escape, even, if necessary, into nightmares. There is, of course, much more to the film than I have room to state here. It deserves a rather extended dissertation, and is open enough to interpretation for an entire seminar. I will just say that it is definitely worth watching, even if you are not prone to analyze films.Oh, and I'm not prone to respond to other reviews, but I really do have to correct what another (very stupid) reviewer said here. This has nothing to do with being "really cool in the early 90s and living in California". If you watched, the film gives the date 6 or 7 times, each time being in 1988. And Middlesex is in Connecticut. Get your facts straight before you review, people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko aka the plight of humanity expressed and transposed through tip-top, dysfunctional, tripe pseudo-art. The mean looking, everyday angst-ridden, emotional Mall dwelling kid does well here, staring at the screen, smirking all film like you're the father he hates and wishes to plot eradication towards. If this is good acting, then sure, take any semi-coherent, yet handsome teen off the street and fire them up, they are READY TO GO! Essentially, the film is perfect for the 'alternate' cliques of people who dislike the norm, dislike societal structure, are appalled by the standard of everyday tastes on display for them. This is fair to take this stance, but, the irony is, this film is merely a sugar-coated black-spot on modern Art. Posing as something acquired to this clique's general 'norm', thinking it is an excuse to be happy that something 'creative' has reared finally to end the scruple and bring forth the mental endearment. I'm sorry folks, I just don't buy it. It lacks charm. It lacks gripping drama. Depth. Meaning. Humour (well it was humorous to me and my perplexed mind). This disdainfully repulsive creation had me cringing in the Cinema, while all around, seemed to be enthralled by the apparent 'spell-binding' blandness of this superficial sham, while I was only fully exasperated by how offensively bad it truly was. I don't blame the 'alternate masses' for being desperate for something of this kind of repertoire, but, you don't jump into bed with the first person you meet.At least when left bewildered by a Rothko painting, you are just that, for differing reasons. Which has you scratching your head and 'wondering' in positive ways. This film had me bewildered for all the wrong reasons.I dislike spoilers, so I won't include one, no matter how inadequate the film is, but the ending just epitomizes the whole film, what he turns out to 'be', uniquely stupid. Bravo.Seriously, what was 'unique' about this film? Because the plot was dull, possibly the dullest part of the film. So yes, this film descends into new levels of self mental-depravity toned by it's atrocious plot, dull acting, lack of ideas, lack of basis and downright lack of general creativity. The only possible atonement being, that I get to rip holes in it for the rest of my life. Though, nothing can atone for the scar left in my mind forever.Oh, what a surprise, Richard Kelly also wrote something as repugnant as 'Domino', also. Expect more future pieces of 'Art' that will trick their way into your unequivocally obtuse junk stand.</fullReview>

Maybe I have spoiled myself by watching great films such as Waking Life, Barton Fink, O Brother Where Art Thou, The Legend of 1900, Amelie, Illuminata, The Red Violin, etc. Those movies all had the three important aspects going for them: a good story, a good ending, and a good purpose.Donnie Darko comes out at you with a character that is mentally disturbed. For those of you not familiar with characters that are a little strange, Donnie Darko's character might seem like a breakthrough to you. You people have been watching too many "Oscar caliber films"! Donnie Darko is not a good story. It is a bunch of random events that leave little character building for anybody but Donnie and oddly enough, the bunny. If you think about it, you could have come up with a bunch of random events involving a mentally disturbed character and come up with a movie similar to Donnie Darko in about a week, tops. Stop and think about the different emotions that any character besides Donnie's showed if you have seen this film. If you haven't seen the film, just watch for any character change at all, this will probably entertain you through the boring parts, I guess I should just say the movie.Donnie Darko has a horrible ending. Think about the ending for a second. I don't think Donnie does anything in the ending himself. Also, the ending should repeat over and over again with different endings given the story line we are given. Just think about it for a second. People who haven't seen it, get ready for a pretty bad ending. Donnie Darko has no purpose. Well, I guess maybe that's a lie, it does have a purpose. I've never been a big fan of movies that are out just to be weird and get people names in the business. Seriously, what else could have been the purpose? The whole moving point behind the movie is based on a premise that cannot exist. I won't say anything more because I don't want to spoil the film for people. Even though the film is bad, Donnie's actor turns in a wonderful job and the other characters do their best to the script's ability. Check this film out, but your not going to like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A really terrible film. It has a lot of worshipers, but the premise is as old as the hills. It never makes much sense, and in the end, you have to ask why someone would make a horror film that was not only scare-less but clueless as well. And the bunny? I know this film has its fans, as a friend of mine is one of them, but I found nothing redeeming about this film. Jake does a fine acting job, but the script is so awful even he couldn't save it. One wonders how it ever got funding. Perhaps being based on "Incident at Owl Creek" had something to do with it, but it really doesn't pull it off. I felt quite ripped off at the end. Did I mention the bunny?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing such great things from everybody about this film, I can honestly say this is a film that I believe to have no redeeming qualities to it. I watched it numerous occasions and understood it, but it simply is horrible. I cannot fathom how so many people can think this film is a cult classic already. The acting is horrible, the story is weak and although it tries to be artistic, it does not accomplish it's goal. It is a pretentious film that has no merit. I always look for something good in a movie, but I could not find one good thing about this. It tries too hard and fails at everything.Please don't rent this, it will be a waste of your time and money.</fullReview>

I get the time travel bit, but I still don't see any point in the two hours of rambling and nonsense. There was a great idea here, but the movie makers (not sure which one to blame) failed miserably in executing on the idea...it's like they assumed everyone else was on an acid trip too. I wrote that jokingly, but now that I think of it, that could very well be the reason!I'd like to be able to say something positive here, but nothing comes to mind...just two hours of me thinking "Blah, blah, blah...oh, there's Patrick Swayze, weird...blah, blah, blah...oh, I remember that song...blah, blah, blah." and 90 minutes into it, "Oh, so that's what was going on...better late than never I guess." Seeing that this movie had a rating over 8 stars made me want to give it a chance, but in the end, I just kept wondering if the world has gone mad.

		<shortDescription>"Donnie Darko" is a brilliant cult classic with more detail and creativity than every other film combined.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Kelly's tiny independent masterpiece is beyond amazing. The detail and creativity put into effect in "Donnie Darko" deliver a mind-bending adventure with a fantastic original screenplay. A troubled teenager (Jake Gyllenhaal) is plagued by visions of a large bunny rabbit that manipulate him to commit a series of crimes, after narrowly escaping a bizarre accident. This creepy, original, bizarre, wondrous, stylish, and magnificent work of art will have you guessing the entire time, except when director Richard Kelly throws a scene so arresting that it's impossible to think. The haunting score and dysfunctional suburban life penetrate our thoughts like a nightmare, while the stylish camera-work and overwhelming amount of animals play with your rational. Richard Kelly uses realistic science to blend into ordinary life and takes you on a cinematic adventure like no other. I really had no idea what was going on. I thought I did, but once I looked up the true meaning beyond the film, I was amazed at the brilliance beyond Richard Kelly's fantastic ideas and direction. Jake Gyllenhaal brings this unique story to life with a masterful performance that takes young acting to a whole new level. This film takes work. It might help to learn about tangent universes, chronological orders, living receivers, manipulated dead and living, and other scientific elements relating to these. These are what the plot is shaped from. The whole idea of human relations, destinies, and chance events are questioned throughout the film. It may be hard to understand all this due to being distracted from all the magnificent film work that is thrown at you constantly. There truly isn't a film with more detail and creativity that is connected throughout an entire film than "Donnie Darko," one of the greatest films to date and by far best of the 21st century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie for a generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Donnie Darko is one of those generation movies. That is, it's a movie I would have loved had I seen it when I was 21 when the movie was originally released. I think then I would have given it either a 10 or 9, as I might be just among the generation it tries to speak to.But I didn't see it when I was 21. I saw it when I was 34, 14 years after it was released, and the issues it handles, the social alienation, difficulty of human relations and adults who don't understand, don't feel as close to me as they did to me when I was closer to the years I had gotten out from the school.DD is not a bad movie by any means. It is a bit gimmicky with its time travel plot, but it is an intriguing tale of a young man with psychological issues, trying to make sense of the world around him. The script is good and the actors all do great work. At the baseline, there's nothing really wrong with the movie, I just think I saw it the wrong time to fully appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko 8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been late to the party on Donnie Darko for nearly fifteen years, I was excited to finally have the moment, where the film was in hand, and I was in the right mood. Donnie Darko met my expectations and took me for a wild ride. Jake Gyllenhaal was fantastic as his typical suave but awkward persona that he plays in a lot in his films (Zodiac, Prisoners). He happens to be so good at that type of role I keep hoping he brings it every time. I was also really impressed with the supporting female cast that included, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Mary McDonnell, Jena Malone and Drew Barrymore. All of them were absolutely terrific. Behind the camera, Richard Kelley, who I have never heard of before this film, was impeccable at keeping the viewer in the dark but also entertained. The story was a tad hard to follow for myself at points, just because I'm not a whiz at understanding paradoxes and time traveling but I still managed to hang in. I now know why Donnie Darko (8/10) is such a cult favorite that is intellectually driven and obviously very original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Films Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest films ever made, by far a superior fever-dream to anything Richard Kelly has done or probably is yet to do, the story tells of a troubled youngster, suffering from terrifying and twisted visions of an omnipotent spectre known only as Frank, who bears likeness to a nightmarishly disfigured rabbit who tells Darko when the world is going to end. It twists around and around but never seems to falter, just steadily meandering around conversations about God and then conversations about the Smurfs. Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze and Mary McDonnell all surpass the expectations the audience bore for them and provide stellar performances. The Gothic rock soundtrack features Echo &amp; The Bunnymen, The Church, Duran Duran and Tears For Fears and perfectly accompanies the darkly gorgeous tone and colour-scape of the film. The best film in my entire collection, Donnie Darko is superb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cool premise and unique blend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1988 upper class suburb Middlesex, Virginia. Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a disturbed kid who talks to a giant creepy bunny called Frank and disappears at night. His parents (Mary McDonnell, Holmes Osborne) have him talking to psychiatrist Dr. Lilian Thurman (Katharine Ross). Frank tells him that the world is ending in 28 days. A jet engine crashes into his room while he's away sleepwalking. No one knows where it came from. He falls for new student Gretchen Ross (Jena Malone). The school is flooded and English teacher Karen Pomeroy (Drew Barrymore)'s assignment is blamed. Gym teacher Kitty Farmer (Beth Grant) begins to teach lessons from motivational speaker Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze). His science teacher Dr. Kenneth Monnitoff (Noah Wyle) gives him a time travel book written by local mad woman Roberta Sparrow.I love the weird moody style. It's got a surreal suburbia that feels more like the small town in Blue Velvet. It's a beautiful place on the surface hiding an ugly core. Frank is just weird and Jake Gyllenhaal plays off of it with a disturbing performance. There is the crazy sci-fi element. All of it mash together in one of the most unique blend. The 80s music is terrific. I also didn't notice Seth Rogen was in this until watching much later. The final ending is a little bit confusing and I'm not sure what it all means. I would have preferred one that wraps up with more sense.</fullReview>

I was in kind of a hurry to watch it because I needed to know if I liked it or not, since I had so many people recommend it to me. It was an amazing movie. Acting was amazing, especially since this was one of Jake Gyllenhaal's first lead roles. He did an outstanding job representing the Donnie Darko character. The right emotions, the right reactions, the right feel, he gave all to this movie. The characters were represented in the most perfect way. Though I feel that some of the acting on the parts of other actors was exaggerated, but not much to the extent to take away from the confused, mysterious, eerie feel of the overall experience. Definitely recommended, and if you don't get it the first time, you'll have to watch it a second time, and trust me, even then, it won't get boring!</fullReview>

I really love how Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Donnie he really captures what I believe the director wanted the mysterious emotionally unstable character. The film is just really thought provoking the ending really started me on a change of peculiar thoughts. Donnie Darko does make you see things in a different life it makes you think what if? It almost let's you make your own decision about the ending like a sort of it's up to you what you make of that. In my opinion I enjoyed the film it was strangely entertaining however I can see how some people may interpret this film as pure utter nonsense and really dislike it but I found it a good film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well it took me 13 years to get around to watching this movie, and I almost didn't due to all the reviews I read about how complex and confusing it was. And how it needed to be watched many times to really understand it. That's all total BS. It's a very good movie to be sure, but it's not extremely deep and mystifying, or very dark at all.Donnie Darko is a high school comedy set in the late 80s with a healthy dose of sci-fi/fantasy thrown in. It's NOT a horror/suspense/thriller/mind-blowing film at all. The only thing scary in this movie is the bunny costume, it's really creepy. (the bunny's mask is awesome!) The plot is fairly self explanatory and easy to follow. It's your basic one character has access to some supernatural info that makes him appear less than sane to everyone else.What makes this a really good movie:Good story - Good actors - Good acting - Good comedy - Good music - Nice blend of multiple film genreEnd of story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko", was a really stylish and interesting piece of film for the new Millennium. It felt like a satire of young adults trying to fight off boredom and find meaning through something, anything no matter how absurd. It's incredibly hard to discuss because the film is somewhat hard to understand, and deciphering the meanings in this review would rob you of a great experience you'll find yourself coming back to. So I guess I'll abruptly try to end this review by talking about the other aspects.Well the acting was great. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Donnie is unique, and definitely promises more to come from this talented actor. His family are arseholes because they don't really talk to him, rather they just send him off to a shrink. Leading to more visions of "Frank", a gruesome man sized rabbit creature that became very memorable and also has a very unique presence given the movies finale. Modern American suburbia is the perfect setting for the crazy events that ensues, leading to an almost anti "American Beauty" (1999) vibe.Final Verdict: "Donnie Darko" is one of those movies that will be talked about for a long time no matter how old it gets. I enjoy coming back to it again and again. 8/10.</fullReview>

I'm thinking I must not of understood it the first time I saw it. I'm assuming it was pretty original at the time, it came out before (I think) the butterfly effect and the jacket (2 other good flicks, similar story lines your welcome, enjoy) Once you put all the pieces together and understand it's a great piece of work. You can pretty much grasp the meaning at the end. Jake did an excellent job, wow.he was so young here. I was disappointed by Barrymore , she wasn't very good in it but you hardly see much of her so, not a big deal. I was surprised it was produced by her Flower Films co,I didn't know that.

		<shortDescription>A suburban teens faces his dark destiny through delusions and societal ignorance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If only as a potent reminder of de-evolution of our society, I think it fair to tag the decade for reversing trend of organic growth and to highlight the failures of a hypocritical country whose ethical dogma is desperately grasped by lazy public and whose entertainment values the ills of the post-triumphant. In many ways, we've sat still since that time when mass- production of style gave us soul-less art and only through a few precious moments or acts of beauty do we find redemption for letting ourselves end up here. Donnie Darko is eventually labeled an agnostic after years with a Therapist who is out of her element and invokes God as an explanation. Our schools are overrun by fearful mother coalitions justifying their own narcissism through educational and fearful bias. Yet, there is a search for the truth that continues and this discovery, no matter how wild and end of days like, brings joy. Truth brings inner peace. It's a "Mad World" alright, and not to be lumped into "fear" or "love" but to make hay of the gray areas in between. Where Darko loses its' message is in the lack of empowerment (minus the time-travel non-sense). Once you realize every generation inherits a gray mess to sort through you can then stop feeling sorry for yourselves as a generation. That's not about Donnie, but about societal responsibility. If not, "Grandma Death" awaits. Donnie Darko; Keeper of a late 1980's confused generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The meaning is clear it is not a mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is much much more. It's a greater movie than you even think. If you look at the sign above the movie theatre when Donnie leaves to burn down Jim Cunningham's place, the key moment of victory exposing the evil that has been in control of Mr and Mrs Average to make those who can be, free, you will see that it shows "The Last Temptation of Christ". This is the key with which to unlock the meaning of the movie. The tangent Universe where Donnie beats the system is analogous to the world of the Christ anomaly, the one that comes into existence with his getting down off the Cross in that film. Christ also succeeds in exposing the corruption of the authorities and their puppet ally, the Church. In both films, the intervening presence, the Devil's beautiful Angel in "Last etc." and Frank in "Donnie", know that because of our spoon-fed mentality and lack of real imagination we always betray the efforts of good people, like Donnie and Christ, in favour of the quiet life, and just let deceitful and self-interested power reassert its dominion, whatever they have done, and however comprehensively it has been exposed, and have its way anyway, hoping they will maybe leave us alone with our stuff if we let them con us yet again. Both Christ and Donnie symbolically give up their triumphs in their anomalous world, the one we should evolve into according to Kazantzakis and Kelly, to return to the poorer reality of the one in which they are killed, and they do so, perversely, as acts of self-sacrifice, to save others (Gretchen in Donnie's case), and allegedly to save humanity in Christ's case (which is actually lost in the present by his barbarous death), but the real message is that we can't have this better outcome seen in the TU given our indifference towards the courageous people, like them, who will not give up their integrity in exchange for stuff as we do but are willing to fight to expose the truth about the perverse way we are controlled, as Donnie does, though they think him mad, and as Christ does. Kelly shows us for what we are; more like docile domestic animals following fodder, than real meaningful human minds: in the unsatisfactory world we wish to settle for in exchange for the quiet life. This is the message of Nikos Kazantzakis, who wrote the novel "Last Temptation...", to the world; and Richard Kelly who realised that it needed a more imaginative and dramatic re-telling. The message is also found in "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest", where McMurphy is a saviour, with the humanity which is all that is really necessary for us to follow to change from a miserable system of excessive and unnecessary concession towards irredeemably cruel power; but instead he is ironically betrayed by the man who owed him most, Billy, who just couldn't cope. These films are all connected and should be taught at school, as should Kazantzakis. Donnie Darko is a mind-boggling wake-up call to us all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if you don't understand Donnie Darko you still can't help but admire it.Just to make things clear I'm not saying I don't understand the film, although I can't explain the full extent of the film.Now I have read some reviews complaining about the director of the film supposedly using 'Cliches' regarding some of the characters. All I can say to this is ARE YOU STUPID? If a viewer of this film can not clearly see that these characters are put in the film intentionally I suggest you retire from watching films. Anyway as you can see I truly believe this is one of the most interesting maybe even entertaining films of all time. My reasoning for this is mainly how relevant and absorbing each scene of the movie is. Donnie Darko is Definitely one of those films you simply can not watch just once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the perfect movie for anyone interested in fantasy, scientific, or mystery films. It had a wonderful score, great filming, and appropriate actors for all the characters in the film. Our story starts with a young, troubled, boy, Donald Darko. Strange things begin happening to Donnie for no apparent reason after he dodges a near death experience, and a voice in his mind starts telling him what to do. Soon, this voice materializes into a man named Frank, who is dressed in a bunny suit every time he has a conversation with Donnie. Essentially, Frank manipulates Donnie using the end of the world as an excuse for the things that happen in Donnie's life. I loved this film for its creativity and it's sympathetic outreach toward the main character. The complexity and darkness of this movie bring an odd but comforting feeling to the viewer. The feature challenges ones brain and leaves them with an foggy understanding of what happened, and a series of conclusions to close. As a viewer, the answer is never handed out at any point throughout the film, making it more than mysterious. The scenes erupt with creativity and concealed meanings, while at the same time not distracting one from the astounding acting in this film from Jake Gyllenhaal, Patrick Swayze, and Mary McDonnell. Each actor works cohesively to bring the effect of the picture to life . To top it all off, Donnie Darko has a delicate score, written by Michael Andrews, that is unspeakably horrific and somehow, at the same time, alluring. As it dusts along the storyline, a few 80s pop songs are thrown in making it hard to find a fault in this film. The director, Richard Kelly, brought this movie together with a high level of success. Donnie Darko was Kelly's first film, making the viewers jaw drop even further learning that it was Kelly's first time directing a big time Hollywood picture. The best way to describe this film is with the tag line itself, "Dark. Darker. Darko."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a very confused teenager.As he says in the movie he wants to "change things". It turns out that he's chosen to prevent the end of the World with the help of a man in a bunny suit. Why this man wears that stupid bunny suit and other things that may look strange to the viewer will be revealed till the end of the movie in a amazing chain of events. Some of the viewers may be confused after their first time watching it, so I suggest seeing the film at least twice. And is important to watch the Director's cut, which includes extra scenes and pages from the book "Philosophy of Time Travel". In this book Roberta Sparrow(Character from the movie) is explaining the concept of time travel, which helps Donnie understand what's happening to him. After the end the movie leaves you with weird feeling of insignificance and makes you think that we're unable to change our destiny. Despite the fact, that Donnie saves the world, he couldn't manage to save his own life. Time Travel, End of the World, Colliding Universes and many other things are the reason I love the movie. I love the music, I love the effects and I love how everything that is happening has a purpose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by Richard Kelly, 2001's "Donnie Darko" is at the time young Jake Gyllenhaal's breakthrough movie as a lead actor. It achieves an otherworldly feel with aspects of the movie that lend it strength including excellent atmospheric music, quirky cynical dialog, quantum physics musings, and Gyllenhaal and Mary McDonnal's acting performances. Re-watched the movie recently after initially seeing it a year after its release date and felt that I understood it much better probably because I paid closer attention. It deals with issues of time-paradox mixed with a bit of religion, and some certain disdain for Middle and High School. The movie is a solid effort that's lifted with writing, acting, and music, although it does overuse music video edits. About a 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is itself a genre, you wont find another movie similar to this.Donnie Darko contains a sense of 80s nostalgia yet a well paced plot that maybe confusing to some viewers. Whatever background your from everybody can find a bit of themselves in Donnie. With help from a great score Donnie Darko is perfect in ever sense, if you enjoy time travel, sci-fi, drama, mystery, romance, teen or the plain weird this movie is for you.The reason why I think this movie is perfect is because its a one of few movies that I can watch over and over.28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds.

		<shortDescription>It's a very , very mad world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Back to the future" meets David Lynch ? this is the way "Donnie Darko" could be described to somebody who hasn't yet seen this movie . A movie too uncommercial and ambitious for mainstream Hollywood has become quickly a cult movie and gained fame. You will either love it or hate it. I love it.At it's heart "DD" is a story about dysfunctional family. Donnie is intelligent , independent and sensitive teenager that can't communicate too well with his family , friends or teachers . It's a teenage drama told with honesty that is hard to find . It's easy to see that Kelly writes about something he did experience too. Not only Donnie isn't understood , but also Chinese girl Cherita , teacher Karen and his girlfriend Gretchen. It's a story about search for meaning of life , fear of death , looking for God , destiny and free will. All those subject are treated seriously and with subtlety. Jake Gyllenhal gives a performance of lifetime as emotionally troubled teenager. He portrays so many different emotions of Donnie with talent never found in his other roles. It's a performance that deserve at least an Oscar nomination. His real life sister Maggie Gyllenhal gives him solid support playing his? sister. Patrick Swayze gives an interesting performance as the fraud Jim Cunningham. Drew Barrymore (who is also one of the producers of the movie) gives a surprisingly for her mature role as the teacher Karen. Bet Grant shines as fanatical teacher Kitty. I also admire Jena Malone for heartbreaking performance as the delicate Gretchen. "DD" has a fantastical soundtrack , which includes songs like : "The killing moon" by Echo and The Bunnymen , "Head over hells" by Tears for fears , "Notorious" by Duran Duran , "Love will tear us apart" by Joy Division and especially "Mad world" by Gary Jules and Michael Andrews. All the songs are well placed in the movie. The sequence where "Mad world" appears is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen.Richard Kelly directs this movie in a fantastic way. With the help of atmospheric music by Michael Andrews and creepy photography by Steven Porter he creates a movie that is really dark . A true haunting sadness and mystery seems to be everywhere. The movie has soul and heart . It's sad , scary and full of black humor. It's art , not entertainment despite using a pop culture imagery (time travel portals , scary figures). It's also a tribute to the 80's (the action takes place in 1988)."Donnie Darko" can't be a masterpiece , because of one problem . Richard Kelly wanted to give the viewer as much freedom as possible to make his own interpretation of what is going on. The movie is open to interpretations ? it was a dream , Donnie's imagination , God's interference , time travel paradox or side effect of pills. Kelly achieved that by hiding from the audience information necessary to really understand the movie the way it was always intended. The fact that the Director's cut and the official website exist is a proof that Kelly himself admits of failing to make "Donnie Darko" a self-contained medium. Without most of the information from "Philosophy of time travel" (it is expanded in the Director's cut) it's not strange that many viewer's weren't able to understand the complex story .It doesn't change the fact that "Donnie Darko" is one of the most original , ambitious and thought-provoking movies I've ever seen. Richard Kelly will probably stay a one-hit wonder director . I doubt he will anything even half as good as "DD" in the future. It doesn't change the fact that he created something that deserves to be admired ? drama about loneliness , pain and fear told by using science fiction. I give it 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was surprised by this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a Netflix nut for years for viewing older movies. But it wasn't until I looked at IMDb's top 250 movies that this movie caught my eye, and downloaded the movie torrent. I expected it to be a dark, brooding teenage, coming-of-age thing that I'd quickly exit and delete.To be quick about this, boy was I surprised. Once I got passed that Donnie was not considering mass murder, my interest was piqued and never wavered to the end. Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Donnie was spot on. I loved his body language and the crooked lips and the tilted head, slightly downward to the right throughout the movie, projecting impatience, curiosity and feigned disinterest. This movie is a gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This truly is a movie that folks will either adore or detest, without a lot in-between. Donnie Darko, first and foremost, refuses to neatly fit into any particular category. It doesn't try to convey any real message, doesn't have a central theme, and doesn't try to push any agenda, or 'achieve' anything. Donnie Darko merely shares with its viewers the world-view and emotions of a very aware, sensitive, intelligent and fundamentally good-natured teenager trying to understand and get to grips with the sights and sounds of the world around him. And for someone like that the jury is out of which is more insane, 7-foot rabbits or God-fearing republicans.And like the world-view and emotions of sensitive, intelligent and good-natured teenagers the world over the movie is complex, unsettling, troubled, intense, lonely, morose, romantic, enchanting, dramatic, self-absorbed, self-conscious, self-righteous, insecure, perplexed, curious and incoherent. That is the whole point.If you were an off-beat teenager like Donnie Darko, and also felt 'weird' because you weren't exactly like the other kids, this movie will hit a nerve. And you will love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this might be because I'm a sophomore in high school, but this movie is one of the only movies I can think of that fit me perfectly. Everything Donnie says i connect with. And it answered huge questions I've had about myself. I'm not saying this movie will force a religion on you, because it talks about a lot and the one Donnie believed in happens to be the one I've been trying to find. But there's a lot of other things in this movie. For example, the feelings in this movie, like respect, fear, confusion and happiness. I can say this movie has some of the greatest dialogue in a high school situation. Plus I love endings that aren't 100% obvious. You will be thinking after the movie is done. I can't explain in words my love for this movie so watch it for yourself.10/10</fullReview>

The second time I saw it was when I realized how spectacular this movie is. I think this movie can be compared to Inception. Inception had a complex plot. It took me two times to watch Inception to fully understand and appreciate it. Same with Donnie Darko. You will have to watch it twice to fully appreciate it. Donnie Darko will make you think.

I thought that he delivered the best performance I have ever seen in a film. Very believable. I'm not going to lie, I was crying my eyes out by the end of the film (I have never cried so much at a film before!) I thought that there was very good character build-up and lots of emotion portrayed. Unlike some other films it had a very good and complex story-line, but it wasn't confusing. I also thought that Donnie and Gretchen's relationship was so sweet. When I saw Frank for the first time, yes, I was creeped out. I was glad that it was more about Donnie's life than Frank making him do weird things. Overall I would say that Donnie Darko is an amazing film with some very good actors. I would rate it 10/10 and say that it is suitable for anyone mature 13+. YOU MUST WATCH!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Spinechilling movie that almost scars you from the disturbing mind of Donnie Drako.An Skizofrenic teenager played by Jake Gylenhall named Donnie Darko is eccentric in the way he views the world, thinks and acts with an outstanding intelligence it's almost scary.Has thoughts of time travel, encounters a crazy Lady that looks almost like Doc Brown from Back to the Future and even thinks of a way to time travel. Oh and a creepy ass man in a Bunny suit named Frank follows him around everywhere.The cinematography is gritty and has a "cold world" kind of feel to it. The quotes are memorable " I met a friend" "Real or imaginary" "HE'S RIGHT THERE" and that scene where he explains the life of a Smurf was funny as hell in a twisted way. Oh and that crazy religious nut person played by Patrick Swayze.That said it's a very interesting movie from beginning to end I highly recommend you check this one out over and over again.

Well,the film covers a temporal arc that goes from 2 October to 30 October and the Donnie life is divided in 2 dimensions: real that finishes in 2 October and imaginary that continues till 30 October. 2 October Frank (the rabbit) wide awake Donnie saves and it. And from now all it is based on all the actions of Donnie, if they damage a sense to the fall of the reactor on he 30 October. In the end the real Frank, skidding in order to avoid the Sparrow, invests and kills Gretchen, provoking fury of Donnie that talks nonsense to Frank, allowing of being the rabbit, the manipulated dead Frank. Dannie when it knows them on the hill in the end makes to return the reactor's airplane to 2 October, and thus, in the real life, than is repeated in Donnie end laughs because in conclusion it has understood that other to know is a lot and that the persons do not die just.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Effect of the use of light in Donnie Darko by Joshua, Job, Michael and Coen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the surrealistic psychological thriller, main character Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) seems to be mentally disturbs already from the first moments of the movie. He has an imaginative friend, Frank. Frank tells him the World will be coming to an end. Frank makes Donnie do extreme things, from flooding the school, to destroying people lives so that Donnie will sacrifice him self and let himself get killed by the airplane motor. This will so called save all the people around him. You can tell by the story that light is going to play a key role in the movie. It is a dark, almost sad movie. Donnie Darko is a perfect example of how light can and should be used in movies. Light plays a great part in the movie and it is clearly visible and really well done, considering the low budget they had to work with.One of the most clearly visible techniques of using light in the movie is when Donnie is looking in the mirror at himself or at the bunny. They used three point lighting in theses scenes. In these scenes the three point lighting is used to illuminate the bottom half of his face from the bottom. It is almost as if someone is standing with a torch underneath which people do when they are telling a spooky story. They illuminate the bottom half of his face so that his eyes are not very visible. This makes him look a bit creepy, dark and a bit mysterious. They also positioned the lights in such a way so that the door behind him is illuminated. This makes the shadows on Donnie's face even more visible because it is seen against a lighter background making Donnie seem even more dark and creepy. Another thing that the makers did was illuminate the rabbit's face in the reflection of the mirror, especially his eyes. This had a really big effect in the movie. Every time the angle of the camera is switched ,the rabbit would all of a sudden appear in the reflection in the mirror. This can be frightening the first couple of times, because you do not expect it and the rabbit is brighter and more visible than expected. You do not expect this while watching the movie, because it is a very mysterious movie and Donnie is a very closed person so you do not expect to all of a sudden see the whole face in such detail. This is even more so in the scene set in the cinema since the rabbit is completely glowing and the eyes are shining.So light does play a big role in the movie Donnie Darko and it would not be the same good movie if the light-effects wouldn't have been used so well. It creates an atmosphere and makes you focus on the important details in the movie such as the rabbit head. The effect of the light can make you feel unconformable or curious during the movie so that you are always on the edge of your seat not expecting or knowing but wanting to know what is going to happen next. This is probably the reason why Donnie Darko was such a big success.We personally thought Donnie Darko was a very grabbing and interesting movie. The psychological problems and odd actions of Donnie kept us in a trance till the end of the movie. There were some shocking moments in the movie that made it a very exciting, and sometimes even scary movie. The acting was done so incredibly well, that however unrealistic the movie seemed, it still felt like it could happen to us any moment. Another outstanding element of the movie was that it was really difficult to understand, especially for us 16-year old students. All the odd things that happen made it difficult to follow and keep up. It wasn't until we looked it up on Internet, that we knew what it was all about. In our opinion, this is a very clever technique the writer uses, but a little bit too difficult, mainly for us younger people. Although the movie was a low-budget movie, because it was Kelly's first movie. It was extremely well filmed making good use of outside areas and common sub-urban areas, so that there was not a lot of need of big film sets, again making it feel more realistic. Also the cast existed of actors that had just started their career, however, and I cant express this enough, the acting was brilliantly done. All with all, the movie had a great impact on us, and we will remember it for a long time, and we will never forget, that not everything is what it seems to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it's the distracting soundtrack: those who lived their teens while this synthepop horror ruled the airwaves are now the people in control, and they likely re-lived the superficial 80s through the process.The film didn't made it for me. It was trying too hard on too many terrains, with no sense of measure, no subtility. I was a non-scary horror movie, a flat-falling comedy, a slack suspense, a mundane fantastic drama. I kept on expecting something, anything, and it didn't happened.Still, maybe as maturity will set in, the guy that made that movie could be someone to watch out for in the future. He was evidently passionate about this movie, that I feel is personal. But as such, it looked to much like spoiled suburban American teens having ill-defined tantrums. And I am either too old or not emo enough to appreciate it.</fullReview>

I love Jake Gyllenhaal and Maggie and Jena Malone. The relationship between Donnie and Gretchen is beautiful.The reason i watch movies is because of the warm feeling i receive after watching movies as such. The ones that you can relate to so much, or the ones that make you think to understand. And this movie is spot on to reality. Some kids get it. They truly understand the things that Donnie understood. And they make everlasting impressions on people around them. Thats what was shown. Over 28 days, how many peoples lives he changed in such a short time. How many things he accomplished or destroyed. Choices...its all about choices. The ones you make and the ones you fail to make. Outcomes are ultimately incredibly different. Donnie chose to die at the end, he knew he would save Gretchen, all of these people if he were to just die at that point. But hes smiling at the end, because hes not dying alone. He has the warm feeling in his heart that people love and care about him, and he is satisfied.</fullReview>

Now, I am reviewing Donnie Darko, the one he had the weirdest role in. In Donnie Darko, Patrick Swayze played Jim Cunningham, who was actually a pedophile. Yeah, I told you it was his weirdest role. Donnie Darko isn't a film that I loved, but I did think it was very good. The story is unique. The acting is pretty good, and well, the film just works. I found this film to be pretty disturbing. Especially cause of that Bunny Frank, who Donnie sees repeatedly throughout the film and who saved his life. I am not going to get into the plot because it is too unique but I will say that the film has to do with time travel. I really thought that Donnie Darko was a cool and interesting film. It's hauntingly brilliant and I give it a big thumbs up. Donnie Darko: ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko played by Jake Gyllenhall commences with edgy shots that attempt to portray him as a dysfunctional schizophrenic teen. We see the very ugly one eye-browed Donnie appearing as part of a Handsome American Nuclear family that he does not appear to genetically connect with, except for his sister who seems also out of place and this despite his first set of massive facial reconstructive surgery, Pectoral implants and upper lip implants . The engine of an airliner falls out of the sky and hits the bedroom of Donnie while he is out sleeping on the golf course. Drew Barrymore appears in the first twenty minutes of the film as Donnie's literature teacher of class Karen Pomeroy. Donnie keeps having surrealistic dreams of a rabbit face character addressing him. Donnie walks around grinning to himself. As expected the new good-looking girl Jenna Malone, played by Gretchen Ross, of the class who is also dysfunctional quickly develops a relationship with the ugly and awkward Donnie. The relationship develops in the same stereotypical American teen boy meets girl films. As the film progresses Donnie sessions with his analyst in which he masturbates under hypnosis. Donnie is bullied at school but hangs with his mates whilst he indulges in hobby of target shooting.. Donnie continues to hallucinate with the half man half rabbit with big teeth and grey eyes harassing him. Gellenhall is introduced to a book by one of the teachers the philosophy of Time travel by an ex-teacher at his school Roberta Sparrow who turns out to be the old woman repeated seen on a road. Eventually the film concludes with Donnie saving his girl friend from death by use of time travel. This art-house cult classic is highly over-rated and was used to establish the wealthy and privileged Jake and Maggie Gyllenhall into highly stylized Hollywood film careers with the assistance of their mate Drew Barrymore who also comes from a great film family dynasty. Entertaining and arty-farty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess I'm not surprised at the demographic breakdown and the high rating this film has garnered; All through it, I found myself impressed by the acting and the dialogue. As Elvis Mitchell said in his NY Times review, this is Jake Gyllenthal's promise of star quality. But, having said that, I can't give the film as a whole the high marks that the masses have. Maybe it's because I've been where Donnie is portrayed to have been, maybe it's because when I think of great films, I look to the storyline as much as to the individual scenes. Maybe I just don't get it, but the mobius strip quality of the story just takes one step beyond my understanding of space/time continuum theory. There is this aura of "Edward Scissorhands" mixed with "Blue Velvet" and the atmospherics are absolutely hypnotizing, but that's the equivalent of a subliminal track repeating "you'll love this movie". When you come right down to it, the ending is unresolved and unresolvable. Is it a Christ allegory? Does Donnie go back in time to sacrifice himself so that Gretchen will live? OK. I can accept that. But by doing that, he allows Cunningham to escape punishment. There is no satisfactory resolution presented by the writer/director, as much as we might wish it to be so because we like the movie so much. It's certainly no "Chinatown" or "Treasure of Sierra Madre" and while enjoyable and watchable more than once as visual art, does not imnsho rise to the level of literature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Kelly's directional debut, 'Donnie Darko' has too be one of the most inspirational movies in film history. Everything about this film is phenomenal, from the cast of actors to the soundtrack. Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal - Jarhead, Brokeback Mountian) is a lonely and disturbed teenage boy that suffers from schizophrenia. When confronted by a rather looking evil rabbit named 'Frank' that tells him the end of the world is near, Donnie decides to save the world with the help of some other characters who help him directly and sub-consciously. A confusing, unique and emotional film that is beautiful in every aspect. A 'must-see' movie in everybody's book, Donnie Darko is in the top 5 of all greatest films.

		<shortDescription>about "The Director's Cut"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko - The Director's Cut" is excellent, you really understand better Donnie's "visions", problems and motivations. I've seen the movie (the shortest one, so to say) at least 6 times, and yesterday I bought the "The Director's Cut" version, in DVD. I loved it! The only fault of the whole film is this: why did Richard Kelly take away "The Killing Moon" from the opening scene to put just the end of Echo &amp; The Bunnymen's song at the Halloween party??? "The Killing Moon" was perfect for the opening scene!!! But, apart from this, as I said, the film is just marvelous. It's my favorite movie of all times, indeed. And the soundtrack is awesome!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Dark Humor and Satire of A Violent Future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is "Donnie Darko" the teen crazy, time traveling, prophetic, powerful, or helpless, suicidal or murderous? The dark humor and satire of "American Beauty" meets the adolescent traumas of "Welcome to the Dollhouse" meets the alternative universes of "Happy Accidents" in a suburbia of hypocrisy and eccentrics, conformity and dysfunction, with a pervasive undercurrent of violence. Executive produced by Drew Barrymore, it has a terrific cast with the bigger names like Drew and Noah Wyle in surprising and small roles.The special effects are not flashy but are very effective.The movie has been cursed in its release timing, because we just can't examine the randomness of violence victims -- let alone plane engines falling out of the sky -- the same way after 9/11. Reading the daily portraits of the victims in "The New York Times" makes us all feel as Cassandra-like as "Donnie" and willing to do anything to change what happened.The soundtrack is a good selection of '80's mope rock, like The Joy Division and The Cure.

		<shortDescription>A movie that's so-so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is one of those movies that you say HUH?, after seeing it for the first time. And second. And third. And etc,etc. I don't really understand this film. Maybe I'm too into the plot of the movie and I want to see something happen that I've never seen before. Donnie Darko survives a near death, and a guy in a rabbit comes and goes and tells Donnie that the world will end in 2 months. OK. A guy in a rabbit suit tells you the world is ending. What in the world was the writer thinking? I don't know, but the rabbit suit is scary though. The face looks like a demon rabbit from hell, which is kinda scary. Donnie Darko is so-so for me. I like watching movies, and I gave this one a chance. I do like watching it, because Drew Barrymore is in it. (She looks really good in this film). Bottom line is , DD is a movie that makes you think. If you high school/friendship movies, watch this one. I wish I could talk to a rabbit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donny Darko is a political film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a political film. When a plane crashes into a building it is not a random act of god, but there has to be other forces at work, the reason the film is set in the 1980's is that's when bush came to power, and the end of the world was set in motion. 'vote Dukasas' not bush (with hindsight) The world has been brain washed by TV, Donnie's dad was also falling into hypnotic states in front of the TV, Donnie is the supper hero who has been chosen by Frank to create a revolution and set things right, symbolised by the Grame Green book the destroyers.He wants to rip the present world apart and create a new order. perhaps the reason the film is so obscure is that it wouldn't sit easily on the west's shoulders that the hero of the film is the destroyer (aka freedom fighter/terrorist)yet the freedom fighter is him self delusional, perhaps he is confused by all the lies that the position's use to cover there own backs, to appear as pillar of society types, sublimest by Jim Cunningham, to conclude I think that the action taken by Donnie wasn't ideal, he died to make things better, but there was still a lot of victims left over by what he done, IE his family, but the alternative was worse. There were no winners</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey, I know the idea of this board is to be all inclusive, but surely now is the time to stop. Every single scene has now been dissected far beyond the intention of the the director. You either love this movie or hate it.Let's all move on to talk about other great and underrated films - how about "3 Iron" or just about any other Korean film - how about "Old Boy"? Donnie has now been thrashed into the ground, and it just seems to me their is almost nothing more to be said.(Although I can't resist mentioning it only took off after is UK DVD release).So, although every new viewer may have a passionate view about it, It's probably been expressed about a zillion time already.Why not just give it a mark out of ten, an instead of writing a review, get excited and passionate about a new,maybe obscure, release?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was such a brilliant film to watch. Jake Gyllenhaal did an excellent job and nailed everyone of his lines. Richard Kelly made this film believable in every aspect. This film is captivating and makes you think out side of the square. Even after the movie has ended you still think about the movie and try to figure out its meaning. Every person has a different idea of what this movie means. It leaves something with you as it gave me a sense of happiness and joy although at the same time can depress you, which is strange. Richard Kelly did an amazing job and this film deserves an A+++++++++++++++++...It's a masterpiece..What more can I say..?</fullReview>

I must have watched it 20 times by now and think I get it but some bits still don't make sense. its not just a great story it looks amazing as well, You would think Richard Kelly had directed a 1000 films with the knowledge of film he seems to have. Let's hope this masterpiece is one of many and he is not a one hit wonder. oh and the sound track is seamless blending the accompanying music just where it's needed, and for mad world, you would have thought the lyrics were written for this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Incredible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is by far the best movie i have EVER seen. It involves a lot of thought, unlike half the crap out there with nothing but explosions and car chases. There is no way anyone could watch this movie, and at the end not think about what happened, and what tiny factors could be effecting the time-line of their own lives. Sure we may not see a demonic rabbit, but the fact is that this movie makes you think, whether you want to or not. If you're looking for a great movie that is incredibly different from the conformist junk readily available this movie is definitely for you. Even if you're a fan of the cookie-cutter films that Hollywood is turning out everyday I still suggest you check this film out. The only people I've ever known that didn't like this were people who hated having to think about something. Either way, at least give it a chance, I had my doubts originally, but after seeing it on Space, I went out and bought it, it quickly became my favourite movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first version is much better in my opinion(10), I just got the Directors Cut(2) today and liked watching the deleted scenes, but the next time I want to watch this film front to back, I'll stick to the original. The first version has a dream-like flow. The DC feels choppy &amp; too new and improved, and loses all flow. I am a huge Donnie Darko fan, and went to three different stores until I finally obtained a copy. I wanted to like the Direcors Cut &amp; looked forward to getting to get a peek behind the scenes at Richard Kelly &amp; his brilliance. Instead I found myself awaiting the end of this waste of money that I'd put so much anticipation into. Richard Kelly reminds me of my college film class teacher and I wish I hadn't purchased the new version. I'll have to wait a couple of months until I can forget the new &amp; so called improved ruined version, before I can sit and watch the original masterpiece.</fullReview>

A clear sign that humans can use more than 10 percent of their brain to make a film. All other movies are not needed anymore because of the fact that this movie acts as a catalyst for more brain function and overall growth. This movie is more thought provoking than saying the Korean alphabet backwards or watching a German movie with Portuguese subtitles that are going 3 times speed you would normally struggle with. The greatest film ever created in terms of plot design, intricate storyline, and overall depth.

		<shortDescription>The most startling debut film since "Eraserhead".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mentioned "Eraserhead" in my summary. "Donnie Darko",written and directed by Richard Kelly, shares many similarities if not in style and approach,then definitely in attitude.It is impossible to categorise this film simply in terms of genre.There is so much going on in "Donnie",whether it be part teen story/horror film/science fiction, that it simply knows no bounds.To me, the most affecting aspect of "Donnie Darko" is the subtext about who you can trust in the world. In that respect, the Director's Cut added a great deal of depth and shade to its characters.However, I prefer the original cut for its choices of music to underscore certain scenes, like Echo and the Bunnymen's "Killing Moon" playing over the opening sequence.The less I tell you about "Donnie Darko" before you see it, the better.All I will say is, see this movie with an open mind.In a world where a significant amount of films look and sound the same, "Donnie Darko" stands as something truly unique.This is why I love this film.Also, talking to friends, I notice that people of 'a certain age' (i.e. late 20's/early 30's) seem to truly appreciate the film. I don't know why, but the late 80's setting of the film seems to really manage to hit a nerve with some viewers.I cannot recommend this film highly enough. Looking forward to seeing what Richard Kelly does next in regards to writing and directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it the end of the universe or of the tangent universe?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds. Our trip into the strange world of Donnie Darko begins with the title character (played brilliantly by Jake Gyllenhall) waking up in the middle of the road, on top of a mountain. Great start huh, but oh boy does it get better. Due to the fact that the troubled Donnie sees a shrink on a regular basis, sleepwalks and is visited by a 6 foot evil looking bunny rabbit telling him that the world will end doesn't always make for your ideal viewing experience. Once watched though, never forgotten.Director Richard Kelly has created a modern masterpiece with his debut picture. The science fiction of the story is given credibility and the possibilities of the structure of time and the universe are all brought together very well. Some people might find this film hard to understand or difficult to follow but when you actually think about whats going on and what's being said it's not all that difficult. It just takes more than one viewing to get everything but it will hopefully make you question a lot of things and keep you awake for hours pondering life, the existence of God and if life is predecided.This is one film that has rightly deserved its cult status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic creation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's truly rare to see a film with such intrigue and complexity. Donnie Darko was truly a grassroots effort in regards to cult super stardom, but the underlying stories within the movie is certainly one that will keep you guessing and watching with a salivating thirst for more. Jake Gyllenhaal was perfect as the troubled and understated title character, meandering through life while the voice of a demonic rabbit whispering mischievous nothings into his ear. Just about everyone involved with the film brought something different to the table (with the exception of Drew Barrymore, who was pretty static and aloof in the film). But what really made this film so watchable is it didn't try to create pointless plot twists for our boredom-induced amusement. Instead, it grips you from the outset, utilizing the great song "Killing Moon" by Echo and the Bunnymen to reel you in (though the song is different on the Director's Cut). Watch the film and see for yourself, and simply lose yourself within a truly unique experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, Darker, Darko - Everybody dies alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Or so we may think. Donnie is a fairly typical teen, in a not so typical suburb full of rich people and a uniform prep school. The place is fictitious, but the story seems strangely real and set in the late 80's and seems to make very good use with some of the better songs of the time.I typically like to go into a movie with a little knowledge as possible. I really dislike movies that have advertised all their good scenes and lines ad-nauseum to the point where you here it in the actual movie for the first time, you feel highly uninspired.*** WARNING - Possible spoilers ahead - WARNING **** YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED *So really like the fact I never really heard about Donnie Darko and had no misfortune to get too much information on this excellent film. I thinks this film's strengths are its weakness and its weakness are some of its strengths. If this does not make any sense, then maybe this movie is not for you. If you like a mystery ... then you may love this one, but it may not have any conclusion or anything you like.I have heard a lot of comparisons of this movie since I saw it and I am puzzled as to why none of them refer to Jacob's ladder or even 2001, or more specifically Hal 9000 in 2001 A Space Oddessy. There are a lot of similarities in both. The Bunny Rabbit (or someone in a deaths-head rabbit costume) is Hal 9000, but with a few twists. Hal had power over the people on the space ship. The astronauts were afraid of Hal and rightly so. The rabbit is also something to be feared but it also seemed to help Donnie at one point. Donnie was bound to the rabbit and he did not know why. Donnie soon finds he has powers over other people and events. He starts to speak his mind, but he knows he is going insane, if not already insane. His shrink wants to increase his medication and his parents are worried, but want to do whatever necessary to help their son. ... and the old lady that stands in the road looking for mail is actually an author of some note. Donnie tries to find answers with the teachers and as good as some of them are, not all are able to help, because they are not allowed to talk about god. Then things start to get really strange and some overly stupid self help guru gets a wakeup call... and then the world ends as the bunny indicated.I thought it was a nice Halloween. I have no idea if I just gave the movie away or not, because even if I did, I did not - but you can make that call if you wish.I think the movie could have done more to stress the end of the world - or not. This was not clear, as many things are not so clear in life. Was the old woman caught in a similar situation and simply beat down the point where she stands in the street and checks her mail box 16 hours a day? What did she really write and why? Why did the movie skip over so many things so quickly. Clearly Donnie's world was about to end, or did he get a choice. What really was that choice and why did all those things happen when he went to the dead lady's house? Was she really dead - of course not, but maybe she was dead inside.As you can imagine death plays a heavy roll - similar to what happened in Jacob's Ladder, but with many significant differences. These differences are best found when watching the movies.I've heard there might be a directors cut for Donnie Darko - I really hope so, because while this was was very good, the Directors Cut (DC) has the potential to be killer :-)I would give the story a 9 (because it could probably have been told better and well its not perfect - or is it?) I would give the acting a 10 (because I could find no flaws on my first viewing - though some rolls are fairly light) I would give the movie a 7 for everything else (short scenes, building was a bit weak, but then it added to the surprise). I would give it an overall rating of 8.4, so I have to round to 8.0 for the vote.I'm thinking the DC could rate a 9 or maybe even a 9.5 in my book, but that is a tall order. The standard DVD did contain most of the deleted scenes, but they were super low res and there was no option to view them 'inmovie'. For a low budget Jr. Director's flick, this did have good effects. For a Post 9/11 film (made before 9/11) this had some odd reminders. The fine line here is not revealing too much and not skipping over certain details. What did that old lady tell Donnie? :-)It's been some time since I've seen the Ladder, so I will probably pick that one up and watch it again and compare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really thought that Donnie Darko was a really great movie. Everything about it, from Donnie needing the therapy to the crazy looking bunny seemed like it could be something someone could really think they were seeing.However, I didn't like the ending. I know it was more supposed to mean he was happy hence why he was killed, but it was disappointing in that he never got to meet "Gretchen" again. She seemed like the only character who didn't understand him, but didn't have to. She just was with him through everything. Other than that, loved the movie.Everyone did a great acting job, except for that Chinese girl. I almost couldn't understand what the point of her was. I know she had a crush on Donnie or something, but did she always have to say "shut up"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest films in recent years, it is a film that truly makes you think. I've seen it many times and i still haven't figured out some of the true meanings behind this story. This film i think has some very true lessons, such as everything on earth dies alone, which Roberta Sparrow told Donnie close to the beginning of the story, and the idea that many people we look up to are hypocrites....Cunningham. Also when Frank asks Donnie in the movie theater "why are you wearing that stupid man suit?" that shows a true meaning about humans in general, that we act very different then anything else on this earth. This is my favorite movie, and I think everyone should see it to see if they can figure out all of the symbolism and mysteries of this complex story line. 10/10 *****!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a film by first time writer-director Richard Kelly. Starring Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie a teenager in 1988 who finds out the world is going to end in about a month. When I first watched this movie, to be honest, my first reaction was "What the hell was that all about." But after watching it more and more times, you find so many things in every viewing. I could not believe a movie could affect you in so many ways. This film is at times extremely funny (The dinner scene is hilarious), yet also a deep and beautiful drama. On one level the plot is a complicated sci-fi and on another a simple teenage love story. It's a tragedy to rival Hamlet, yet also one of the most uplifting movies in years. Anyone can watch this movie and take something different from it. With brilliant performances from all involved and wonderful direction from Richard Kelly, this is a movie that gets better with every viewing and after my sixth viewing I'm still discovering new aspects and ideas behind it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An easily disliked film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Extra material on DVD I rented included a number of scenes that were cut from the final release. I think a lot more could have been cut. Drew Barrymore does not add luster to the name of a distinguished American theatrical family by her association with this movie. Jake Gylenhaal performs very well, but he may have been distressed with the finished product. His film parents are overgrown juveniles, particularly his father who is first seen playfully threatening his wife with some sort of electric pruning instrument. This is the father of teenagers! Later on he is seen as unable to remember the name of the psychiatrist treating his son for rather severe mental health problems. A detached parent. And mother seems to be rather vaguely distracted as she wanders about with a half smile on her face and a drink in her hand. And then there are the people at Donnie's school, including an inept principal and an incredibly stupid teacher. No wonder Donnie takes refuge in his dark visions. The problems of a young man trying to cope with his own terrifying inner world of demons should have been handled with more sympathy and less reliance on special effects.This is an unlikable picture about unlikable people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director's Cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie tends to polarize people, either they love it or hate it. Like the movie Memento, this is not an easy movie to watch and an even harder one to understand. At it heart, the movie is about teen alienation, and has over the last few years gained a cult following on DVD. As such, a directors cut is in limited release in some cities, The new version includes about 20 minutes of new scenes, and some additional special effects have been added.The main character, Donnie Darko, is a brilliant, but troubled teen who, as we find out, is undergoing therapy. Donnie claims to see a 6 foot tall rabbit who tells him that the world will end in 28 days. In addition, the rabbit saves Donnie's life (from a falling jet engine), and then proceeds to guide his actions over the next 28 days. The original version of the movie left viewers to make up their own minds about what was going on: Is Donnie delusional or is the world coming to an end? The Director's cut gives a few more answers while also adding scenes involving Donnie's family and therapist. (For those who want all the answers, listen to the Director's commentary on the DVD)This movie is not for anyone who wants to sit back and relax for a couple of hours. However the movie is visually impressive for a small budget (5 million dollars) independent movie. Many of the scenes are stunning and well worth watching even if you don't believe the movie as a whole works. My advice, take a chance and walk on the Dark side.</fullReview>

The plot, isn't too complicated in my opinion, it just needs a little thought. It's a choice between life and death, and Donnie has to decide which brings the most relief.If you like to be able to remember your films, and to discuss them in the pub later, this is for you. If you like to leave your brain at home in a jar when you go to the cinema, then don't watch this.My opinion.. 10/10, one of my top 10 films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko: This superb low budget gem is an engrossing and strange tale of a troubled young man named Donnie. He is troubled by visions, in particular of a figure in a rabbit suit named Frank. Frank tells Donnie to do certain things, from flooding his school to burning someone's house down.The story essentially starts a while after Donnie's psychological problems. When we first see him he is already on medication and has a psychiatrist. The story confuses, but for this sort of film it is confusion in a good way, much like David Lynch's films. As the story progresses we become more intrigued by who Frank is and what will happen. When he first contacts Donnie he tells him the world will end in 12 days. The film has a great ending that really grabs you a leaves a lasting impression. I enjoyed the film immensely especially as it is something different from the usual films released.The cast are very good. Jake Gyllenhaal perfectly portrays the tortured teen Donnie, and his sister Maggie plays Donnie's sister in the movie too. This gives a realism to the brother sister dynamic, and not to mention she is a good actress as well. There is also good support from Jena Malone and also Patrick Swayze and Drew Barrymore.Overall a Lynch styled thriller that is always intriguing and watchable. *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Movies You'll Ever See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was just recently introduced to this movie about 4 months ago by an ex boyfriend. I had never even heard of this movie before he told me about it, but I'm so glad he did. By far this is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. I was so floored by the end of the movie that my mouth was to the floor and I was close to tears at the thought of the decision Donnie had made. Afterwards I had to watch it again, and I began to understand the movie more and more, and in different perspectives. I just love the way the movie forces you to think, ponder, and have so many questions that you wish you could ask. I find it hard to believe that this movie didn't do so well when it first came out, but I find that it was the fault of bad marketing and getting it out to the public. Thankfully the loyal fans of this movie worked their power of word of mouth, and made this movie the cult phenomenon that it is today. I'm excited to hear of it's re-release with the Director's Cut, but saddened that it's only in select theaters. I'm sure that I will not get to see the movie, unless it does well in the other theaters. So I urge you to see the Director's Cut if it is playing in your city and tell your friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did laugh a little, but didn't cry. Just being different doesn't make a movie good, but this one is a good movie that is definitely different. My own interpretation is that the way it turned out at the end is the way it really happened in the beginning, but we just saw how bad things would've turned out if hadn't happened that way. In other words, if the sky is falling it'll just makes things worse if you try to get out of the way, . That's about as clear as I can get about Donnie Darko. Along the way of making this important point, there was lots of good acting, situation comedy of the darker kind and shameless hypocrisy . The DVD was not the best ever pressed as the video was often grainy and smeary but there are a few interesting extras that you'd never see on a cable/satellite broadcast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The world of Donnie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" is a very well developed movie. After watching the commentaries, I gained much respect for the cast and crew. Not only did not one person get paid for the film, but they did all of the scenes in 28 days.Many big blockbusters of today don't have near the acting or script that "Donnie Darko" achieved and take months or even years to accomplish. The director did an amazing job with the sources he had, and in the end, had a great cast of actors and actresses. The ending also lets the viewer decide for themselves the whole meaning of the movie. The movie also sticks in your head. I saw the film approximately 2 weeks ago and still can't stop thinking about it. The movie makes you think a lot about what happened and makes you want to go back and watch it again to make sure you didn't miss something. I'm very excited to see the directors cut edition of the film that is said to come out sometime this summer. If you saw the deleted scenes on the DVD, you know that there was plenty more to put into the movie that would make it even better. In conclusion I would like to say that I believe this movie is one of the greatest films I've ever seen and I truly look forward to seeing more work from this director and his cast and crew.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, where should I start.. I have watched Donnie Darko 4 or 5 time and it gets better every time. That may be because I'm interested about physics, worm holes, time traveling etc. The movie is pretty difficult to understand but my opinion is: this movie shouldn't be understood in one way. Everyone should have their own way to understand the idea of Donnie Darko. If someone come to me and says "Donnie Darko was the worst movie I've ever seen", I'll just say to him "go home, watch it again and in this time CONCENTRATE!" Like I said Donnie Darko is the best movie I've ever seen. Everything was good: plot, actors/actresses, direction, script, even the music was perfect. I would highly recommend this movie for everyone which can concentrate. My vote for this movie is 11/10 :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is, so far, my favorite movie of the new millennium. it took me a few (2 or 3) repeat viewings to understand why some regard the young, troubled character as a superhero, but it doesn't change my opinion of the film. it just means i'm a little slow.story: i guess it's a given that it's pretty much derivative, but the set-up, i think, is pretty original. this is probably prominently seen in again, donnie possessing "super powers", but also roberta sparrow's book. the intertwining of philosophy, science fiction, and a little bit of religion is well done.acting: jake gyllenhaal is my favorite young actor right now. it's like when i saw tom hanks in big for the first time. he gives a great performance in this film as a socially-confused (well, schizophrenic) sixteen year old, resembling a young robert deniro hahahaha. anyway, the rest of the cast, the darkos and the supporting roles, also give very good performances to guide donnie to his destiny, if you would call it that. i'm kind of neutral about drew barrymore though.direction: i was surprised when i was informed that this is the debut movie by richard kelly, a usc graduate, who also wrote AND directed the film. his style would make you think that he's actually been around for a while. you can see aspects of other classic movies in the film. i also like the way he keeps an ominous/apocalyptic atmosphere throughout the movie, even when it's at its light-hearted side.visuals: i love the visuals in this film. for an independent movie, they're pretty well done, especially the solar plexus spears (maybe kelly's nod to james cameron's the abyss or something, i dunno). anyway, visually, the film is brilliant. the most memorable is the aero theater scene (titled frightmare fest or something on the DVD), which features sam raimi's the evil dead.overall: a well-written, visually great film, donnie darko is probably one that few people have heard of and it's a big shame. it has enough heart and thought that can rival what are considered the best movies ever made and barely anyone has seen it. i think that it wouldn't appeal to some people though, especially the head-scratcher ending, and to these people, check-out the movie's official website. to those that have seen it, spread the word. this is a movie that begs to be heard.(10 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Destiny and free will clash in the Fourth Dimension.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is not only a savvy satire of recent American culture, but a clever, passionate cocktail of genres. Richard Kelly has brought psychology and philosophy to a new level as he explores the life of 16 year old Donald Darko. Misunderstood from the start, Donnie is awoken one night but what he believes to be a man in a bunny suit. Seduced by the rabbit, Frank, Donnie is led from his room, which is pummeled by a rogue jet engine in his absence. Frank uses his introduction tell Donnie that the world will end in 28 days.Donnie spends the next 28 days of his life experiencing not only more hallucinations, but social and moral conflicts that bring the audience to understand Donnies purpose. Frank manipulates Donnie into a series of vandalisms that expose corruption, reveal truth, and prepare Donnie for the worlds end.The audience follows Donnie through 28 days of drama and teen struggles as he begins to understand the grim connection between time, the universe, and all people. Ultimately, we are all faced with the same questions...and must make the most difficult choice of all...To conform to destiny's plan, forsaking life and love...or to betray the our paths. Donnie Darko is the bittersweet story of what could have been, and what should be.</fullReview>

Anyone who says it's bad or dumb has not bothered to try to figure it out. Actually, at this point I'm not sure if it can be totally figured out. Want to try? You must read the book! (A Philosophy of Time Travel, that is.) This helps but still doesn't spell everything out. I also found some answers in the Deleted Scenes on the DVD.After viewing the movie for the first time, you might have some of your own ideas, and they might be totally unique, but I guarantee there will be something you miss! If you are like me, you missed a lot of it but were curious enough to try to dig out some of the answers.If you don't have a curious nature, you'll probably just think the movie is dumb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not one of those who like to agree with the majority. Thus, I'm in a predicament now that I know how highly it has been rated.The film was recommended by a colleague who couldn't praise it enough. So, finally I get around to watching the dvd today and have to say it didn't dissapoint. The cinematography was excellent. The plot a little confusing. It is easy, I can understand, for someone to say that they completely understood the film and the concept just to make themselves look intelligent. Also, denouncing the film could leave you looking like a moron who didn't even give the film a chance. All I will say is watch it once. Even then, you'll at least think it original. Then watch it with the commentary and there will be that 'oh, I get it now..' feeling and a 'that was clever now wasn't it' feeling after playing the special features and interacting on the website.People say this is a film made for dvd. This is not a mocking comment but merely a reference to the fact that this film is better watched on dvd. Seeing the film once, may leave you feeling unsatisfied. As the whole conclusion to the film can be seen as quite vague some might argue this was done on purpose. This may have possibly been to make you think about the plot, to see it again, or maybe go out and buy the dvd and exchange ideas with others about what you though it meant. Thus, generating a cult of sorts (which it appears to have achieved). Some of the best films are those you want to watch again and again, not once, and then feel satisfied. You will watch this film once and want to watch it again to fully understand it. Then again, to pick up clever little bits you never saw. Then again, for pure enjoyment, and so on.Those of us who want a dvd packed with special features you actually want to see, that help you understand the film more, and that has a link to a website, where more fun and games await, should definitely get this.</fullReview>

The writer and director was forced to cut some 20 scenes after filming. With the extra scenes the viewer can understand the meaning of divine intervention in this film and also the viewer can read the book 'Time Travel' from the DVD extra features, which explains the philosophy of the movie which seems bizarre to say the least. Without the DVD the movie is a tripped out confusing piece of work that seems to make a point out of being bizarre. With the DVD features this movie has become a classic, you can spend hours analyzing and picking apart all the intricacies put into this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the movie is about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER When you have seen this movie you will be confused of what actually happened, a travel in time, another dimension etc etc. However the only realistic answer is that everything is a dream (almost)! He actually lay in his bed and imagine the whole story which a quick scene at the end shows, also the background song is a bit of a clue, not to forget the many logical/unlogical things that happened, which is a normal way of a dream to act. The characters in his dream is of course people he has seen, e.g. the girl he imagined to be his girlfriend, or Frank who is his sisters friend (one scene reveals that). The only thing you do not know is whether he has scizofrenia with paranoia syndroms or if it is a normal dream that everyone can have (you might guess the first alternative because he behaves a little unnormal when he suddenly wakes up and then goes to sleep, but then again, what is normal...). The movie basically describes when you almost know from a feeling what is going to happen to you in a long period of time (some parts might be wrong, other parts right, other parts almost right etc), a kind of dejavu feeling that has not happened really yet (or will sometimes). But unfortunately our character dies just after when he goes to sleep again, from a real aeroplane jet engine. Now, the real twist is: is it all a coincidence, or did he somehow become enlightened of what would happen? I myself believe that it is a random event that he dreamed of a aeroplane jet engine and later that he died of one, and the reason for it is strictly unexplainable.</fullReview>

I would answer to that question: You won't like it if you have expectations, things that are not necessary meant to be in this movie. That's why this movie is so special, you won't have anything to predetermine or anticipate, you will just watch the movie and let it show you another side of the world. It will brake these cliché that have been found in many movies nowadays, and rise above the level of most of them.

		<shortDescription>Not so friggin' complicated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Still a great movie. Here's my plot synopsis so *spoiler alert* here must be advertised:Begins with Donnie's vision of the world ending. He wakes up on a golf course after having a conversation with an 'evil bunny rabbit'. Finds that his house has been ravaged by the jet engine of a plane that seems to not exist in this universe. He tries to figure out a series of events that he finds perplexing, all of which deal with his place in the universe, typical adolescent angst and such, but with the additional, compelling factors that can be summarized as: he communicates with a bunny that orders him to coordinate acts of vandalism and he needs to find out what course of events is leading him to perform these acts. Destiny? Free Will? Will the world end? If so, is he God, since he seems to control all aspects of the developing scenario?He begins to be interested in time travel. It must be noted that this is only tangentially important. All "information" Donnie receives is part of his "life passing before his eyes". The Drew Barrymore character, Noah Wyle, the "Grandma Death" his sex fantasies...It's hallucination and madness as he dies. More on that later.So, the film unfolds as we wind down to the end of the universe. Other reviewers have not noted how funny this movie is. Any teen high school movie I must watch and these scenes are above average. We are treated to a high school experience that, while not real, is ironic, tragic and disgusting and, thus, as real if not more real than the real thing. We see how the bunny rabbit--a costume worn by a trick or treater with his eye blown out--gets shot by Donnie on Halloween night for running over the love of his life, the one who just might save him for the inevitable solitary death that he fears. It is all tied together, incompletely of course, because it's a dream.As the mother returns home from LA with Donnie's sister (in a parallel universe of course) the jet engine dislodges--killing the mother in, presumably a different movie--and falling on the Donnie Darko house, whose resident Donnie is NOT out on a golf course but in bed, dreaming revenge fantasies that he will never live to complete.From here the movie should end, but it doesn't, showing us scenes of family members crying which are really not necessary.Analysis is stupid. Watch it because at it's best it is funny as hell. And Donnie's character is well acted. The script is great. Don't be a fool and buy into the "it's confusing" racket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What really annoys me is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...the fact that most of the negative Donnie Darko reviews I've seen are so close-minded. Everyone is complaining about the holes of the plot and the slow-moving storyline. People...:Donnie Darko is not a movie for anyone who expects concrete facts to be presented to them clearly. It's not supposed to cater to your ignorance and mental laziness by telling you straight-out things like, "What did the Chinese girl have to do with anything?" or "What was with Grandma Death?" This is a movie with deep symbolism that you need to find for yourself. Nothing will be explained to you in this movie... don't watch it if you're going to complain about being confused or there not being enough action. Obviously this isn't an action flick; you have to be in the right mood if you want to fully appreciate it.Also, some of the negative reviews I've read seem to have been written by people who could potentially enjoy this movie, but instead chose not to before they even saw it. They don't want to like anything that is popular, and so they create problems with the movie so that they can be different...If you consider yourself thoughtful or philosophical, watch this movie... and don't watch it to either accept or reject the opinions of its incredible fan-base... just watch it for yourself, with an open mind. And remember... don't treat it like any other film. Analyzing the subject matter of Donnie Darko requires... eccentricity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A trip down the Rabbit hole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year 2001 was infact a rebirth for the Fantasy genre, with both Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings dominating the screen. Aside from this rookie film-maker Richard Kelly had his own, if more low key feature ready for release into society. Often in the Independant film world, a director will choose to make a film that goes against the norm whether it be in style or in content. Kelly is no exception, Donnie Darko is one of the most curious and interesting films of 2002.As I sit hear writing this review I cannot think of a more appropriate word to describe the films setup so ill just go with 'captivating'. From the very start Kelly invites humour to the table and then throws darker themes into the mix, but with a humorous twist.(Like a 6ft tall rabbit name Frank) Some people may be put off by the unconvential style to the film, mixing comedy, drama and science fiction elements but it works. The atmosphere throughout the film is pretty uneasy, just like Donnie you feel that something is going to happen but you dont quite understand why or how. Its this intrigue that hooks the viewer in the first place using a subtle blend of light comedic moments and haunting visuals to create such a curious tone to the film. Unlike David Lynch who also explores unconvential themes in a vague metaphorical way, the film is actually quite easy to follow but complex for those who wish to analyze its many layers. Packed with symbolism and demanding multiple viewings, some may be irritated by such a heavy handed approach but infact it is integral to the plot itself. I wouldnt recommend watching if your in the mood for an easy to follow film nor would I recommend watching with company. Of course this is just my opinion but for full effect bolt the door shut and submerse yourself in the film, its worthwhile.Although alot of the film is set in low light, it doesnt detract from looking crisp and sharp throughout. Kelly also creates his own style of flipping the camera or trailing characters and put to music almost seems perfect synchronization. Music throughout the film is used alot in key scenes whether it be gental ambience or 'Echo and the Bunnymen', both sides fuel the atmosphere Kelly is going for and create both a energetic and emotionally charged effect. In fact nothing Kelly uses whether it is the dialogue or the camera itself seems out of place or inappropriate. Choosing to direct the film in a diary of events fashion seemed the only natural way to do the film considering the plot, almost a countdown to doomsday style helping crank up the tension. In some scenes the music will create an aura of menace perfectly fit for the situation, othertimes the music turns to a more religious tone making an ordinary cinema seem like a surreal backdrop for the events that follow. Particularly the lyrics in each song seem to be more than fitting, from 'Mad World' to 'Under the Milky Way' it can make scenes deeply saddening and beautiful. On a side note the theme in the credits ('For whom the bell tolls') is extremely reflective and although not included on the soundtrack should be acknowledged.At heart the film explores the character of Donnie with themes of teenage insecurity being mixed with philosophical aspects. Slack jawed with a unsettling expression, Jake Gyllenhaal, a relatively unknown actor at the time molds into his character well..so well it seems that the role almost seems tailor made. Gyllenhaal balances an act of emotional instability with dry humour convincingly, with the plot being centered around him its just as well the lead role is strong. Thankfully the supporting cast is just as effective, even Patrick Swayze and Drew Barrymore who I wouldnt really go mad over seem to suit their roles well even if they are pawns to the plot more than anything. Kelly's care for his characters is shown through no character being weak or underused, both the relationships and lesser characters are all the more believable and all have something ticking inside them making the story all the more fascinating.In retrospect, Donnie Darko is a hard film to criticise as it does nothing really wrong. The story enticing, the atmosphere unsettling and for once leaving me in a state of stupefaction, I can whole heartily recommend this to anyone with the patience and interest to give it a go.9 out of 10</fullReview>

If only other directors would follow this caliber of film making rather than making pointless Hollywood mish mash like 90% of the film industry. This is why I am glad that major actress Drew Barrymore saw fit to give Kelly's script the attention it deserved. Richard's film was and still is a philosophical masterpiece, unlike atrociously bad films such as Waking Life. I wish I could make small, yet sophisticated film and have someone like Drew believe in my talents. Maybe one day someone will take my ideas under their wing.

		<fullReview>At the end of Donnie Darko, my friend and I just sat in the theatre, trying to figure out what had happened. We were immersed in a sweet kind of confusion. We had no idea what had just happened, but both of us came out of the theatre saying that it was the best movie we'd been to in a long time. Donnie Darko is the kind of movie that keeps you thinking for days or weeks after you've seen it. After seeing it several times now, I think perhaps I've got it figured out, but I keep wanting to watch to see if I can figure anything else out. While Donnie Darko is confusing and dark, it is also funny and entertaining. It is set in the mid to late 80s, and deals with elements of science fiction, family issues, psychological issues, teenaged issues, and more. It's a bit of a farce on societal factors as well, with the whole Love and Fear thing. The acting, especially by Jake Gyllenhaal and Mary McDonnel, is believable and real. I just enjoy Donnie Darko more each time I watch it. I recommend it to anyone who can appreciate a little science fiction mixed in with everything else any good movie would have to offer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will freely admit what others have said about this film on this movie database: the plot is deeply ingrained, perhaps even nonsensical. Still, how much does that matter when the product as a whole is as stupendous as Donnie Darko is?I had to watch the DVD director's commentary before I fully understood this film, but at the same time it is practically the only film that has inspired me to watch the director's commentary in its entirety. It features one of the greatest uses of music I have ever encountered in a film; it is cinematographically brilliant and original; it contains an ensemble cast performance that is beyond criticism; it pushes the limits of what can be achieved in the modern Hollywood film industry. What more need you know before rushing out to see this movie?Add to what I've already mentioned the fact that this film features a giant talking rabbit and you've got a genuine classic on your hands. Ignore any negative comments you may have heard on this topic: Donnie Darko is a work of brilliance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the movie was great. I am a avid movie watcher, and I first thought when I heard the name Donnie Darko, "Oh, this movies gonna suck." However, I thought the flick was great. It was a different style, and I love how the director added so much Tears For Fears music throughout the movie.That was great to add in the 80's music to an 80's movie. Great movie, great acting and everyone should see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this film. My initial reaction on hearing the plot was that it was some kind of stupid, Bill-and-Ted-esque comedy. I mean, a giant evil rabbit, prophesising the end of the world. Pack it in. But upon seeing this film, it really wasn't stupid. Very well made, and surprisingly stylish given the fact that it's a debut, it's both funny and moving, and definitely a thinker. I can see why it wouldn't appeal to some, as it's not what you'd describe as transparent, but if you like Twin Peaks, and you like spending hours after seeing a film discussing what it meant, then you'll like Donnie Darko. The central character is very well played by Jake Gyllenhaal, and it is one of the few movies with patrick swayze in that you won't be embarrassed to admit you like. The only problem is that the end is very bewildering, but hey, I'm a David Lynch fan, I can cope with that.</fullReview>

Mark my words this will become as much of a cult film as Blade Runner.To sum up - Great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of the few media products to defy all expectations and seriously progress a format. I think this film is one of the most significant I have ever seen ,and will become a classic over time. Its release lacked the exposure it truly deserved, but this will serve the film well as word of mouth will only be positive. the concepts and ideas presented here are seen as fantastic, but they are rooted in truth, in modern, accepted scientific theories, well most of it. I think that this is a film of unique character, its very special and I don't believe that anyone who watched it will fail to be affected by it. Whilst watching, i couldn't be a critic and stand back because I found so much truth, beauty on the screen. This is an epic achievement, and the only reason it could fail is because all the influential critics of our time are of another generation and don't see just how accurate and truthful this film is. If you are of an age where you can say "Nirvana? Oh yes, my son/daughter likes them" then watch this film and learn from it. If you can watch this film and say "Joy Division? never heard of them, but i like that song" Its probably you its talking about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko, a fantastic movie. The most original, well put together film I feel I have ever seen. Even pieces such as 2001, Vanilla Sky and The Matrix do not compare. I won't spoil the storyline but I shall just support my viewpoint by telling you that you shouldn't expect to understand the storyline straight off. You should at least investigate "The Philosophy of Time Travel" the "book" (short pamphlet thing).If you like original, thought provoking filmmaking, you will not be dissapointed by this, the directorial debut of Richard Kelly.There are a few problems I have with the film, just minor points, I feel it is a little too mysterious for it's own good, and Drew Barrymore's performance is less than spectacular, however the filmmaking, cinematography, camera work, lighting, effects, music, and for the large part (especially Jake Gyllenhaal, a fantastic performance) the acting was absolutely brillant.Close enough to a 10 to make it a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie doesn't make any assumptions about what is real or not while remaining faithfully rooted in the late 80's.It touches many of the Fortean chords struck by Magnolia such as the deeper consequences of coincidence and the nature of fate. It also skewers "Positive Attitude Gurus", stage mothers and idiotic educators. It's very entertaining, slightly confusing and will make you think.Perhaps edited a bit heavily - would have been nice to get a few more tasty "hints" about the larger themes, but the vagueness leads to more interpretations of the events.Get the DVD so you can hear the director's commentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is great. It was hard to come up with a solid rating for how much I liked it, but the more I learn about it (The Philosophy of Time Travel), the more I think about it -- trying to work it all out in my head and the more I watch the movie and start noticing subtle little hints and things, the more I love it and realize how truly great it is. I love how this movie has much more to understand and dig into deeper for those who actually want to take the time to understand everything and every aspect of the movie and why things happened. But at the same time for those who DON'T dig into the movie any further than just watching it...the movie still makes all it's points about about fate, life, love and course of actions. It gives you so few real answers in the end, that you are forced to think about this movie.  The production itself was also great the mood and atmosphere were effective, the acting was good, the comedy was real and funny, the creepiness was creepy in a believable way, the feelings of characters was well portrayed, each song fit meaningfully into the movie and created an emotional poignancy.....I'll just stop talking now, and hope that you decide to see this movie now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>an auspicious, debut from the man who is the independent scene's latest wunderkind, Donnie Darko feels like the work of a seasoned veteran. it's rhythm and plotline are occasionally interrupted by the use of story cards describing the amount of days left to a mysterious occurance, but the real treasure here is the screenplay and the direction, both by Kelly. while some films are ruined by directors who wear their influences on their sleeves, Kelly takes the teen movie and breathes new life into it. with equal influence from John Hughes, robert redford and martin scorsese, Kelly's film is dark, cynical and clever. it's sad story is about a schizophrenic teen (played by Jake Gylenhaal in a competent performance) with haunting visions of a demonic rabbit. and this bunny is no Harvey. he's a sinister spectre, who forces the boy to commit horrible acts. there a lot of concepts floating around here, such as parents living vicariously through their children, parents misunderstanding their children, children misunderstanding children, time travel, death, life, religion, religion...more religion. an overall decent effort, but no classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk about a waste of celluloid. Think of all the money that goes into the entire production of a movie. I visited the Website for this movie some time ago. The site made this movie seem like if it would be an interesting movie, especially since it's a movie that deals with the concept of time travel (supposedly). I finally got around to seeing this movie. While watching it, I was trying to figure out what the heck this movie was about. Was this a movie about a paranoid schizophrenic who has hallucinations? Was this a movie about time travel? Was this a movie about a sinister extraterrestrial? Did the movie have to do with any of that at all? All I know is that I was very bored while watching this movie. What's even worse than the movie itself is the reaction of some of the viewers of this movie. I can't stand reading reviews from people who try to find hidden symbolism or try to look for a subliminal layer in all the films that they watch, when there is none of that. Can't they just watch a movie and review it objectively, for what it is, rather than trying to look for a nonexistent underlying meaning to the movie? A stupid movie is simply that: a stupid movie. A boring movie is simply that: a boring movie. "Donnie Darko" is nothing but a glorified B-Movie</fullReview>

(It should be noted #1 on my list is Austin Powers so it's not giving the movie right justice) Jake Gyllenhaal plays such a truely unique character, suffering from his own mind and questioning whether he's the insane one. It shows what the world is and what could happen, if the "space time continum" was broken. The way everything fit together so perfectly was phenominal. (Yes, it may take many watches, some long thoughts at night, and listening to the driector's comments before you completely understand but it's worth it.) All in all, a cult movie? Yes.

I can't really summarize it, since there would be a lot to write about it (and consequently a lot to spoil). This movie is a sort of avante garde "I hate most of what I see around me" kind of film.

		<shortDescription>"Fan the Flame" Campaign for "Donnie Darko" - Cult Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a comparatively little known film about a teenage schizophrenic superhero (Don't ask), Donnie Darko's No.114th placing in the IMDB Top250 is no mean feat. Infact, the growing (and heartening) support for this movie can only bear testament to its rising cult following."Donnie Darko" started off with an offbeat, almost disjointed set-up, much like a wound up toy with a screw loose, charging headlong into diverse cinematic genres. Is it trying to be a sci-fi movie? A horror flick? Or a nostalgic 80's coming-of-age drama? Who cares?But as chaotic as it may initially seem, all its jarring pieces somehow fell into place, culminating into an emotional pay-off so prophetic, one can't help but be blindsided by its audaciousness. Seriously, who wouldn't go teary eyed over that divinely executed "Mad World" sequence, after having seen all which preceded it?This is one of the most profoundly moving film I have ever seen.Granted, Donnie Darko did not get its deserved recognition during its initial run last year. Being overly-hyped before its Sundance premier, the film as a result bore the unfair brunt of a critical backlash.But now that the dust has settled, I am glad that there are re-newed interests in this movie. People are talking about it more and more. With its current availability on Homevideo/ DVD, it'll only be a matter of time when people start discovering the richness of "Donnie Darko", more so after repeated viewings. Hence, here's my call to the growing numbers out there who have seen Donnie Darko. If you, like me, have fallen under its spell, I dare urge all to help in re-surrecting it to its full potential. Let's share the buzz and spread the word about this mini-masterpiece. Tell all your friends to go see "Donnie Darko", then talk about it and go see it again. Who knows, together we may even be able to help push "Donnie Darko" into becoming this decade's "Shawshank Redemption". Now wouldn't that be nice?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dark-o ride into the mysterious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Donnie Darko is an intriguing one. It is one large story with many smaller sub-plots within it's strange interior. The movie itself is well put together if not a bit confusing at times, but follow closely and you will be enthralled in a story as dark and strange as you can imagine. The movie revolves mainly around Donnie Darko, a teen filled with the usual teen angst. Donnie however is a dillusional schizophrenic who has recurring visions of a tall demonic looking rabbit who seems to be leading him somewhere. Where the rabbit is leading Donnie and what the rabbit is trying to tell him you only find out at the end in a climax that ties all together in a puzzling "think about it for days after" type ending that can lead to so many different conclusions depending on your own beliefs and personality. The movie is beautifully shot and well acted. Stephen Poster should be commended for his wonderful cinematography and Michael Andrews score fits the overall feel of the movie quite well while adding to it very effectively. Jake Gyllenhaal as well should be commended for his portrayal of Donnie, and the overall cast was well chosen. The film was well edited and the lighting was also well done. This movie was well done overall and I feel if anyone has a problem with the movie it would be director and writer Richard Kelly's complicated and strange script which I in particular found quite original and very interesting. If you like movies that make you think and make you feel...Donnie Darko is just the ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darko is complex and inspiring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is perhaps the best movie I've ever seen. A story about God, fate, mental illness, and self-sacrifice, Darko is the brilliant first attempt at film-making by Richard Kelly. Jake Gillenhaal is amazing as troubled teen Donnie. He's not sure if he's going crazy, or if all that he sees really happening. He slowly disconnects from the world, even the people he loves the most. And in the end, the film is about Donnie Darko coming to terms with who he is and what he must do.The film also boasts fantastic performances by all it's players, including a surprising display of talent by Patrick Swayze, who plays a self-help guru who's teachings appear to be taking root in Donnies home town. Swayze's character is a man in a lot of pain on the inside, and his final scene is emotionally touching. I'm amazed that I had never heard of this movie until a few months ago. It is worthy of a national release, but I guess the powers that be felf either people wouldn't get it, or that it wasn't worth their time. Don't let the fact that you've never heard of it fool you. Anyone out there who hasn't seen this film, do so now. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's rare these days to see a film taken to meet it's full potential as an art form. `Donnie Darko' achieves this, brilliantly. There is no way to properly categorize, or even explain this film.It begins feeling almost slow, but the beautiful scenery, and haunting music compensate well. You are then drawn in by a family that is rarely seen on screen. Multi-dimensional, funny and caring, and above all, realistic. I think that may be the movies strongest point. Its character development is impeccable. We are not simply given stereotypical characters; the neurotic mother, the troubled teen, the bratty sister, and so forth. We are shown people living and reacting to various occurrences in a number of different ways. It hits home a little more, so to speak.The plot takes many different twists and turns, branching off until you are involved with countless peoples lives, but miraculously, not overwhelmed by it all. A great deal of `Donnie Darko' is laden with intelligent, and quirky humour. From a debate about the mating habits of smurfs, to a mind-numbing motivational speaker, the film has some definite hilarious moments.It also has some fairly dark moments. A key character is actually a 6-foot tall, somewhat `intimidating', bunny, named Frank. He is what, more or less, holds the movie together, forcing it along. The idea may sound silly at first, but it captures the dark-funny-bizarre tone of the film very well.I will say, this is a movie you have to watch until the end. And it's definitely a movie that gets better and better every time you watch it. It has so many layers to it. There are a lot of things you may not pick up on, that just make the entire movie that much more incredible. And a lot of things that you don't even know are relevant until you reach the end.See this film. It will leave you speechless, and questioning just about everything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie ever about divine intervention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To tell the honest truth, the only reason why I saw this movie in the first place was because it had Noah Wyle. Though when I watched the movie the first time, I thought to myself that this had to be the strangest movie I had ever seen. It wasn't until the night after my high school graduation, that I watched it again. This time I watched it on DVD with all the deleted scenes and extras. This cleared up any questions I had about the movie. I have now seen this movie 5 times and have bought it for my collection.*****POSSIBLE SPOILER*********I wanted to take some time to explain what I think this movie was about. This is a movie completely about God's intervention in the lives of humans. When Donnie is saved from catastrophe at the beginning of the movie, God (symbolized by a 6 foot rabbit) intervenes and saves Donnie from certain death. The rest of the movie is to show what would have happened if Donnie really would have survived. Donnie sees that everyone that is part of his life is hurt in some way because he survived. At the conclusion of film we see Donnie actually live out the reality of that most certain death. He chose to die instead of hurting all the people he cares about. This shows the difference between free will and God's sovereignty. If you wanted to you could say that Donnie represented Christ by sacrificing himself for everyone's better good.**********************************************************************There is so much to this movie, I do not recommend you to watch it by yourself. This is a movie that needs to be watched with extra eyes and ears and then discussed over a nice cup of coffee for a night cap.Quality of movie: Excellent (Barrymore's performance is a little weak but not bad)Language: Partially rough mainly sexual references and drug contentSex: NoneExcellent debut by Richard Kelly.</fullReview>

This movie made me think and feel more than any I have seen in a long time. It is fun just trying to figure out what is going on. It really demands multiple viewings. But this is no purely intellectual exercise. The film is extremely moving, from Donnie's love affair with Jena Malone , to his increasing alienation, to the performance of his loving, grieving mother, to the under-recognized performance of Catherine Ross as Donnie's shrink. I really don't want to say too much. Great story, great acting, great look, and yes, great soundtrack (I was a teen in the eighties).See this movie. Now.</fullReview>

In addition, the way in which everything is tied together like a neat package in the end will make you want to rewind this a few times. I was left, literally, with my jaw wide open at the end as I felt like I was being played with the whole time. It all came together like you'd never thought possible. The moral behind the movie is also one that is very usable in real life. That's why I connected with this movie so well. If you're really in the mood for a shoot-em-up thriller... this is NOT the movie for you. However, with the absence of guns and the such, this movie will still knock your socks off. It's surprising I didn't see any advertisements for this movie when it came out. Anyway, make sure the lights are off and the volume is max if you really want to experience Donnie Darko...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is awesome. That's it. The title character is so brilliantly acted as a potentially psychotic character... although its up the viewer whether he is or not after they see the end. The events throughout the film tie together so well, even though they may not be obvious without seeing it more then once or really thinking about it. Many of the characters seemed irrelevant, but I realized why they were there after I saw the end. The theories presented in this movie are things to think about, and this adds to the quality of the movie immensely. I absolutely love a movie that makes you think or rethink what you know. I loved this movie so much... I might go as far as calling it perfect. But I won't hesitate to say that it was perfect to me. See this one. Rent it, or buy it because I guarantee you will watch it many times. But don't include in a casual movie night because this one's a thinker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is the kind of film that makes you want to hit the rewind button and watch it all over again to catch the little details that you know you missed. The film is completely open to interpretation, one of the reasons I enjoy it so much. It captures the life of Donald Darko, teenage boy caught in suburbian hell, with a twist of time travel thrown in. The best way to go into the film is completely blind as you will experience it the way it was meant to be experienced. Donnie Darko takes place in the 80's, a time when political pressures were abound- and this movie captures that perfectly. The soundtrack is very complementing, both score and pop music. First time writer/director Richard Kelly takes his audience on a fascinating ride, one filled with empathetic visions of how he perceives the judgement of fate. I highly recommend this film to anyone with an imagination.Other similar movies: None. (Perhaps Mulholland Dr.)Score: 10/10Recommended: Yes, definitely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know where to start with this movie. I knew nothing about this when I saw a copy of it at the store. I had heard it was good, so I decided to check it out. The movie opens with a perfect marriage of song and screen. We hear "The Killing Moon" from Echo and the Bunnymen while the camera just starts to set-up the environment. It will hook you from that point on. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll just say that the film revolves around the life of Donnie Darko, a gifted but troubled adolescent. But this isn't like any other movie you may have seen before. It almost transcends labeling, containing elements of many different genres. A great soundtrack of 80's new wave combined with an amazing score compliment the film so well. Great performances all around and a brilliant script also make this movie a masterpiece. Drew Barrymore gives her best performance since E.T., and Jake Gyllenhaal shows his extraordinary talent for acting. After watching this, I would see a film solely on the basis of seeing his work of the craft. If this is Richard Kelly's film debut, I eagerly await his next film. Do yourself a favor and at least check it out. Then tell all your friends to do the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A troubled teenager (Jake Gyllenhaal) is plagued by visions of a large bunny rabbit that manipulates him to commit a series of crimes, after narrowly escaping a bizarre accident.Having graduated high school in 1999, I was very much a product of the 1990s. And being into the industrial music scene, I saw the 90s as a decade consumed with nihilistic imagery, both with films and music. Friedrich Nietzsche was back in a big way, for better or worse (probably worse, since he is so misunderstood by people)."Donnie Darko" missed the 1990s, but I think many people may age saw it as the film that capped their experience of adolescence. The film is quite nihilistic (in the most uplifting way) and even has James Duval in a minor (but important) role. Duval was well-known to those of us who gravitated to the films of Gregg Araki.Before we had "Lost", this was the film that sparked amateur philosophy debates. We were not quoting Locke or Descartes, but we were wondering what it all meant, what was the deeper meaning, is time travel really possible... it all seemed so profound. Looking back now (in 2013 at age 32), I cannot help but wonder how much of this was youthful eyes and mind, and how much was really in the film... but I did find myself captivated watching it (yet) again, many years since the days when it was on constant rewind.Richard Kelly was supposed to be the next big thing after this film came out. As near as I can tell, that never happened. "Southland Tales" never really took off. And then "The Box"... a film that wants to be deep, but probably is not. Many of the Darko devotees (myself included) wanted there to be something in the story, something beyond the original version, but it all seems so convoluted.Anyway, "Donnie Darko" remains a classic of modern independent cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any one who claims to understand this is suffering from metaphysics-envy. Of all the great and near-great metaphysical films these last 15 yrs, this is a wannabe. Actually, this is a student film at some film school. Technically and acting-wise it is adequate for commercial release?however this got done. Again, we have the newish problem of the director failing to put the subjective on the screen. What the f%##!? What's the problem here? It can't all be explained by 'being too close to the trees' thing. All directors have this problem; and painters, etc. These LA-spoiled twats just get stars in their eyes and go all manic-wow-wow on our asses. Won't ANYONE tell these dilettantes the truth? All tied up in the tech/glam of f'in H'wood, fer chrissakes! The actual time-travel plot is spottily described by RIchard Kelly on the DVD commentary, and besides being very vague, there is NO way anyone could see it from the film itself. So many films these days suffer from the same 'problem'. It actually is a form of apocalypse-insanity. EVERYONE has manic/depressive disorder. The 'lucky' ones with money/opportunity are ego- blown from where their maturity was arrested, and the rest of us are sitting on massive anger from our deprivation-torture in this Domination Reality (consensus reality). Anger we don't feel we have a right to have becomes guilt. Anger we feel we'll get in trouble for becomes depression.Teeny-boppers think they 'get it' about this film. BTW, Jake Gyllenhaal has got to go. The Mossad has to whack this sucker. How does an average looking guy with barely mediocre talent get cast all over the place? This is the only thing worthy of discussion about this film/video. The only thing worth discussion re Hollywood, period</fullReview>

In first case it's poor in terms of invention and imagination; in second case it's not scary enough to be good; and in third case it's not bad but not good either because just only ordinary. It looks like an ambitious movie which didn't come up to its director's expectations because he is no David Lynch or Stanley Kubrick or even Steven Spielberg. The final scenes give us the impression that the movie's director didn't know how to end the story imbroglio into which he had got and then imagined some meaningless and unconvincing sequences in a Halloween atmosphere.

		<fullReview>Too weird for me, I'm afraid. Very "Twin Peaks", by which I mean, beguiling to the eye, challenging in parts but ultimately just too confusing and abstract for my sensibilities. The acting's fine, Jake Gyllenhaal in his breakthrough role as the disturbed teenager from whose perspective everything goes crazy, Jena Malone as the even more sensitive new girl in school with whom Donnie finds a kindred spirit and some established actors in unexpected roles, like Patrick Swayze, Katharine Ross and co-producer Drew Barrymore. The early 1980's soundtrack featuring the dark and brooding Joy Division, Echo and the Bunnymen and Tears for Fears chimes in well with Donnie's gloomy psychosis, but I could sit here for hours and still not précis the plot so I won't even try. Perhaps it's all in the words of the Tears for Fears song "Mad World" played at the movie's end - "the dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had". An arresting line and, maybe for a few minutes, an interesting thought but, for me, not enough to hang a movie on.</fullReview>

And yes, there is a twist but not the kind of twist I would explain. I kind of remember being at junior school and writing a story and at the end of it saying 'It was all a dream'. The ending of course was not a dream, but I now feel as disappointed as my teacher was when she read my story.Acting, OK - good. Action OK. They even stuck a bit of a teenage romance in there.Now I like clever films, and particularly clever films with a twist at the end. But the point of those films is that you are left shocked at the end, shocked that you did not see it coming, or shocked that you can't believe it. The problem with this film, for me, is that it was so disjointed there really was not that many options available to me at the end to guess at, apart from obscure ones. The film pointed me needlessly in a more stupid and unbelievable conclusion to what was going to happen so by the end of the film I was very disappointed with what actually happened.Now I am going to give the film the benefit of the doubt as I have read that you have to see the film more than once to understand the subtleties of the film. However, after watching it once, I really cannot be bothered to watch it again and it is with great disatisfaction I give this film a four as I did make it to the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's time to put an end to this twaddle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film shortly after it came out, knowing little about it. I read the short synopsis in the cinema foyer and thought, "This sounds ok- let's give it a shot." I was slightly put off near the start of the movie by the family dinner scene. First, we have it rather badly shoehorned into the dialogue that Donnie is on medication, and closely followed by some "look how big and clever we are" swearing (before you get your back up, allow me to point out that one of my very favourite films is Goodfellas...). Uh-oh, it looks like this is going to be a film version of a teenager's diary. Sure enough, while there were some cracking moments in the dialogue ("I'm sure we've all seen Bonanza") and some genuinely stylish ideas (Donnie 'seeing' worm-like forms emitting from people's chests), there were also the well-worn gags about late 80s TV evangelists; self indulgent moaning about how 'nobody understands'; the frankly embarrassingly written discussion about the sexuality of the Smurfs (cinematically, a pathetic and childish attempt at the "Royal With Cheese" scene from Pulp Fiction); and quasi-surreal characters like Frank the Rabbit- surreal and amusing to the sort of people who think Avril Lavigne is Alternative, no doubt. I think the point where I really started to lose patience was when the psychiatrist pleads with Donnie, saying there's no way he could possibly not believe in any higher power or that there is no point to life. Could it be that Richard Kelly is emphasising Donnie's teenage worries that "nobody understands"- not even somebody who should remain impartial like a psychiatrist, or is it, as I suspect, just uninformed, melodramatic nonsense? Now to the ending. Surely the reason I don't like this film is because I don't understand it. Wrong. This ending is a cop out. It is not ambiguous in order to enhance the film or inspire the audience. It is ambiguous because the writer has painted himself into a corner and can't think of any other way to get out of it. The ending to Kubrick's 2001 enhances the film. This just feels tacked on. I came out of the cinema feeling that I'd seen a bit of a mixed bag. Some cracking, stylish moments, but overall a rather adolescent mess. Not one of the worst films I'd seen, but probably not one I'd be renting, either. Imagine my surprise, therefore, when I log on to the normally respectable IMDb and discover that this film has been voted the 91st greatest film ever made. I discussed this with friends and found to my distress that people I would consider intelligent put this up in their top 10 favourite films. Why?! Now, I'm not saying this film is awful; that it should be banned; that it should never have been made etc., but I really do think it's time more people came forward and cut through the dung on this one. I notice that the highest votes from this film came from males under 18. Perhaps this reflects my assertion that this is like a celluloid teenager: confused; moody; attention seeking; and annoying. Richard Kelly has produced some interesting ideas with this film. However, as a Director and especially as a Writer, he needs to mature in his work a lot more. A hell of a lot more. The hype for this film, crowning him as a great young director and the producer of a masterpiece, will, I fear, cause Kelly to stop growing and maturing, and start disappearing even further up himself. I await "Knowing" with interest, but not with much enthusiasm. Here endeth the lesson.</fullReview>

He had a vision of a horrific bunny revealing how much time he has left until the destruction of the earth. His life at school and at home is offbeat, cursing his parents and separating himself from them completely and finding guidance with his girlfriend, the new girl in town who seems to have an odd understanding of him. Things start coming unglued as his time left on earth dwindles. This is a good film, but its imperfections really stand out. Time travel has a big play in the film and it is hardly developed?this causes major confusion in the key scene of the movie.

		<fullReview>DONNIE DARKO (2001) **** Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, Mary McDonnell, Holmes Osborne, Drew Barrymore, Katharine Ross, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wyle, Maggie Gyllenhaal, James Duval, Beth Grant. Pitch black comedy/satire cum thriller by newcomer Richard Kelly about the eponymous protagonist (a compelling Gyllenhaal) as a misunderstood teenager whose brush with death unleashes a nightmarish Apocalyptic countdown and encounters of sanity gone awry with his subconscious in the form of a six-foot rabbit named Frank (!) that belies David Lynch and John Hughes all at once. Sharply skewed storyline deftly underscores hypocrisies and frailties of the human spirit/mind and some outlandish leaps of faith for viewers everywhere; stick with it, the ending is a doozy. Saturated cinematography by Steven Poster makes the surreal real. Impressive film-making debut and a one-of-a-kind film that makes you think what did it all mean. Produced by Barrymore, who co-stars as Donnie's well-meaning English Lit teacher.</fullReview>

The movie is watchable and filmed well but fails to deliver what it was really trying to - and that according to the directors own commentary. Although a 5 [1-10] on the watch-ability and production values, I gave it a 1 to correct the curve from fake reviews I am sure many of the votes and posts with glorious reviews are merely marketing plants, and that, sadly, really skews the ratings here at IMDb.

So he sets houses on fire, calls his mother a bitch, doesn't take his medication, tells teachers to "shove it up (their) @$$", and basically disrespects all authority. This sounds like every 16 year-old know-it-all punk I've ever known, including myself. Crybaby self-centered jerk.Fat kids are made fun of, parents are made out to be hypocrites, teachers are out-of-touch and/or scared to save their jobs, and in a sign of any weak script, a gun comes into play in the third act.

		<fullReview>I can't see how in the world this thing came to be so overrated. First and foremost, everything about it seems hackneyed and recycled, it has an air of cheap 80s teeny thrillers about it. The plot is plain silly - a mishmash of tacky themes including UFOs, time-warp, bogeyman, and expectedly, teen angst. Now, supposedly, some such incredibly over-the-top plots may have made for some classic B-movies in the past. But even in terms of camp or trash value, this film is too square and has too large a budget to offer any entertainment. There's nothing genuinely funny or frightening in it, despite noticeable attempts. About a half way through I ended up yawning myself senseless and reaching for "stop". Perhaps the (fortunate) neglect of the themes involved during the 90s is accountable for this film's popularity amongst its generation of teens, to whom this may seem a novelty. It is possible that the poor quality of the story and dialogue is thus overlooked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My new plasma display was longing for new material, so i went out with my gf to rent some movies for the weekend. I took this from blockbuster, a sign read: listed in IMDb's top 100. So i fed my DVD player and started watching. Utterly boring since the beginning, i chose to resist a little longer, hoping for a twist; no way. I thought that maybe i should reconsider my approach toward the new school of directors and writers, that maybe the time for 'The 6th sense', 'LOTR', and 'The Shawshank redemption' is over, yet I wonder what kind of weed they were smoking when they wrote this 'masterpiece'. Nonsense replaced boredom, then after 45 minutes my DVD player farted this pos out and i decided that cleaning my cat's litter was a much more rewarding experience; imho you should save your time and money on this garbage; I give this 2 out of 10 just because i've seen worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched this movie, mostly on the basis of the praise given on this site and I must say what a waste of 2 hours of my life.I cannot believe it was so slow, boring and with a totally pointless storyline. The only reason I watched it to the end was because I thought it must get better at some point to be given all this praise on here. But it didn't.Just my opinion...... you may love it!! But then again you may love watching grass grow or paint dry.If someone could please explain to me why this is rated so highly I would be most grateful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge disappointment for such a cult following.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I work at a video store and suddenly became aroused with this movie Donnie Darko, it seemed that everyone wanted it but we never had it in. I finally saw it and man, what a drag. I might enjoy the movie more if there had not been so much hype. The movie is interesting but feels too much like a David Lynch film. My main problem I suppose is how they present the space time continuem. I have read about this in a couple college courses and have a friend who is a physicist. This movie presents is falsely. I think I will give this another shot in a couple months, but overall....it's not worth the hype and sure isn't worth a top-100 rating on this site.</fullReview>

It is highly derivative of other movies and tv shows, including the two I mention in the summary line. And unfortunately, like a lot of other movies with a plot twist/secret, the revelations that come in the final act are rather disappointing and don't really tie up the movie like it leads you to believe it will, and in a way makes a lot of the movie non-sensical (as opposed to simply non-sequitor). 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pretentious, Nonsensical Bore!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard many good things about this movie (both the original and the director's cut) before I saw it. I didn't read any of the reviews though because they usually give too much away and I wanted to watch the movie without some expectation clouding my judgment. Well, I saw it over two nights because it was so boring and it was a huge disappointment.Many reviews point out how creative and original it is. But just because something is original and creative don't automatically make it good; and this movie surely isn't good or that original or creative. Stripped away the overused time travel sci-fi elements and all you have here is another bored, alienated, American suburban middle-class teenager movie. I wish there are movies that explore why American suburban middle-upper-class environment produces so many bored, alienated teenagers. Seems like a uniquely American phenomenon. Whenever I see movies like that, I tend to scream at the characters to pick up a sport, get a hobby, read some books, do something instead of laying around angry at everybody and being bored. I've never been able to sympathize or empathize with that mentality.The movie might work better if removed of all the sci-fi trappings and refashion itself as a teenage American Beauty. A lot of people expecting a sci-fi movie came away disappointed at the insipid sci-fi gibberish. Granted, movies about time travel never really make sense because the nature of time travel is just not logical. Many reviews also didn't understand all the elements of the movie. Neither do I. Although I don't require a movie to explain everything, this movie just thinks itself too clever by putting in too many nonsensical elements for me to accept. One reviewer interprets the movie as about schizophrenia and all the sci-fi stuff just happens in the character's head. That's as good an explanation for this mess of a movie as any.The extras on the Director's cut have a long feature on the loyal admirers of this movie. But they're all British, and in some of the interviews, they are so full of themselves because they know how to appreciate creative movies like this and they understand the movie and don't need to be told what it's about. So, the film makers are so desperate to make the movie appear to be special that they got a bunch of self-aggrandizing foreigners to say how much more intelligent they are because they "get" the movie. The documentary was also filmed in that annoying pretentious artsy style w/ part of a face and lighting from weird angle. Very much a turn off.As a drama about alienation or schizophrenia, it is intensely boring; as a sci-fi genre movie, it is neither thought provoking nor exciting, it is still intensely boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>perfect marketing strategy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the best marketing strategy of all times!! I believe that the average vote here on IMDb has been raised thanks to a planned marketing strategy (even if IMDb itself could be not aware of it)and the result is that a lot of people (like myself) bought the DVD because of the high rating (also written on the cover of the DVD). Is this movie so good? No, of course. Is mr.Gyllenhaal an actor? Are we sure? 90% of this movie is absolutely boring, I waited all the time for something interesting to happen. What about the time travel explanation? I think that the time travel related episodes in Star Trek are much more interesting and convincing. If you want to see a good sci-fi movie, there are at least 100 movies better than this (you could begin with 12 monkeys). If you want to see a movie that gives space to interpretation, see Mulholland drive (why is it rated below this? Are we crazy?).I will sell my DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is ridiculous: a mishmash of nothing that makes no sense. But alas, that is what its fans consider to be its genius. The less sense the better. Gyllenhal does a nice job with what he is given, but unfortunately it ain't much.Is it an 80s movie? Is it set in the 80s? Does it matter? Does anyone care? If so, why? I watched this with low expectations, and they were not met. The only way this film can be appreciated is if you enjoy the sight of pretentious film-making. And yes, this is "FILMmaking" -- not movie making.It's such a great premise, and yet it is wasted in the hands of a writer who does not know what good writing is and a director who could not direct a paper bag.</fullReview>

The kind of thing that, to judge by some of the other comments, makes people who don't think or read feel like intellectuals.If it weren't so boring quite a lot of it would be funny. The 'therapist' for example. God knows what kind of training she had. And the Patrick Swayze plot which leads nowhere and means nothing. To say nothing of all the other incompetent plotting that litters the plot. And the acting is so awful. And all the terrible music! And all the brain-dead 'homages' to better films and more talented film-makers (Kubrick, Spielberg, et al. So second-rate)So like he has to die so she can live.

		<fullReview>It's too bad the IMDB doesn't award votes of zero for a film. Donnie Darko would be a candidate for the goose egg.I've sat through many a bad film -- Gummo comes to mind -- or challenging films from the Goddard canon. But Donnie Darko was so awful that I nearly shut it off 30 minutes in, and I only stuck around because there was *one* funny scene that referenced the Smurfs. I'm now regretting that decision.The plot, if you can call it that, is like Harvey meets Amelie on a dimly-lit back street. Set in 1988, Donnie Darko is about a high-school kid who's being haunted by visions of an ugly bunny rabbit who visits him at weird hours of the night. The rabbit, who really looks like a guy in a bad Easter costume, saves Donnie's life one day from being crushed to death by a wayward jet engine that falls out of the sky. The bunny rabbit then convinces Donnie that the world's going to end in less than a month, which means Mr. Darko has to go out and vandalize his school or the homes of no-gooders all in the name of ... well, I'm not entire sure.Nothing makes sense in Donnie Darko. There's all sorts of allegories to the 1988 U.S. election that don't pay off. The ending is muddled and, by that time, you'll have stopped caring why nothing makes sense. Then there's these bizarre extended musical sequences set to horrible '80s music that pop up for no apparent reason other than to possibly pad the running time.But you really don't want to get me started on the dialogue and the acting. Drew Barrymore is *horrible* as an English teacher, and seems to be reading her lines off a TelePrompter. Some of the high school bullies look spaced out on drugs, and *aren't* threatening or menacing at all. And I have absolutely zero idea what Gretchen, the token romantic interest, sees in our (anti)-hero. Note to screenwriter: "He's weird" doesn't cut it.Then there's the god-awful CGI, which liberally borrows special effects last seen in *The Abyss*.There's only one good decent thing I can say about this movie, aside from the aforementioned Smurf scene: the kid who plays Donnie actually does a good job. He almost makes the whole thing watchable -- until the utterly confusing ending cancels it out. Sometimes, aping David Lynch is *not* a good thing.I don't get how so many people have been duped by this waste of time. Personally, I want my $5 in rental fees back. Zero out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had avoided watching this film for quite few years - why? I had a couple of people that liked b-rated films the way I do to tell me this is a good film - watch it! I thought "Oh no not another crappy b-rated horror film - I only like certain ones! And the name 'Darko" sounds like a worse than cheap b-rated film." Then more people told me to watch this film because I would love it. What is going on here I thought - why are so many people telling me that I would love this film? Well I finally broke down to watch the movie - I had no idea who played in it, nor did I know anything about the movie only that I would love it - so I had gone into watching the film thinking I would hate it. Well I ate my words and it didn't taste very well... the movie is Brilliant! And I do in-fact love this film! I thank everyone that told me to watch this movie! Yes Donnie Darko is a very dark, thrilling mystery film that will leave you days later pondering the film. It is well worth watching! ***********Spoiler***********Time Travel - if you could go back in time, what would you change? Donnie Darko decided to go back in time to die - to save others from their deaths and any pain that Donnie himself may have caused others. The movie shows how one person can influence the lives of others. For example: If Gretchen Ross had not have met and gone out with Donnie then she would not have died that night.*****************************This is a film you may have to watch more than once to full get a grip on everything that is going on. I highly recommend this movie but be prepared to think during and after the movie - it is one of those types of films.10/10</fullReview>

The movie is very odd and peculiar and that's what makes it so special.With Donnie's nonchalant attitude he stood up for the ones that don't speak up for themselves while throwing the ones that shouldn't be speaking at all. The way the rabbit had Donnie do every act that the boys did in The Destructors was amazing. Leading to the ultimate sacrifice as Donnie gave up his life so Gretchen would live.

		<shortDescription>Amazing movie, but go for the Director's Cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a HUGE movie guy who takes pride in unique, yet quality taste, I was almost disappointed that this movie ended up being in my top 5 of ALL TIME. Maybe even top 3. But I suppose it was a lesson in judging a movie by its following. True, though many DD fans are confused teens who listen to too much Insane Clown Posse and frequent Hot Topics, this movie is actually great. Really. I must've watched this movie over 20 times by the end of my second week with it. The story is just fantastic, the casting was excellent, and the score/soundtrack is flawless. Without bringing up all the things I have to say about this movie and muddling up the review, I WILL say that this movie, when interpreted correctly (sorry Hot Topic fans, this movie is NOT just about a kid with schizophrenia. That completely destroys the potential magnitude of this film), can lead to hours and hours of discussion. I talked for weeks about this movie, and my friend (who loaned it to me) and I had conversations that took us to very profound places...You can tell a movie is great when it changed something about your personality. Just like seeing Batman for the first time as a kid had me running around in a batman costume for over two years of my life, this movie has changed me. Which if you think about it, is the greatest thing art can do, right? I compare Donnie Darko to Casablanca, in the sense that it was a movie that is too good to have come from the conditions it was made under. By now it may not be clear why this is ranked a 7 out of 10, because I liked the movie so goddamn much. This is because I am talking about the Director's Cut only. The Director's Cut is flawless, except for one or two things I might have done differently, but these things are trivial. The theatrical version for me left a lot to be desired, and had a few bad notes in it that killed the mood for me. I know a lot of people firmly prefer the theatrical, but if you were to see the Director's Cut, you would know that it is everything the original was meant to be and so much more. Richard Kelly says it himself on most of the commentary over deleted scenes in the theatrical release. A lot of these scenes he considered (rightly so) to be very important to the film as a whole, but was forced to cut it due to the constraining time limit at Sundance (I think he had to cut 20-30 minutes in total, I can't recall now). Trust me when I say that the scenes cut REALLY enhance the experience, and I'm thinking of one in particular that made the movie for me. Also, Kelly adds a lot. Remember that the Director's Cut was made in 04, giving Kelly a lot of time to mull over what he really wanted his masterpiece to SAY. A lot of great effects are added that give it more of an art house film vibe. It truly is amazing, and though I understand the sentiments to the original (I don't like the remastered Star Wars just as much as everyone else), in the end it's a better movie. Really. But the theatrical I would rate at about a 7.But anyway, this movie's good, and if you're weary of it: it's not as weird as your goth friends say it is. It's just original. And they're kinda dumb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko is a very confusing, but entertaining movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a movie that I would highly recommend to people that want something to think about. It is a movie that showed truth, mixed in with things that are not considered possible. The every day life of a teenager is shown on one side, with realistic reactions to Donnie's decisions. For example, Donnie floods the school, with some persuasion from Frank. An appropriate reaction is shown by the city trying to find the criminal and even have Donnie as a suspect. There is also a point in the movie where an arson is caught, and the screenwriter shows how there are trade-offs for doing these terrible deeds.A ways into the movie, you might start to find that you are confused. If you haven't been paying attention to small details, you will for sure be confused. Donnie is living in a tangent universe and is out to try to find out the truth. Jake Gyllenhaal does a great job making Donnie seem likable at some points, and very bad at other points. It is tough to play the role of a schizophrenic teenager living in two universes, but he does it as well as anyone could ask.The only thing that I did not like about the movie was some of the useless scenes/language that really did nothing to move the plot forward. That is really one of the only negative things that I can say about this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's Up, Doc?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is "an edgy, psychological thriller about a suburban teen coming face-to-face with his dark destiny," according to the promotional verbiage for the film, starring Jake Gyllenhaal as "a delusional high school student visited by a demonic rabbit with eerie visions of the past and deadly predictions for the future." This description hardly scratches the surface of "Donnie Darko". While watching the film, to enjoy a quirky, satisfying thriller, you may get the impression may be watching something more meaningful. You are. Repeated viewings (recommended) will reveal completely different films. Writer/director Richard Kelly creates more than a movie monster."Donnie Darko" is an multi-layered, inspirational, and beautifully produced work. Most obviously, it is superbly written and directed. Mr. Kelly, who really pulls a rabbit out of his hat, should have received an "Academy Award", along with several members of his crew; perhaps, the film's more "independent" status was an obstacle. The cast is exceptional, from Mr. Gyllenhaal's central role, to the many supporting characterizations, right down to the smallest players. This film is full of memorable characters, arriving on the screen for a variety of reasons, and for various lengths of time, to serve a defined purpose. They're all jewels.The film is set in Middlesex, Suburbia, during 1988. Forget April, for the Darko family, October is the cruelest month. Gyllenhaal is a kid held back in high school, for burning down a house. Presently, Gyllenhaal is a disturbed sleepwalker, who is not taking his medication; perhaps, intuitively, he knows it wouldn't make any difference. Gyllenhaal lives with mother Mary McDonnell (as Rose Darko), father Holmes Osborne (as Eddie Darko), big sister Maggie Gyllenhaal (as Elizabeth Darko), and little sister Daveigh Chase (as Samantha Darko). They're all jewels.As with the entire cast, it's difficult to single out one Darko family performance. Gyllenhaal never disappoints. Secondarily, Ms. McDonnell's may be the best, due to Kelly's skillful writing. Motherly love, for a son who seems to be drifting into madness, is wondrous; the delicacy of McDonnell's performance is perfectly suited to Gyllenhaal's fragility. Even Ms. Chase, who you'd expect to be the minor Darko, is magical; she even writes about "The Last Unicorn", Ariel (before he died in the possession of Count Petofi).The characters who exist outside the Darko family are as important. Many of them are teachers. At school, Drew Barrymore (as Karen Pomeroy) covers English literature in spectacular fashion; she challenges students' critical thinking skills, and gives Gyllenhaal guidance. As one of the film's producers, Ms. Barrymore's the most valuable member of the faculty lounge. Beth Grant (as Kitty Farmer) displays a limitless ability to multitask. Noah Wyle (as Kenneth Monnitoff) lurks in the science department, and helps Gyllenhaal consider slipping into time. Moreover, he reveals the truth about Patience Cleveland (as "Grandma Death" aka Roberta Sparrow), who whispers: "Every living creature on Earth dies alone." Among the students, new girl in school Jena Malone (as Gretchen Ross) provides Gyllenhaal with love interest; and, with a dark past of her own, she's a natural. Katharine Ross (as Lilian Thurman) is a dignified and memorable hypno-therapist. Patrick Swayze (as Jim Cunningham) plays the self-help guru with a convenient focus, "Controlling Fear". Even small parts shine, like Jolene Purdy (as Cherita Chen). And, imaginary friend James Duval (as Frank) belongs in a very special class (note, he is not actually related to the addiction-signaling "Harvey").Finally, the soundtrack, including original music by Michael Andrews, has to be one of the best assembled for a motion picture. From "The Killing Moon" (by Echo and the Bunnymen) to the new "Mad World" (by Gary Jules), the mood is always finely tuned.Look up. Plane to catch. My time's out of space.********** Donnie Darko (1/19/01) Richard Kelly ~ Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, Drew Barrymore, Mary McDonnell</fullReview>

When you dream you dream your desires, your fears, your regrets and your hopes, but you often feel lonely: people lose their soul, since you're the puppeteer.When you die, even if your body is crushed by a jet engine, as your neurons die your brain slows down, just like HAL in 2001, while you start to dream for the few seconds left. Good dreams, bad dreams, strange dreams, depending upon what some people call your karma.In that dream, towards the end, things become weird, images lose their crispness, scenes get apocalyptic, until a cold feeling and the knowledge that the day has come floods your scene.</fullReview>

These kind of movies somehow get the high scores but don't make much sense.They raise a lot of questions , they seem to have some clues , but if you try to put all of the clues together you'll realize you're left in the dark.To be honest it seems like another of the Hollywood's ways to get more money...just by making something really really strange every few years. Additionally , watching the crew interviews , I got the feeling that even them , that were actually working with writer can't understand what's the movie about . The good things are acting and atmosphere . In my opinion all actors did good job with no exceptions. If the script was just a bit different , more down to earth it would be masterpiece,so it's quite a shame writer and director wanted to make such an ENIGMA....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was such a waste of time, money, air. I hated the movie from the beginning, then again I do not do drugs so maybe you needed to be wasted to "appreciate" this garbage. Went to see it with an ex-friend (yeah I don't talk to her anymore) because she taught it was a great movie. She is a coke head but normally a nice gal with alright taste but this was the turning point as I wish I could undo the time wasted watching this confusing and totally incoherent movie. I would recommend to avoid touching a DVD box with this movie. I will like to see who like this movie and get the list of the movies they liked to AVOID them as this is the worst movie I ever watched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie gave me nothing; no entertainment, no new ideas, nothing to think about. It just waisted my time.But the most disturbing fact about this movie are the fans; I just don't get them. It's adorable when they say - "you have to watch it more than once" or "you didn't get it", because I did get it and I did understand it, but the things you had to "get" and understand were so obvious and boring, they could've just given me a memo and spared me of this insult for anyone capable of thinking.Donnie Darko is a movie for teenagers who THINK that they are smart and artistic; no one understands them (bu-hu) and they are oh so special and unlike any other teen out there. No one likes me, my parents are stupid... OMG</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and Unsettling, But for Certain Tastes, Exquisite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even if you don't like "Donnie Darko" (and I'm sure there are many people who hate it, if they've ever even seen it), you're not likely to forget it quickly. This film lingers in the mind in a very unsettling way. It left me feeling creepy, and it's actually a fairly nihilistic film, but at the same time I was weirdly exhilarated by it, mostly because it's just so damn good.It's got an expert cast, including the Gyllenhaals (Jake and Maggie), both of whom are two of the best young actors currently working, Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze (yes, Patrick Swayze) and Jena Malone. All the actors are top-notch and make so much of their characters that they prevent the film from falling into too-quirky-for-its-own-good territory, a fate that befalls many "independent" films. But praise must go to the writing and directing in this regard as well. At first it may seem that events and scenes are thrown in arbitrarily just for the sake of being weird, but everything comes together logically and powerfully."Donnie Darko" is a movie for people who think too much. For those of us (and I include myself) who can never understand how, for example, religious people are so easily able to have a pat answer for everything that's complicated about the world in which we live, this movie gives us something to relate to. It doesn't provide answers, unfortunately, but there's something comforting about knowing other people out there are struggling with the same problems. Donnie almost can't live a functional life because of the anxiety caused by all of the unknowns about existence, and he sees the bland, self-help answers offered by so much of middle-class American society for what they are: shams to hide behind rather than to really help. He wants to be able to live without fear, without having to be convinced that there's a point to it all, but he can't, and watching him struggle with that is poignant and heart-breaking.This is a terrific film that deserves to be seen. I haven't seen the original version, so can't make comparison to the director's cut, but I have no complaints with it as is.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DONNIE DARKO Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound format: Dolby DigitalA lonely high school student (Jake Gyllenhaal) is beset by visions which portend either a mental breakdown or the End of the World...Richard Kelly's debut film aims for cult status at every level but fails to fly off the screen. Though a fine actor, Gyllenhaal is basically miscast, and Kelly's style is too laidback to make much of an impact. Cult favorite James Duval (a regular in Gregg Araki's outrageous movies) makes a cameo appearance as the object of Gyllenhaal's strange 'visions'. Fine use of the wide Panavision frame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoilersI just saw this film Saturday night. For the most part I enjoyed it's take on the nature of reality and God. The movie loses big points with me because of the left-wing propaganda of the character Jim Cunningham. Cunningham is portrayed as a advocate of not just his "Fear/Love" program, but of traditional values. But it turns out he's into kiddie porn. The underlying message is that anyone who holds conservative values is suspect. Hollywood constantly tries to hide it's agenda in the seeminly benign medium of film, but I always catch them red handed. If you're into pyschological horror, rent it, just beware of the propaganda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stunning Debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Kelly's stunning debut about a paranoid schizophrenic teenager who is haunted by a 6-foot evil-faced rabbit named Frank who commands him to do things and gives him horrifying glimpses of the future is not for everyone. But film buffs who like to be surprised and wowed and don't settle for pat nice little stories (and endings, and wow, this has one doozy of an ending every bit as mind blowing as say a "Mulholland Drive" or "Memento" or "Twelve Monkeys"), should be overwhelmingly delighted by this film. Richard Kelly directs with a sure hand and maverick mind. He fully creates and realizes a truly unique and thrilling universe for his characters and images to inhabit, and once he creates the rules (which might not make sense in the real world, but make perfect sense in the fantasy world he creates for us), he never breaks those rules (a true test of great entertainment/cinema/literature that portrays fantasy or dreams) and takes us on one hell of a ride. If you like to watch cult movies then behold "Donnie Darko" and you will not be disappointed (and maybe up all night thinking about it afterwards).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donny and the bunny man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is a brainy but depressed teenager. Between a familial cocoon on the verge of splitting up and a conformist high school, he's suffocating. His only real friend is a giant rabbit named Frank. The latter orders him to commit acts of violence and predicts him the end of the world in 28 days, 06 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds......And this is what grabbed my attention about the American independent movie made by a 26 year old young director, Richard Kelly. I was amazed at the general enthusiasm on this site around this flick while knowing it opened around the world with little hype (in France, it had a very quiet opening). "Donnie Darko" could occupy a prominent place among the movies which were sleepers at the time of their release but which gained the status of cult-movie. I have heard about it thanks to one of my favorite bands: Echo and the Bunnymen. Their grand song "the Killing Moon" opens a movie which in its first quarter of an hour presents a series of sequences drastically different in the content and form (from the moment when Donnie awakes in the country to the presentation of his high school to the first apparition of Frank, the rabbit). The first merit we can attribute to Kelly's flick is having gathered several cinema genres in a sole genuine story (fantastic, comedy, drama, thriller, teenage movie). This variety is equaled by the liberty of tones that characterizes the movie. Going from fantasizing to realism, swinging from fantastic to comedy as if it followed naturally, Kelly also excels in imposing climates. The more the movies goes on, the more intensity it accumulates. An intensity that Kelly controls without extreme special effects and by little touches, notably with the apparitions of the evil rabbit which pepper the work. This creature is a kind of witness of Donnie's troubled mind.As a matter of fact, the movie wavers nearly all the time between 2 poles: the exterior world and Donnie's inner psycho. We penetrate in the tormented mind of a teenager who is prey to a profound discontentment and especially rebelled against the world that surrounds him. By committing odd and alarming acts suggested by Frank, he expresses his contempt and his hate for this shameful world. So, in a way Frank is the intermediary point between Donnie's mind and his exterior contact.But these acts are for Kelly an excellent means to break the deceitful appearances and to remove masks of hateful characters. To a second degree, "Donnie Darko" is adorned with a scathing social critic whose target is especially the education system. This one is ossified, remains paralyzed in its conformist educational methods. One of its goals is turning young female pupils in pompom girls! And in one memorable sequence, the headmaster rejects Drew Barrymore's educational methods without explaining why! The critic is still more acid when the teachers welcomes nearly with open arms a persuasive preacher (an unexpected Patrick Swayze) who claims knowing how to crush fear thanks to a total master of positive energy. Ultimately, it is total idolatry or credulity for shameless charlatanism that the movie also attacks and when we learn Swayze's hidden secret, the satire is extra intense.Furthermore, Kelly also skilfully incorporated elements of teenage movie in his rich work and these elements are generally the ones which are put aside in teenage movies. The most important one is the difficulties of communication between teenagers and their parents. Donnie suffers but his parents (even his girlfriend or close relatives) are incapable of understanding him, although they seem to agree their son on certain points like the education in his school. Even his analysis sessions are of little help for him. What can he do? Perhaps contemplating the possibility of time travel...As for the cast, it alternates good and, let's say, less good surprises. The best: Jake Gyllenhaal is a real revelation, both frail and disturbing. The actress who acts his gym teacher also stands out even if she acts a grotesque character. But thanks to this, the movie is blessed with comic moments of a high quality. Then, I have always thought that Patrick Swayze had limited gifts as an actor but here, he is cast against type in a role for which he was the ideal man. However, the choice of Drew Barrymore for the young literature teacher is debatable. She's not bad at all but she was too young for the role (this is my opinion).I don't want to reveal the end but with it we could write that we've come full circle. It ends a movie which opens prospects to any possible interpretations. Not meant pejoratively, the screenplay has a good packet of holes or ambiguous points. Moreover, the logic behind the whole story is hard to perceive. The truth finds itself neither in Donnie's mind, nor in the exterior world. Maybe in every viewer's opinion. I address to the people who haven't watched "Donnie Darko": if you wish to watch it and at the end of the first projection you feel bemused, don't reject it like I did. Like "Jacob's Ladder" (1990), like "the Sixth Sense" (1999), it requires several viewings before the qualities of Kelly's work reveal themselves before our eyes. An undeniable tour-de-force in the teenage movie as well as a readable work on several levels, spanning fantastic movie, teenage movie and social satire, "Donnie Darko" should attract any movie-goer given it doesn't necessarily target a specific category of viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's meant to be ironic..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly the plot is up to conjecture--and personal taste will have to determine how successful it ultimately is--but "Donnie Darko" is an intriguing mind-puzzle, oft-times disguised as a desensitized youth movie but one with constant layers of subtext. It is sad that a youth movie today hasn't much to reward us with except depression, destruction and death, yet it's refreshing to see something so challenging, weaving its story carefully and with a stylish spell. I haven't much cared for Jake Gyllenhaal's work in most movies, but here his heavy-lidded stare is used to good effect; he doesn't go full-throttle with the performance, but he does reach in and surprise us with a range of emotions. Drew Barrymore (also a producer) is just the opposite: as one of Donnie's teachers, a free spirit-type, she allows fear to suppress her natural instincts as an actress (how's that for irony?), and nearly every reaction shot of her rings false because she's playing to the camera. The supporting performances seem dead-on, and the picture manages a fine walk between darkly comic and deranged. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Bust!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say up front...do NOT waste your time or money seeing this film. It was extremely disappointing and very non-interesting. Donnie Darko is a teenager who is struggling with mental problems. He is heavily medicated, however his mental illness is getting the best of him. So, he begins performing acts of violence and vandalism.The main character, Donnie, is then surrounded by a subplot based on time travel. The subplot makes almost no sense and totally confuses the movie. The movie ends up be very odd, extremely boring and generally incohesive. I suspect the ending of the movie is supposed to explain the other boring 2 hours, but to me it just made the film even more painful to bear. Could it be possible that Donnie Psycho can actually travel back in time and alter the past? Give me a break! And to the film makers...how about less cheesy special effects and better quality sound editing.4/10 at best. Donnie Darko was a total disappointment at almost all levels. I suspect its makers think they were being clever with this movie. If so, they are too clever for their own good, and for the good of anyone who hoped this movie had more to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Re Sparkle Motion v1.32</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I discovered Donnie by knowing that it included Daveigh. This tries to link together detail from the Donnie Darko disks, together with assorted IMDb files, in order to identify who Sparkle Motion are and other parts where they contributed to the film. This is not comprehensive, but covers the main bits. * Some background: High School Musical's Ashley Tinsdale has a non musical role in this, Dorky (Kim, brunette). Here she is actual high school age. DC soundtrack - ntsc-1:06:58_pal-1:04:14 ? ntsc-0:58:08_pal-0:55:46 in the shorter version, speaking at Jim's presentation - Hi. My stepsister, like, I sometimes worry that she eats too much. ? Joanie and Beth are on screen too. Except, who is that sitting next to Cherita in Donnie's English class? This is very early Tisdale and she is not just in one scene. The Blu-ray version helped me to notice that, but mine lacks the promos of Killing Moon and Mad World that are a highlight of the DC DVD two disk set. * From the DC version Production Notes video, filming of the main Sparkle performance was on 27th July 2000, 24 days to go. From IMDb trivia and box office, filming started on Daveigh's birthday and ended on August 31st after 28 working days. I consider Sparkle Motion as actors rather than dancers. They play a special role in the film. The choreography will be a relevant statement. Their early practice session is a lead in to us being shown The Destructors, such as Donnie asleep on the golf course as an extension of the lead in. This exercise helps the dance to dance for me. I had expected to rate Daveigh for song and dance but for me her website in 2006 gave the wrong examples and for me the competition from LiLo at the end of Life Size is too hot. And that Greene too, that Greene is a killer. * From the D C soundtrack - ntsc-1:24:00_pal-1:20:40 - ntsc-1:11:30_pal-1:08:35 in the shorter version, intro to the performance - Now the moment we've all been waiting for. It is my pleasure to introduce to you Emily Bates, Suzy Bailey, Samantha Darko, Beth Farmer and Joanie James. They are Sparkle Motion. From the cast list and biog files: Daveigh Chase plays Samantha Darko - Date of birth 24 July 1990 of Las Vegas, USA Jazzie Mahannah plays Joanie James Tiler Peck plays Beth Farmer - Date of birth 12 January 1989 of California, USA Marina Malota plays Emily Bates - Date of birth 7 February 1987 of Burbank, USA Carly Naples plays Suzy Bailey Also: Kristina Malota, sister of Marina, plays Susie Bates, sister of Emily, pics say younger sister. Beth Grant plays Kitty Farmer, mother of Beth, possible joke?, and also the teacher cum Sparkle organiser who teaches Jim's stuff. Daveigh and Marina have both acted in several films. Carly and Tiler and Jazzie have done some too. Simpler to check their IMDb listings than write them here. * Visuals: Samantha and Joanie are clearly labelled in the soundtrack so taken as read here. DC visuals ? ntsc-0:21:21_pal-0:20:33 ? ntsc-0:18:30_pal-0:17:45 in the shorter version, the outdoor practice ? screen left to right at the start is Emily Bates - Beth Farmer - Samantha Darko - Suzy Bailey - Joanie James DC soundtrack ? ntsc-0:30:17_pal-0:29:10 ? ntsc-0:26:14_pal-0:25:24 in the shorter version, at the bus stop on the day of the flood - Emilie and Susie Bates join Samantha and Joanie etc at the bus queue - Emilie Bates: Hey! Hey! I can't believe this! School's closed today because it's flooded. - Joanie James: No way! DC soundtrack - ntsc-0:31:24_pal-0:30:07 ? ntsc-0:27:01_pal-0:26:02 in the shorter version, talking about the flooding ? left to right Emilie Bates - Joanie James - Susie Bates - - Emilie Bates: Beth's mom said the boys' locker room flooded and they found faeces everywhere. - Susie Bates: What are faeces? - Emilie Bates: Baby mice. DC soundtrack - ntsc-1:23:06_pal-1:19:43 - ntsc-1:10:35_pal-1:07 in the shorter version , pep talk before the performance - 0K. Now, girls, I want you to concentrate. Failure is not an option. And, Bethany, if you feel the need to vomit up there, just swallow it. - It identifies Beth as the blonde with long cute hair tied in a pony tail. DC version Production Notes video ? 8:40, the dance introduced in a different way and a snippet shown from a different angle. These times relate to region 2 PAL versions and region 1 NTSC versions. The R2 appear to be 24fps replayed at 25fps. The region 1 are likely to be 24fps played at 23.976-ish fps. Approximately a 4% difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Think about these while you watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this movie last year and i didn't really understand it. i decided to watch it today and see if i could understand it anymore. so far i have picked up on a few things that are good to know and examine while you go throughout the movie. First thing i noticed...Jim Cunningham. A wise man once told me that writers often use characters with the initials JC in order to represent Jesus Christ and that character is the savior of the story. I just paused the movie, I'm about half way done with it so i cant further comment on how Jim Cunningham could possibly live up to this expectation. Second, the word fear comes up an awful lot. This fear is also linked back to Jim Cunningham with his tape about losing fear. Again, I'm not entirely sure what the connection is except for god and fear are related and when you relate those words there is so much to be said. Third of all, i thought i read a comment earlier about Donnie being schizophrenic and i just paused the movie after his psychologist told his parents that his visions were a common thing among paranoid schizophrenics. the parents didn't look surprised so I'm assuming that yes, he is in fact a paranoid schizo and that is why he is taking his medication.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can a film possibly be classed as good let alone great when at no point during its agonising 133minutes run time does it mention even once what the hell is going on. You cant can you? The above film is a mess of plot holes and useless information that doesn't help when trying to understand the story. This film is Donnie Darko, the film you love. At no point, no message within it and to grasp the pretentious overly thought out drivel that the 'director' calls a plot you are forced to shell out again to purchase a 'directors cut' edition where this conceited, arrogant excuse for a man will at length explain that the last 2hours of your life have been about nothing more than a teenager saving the world from the apocalypse. Thats right, Donnie Darko is End of Days except a pansy teenage angst ridden rendition. For the more adventurous among us, it might be a better course of action to simply purchase a needle full of happy juice where upon you can save the world from a disastrous plot and poor acting yourself, and lets face it: its cheaper and more fulfilling. The utterly pretentious opening scene in which Donnie is lying in the road leads us all to pray he will be struck down by an on-coming heavy goods lorry, ending the horror before it begins. And let's face it it doesn't get any better; we are disappointed when it's Donnie's girl friend that catches it beneath the wheels of a speeding justice wagon and not the sickeningly adolescent hero, who has become increasingly unworthy of our empathy throughout the film. In terms of 'cult' status; the film has gained a legion of short sighted fans that fail to see through the mist of faeces that clouds their vision from the truth; its like being beaten to death with your own legs, humiliating, painful and when its over you die (inside). The fundamental problem with Donnie Darko is its just too up itself, and there aren't enough lesbians.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Very Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To read some of the more lengthy reviews of this instantly forgettable movie, one would think "Donnie Darko" is the greatest movie never seen. Believe me, it ain't. Far from it. This DVD probably spends most of its life on the shelf at your local video store, removed sporadically for viewing by some soon-to-be-disappointed film nut, checking it out for to discover what all the hoopla isn't about. I'm not so sure the DVD always gets returned in its original condition, after all, when one expects too much and gets squat for their returns--things get busted.The blame for this dismal failure falls on writer-director, Richard Kelly, whose flawed "deus ex machina" ending completely undermines some mildly interesting stuff (time-travel, teen/parent relations, social satire) that he had going on before tanking it. Kelly's ill-conceived wrap-up renders "Donnie Darko" as nothing more than an insipid cross between "Sliding Doors" (w/Gwyneth Paltrow) and "Heathers" (w/Winona Ryder, et al.); a teen angst flick hinging upon the destiny of its protagonist. But, unlike these other two flicks, "Donnie Darko" fails dismally because in the end--because of its ending, leaving one feeling completely cheated, if not, in my case, disgusted.The fault is Kelly's alone. His principals share no blame.The story, briefly: Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie Darko, a morose, high school "weirdo." Drugs prescribed by the shrink his loving parents send him to cause him to hallucinate Frank, an alien-looking space-bunny who orders him to commit violent acts and predicts the imminent end of the world.Frank's prediction is rendered--early in the movie--on the same day a jet engine plunges into the Darko's residence, entering through the roof above Donnie's bedroom and boring a hole right on down to the first floor. When that occurs, we are misled to believe that Donnie was not in his bedroom at the time of the accident. (He is found sleeping on the fairway at a local golf course by two neighborhood men.) I mention this because this intentional deception by Kelly will either tick you off big time (as it did me) or lead you to make a self-appeasing justification allowing for such a gimmick.In either case, the jet engine accident, as framed by the aforementioned dubious ending, clearly divides this picture into two distinct parts: the part that did not happen, and the part that did happen. Unfortunately, the part that did NOT happen makes for 90% of the movie. Kelly undermines his own efforts with his choice of ending, obliterating one's concern for all that did NOT transpire. By his own devise, he turns the movie into a "what if" flick, a la "Sliding Doors." Ironically, the thought "what if" comes to mind when thinking about this movie, as in, "What if Kelly cut out the wrap-up ending and left us hanging?" At least then I'd have something to think about. As is, because Kelly chose to divide the movie into unequal parts, tossing 90% of it into the dumpster at movie's end, there's not much left to discuss. Kelly clearly shows that the jet engine did, indeed, kill Donnie Darko, and but so all that transpired after that event is, like the film, instantly forgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This got to be the WORST movie ever. I feel sorry for people that paid Blu-rays or DVD's for this movie. There is literally ton of other high quality movies. This was completely WASTE of my time. I would not recommend this to anyone, don't waste your time on this. Go out and enjoy the nature or something instead of watching this movie. It's sooo not worth a minute of your time. Giving people something so that each and every one can give their own idea, conclusion etc, is not a movie, its a task professor at college gives you. Movie with NO ending are the WORST movies EVER. And this one made the Top list #1, people are confused in voting, you vote for worst movie ever, higher score it is worst it is. Don't spend not even 5cent on this one, watch something proper from Spielberg, Cameron or Ridley...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am surprised many people have enjoyed this movie, even though it was a Superflop in the Box office worldwide. The Only good thing about this movie, as many people know is the Music. Chaiya Chaiya and Dil se re are fantastic songs by A R Rahman. Donnie Darko is extremely slow and boring with unrealistic characters that bore you. Donnie Darko is apparently in Love with Gretchen Ross, who blatantly tells him she is not interested and gives so many reasons and excuse to leave her alone. But, Donnie Darko doesn't get the message and still loves her, I guess that can be acceptable (love is strange) but Gretchen looks ugly and nothing sweet or special to Fall in love with her, but Donnie Darko still follows her. Thats, pretty much what happens in the whole film, the ending could of been better, but the ending in one word to describe SUCKS. Not emotional, nor appealing. I cant blame Donnie Darko who gives a decent performance in a dull movie, which isn't made for him.Seth Rogen is an actress who i do not appreciate, but gives a fine performance as a disturbed woman. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surrealist and very original cult gem that is not to be missed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko is one stylish movie, but unlike many stylish films; this one's greatness is certainly not at all down to superficiality. The plot and script of this movie are both superb examples of great film-making. Drama, comedy, Sci Fi, Horror and romance are all present in this movie, and the comedy in particular is especially prominent in the early stages. I was laughing out loud at some parts including Donnie's little disagreement with the local celebrity, Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze), and the meeting between Donnie's parents and Donnie's English teacher over the incident of him telling her to "shove the book up her anus", as she put it. Donnie Darko revolves around it's title character, who is portrayed brilliantly by up and coming young actor; Jake Gyllenhaal. Jake plays a disturbed teenager who is visited by a rabbit suit wearing "being" from an unknown origin, who tells him that the world will come to an end in 28 days. The film follows the classic coming of age story and shows the young man becoming understanding of the world around him. However, this is not your average tale of coming of age, far from it in fact; as this dark and surreal film stands apart from just about every other coming of age story in existence by way of it's interwoven themes of Space, time and morality.Set in 1988, newcomer Richard Kelly consciously blends a blissful eighties style with a great soundtrack of tunes from the era, and even finds time to show my favourite horror film of all time; the classic zombie flick, "The Evil Dead". Kelly's film is a strange yet compelling masterpiece, which puts him up there with surrealist David Lynch in terms of strangeness. I hope that this isn't Kelly's last offering as it would be a shame because he definitely has what it takes to make a film with not a lot of promise in its premise become a masterpiece. The cast, with the exceptions of Patrick Swayze and Drew Barrymore, is made up of relatively unknown actors, which is a surprise, as all the acting is great and all the characters are put across surprisingly well. Jake Gyllenhaal in particular is brilliant as Donnie Darko, portraying his character powerfully and believably. The rather sexy Jena Malone, another Hollywood unknown, also does very well, in the lead female role of Gretchen. Also of note in the movie is Jake's sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal, who takes the role of his on-screen sister also.Donnie Darko became an almost instant cult hit on release, and for some reason that has also gained it a rather unflattering reputation. This is unfair, as although the movie is now very much in the public domain, has been seen by everyone and isn't that little cult gem that it used to be; it has lost none of it's originality or power (and why would it?) in it's transition from small indie film to massive popular hit. The final song played on this movie is Tears for Fear cover; a lovely piece by Gary Jules entitled, of course called "Mad World". This song is a great way to end the movie as not only is it a great song, but it seems to have the power to pull the whole thing together through it's heartfelt deliverance of some very touching lyrics. Ignore the people that lambaste it's popularity; Donnie Darko is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

If we assume that Donnie knew what is going to happen and he time travels in past why he needs to sacrifice his life. And for what?? If he knew already what is going to happen he can avoid everything. Right from hanging out with his girl, watching the movie with her or taking her to the grandmothers' house.

There is some good acting, but Gyllenhall was better in Moonlight Mile, Malone was better in Contact as a young Ellie, and everyone else was so so. There is a nice style but overall why make a movie that can be seen so many different ways, that to me means its ambiguous and vague and the director lacks capacity to make a smart, quality film that actually goes somewhere and has a meaning. This movie is sub-par, wanna see a better movie that has similar style and tendencies, then watch The Butterfly Effect. 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>in the context of September 11...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Donnie Darko" is not the easiest movie to explain. The title character (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a high school student in 1988 who narrowly escapes death one night by wondering out of his house before a jet engine crashes into his room. He then has visions of an evil-looking rabbit who may or may not be there to warn him of something.That's the bare plot, but there's of course the question of the movie's overarching idea. That's very much up to interpretation. Is it about time travel? Maybe so; I can't say for certain. But other things strike me about the movie. One scene shows the debate between George Bush Sr and Michael Dukakis, in which Bush praises Panama's president. This gives an obvious sense of irony, possibly an allusion to what ends up happening in the movie.But I would really like to talk about the movie in the context of September 11, 2001, as the movie was released shortly thereafter. It's not just that "Donnie Darko" creates an eerie, mind-blowing feeling similar to the one that we got on 9/11. There is also Patrick Swayze's pop-psychologist: to me, at least, he represents the "Bible-for-everything" agenda that Bush used 9/11 to try and push.But that's just me. I don't know for certain what the movie's saying. But I do recommend it. Interestingly, around the time that it was released, the Steve Martin vehicle "Novocaine" also featured a sinister-looking rabbit. Hmmm...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing, dark, difficult and confusing but very enjoyable and worth the work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the small American of Middlesex lives Donnie, a disturbed teenager, in psychoanalysis and on a programme of medication. One night a large figure in a rabbit suit (Frank) appears to Donnie and takes him out of his home in order to tell him that in just over 28 days the world will come to an end. While out Donnie house is struck by an aeroplane engine that crushes his room and would have surely killed him. Donnie follows Frank's instruction as they grow increasingly violent as he tries to prevent the world ending and turn time back.I, like many others, came to this on the back of rave reviews but I knew that this film is a CULT movie. That means that not everyone will get it or enjoy it. I fell within the first category but not within the second. The plot is a strange mix of high school movie cliché and a weird hallucination (?) that is Donnie's world. The two sit well together and both work separately. The high school stuff finds Donnie in a boat many of us have been in ? that of a teenager disaffected and misunderstood by everything around him. On top of this alienation Donnie must cope with the darker world of Frank ? a darkness that is brought out really well and is genuinely creepy.This side of the story is the difficult bit. There are big question marks that surround what is actually going on with Frank and, even after the film has finished it remains unclear and you'll be left wondering `what the heck was that?' However it is a fantastic ride and you'll be totally sucked into the world of Donnie. It's not a classic film because of this ? too dark for many and maybe too frustrating in it's ambiguous nature for others, but it is one hell of a movie that'll amuse, chill and entertain long after you finish it.The direction is faultless. Shadowy stairwells cast beautiful shadows and blue skies and picket fences give way to dark visions and destruction. The use of music is also good ? 80's soundtracks may not be a fresh idea but here it is used sparingly and to great effect. Some is over familiar but in fairness most is well known but gains value from how it is used with the action onscreen.Gyllenhaal is a great lead and brings an immense depth to the film, his laid back approach mixed with the dark haunted looks he can draw upon add to the feelings of both menace and reality. The rest of the cast are all great and throw up a few faces I wasn't expecting ? including Mary McDonnell, Swayze, Barrymore and Noah Wyle from ER. These aren't distracting and don't take away or add to the film's value simply by their star power.Overall this is well worth a watch. You won't get it first time but you'll have fun thinking about it and running over the meaning in your mind. I'm coming to grips with the whole time travel thing but am still questioning my own answers. Please remember than this is a cult movie that is wearing a multiplex outfit (just like Frank). Many will find it confusing, challenging and just too plain weird but most will enjoy it even if the meaning is confused and difficult.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Kelly's flawed but utterly promising debut is one of the best things that could happen to post 2000 cinema. In fact, I use the word 'flawed' with caution because it isn't the most appropriate term to describe the slight imperfections featuring in Donnie Darko. It feels a little like Kelly wants to add too many ingenious elements and gimmicks and the screenplay often is a little messy. Nevertheless, it's a project that breathes its own personal atmosphere and the creativity nearly drips from the screen. What makes this film so unique and fresh is the half-apocalyptic, half depressing tone. We're welcomed in a bitter 80's setting and meet Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) who's living in a socially strict suburban town called Middlesex. Donnie is a not-so typical teenager who suffers from severe hallucinations and bizarre states of mind. It even gets worse when he has a near death experience, as he starts spotting a giant ugly bunny that tells him the world is coming to an end. What follows is a blend of almost-brilliant sequences, an outstanding 80's soundtrack and slightly too many digital effects. That's not a bad thing, though, because you especially remember the good sequences like Donnie rebelling against his superficial teachers and hilarious Smurf-speeches. Jake Gyllenhaal is great and there are sublime supporting roles for Mary McDowell, Patrick Swayze and Holmes Osborne (he's the coolest father one could have). Special mention goes out to the gorgeous Maggie Gyllenhaal in her (too small) role of Donnie's sister Elizabeth. Richard Kelly has talent. That's not an opinion, that's a fact and even those who dislike this film should reckon this. Just look at how he pans the camera over the high school playground while 'Head over Heals' by Tears for Fears is playing. That's pure class!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film about an 'axe wielding' kid and a 'demonic bunny' is not conventional stuff. But outside the box is good. However 10,000 miles outside the box, is garbage! The problem with this film is all of its 'rubbish' and 'garbage'.It begins with 'the jet engine' which you have no clue about until it finishes so that's garbage. But even when you account for that there's still all that other stuff that has lengthy explanations but no real meaning so that's all 'garbage' too.The writer/director of this 'garbage' has crafted it in such a way that one asks if it's really garbage and not in fact misunderstood 'art', obviously everyone who 'worships' this 'gobbledygook' some how understands it's every aspect because it speaks to them. But that's rubbish because even the 'creator' of this 'junk' doesn't know what he's talking about.It's clear as crystal this film is just an 'orgy' of every thought Richard Kelly ever had. That's why there's half a million half baked ideas 'scattered' and 'interwoven' in to the stories already too multifaceted "basic" premise. That thing your English teacher tells you not to do "was it all a dream?" is one of two front running conclusions this film leaves you pondering too. To make this movie even worse I actually believe the later. Because how else can you explain the fact that was his mother's flight! Unless of course you just accept it on a whim like everything else from this film.Conversely this garbage has 'extremely' funny mini stories throughout. The kiddie porn ring is hilarious! Sparkle motion is outrageous! The fear/love line discussion is interesting. The Smurf speech! Katharine Ross as Donnie's placebo prescribing physiatrist is a welcomed sight. But these are all just 'great moments. Good television commercials are great moments. It doesn't save this garbage from itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen a large amount of creative, innovative, insightful, thought-inspiring movies. Donnie Darko would be one of Harlan Ellison's favorite pet-projects for his "Glass Teat" column in the last year of the sixties. To use his words, this movie is "soul-robbing and dehumanizing. It requires that the viewer stop thinking, completely." I have never seen a movie more worthless than this. Drew Barrymore's performance is appalling. Patrick Swayze's character and performance are mind-numbing. Jake Gwyl-whatever's performance ranks up there with the dumb-a** guys in "Dumb and Dumber," "American Pie," and "Dude, Where's My Car?"Something immediately comes to mind when reading reviews for this sad excuse for a "film." Those who like the film always seem to attack the intelligence of those who don't. Comments about "not getting it" abound. This is sad. Just because someone posts an unfavorable review of a movie you like doesn't necessarily mean they are less intelligent than you. In fact, the opposite case may be true...So to state it plainly, the acting in this film is deplorable. the story starts off interesting, but deteriorates into drivel. No one can really care about Donnie or his family... they are boring. The idea of putting an overweight Asian girl as a pathetic love-interest in Donnie is the saddest attempt by a filmamker to be "politically correct" (let's make sure we cover ALL the bases-- what hasn't been tried before; but we can always fall back on "fairness" if we get slagged for it).Comparisons to "Memento"," David Lynch, "Jacob's Ladder," etc are unwarranted. This movie cannot ever aspire to the heady, thought-inspiring genius that these other achieve. Those who attack others' ability to "get it," need to ask themselves "what is there to get?" The answer is, "nothing."Rating: negative one, out of ten.</fullReview>

He has visions of a giant rabbit, Frank, the Fuzzy Bunny, who instructs him to make violent acts, like destroying the fire hydrant and piping to flood his high-school like in Graham Greene's book, which text was read in his English class, or burning to the ground the house of the hypocrite Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze). Donnie is not at home when an engine turbine falls of a plane into his bedroom without any explanation. He predicts the doomsday and is very interested in time travel through the wormhole."Donnie Darko" is one of the weirdest cult movies ever. Richard Kelly follows the same school of David Lynch, making a very intriguing movie with the usual elements of this director, such as in "The Lost Highway", using characters very bizarre and dark.

		<shortDescription>Fabulous, albeit confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to explain Donnie Darko (2001) in one sentence, I would say that it could best be described as Fight Club meets John Hughes. Thankfully, I'm not restricted to just one sentence, because there's a lot more to this movie than just a simple benign remark.As best I can manage, it is a pop culture masterpiece with a dark edge -- a brilliant insight into the minds of troubled youth. At the center of it all is actor Jake Gyllenhaal, playing the titular character, who delivers an amazing performance, so isolated and grim that it instantly brings to mind Travis Bickle in Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver or perhaps, even, a new kind of screen 'hero' ? a snapshot of teenagers across America, and considering how disturbed Donnie is, the fact that he could be a non-rarity is startling.Donnie exists in our world as a true oddball. 'You're weird,' a girl tells him. 'Sorry,' he says. 'I meant that as a compliment,' she replies.So, it's a compliment to be weird these days ? a good thing to be different. Times have changed significantly; from when being normal was what everyone wanted. I suppose time has progressed far enough now that those who aimed to be like everyone else reached their goal and realized atop their mountains that everyone else wanted to be like everyone else, too, and now they're all climbing back down. It's a paradox only Donnie Darko could welcome. It's one of many.To actually give a summary of Darko's plot might seem ridiculous, and because of this I'll merely say that it presents an all-new twist on the idea behind Harvey ? Donnie is plagued by imaginary (?) visitations by a rabbit named Frank, who talks, and tells Donnie that the end of the world will arrive in no more than 28 days.Frank saves Donnie's life, after a jet engine crashes in his bedroom. He then commands Donnie to do a variety of tasks to help prevent the end of the world, including trashing his high school and burning down the house of a self-help publisher (Patrick Swayze).These days I admire any film that is unique ? and Donnie Darko is the most original film I've seen since Terry Gilliam's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or perhaps, even, as far back to 1985's Brazil (also directed by Gilliam). What those two films had, however, was a biting satirical edge ? Donnie Darko has it, too, but it's not as blatant. It's far subtler, darker, more dangerous. The movie has its fair share of laughs but to classify it as a comedy would be wrong.The movie's cast is impressive ? Drew Barrymore (who also serves as co-producer), Swayze and other supporting roles are impressive. Swayze in particular is remarkable, having reached that point in his career ? like Tom Cruise ? where he's capable of abandoning his nice guy image and playing a darker role.I'm sure many people won't like Darko because of this reason (its darkness), but for me it was a real delight, a movie as complex as anything I've seen in years with a labyrinthine plot that brings to mind the limitless possibilities of the time paradoxes created in Back to the Future. Mere irony, then, that Robert Zemeckis's film is mentioned in Donnie Darko? Perhaps not?I still don't fully understand Donnie Darko, nor do I need to. Directed by newcomer Richard Kelly, it is one of the most intriguing films of all time ? and indeed probably one of the most unique films we'll see for quite some time. In a decade of Michael Bay, CGI, thoughtless standardized 'flicks' and boring, sappy, routine melodramas, Donnie Darko hits the right nerve ? all at once it is a comedy, drama, thriller, horror, romance, and one of a kind in each regard. A don't-miss-it sort of masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was the many opinions of people that I heard about this film, most comments being about how it confused viewers, so naturally a second time is a must, as I was one of those confused originally as well. Basically Donnie Darko (Jarhead's Jake Gyllenhaal) is a paranoid schizophrenic who takes pills to stay on the straight and narrow, but still doesn't get on with his family, mother Rose (Independence Day's Mary McDonnell), dad Eddie (Holmes Osborne) and sisters Elizabeth (Jake's real sister, Secretary's Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Samantha (Spirited Away's Daveigh Chase). One night, he gets out of bed and goes to the front garden, where he comes face to face with a six foot creepy looking rabbit (well, a guy in a rabbit costume) called Frank, who tells him the "end of the world" is in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds. Moments later a plane jet crashes into his bedroom, he is lucky to be alive, and investigations go on a little while to find where it came from. When he returns to school he has hardly any real friends and does not get on with the teachers very well, including Karen Pomeroy (Drew Barrymore), as well as emotional problems professional Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze). He meets a new friend in sympathetic new student Gretchen Ross (Jena Malone), this offers a distraction from any problems he has, but it cannot stop him seeing Frank who gives him tasks to do. Over time Frank tells Donnie to flood the school and spray paint words on the floor, and burn down the house of Cunningham, who turns out to be a paedophile, but he also gives him ideas and questions about the possibility of time travel. He tells all about this stuff and being with Gretchen, as well as the problems with family and school, to his psychological therapist Dr. Lilian Thurman (Katharine Ross). On Halloween night, the night when the world is meant to end, Donnie delivers a letter to the seemingly senile old woman Roberta Sparrow aka Grandma Death (Patience Cleveland), and he witnesses Gretchen hit by a car by the man in the rabbit suit, Elizabeth's boyfriend Frank (Independence Day's James Duval). After shooting him dead with his Dad's stolen gun, Donnie sees a tornado approaching, but he is fine about it, and it seems to take him through a time portal taking him back to the night just before he would meet Frank. The final scene sees him fall asleep, and somehow the plane jet was brought back in time as well, and of course being in his bedroom the engine falls on Donnie killing him, like it was meant to all along, and we see Gretchen alive and well as an innocent passer by after the accident. Also starring Noah Wyle as Dr. Monnitoff, Child Play 2's Beth Grant as Kitty Farmer and young Seth Rogen as Ricky Danforth. Gyllenhaal gives a haunting performance as the very troubled teenager, and the supporting cast members, including Gyllenhaal's worthy sister, and a preachy and in a way annoying character from Swayze, and of course Frank the rabbit is popular character. There may be many questions posed by people who watch, but I would go with the theory that the night Donnie returned home after sleeping on the road, he fell asleep, and everything up to the point he is killed by the plane jet is a dream, anyway, the acting is great, the special effects are cool, and the story has some good weirdness, it is a great psychological fantasy drama. It was nominated the Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize Dramatic for director Richard Kelly. It was number 9 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Very good!</fullReview>
