		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Heroes come in many shapes and forms. Steve Gleason became a cult hero when he blocked a punt for his New Orleans Saints team in their first home game after Hurricane Katrina. For this, the team erected a life-sized statue outside the Superdome. In his time since that game, he has suffered more than any person should, and he has provided hope and assistance to more unfortunate folks than just about anyone. By now, just about everyone would consider him a hero.Director Clay Tweel takes a very direct approach to telling Steve's story. He guides us through the life of the undersized Washington State linebacker who, against all odds, carved out a 9 year career in the NFL; married a remarkable woman who was his equal as a free-spirit; was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease); learned to live with the debilitating disease; established a foundation to provide assistance to others with ALS.Tweel pulls no punches in showing the progression of the devastating disease, and equally as importantly, in the toll such a disease takes on the loving caregiver after so many years. Gleason retired in 2008, and was diagnosed in 2011. Six weeks later, he and his wife Michel found out she was pregnant with their first child. Staring down the disease and the impending birth of their child, the couple took a 2 month expedition to the Alaska wilderness. This could be interpreted as their way of leaving their "old life" behind, but this couple is so full of life and spirit, that it was in fact, merely a next step.The diagnosis and the baby announcement motivated Gleason to begin filming video blogs/journals for his unborn child. His stated goal was to "share with you who I am", since the odds weren't good that father and son would ever be able to hold a conversation or play catch. Clips of these video entries are shown throughout and capture Gleason's charm, humor, sincerity and spirit of life.Son Rivers arrives in October 2011 just as the disease is creating severe challenges for Steve's physical and verbal capacities. We watch as Michel transitions from free-spirited newlywed to full-time care-giver and first time mother. Her coping methods are on display, as are the effects on her energy and outlook over the next few years.With the help of friends and family, Team Gleason is created as a foundation to provide assistance to ALS sufferers. The foundation finds its newest mission when Medicare announces that vocal/speech technology will no longer be covered for ALS. "No White Flags" becomes the calling card for the foundation, and these activities are blended with Gleason's medical and family hurdles ? including his religious father who drags him to a 'faith healer'.Moments with Eddie Vedder and Drew Brees, among others, lead us to the global phenomenon known as "the ice bucket challenge" for ALS and finally the Microsoft Super Bowl commercial featuring Gleason and new speech technology. The film and story are simultaneously gut-wrenching and inspirational, and provide a rare behind-the-scenes look at the emotional and physical impact of disease on both patient and caregiver.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very uplifting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like a good sports movie should be (Weather it's a documentary or not) Gleason is very upbeat and makes you feel bad about not getting up off your ass to do something with your life.What I like especially about the film is Steve Gleason's positive tempo. He's a fighter and you can tell. The documentary keeps tabs on the amount of time Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is taking to effect his body. For a while I did not really notice that anything was changing, it was not until others in the documentary pointed things out, that I realized the effect it was taking.http://cinemagardens.com/Keeping an uptempo as he watched from a chair his son growing up was hard on him, so there were times when he broke down and that's understandable, cause he's human, that is the reason he was making this documentary, to show his son what type of man he is, and the best part is that he broke down but didn't break. He picked himself up and kept going.Same goes for his wife. She's a strong beautiful woman, who was going through it the same as him, and it was hard for her to keep it together but she's going strong. You can't help but to tear up a little over that.It's an inspirational story about what can happen if you never give up on life, and a touching story of a father making a connection with his son.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On September 25, 2006, the New Orleans Saints returned to their home turf, the Superdome, nearly two years after Hurricane Katrina had turned it into a sad, makeshift refugee camp for thousands of displaced families. On that Monday night, New Orleanians needed a rebirth. Saints safety Steve Gleason, a small, Rudy-esque standout who played his college ball with the Washington State Cougars, gave them just that when he blocked a punt that led the Saints to their first touchdown since Katrina. Gleason had New Orleans' back. Five years later, Gleason needed the city to have his back. In 2011, Steve Gleason was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). And just six weeks after his diagnosis, he discovered his wife, Michel, was pregnant with their first child. Knowing he would be able to see his child grow up, Steve began a video blog to impart wisdom to his son. That, along with interviews with family and friends, became the inspiring and heartbreaking documentary "Gleason."What can I say? If you don't like wiping tears and snot from your face as you cry your way through half of a two-hour movie, maybe you're better off not seeing "Gleason." And this isn't the work of paid actors overdoing it for dramatic effect or composers calculating which violin at which time will tug your heartstrings most effectively. These are real people struggling to live with their scary new lives. This is a candid conversation between a father and son, or a home video in the hospital after the birth of a child. Steve Gleason isn't afraid to show you himself at his worst? struggling to control his bowels, crying on camera as he tries to record a video message his son can watch when he's old enough. "Gleason" stays on message, a message of resilience in the face of adversity. But as much as it inspires and educates, above all, "Gleason" is a portal for you to access emotions you might have bottled up. But then, when it's over, stop blubbering, wipe away those tears, and contribute some money and time to defeating ALS. Because even though the ice buckets have long since melted, the cause is still very real for many people fighting to stay alive, and for the courageous spouses and family members putting in overtime to keep their loved ones with them. "Gleason" is a call to action. Heed the call.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See the film, its worth you time to feel human.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Me and my wife went to a show here in New Orleans. Gleason has been a public figure in the city for some time. Living here during his time as player at the Saints we all knew his name. We where aware of his struggles with ALS and even his outreach. This movie takes you on a deep inside look of the life of his family with no filter and uncut realism. Love knows no bounds and as the movies connects you with the struggles of being human you might take a deep look at yourself. I came away from the theater reflecting on what i had done with my life. Feeling more then a bit of guilt for not doing more with what I have. The films very much a first person blog video, something that you could or would expect to find on Youtube. Its amazing the forethought put into capturing life before it becomes a scrip. As things unfold you become aware of the fragility of life and the greatness. I recommend seeing the film and share with friends. We all have something we can do and sacrifice to make the lives of everyone we know better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie never before hearing the name Steve Gleason (shame on me), and only knew what I read in the reviews. I figured it would be sad, but I was not at all prepared for what this documentary entailed. From the very beginning, I fell in love with both Steve and his wife Michel. Both were very likable and brutally honest and I appreciate that.This documentary was one of the most powerful pieces of work I have ever seen on film. From the very beginning, you knew it was going to be a roller coaster, but nothing prepares you for the love, determination, heartbreak, devastation and unthinkable circumstances that Steve and those around him have to endure. It was hard to watch, yet captivating at the same time. I simply can not imagine having a terminal illness such as ALS, or watching someone that I love go through what this man and his family have gone through.Yet as heartbreaking as it was to watch, I was amazed at how they managed to somehow keep their sense of humor. The movie was laugh out loud at parts and gave you a very up close and personal view of what happens to a human when their body fails them.I can not say enough about this movie. It was very powerful and will stay with me for a long time. I think it is important to show films such as this to bring education, awareness and support to such important issues. This film managed to show you the real grit of marriages, parenting, health/illnesses, family, faith, and football.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gleason" (2016 release; 110 min.) is a documentary about Steve Gleason, the former New Orleans Saint defensive back and special team player. As the movie opens, Gleason talks into the camera, explaining he want to make video blogs, "to share while I can". After that, we go back in time when we see Gleason excel at Washington State and then the Saints, retiring in 2008. We then go straight to the heart of the matter: it's January, 2011 and Steve is diagnosed with ACL, better known at Lou Gehrig's disease. Shortly thereafter, we learn that Steve's wife Michel is pregnant with the couple's first child. Couple of comments: let me state upfront that I was not familiar with Steve Gleason, and unless you are a Saints fan, I'm guessing many of you are not either. But when I saw the trailer of this movie some weeks ago, I just knew I had to come watch this. Beware: the movie is not for the faint of heart! it throws an emotional gut punch at you, as we discover what it's like to live with ACl, and to see how a once healthy man's body steadily worsens--while his mind stays sharp, creating enormous frustration at times for Gleason. The movie does not look away either when very difficult moments arrive (check out the confrontations, yes plural, between Steve and his father). But in the end the movie is also very inspirational, as we see Steve persevere, helped with unwavering support by Michel and others. Several Pearl Jam members appear in the movie, and Steve's interview of PJ front man Eddie Vedder is priceless. In another one of his video blogs, Steve says "it's not going to be easy but it's going to be awesome". And that captures the movie right there."Gleason" made quite a splash when it premiered at this year's Sundance Film Festival, and Amazon Studios promptly bought it. It recently had a one week run at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and the Wednesday early evening screening where I saw it at was sadly not attended very well. I sure hope that this movie will find a wider audience in distribution channels outside of traditional theaters. If you are in the mood for an emotional taxing but inspirational documentary about life with ACL, you cannot go wrong with this. Just make sure you have plenty of paper napkins handy... "Gleason" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary really does reaffirm life and registers in a big way. Thanks to all the Gleason friends and family for sharing this with us.I walked out of the cinema and made sure to take an extra look around at the sky itself and took a loooooong deep breath and remembered to thank God for ALL the big things in life. As anyone that has gone through anything like this with a loved one knows, there are NO small things in life. Everything is large and larger. The ability to walk, talk, think, breathe and live pain free are nothing to be taken for granted. This documentary perfectly reminds you of that and makes any other problems seem insignificant by comparison.I was moved by the depth they cared to share with us from the humbling and frustrating person hygiene issues to matters of faith. Watching Steve bare and carry this HEAVY cross and watching him and those around him suffer is certainly uncomfortable but also awe inspiring. As he stated, his soul is indeed saved and his sacrifice and true pain on every level being recorded is a testament to that salvation and his impact on others. What a terrible and sad cross to bare.Same certainly can be said for his amazing and lovely wife, Michel. She may not want to be labeled as a saint but how else to describe her strength? She's as far way from "dick-face" as it gets! ;) Their journey and strength should make us all want to be better people and live stronger lives.</fullReview>
