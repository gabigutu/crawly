		<shortDescription>Charlie Finds a Son</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE KID (First National Pictures, 1921), a comedy-drama written, directed and starring Charlie Chaplin (1889-1977), plays an important part his screen career. Aside from Chaplin cast opposite Marie Dressler in TILLIE'S PUNCTURED ROMANCE (1914), a Mack Sennett production hailed as the first feature length comedy, THE KID starts Chaplin with a whole new cycle of feature comedies, but releases coming once every two to three years. A comic genius who got his start in comedy shorts starting in 1914, eventually under the supervision and direction of himself, Chaplin's methods in movie making improved with each passing film. Like himself, Jackie Coogan, Chaplin's littlest co-star and title character, made such an impression with his initial performance, nearly upstaging his impresario, that he immediately found himself starring in movies on his own, becoming Hollywood's first important child star.THE KID starts off with inter-titles, "A picture with a smile and perhaps a tear," followed by "The woman whose sin was motherhood," titles much to the liking of a D.W. Griffith directorial tearjerker starring Lillian Gish, yet, in fact, might have seemed more logical for a Griffith film than Chaplin's, whose very name personifies comedy. A young girl (Edna Purviance) leaves a charity hospital with a baby in her arms. who turns out to be an unwed mother whose father (Carl Miller), a young artist, never returns to her life. The mother places her baby in the back of a limousine and walks away. Crooks enter the scene, stealing the car, discover the baby and place it in a trash bin in the poor district of town. Noticing the infant wrapped in a blanket, Charlie tries to pass it off to someone else, but after stumbling upon a note which reads, "Please love and care for this orphan child," he decides to raise the child himself. Five years pass. The kid (whose name is believed to be John), now Charlie's adopted son and sidekick, start off each day with brand new adventures in raising money. As for the kid's mother, she's become "a star of great prominence," devoting her spare time with charitable work handing out gifts to the children of poor districts, where lives the kid. The paths of the kid and his mother meet on numerous occasions, unaware of each other's identities. When the kid becomes seriously ill and in need of immediate medical attention, a middle-aged country doctor, having discovered Charlie not the boy's true father, sends for the authorities from the County Orphan Asylum to take the child away.THE KID consists of many ingredients to make this an everlasting product, especially for a silent movie made so long ago. Chaplin, who constructs his gags to perfection, has one difficult scene that comes off naturally, this being where Charlie cuts out diapers from a sheet for the infant as he's lying beside him in a miniature hammock crying out for his milk. The baby immediately stops after Charlie directs the nipple attached to a coffee pot (a substitute for a baby bottle) back into his mouth. Another classic moment, on a serious nature, is when Charlie is being held back by authorities, being forced to watch his crying "son" taken away from him. Charlie breaks away and goes after the truck as he's being chased by a policeman from the slanted roof-tops. The close-up where father and son tearful reunite is as touching as anything ever captured on film.Chaplin and little Jackie (billed Jack Coogan in the opening credits) display their talents as both funny characters and dramatic actors. Little Jackie is especially cute as a miniature sized Chaplin, right down to his baggy pants. Chaplin giving one of his most sensitive performances, is so convincing that it doesn't take away his screen persona as the lovable funny tramp. From this point onward, he would become less characteristic as a slapstick comedian and more agreeable as an serious actor, at the same time, adding more plot, pathos and truly great comedy routines.As much as the present showing of THE KID barely reaches the one hour mark, Chaplin includes enough gags and pathos to make it work. The dream sequence where he finds himself in Heaven surrounded by angels might appear trite and unnecessary for some, but actually makes it essential to the plot which fits into the scene that follows.THE KID, which had been unavailable for public viewing for many years, was resurrected in the 1970s in revival movie houses with a brand new and wonderful orchestral score conducted by Chaplin himself in 1971. It would be nearly another decade for many to fully get to see and appreciate this little masterpiece when distributed to video cassette in 1989 as part of the Charlie Chaplin centennial collection, double billed along with a comedy short, THE IDLE CLASS (1921). In the DVD format, the two disc set includes rare out-takes and deleted scenes. Turner Classic Movies has brought forth THE KID as part of its movie library, where it made its debut December 15, 2003, during its weekly Silent Sunday Nights, hosted by Robert Osborne, and later in March 2004 when Charlie Chaplin was selected as its "Star of the Month."For its age, THE KID holds up extremely well, thanks to the convincing performances of both Chaplin and Coogan. There's no doubt Jackie Coogan (1914-1984) became an overnight star with this one film. He was a natural. While the paths of Chaplin and Coogan would never meet again, on screen anyway, without them, there would never have been such a true classic from the silent screen era as THE KID.

		<fullReview>It is hard to find such delightful and adorable movies these days as "The Kid". It is a silent movie but so rich, winning and beautiful that you don´t nead words. Chaplin and 6-year old Coogan are possibly the most charming pair I have ever seen in my life. The film succees to be nicely light and full of joy but also overwhelmingly sad and sentimental. I always get my eyes full with tears of saddness and happiness. And I really never cry in movies. And the music...its simply Oscar-level! The movie is sympathetic, full of feeling, touchingly funny moments. It is truly a masterpiece showing how extraordinary talented person Charlie Chaplin was considering this film is respectively over 80 years old! So don´t you miss it because of it´s age, don´t miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must-See Silent Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While perhaps not as celebrated now as some of Chaplin's later features, "The Kid" is an excellent achievement and a thoroughly enjoyable film. Charlie and young Jackie Coogan make an entertaining and unforgettable pair, and there is a lot of good slapstick plus a story that moves quickly and makes you want to know what will happen. Chaplin also wrote a particularly good score for this one, and most of the time the music sets off the action very nicely.While it's a fairly simple story, this is one of Chaplin's most efficiently designed movies. Every scene either is necessary to the plot, or is very funny for its own sake, or both. Except for Chaplin and Coogan, most of the other characters (even frequent Chaplin leading lady Edna Purviance) are just there to advance the plot when needed, and the two leads are allowed to carry the show, which they both do extremely well."The Kid" is also impressive in that, while the story is a sentimental one, it strikes an ideal balance, maintaining sympathy for the characters while never overdoing it with the pathos, which Chaplin occasionally lapsed into even in some of his greatest movies. Here, the careful balance makes the few moments of real emotion all the more effective and memorable.This is one of Chaplin's very best movies by any measure. If you enjoy silent comedies, don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Most Memorable Silent Films Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, is this a memorable film! It is one of the most famous silent movies ever and justifiably so. That fact that it still entertains over 80 years after it was made is quite a testimony. It is a wonderful blend of humor and drama. Charlie Chaplin's unique humor, combined with an involving storyline and strong sentimentality make this one to remember. Chaplin's humor ranges from pure slapstick to some clever stunts.The "kid" - Jackie Coogan - is just as memorable, maybe even more so. He is unbelievably cute, especially in those old-time clothes he wore. Watching the expressions on his face, even as a baby, are fascinating and facial expressions certainly were a trademark of the silent era.So, between Chaplin and Coogan, and a very involving story that can break your heart one minute and have you laughing out loud the next, it's an amazing piece of work. This is a very fast-paced story which lasts less than an hour.The special edition two-disc DVD has a restored version of the print so the picture is very clear, actually astounding for its age. Excellent entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Kid" is a powerfully emotional and wonderfully hilarious motion picture and was a tremendous breakthrough in Charlie Chaplin's oeuvre. Chaplin hadn't filled a film so fully with pathos since "The Vagabond" (1916), and then it was in a very limited way, subject to the confines of two-reel length. Additionally, "Sunnyside" (1919) was a failure. The feature length of "The Kid" also allows Chaplin to elaborate and refine the gags, pranks and set pieces, and with the support of Jackie Coogan, it's one of his funniest comedies.The parent-child relationship has proved potential as sentimental entertainment, and, for me, not many have neared Chaplin in exploiting that formula in "The Kid". The sequence where they take the kid, for a workhouse, away from the tramp is probably the most powerful and endearing tearjerker moment in the film--or of all film. In addition to Chaplin and Coogan, Edna Purviance is also quite effective in the dramatic side of the picture. Furthermore, Chaplin and cinematographer Roland Totheroh's photography had by then improved vastly over their work at Mutual, and Chaplin was already an eccentric perfectionist, but the musical score added to the 1971 release, composed by Chaplin, taken from Tchaikovsky, gives the sentimental parts its most verve.Of the slapstick, one of my favorite scenes involves the tramp in fear of a bully. It's reminiscent of his Mutual short "Easy Street" (1917), which is made especially clear when the bully bends a lamppost with one punch. There are many other great moments of humorous pantomime and farce in this film. Yet, "The Kid" is much more than that, which makes it such a breakthrough; the slapstick fills the plot, and there is more of a developed plot here than in Chaplin's previous work. This was the beginning of the tramp as the sympathetic, pitiful hero, as well as clown, that's so recognizable and beloved to this day.Moreover, the dream sequence is an ingenious plot device; it adds dimensionally to the narrative and asserts its themes while delaying the inevitable conclusion of the outer narrative to poignant effect. It's also funny in a silly way. It's somewhat analogous to the outer reality story, although with much ambiguity. I wasn't always sure Chaplin was making any clear point, such as with the Christ image earlier in the film, but that seems unimportant; "The Kid" affects the emotions and isn't especially aimed at engaging the mind. At six reels, with more sets and a developed plot, this film was already an expansion compared to Chaplin's previous films; the dream sequence satisfyingly expands the narrative depth, thus making "The Kid" Chaplin's first complete feature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there a way to name the greatest filmmaker of all time? Probably not, to different people it's gonna be different person, so I can speak only for myself. Let me try to describe my favorite contestant for this award:This man is the true embodiment of the "American Dream": Having grown up in poverty and misery and virtually without parents (without a father and with insane mother), moving to America with basically nothing but his ability to speak English (in the era of the silent movies), this man manages to establish his own film company (United Artists) and becomes one of the creators of Hollywood. He produces, directs, writes, plays the leading role and composes the music for his movies. He is the creator of the most famous movie image on the earth-the Little Tramp. As you all probably know I am talking about sir Charles Spencer Chaplin. There are attempts, sometimes I read, to make Buster Keaton candidate for the Chaplin's throne. Well, I won't comment on that for I am not familiar with Keaton's work; I grew up with Chaplin so you could say I am being biased, however I would mention only one fact here: the only time the two meet on the screen is in a Chaplin's movie "Limelight." I think this says a lot.Why did I choose the movie "The Kid" as a podium for my tribute to the great Charlie? I have to say I like all of his movies, mistake, I love all of his movies, but this one is the true purl in his work to me. I don't think of any other movie, not only Chaplin's, that made me cry, I mean really cry, and laugh, I mean really laugh, like "The Kid." The closest I can think of now is another Chaplin's masterpiece "City Lights" but unlike the later one in the former one that is only him, the tramp, and the kid; and everything is silent. Think about it: the movie making at its purest.I don't know whether I could make my point with this review-probably not. There are not enough words to describe the respect and gratitude I feel towards Chaplin. To me he is simply the greatest filmmaker of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin understands how close slapstick is to pathos in this classic tearjerking comedy; and remember: kids love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always thought there's a great beauty and poignancy to the best slapstick comedies, even unsentimental ones like Keaton's "The General" or Laurel and Hardy's "Way Out West." The latter comedy has a scene where L&amp;H perform a soft-shoe dance; it always brings me to tears. Why? Maybe physical comedy has the same kind of effect on me as a dance performance. Both art forms are very expressive; the fact that I'm laughing doesn't dilute the emotional charge.One of many things that made Chaplin a genius was his understanding of how close slapstick is to pathos already. Why not marry the two things? That's what he did in some of his early short films, and that's what he does in this feature comedy. The Little Tramp finds an abandoned baby and raises him into boyhood. But the authorities find out and want to take little Jackie (Jackie Coogan) away. Meanwhile, the mother who abandoned him has since become a wealthy singer and doesn't know if she'll ever find out what became of him.Jackie Coogan (about five in this film), with his charming manners, his talents as a mimic and his adeptness at physical comedy, is one of the all-time great child actors. Want more evidence of Chaplin's genius? Coogan doesn't steal the film from him. This is true even though Chaplin, as producer, star and director, makes every evident attempt to spotlight the boy's talents. Coogan is even better here than he is in his own vehicles, like "My Boy" and "Oliver Twist."Chaplin's storytelling?even with the foolish sub-Dickensian plot twists, such as Jackie suddenly taking ill?deftly draws out the comedy and pathos for maximum effect. The individual scenes themselves are flawlessly constructed. The window-breaking scene, the flophouse scene, the dream sequence, the trying-to-get-rid-of-the-baby scene?they're perfect. Chaplin's celebrated pantomimic skills are examples of storytelling in themselves.Want me to criticize something? How about those thudding attempts to link the mother with Jesus? But you know, I can't even complain about that. It's too sweetly na?ve. And the movie as a whole is too good to allow us to sneer at the (very) few flaws.One important note: children love this movie. Show it to them while they're young, and you'll make Chaplin fans of them. And that's better than their becoming fans of almost anything that's being peddled to them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>rarely has there ever been such a deft mix of wonderful absurdity and (dark) sentiment as here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to call Charlie Chaplin a genius, but I'll say it once again: the man was a genius, if only at doing a certain particular kind of film. You wouldn't ever see Charlie Chaplin doing a silent horror film, or at least one like out of Germany, or even a big epic that ran Griffith lengths. His artistry was concerned with those who could just about afford the price of a ticket back in the 20s and 30s to see his films and he combined pathos that was incredible and unique in and of its spectrum of humor and compassion. Some may call films like the Kid and even City Lights sentimental, but they may miss the greater picture at work which is that any sentiment is orchestrated and (the usual kicked-around word) manipulated amid the comedic set-ups. Earned sentiment is different than faux sentimentality chucked on to the viewer, and if any case could show this distinction better it would be hard to find a better example then the Kid.As it stands even at 50 minutes, which was trimmed by Chaplin himself 50 years after its original release and including a new musical score, it's just about a perfectly told tale. It is short in either cut form but its so simple a story to tell that anything else would just likely be padding; even that 'Dreamland' sequence towards the end of the film is crucial and allows for Chaplin to let loose on a wonderful light-and-dark examination of all the major characters in the picture- now with angel wings and devil horns! What it's about, in complete basics, is that a woman leaves her baby in the backseat of a car thinking she won't be able to take care of him, and the baby winds up by chance in an alleyway the Tramp is at, and the Tramp decides to take care of him (he even names him, in one amusing aside, John). Then it cuts to 5 years later, and the two are an intrepid duo as they break and fix windows, eat lots of pancake, and the Tramp nearly gets pummeled by an "Older Brother" of a kid John gets in a fight with. Meanwhile, the mother is now a success, not knowing her child is somewhere- right in front of her nose.This may sound like a bit of story, but it's told briskly and without a missed beat in editing, and Chaplin's re-edit tightens it to a point where we're mostly with the Kid and the Tramp. Their scenes are everything that Chaplin wants them to be: playful, absurd, cute, and bittersweet to a degree. We know this can't exactly last, but the moment the poor maybe-sick Kid is taken away to the orphanage becomes one of the most tragic (and yet partially triumphant) sequences in the movies. It's in a case like this, where we as the audience tear up, more or less, as the Kid is being carted away crying his eyes out, and then inter-cut with Chaplin's daring dash across the roof-tops to save him, that we see the genius of comedy and tragedy combined and working off each other. This is assisted greatly throughout by child actor Jackie Coogan who may be one of the very best child actors in any film, silent or otherwise; that it's silent adds to the challenge and success of pure pantomime that without fault feels true: even a beat with the Kid playing with toys, an obviously "cute" bit, is great, and up for the task of playing off a quintessential clown like Chaplin.Featuring some excellent set-pieces just unto themselves (aside from Dreamland there is the fight between Chaplin and the Brother with that belly-laugh part with the repetitive brick-hit to the head, or when Tramp and the Kid stop to sleep for the night at the home and have to sneak around to try and not pay an extra coin), an absolutely beautiful musical track from Chaplin, and excellent performances from all supporting cast (including frequent Chaplin star Edna Purvivance), it's altogether an awe-inspiring feat. To see this or City Lights or Modern Times to an extent is to see ideas and character outlasting far beyond their time and place as something far more valuable to the public consciousness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A picture with laughter and a few tears, indeed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin was perhaps the most innovative auteur of the silent era and certainly the most famous. His character, the Tramp, is now a cultural icon and will forever be a symbol of poverty and travesty that was American society in the early 20th century, but something all of us can overcome.In one of his first roles with this character, he played opposite a very young Jackie Coogan, who would go on to play Uncle Fester in the cult TV series The Addams Family. Taking himself and this very talented young boy, Chaplin made a masterwork; one that he truly could call his own as he wrote, directed, starred in and composed the score for this film.Here, Chaplin feeds to one of the most basic of all human desires: to care for a child and be needed and loved by one another. The Tramp finds an abandoned baby in an alley and in order to not be caught by a policeman he takes the child in as his own. He hasn't got much but he does have love, which is more than can be said for the child's mother.Flash forward five years, and now the mother wants her son back. Circumstances arise and soon the Tramp is fighting for the right to keep his little companion. Even so, the story is thin but I believe Chaplin was going for something more deep and meaningful. This also gave him a chance to work on some different visual styles and comedic gimmicks, things not used much at the time in the movies. Using these little tricks and ideas, Chaplin creates a real persona not just for himself but also the supporting cast and involving us in the story.However, at the heart of the story are the emotions about fighting for the right to be a parent/guardian; someone the kid can look up to and sleep beside and confide in. It tugs at your heart all while making you laugh, sometimes in the same scene. This shows the work of a true genius; someone who knew what he wanted to create and the style in which he wanted to portray it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When watching this, I wanted to give the film a 7 rather than an 8, simply because I do not think it is as good as "Modern Times" or one or two others. However, taking into account that this is 1921 and the film technology is not all there, I will give it a little extra bump because it is so clean and well done, it could have been made a decade later and looked the same.Chaplin has to, of course, be given a lot of credit for producing, writing, directing and starring. Being a great comic actor is one thing, but being able to run your whole production takes a special skill. And young Jackie Coogan sells the picture. The film succeeds or fails depending on your casting of the kid, and they nailed it -- he's adorable, emotional, and seems able to handle any situation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes a feature film different to a short? It isn't just length. After all, some of Charlie Chaplin's later shorts were as long as forty-five minutes, while The Kid is barely an hour. No, when Chaplin made his graduation to full-length features, he also strove to broaden the scope, scale and above all the dignity of his work. The Kid is not just the addition of another fifteen minutes of funny business; it is truly a turning point in Chaplin's career.The Kid begins with a bit of backstory, as a few of Chaplin's shorts do, but never before has he conceived one as professional looking as this. Here we have the opening of a drama, and yet one written and staged with such simplicity that it does not overbalance the rest of the picture, and does not leave us waiting too long to get onto the comedy. Two shots and a title card tell us that the woman in this story is the mother of an illegitimate child. A couple more shots tell us that the father is now out of her life, and revealing him to be an aspiring artist gives us an idea of why she may have been attracted to him, and why perhaps their relationship was passionate yet brief. Of course, such seriousness was the sort of thing to be lampooned in a Chaplin short, but here that wouldn't be appropriate. Instead we are eased gradually into the comedy world, but having the pair of hoodlums who steal the car slightly buffoonish characters ? they are by no means laugh-out-loud funny, but they certainly don't belong in a straight dramatic setting. And throughout while the drama remains very genuine Chaplin takes care never to allow any environment to become too serious, for example having Henry Bergman turn up as a flamboyant impresario in the dressing room scene.And never before has the effort gone into directing actors been so evident in a Chaplin picture. The performances in The Kid are full of subtle gesture and timing in ensemble pieces. Edna Purviance demonstrates a good sense of dramatic realism, with a little too much melodramatic exaggeration, but still very natural by the standards of the time. And of course, little Jackie Coogan is astoundingly impressive, his movements, expressions and timings all spot-on, so much so that it almost looks impossible for a child to be acting with such apparent awareness, and he appears more like a human cartoon character. Coogan steals the picture with ease, and for once the normally egotistical Chaplin steps graciously aside.This too is an important difference with The Kid. Chaplin had always resisted anything verging on a double act, famously severing his partnership with the funny-in-his-own-right Ben Turpin back in 1915. Now however he allows his rapport with Coogan to become the main basis for gags. Notice how there are very few protracted comedy sequences in The Kid that feature Chaplin on his own. The few examples, such as the routine with the policeman's wife and the window ledge, are often hilarious and Chaplin could easily have filled the picture with such material. However, he does the bulk of the comedy in duet with Coogan, in material which is perhaps not quite as funny but also has that endearing touch to it, and Chaplin willingly sacrifices his own time in the limelight to bring this out.Today The Kid can be looked upon as the ancestor of the successful feature-length spin-off. If you look at something like the 80-minute Christmas special of The Office, it similarly broadened out the scope of the TV series by adding some serious dramatic and emotional elements, and has become recognised as a masterpiece ? better than the series. By comparison The Simpsons will always be best remembered as a TV show because The Simpsons Movie just felt like an extra long episode. Chaplin's full length features however were far more than just spin-offs, and have always been revered and regarded as the most important body of his work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Kid became a critically hailed international hit. A tramp (Charles Chaplin) brings up an abandoned baby (Jackie Coogan), and later loses him to his mother (Edna Purviance); but there is a happy ending.The film is a sentimental silent comedy set in the slums. The comedy is sparingly laid on, but the overall effect is much less painful than the synopsis would suggest. The production is comparatively smooth, young Coogan is sensational, and the film contains much of the quintessential Chaplin. Chaplin had difficulties getting The Kid produced. His inspiration, it is suggested was the death of his own first son, Norman Spencer Chaplin a few days after birth in 1919.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The simple, lovely story of an abandoned kid and found and raised by the little tramp is executed by Chaplin with an incredible sensitive touch. I'd say that it is as much funny as sad, and the music score couldn't be more accurate.Perhaps the most delightful surprise was to "In the dreamland" scene. So full of symbolism and lyrically narrated, the scene made me question myself if, at the moment, I was watching Bu?uel and not Chaplin. It is not my Chaplin's favorite, but it's for sure one of his bests. Totally recommend to be watched. Chaplin will never disappoint you, that's for sure. If you watch this one, also with "City Lights" and "Modern Times", you'll be ready to enjoy his talkies: "The Great Dictator", a classic, and the perfect, touching till tears, "Limelight".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pathos And Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due to an unwed mother abandoning her child in an automobile and said automobile being subsequently hijacked, The Little Tramp winds up with the baby and proceeds to raise it in its first five years.In reading Charlie Chaplin's memoirs I learned two things about the making of The Kid. First he had to get child star Jackie Coogan away from Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle under whom the lad was contracted. Chaplin saw him and was determined to make a film with him. The second thing was Chaplin's determination to make a film that combined both pathos and comedy which many said could not be done.The success of The Kid is due to the chemistry established between Chaplin and Coogan. As Chaplin said in his memoirs young children in their uninhibited way are natural actors. Part of the chemistry though is to make sure they don't totally steal the film from you.The Tramp gets his innings in with The Kid. He's the same rapscallion Tramp we all know, but The Kid showed another side of The Tramp, one of deep feeling and protectiveness. Two people who need and love each other very much. This film couldn't miss.First National Pictures sure thought so as it became part of a three way tug of war between Chaplin, the studio, and his estranged wife Mildred Harris. The Robert Downey, Jr. biographical film Chaplin illustrates that whole bit of business where Charlie smuggled out the negative of The Kid and took it on the lam across state lines. He edited it and was able to get it back to First National as a finished product on his own terms. That whole business probably would make a good movie unto itself.Till that one is made see and enjoy the Tramp and the future Uncle Fester in The Kid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A picture with a smile-and perhaps, a tear." You were too modest, Sir Chaplin ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Kid" was released in 1921, at the pinnacle of the Silent era, when emotions came to screen through looks and body language, when "we didn't need dialog, we had faces". And if there's one film where Charlie Chaplin's face oddly illuminates the screen, it's definitely "The Kid". Sure, many fans would argue that "City Lights" is Chaplin's masterpiece but something is too perfect, too masterfully directed, it was made during the talking era, Chaplin was in his 40's and had more experience, while "The Kid" features a more youthful director, It belongs to a whole other era, and has the historical feel of a Mark Twain or Charles Dickens novel, which is not surprising when you consider that the movie is chronologically closer to these classics ? Indeed, in 1921, Chaplin was 32, Hitchcock 22, Brando wasn't even born, discovering "The Kid" is like turning the pages of a dusty yellow-paged historical book, one eye is watching the film, while the other discovers a period. And I don't know if I'm the only one, but there's something in the setting, the location that makes the film look even older. For all I saw, the movie could have been set in the early century, and considering the timing of the film, maybe this feeling has been deliberately accentuated by Chaplin, himself. The film was made in a difficult personal time, when he'd just lost his son after his birth. There was a great wound in Chaplin's heart and a movie evoking childhood was the best way to exorcise his inner demons, and his discovery of a very young gifted child named Jackie Coogan the perfect encouragement.The context of "The Kid" is crucial to analyze and comprehend the personal motives of Chaplin beneath the simple desire to make a movie. Chaplin was a successful comedian at that time, which is even more impressive considering his seven-year experience, a short time but enough to create an icon, the Little Tramp, an immediately recognizable character that put a face in a rather young art named Cinema. Chaplin's story is also the perfect illustration of the American Dream and I'm sure that he felt privileged for having gone from a difficult childhood in a poor London district to Hollywood fame ... and maybe somewhere deeply in his heart, he felt obliged to let this part of himself having an occasion to shine, maybe he knew he was the only one who could direct himself in a more serious tone, and maybe the weight of the past was the little flame that ignited his desire to be a film-maker."The Emigrant" in 1917 was like the first step back into Chaplin's past, inspired by his own experience. The movie doesn't feature many emotional moments probably because the emigration carries a sort of hope for a better future, and leaving the motherland wasn't synonym of sadness, but the emotions were there, beyond the slapstick and the comedy, and waiting for another step back, to finally explode in an emotional firework, which directly transports us to Chaplin's past. He who grew up without a father, and started working at an early age, he who learned entertainment for survival more than for a living, before it cemented his talent, he needed to dedicate a film to what made Chaplin Chaplin. And this is how "The Kid" was made, and for the first time, Chaplin would become more than a simple clown, and get all the respect he needed from his peers, as a gifted film-maker. He could finally make his first masterpiece "The Gold Rush", but "The Kid" was this necessary last breath before taking the big dive.Many aspects of "The Kid" highlight Chaplin's past, and the level of pathos depicted in the introduction will disconcert many fans who expected good laughs : a woman abandons a child, expecting him to be adopted by a rich family, until funny yet hazardous circumstances put the child into the Tramp's arms. But what strikes the most is the level of maturity from Chaplin who, despite the archetypal situations, didn't make the gesture as spontaneous as it could have been, the mother of the illegitimate son is obviously devoured by guilt, as is the father, a nice-looking fellow, and a sign that Chaplin doesn't hold any grief against his father. These things happen, and we shouldn't feel sorry, as it contributed to the creation of one of the greatest early cinematic duos : the Tramp and the Kid.In every aspect, the Kid is Chaplin's alter ego : he's smart, tender, funny, sensitive? and more than anything extremely convincing. We've seen so many child performances since 1921 to get a definitive opinion on what a great one is, and Jackie Coogan is one of the best, if not the best, almost stealing the show from the King of Comedy, and that the kid didn't become as much a star as Chaplin, is one of cinema's cruelest ironies. The chemistry between the two characters is genuinely authentic, and it takes its highlight at one irresistible emotional scene. I surrendered to tears when I saw the poor little kid crying, while the movie showed one of the rarest and most intense close-ups on Chaplin's face : his devastated look and his eyes suggesting an icy blueness as to incarnate the cold cruelty of a world that would allow the worst to happen, and whatever inhabits the Tramp's heart is communicated through an emotional score composed by Chaplin himself.Chaplin, like Disney for animation, handled drama with the same strength as for comedy, the necessary tears for a movie mostly made of joy, fun, cheers, and even some dreamy escapism allowing a self-reflexive approach of the magic of childhood. "The Kid" is not perfect, but it's a masterpiece of sincerity, of humanity that only Chaplin could have made and embodied through a magnificent music. If not his best, it's his most defining film ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin's first full length feature film, and his biggest success up to that date, is a remarkably heartwarming story , which makes the surprising connection between slapstick comedy and dramatic tragedy. It begins with a woman who's "sin was motherhood," who gives birth to a baby she can't support at a Charity Hospital which is kept pad-locked from the inside. She is forced to abandon it in an alley, and before long Chaplin wanders by and what follows is one of the best sequences of the film, as he is casually strolling by and then, through a series of odd but entirely believable situations, he is unable to get rid of it. It is no secret that little Jackie Coogan nearly stole the show from Chaplin (who was in top form) playing the little boy at 5 years old. Charlie's life is thrown into turmoil by the unexpected arrival of the baby, but eventually he sort of organizes his life and when the kid gets a little older they make a nice living together, the boy breaking windows and Charlie selling replacements. Soon the police notice so they have to cut and run, because there are other conflicts approaching which will warrant screen time much more than how they make money. It is interesting to watch the film oscillate back and forth from Chaplin's traditional slapstick comedy and a much more developed, dramatic story. The film is interspersed with pure slapstick and some genuinely moving moments (sometimes simultaneously, if you can believe that), but overall it is a truly heartwarming tale of friendship and family and survival, and it is never once predictable, all the way until the last frame.There is a quick scene where the kid gets into a fist fight with another little boy, and in between "rounds, " Charlie is rubbing the kid down and congratulating him on fighting so well, and giving him hints for the rest of the fight. Meanwhile, the other kid's brother shows up, a massive oaf of a man who looks more like Frankenstein's monster than anything else. What follows is a pretty funny fight that looks startlingly similar to the fight between Charlie and the town bully in Easy Street. This is a slapstick set-up that is so simple that it could have been thrown in just to take up screen time, were it not for it's direct relevance to the story.At another point, there is pure slapstick taking place in their little shack of a home, as the 1921 version of Child Protective Services shows up to tear the young boy crying from Jackie's arms. I think this is the only time in any film that I've ever seen genuine, low-brow slapstick so seamlessly combined with a truly sad and heartbreaking incident. This combination, not just here but throughout the film, is The Kid's biggest achievement. There is a dream sequence near the end of the film that I am really not sure what to think about, although my understanding is that volumes have been written about it's symbolic meaning, both within the movie and in reference to Chaplin's personal life. And speaking of which, supposedly there were some legal issues involving money and divorce for which Chaplin sped the film stock to Utah for editing. I don't know which story to believe, that it was because of Chaplin's painful divorce or because he was unhappy with his salary (I would bet it's a little of both), but the film is here and I guess ultimately that's all that matters. In the five or six times that I've seen The Kid, I am always a little uncomfortable with that kiss that Charlie gives the kid when he finally rescues him from the back of that truck, if only because I am conscious that he is not the tramp's real son, either on screen or off. Then again, I am looking at it with 21st century eyes. Some of Shirley Temple's early films are also a little disturbing to me, although for not quite the same reasons. By this time, Chaplin was fully on the road to his career in full length feature films, and after 36 short comedies for Mack Sennett at Keystone Studios and a dozen or so more for Essanay and Vagabond (along with a few assorted others), Charlie was fast on the way to establishing himself as one of the greatest stars in the history of the cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is such a incredible movie...Along with "City Lights" and "The Gold Rush" this has to be one of the best movies starring Charles Chaplin, and it is also one of the best movies ever made.It is true that for the modern viewers, the story of this film could be way too melodramatic and dated, but personally I think it is one of the most heartwarming and captivating films ever made, and a timeless classic from the age where movies were made with heart and not only thinking only in the box-office.That doesn't mean this movie isn't entertaining: In fact, I found this movie to be way more enjoyable than many modern unfunny "comedies" and also way more emotional and engaging.I truly loved this film. It is one of the best movies of the story of cinema and shouldn't be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sheer Masterpiece of Motion Pictures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening title to this film reads "A film with a smile - and perhaps, a tear." Truer words about a motion picture have never been spoken, for Charlie Chaplin's "The Kid" has a plethora of smiles from start to finish, and yes, a few tears as well. The film tells the tale of a woman who abandons her infant son, who is eventually stumbled upon by the famous Little Tramp character, played by Chaplin. The Tramp takes the baby into his own care. Five years go by, and the Tramp and the Kid, portrayed by a young Jackie Coogan, are getting along just fine. However, a turn of events results in the two being separated, and from there the film moves on as the Tramp desperately tries to be reunited with the boy he has grown to consider his son.Charlie Chaplin is a true master of filmmaking, and this film is one of his best. His direction is truly remarkable, being able to manipulate the audience's emotions so much without sound. He is able to do more with silence than any living filmmaker could do with an insurmountable budget. He manages to make you laugh almost non-stop from start to finish, and even wind up causing you to shed a tear. It's so emotionally gripping, and you just fall in love with these characters from the get-go. Even though the Tramp may not have the best living conditions or resources to properly care for the Kid, his love and loyalty to his job of caring for the boy makes their relationship a truly beautiful piece of cinema.As emotionally wrenching this film is, it's simply hilarious. This film has some great slapstick humor, and Chaplin is a true master of it. Jackie Coogan is also great. If I had to find one flaw with the film, it would be the slightly odd and silly dream sequence, but it is symbolic of the rest of the film and I don't really mind it, despite being odd and out of tone with the rest of the film. Overall, The Kid is a film that can make you laugh out loud one minute, then tug at your heartstrings the next. It's an absolute riot, but one of the most emotionally satisfying pieces of cinema I've ever seen. And to think that Chaplin did all this without a line of dialogue, it's just incredible. And not to mention the music is just stellar too, Chaplin is a master at composition. The Kid is one of my favorite films, and anyone who has yet to see it should definitely get on that!</fullReview>

I had heard that this was the best movie Charlie Chaplin made but I disagree with that statement completely. No doubt it's a fantastic movie with a very strong story and message but it's definitely not his best. I found the last scene of the movie a little contrite and compromising.

		<fullReview>I was hardly a Chaplin fan, in fact, I loved Laurel &amp; Hardy, and really didn't like Charlie Chaplin, until I found that I could impersonate him as a look-a-like. Then, while viewing his films for the need of impersonating, I have become a big Charlie Chaplin fan. His comedy mingled with pasos and pantomime was unique, and very funny; and this one is certainly one of his best.In it a six-year old Jackie Coogan makes his screen debut as a little orphan that the tramp picks up and cares for five years. Every moment of this film is terrific, it moves along swiftly, and made me shed a tear three or few times. Chaplin's score is undeniably a great piece of artwork, and the acting is superb; nobody in this film lacks-especially Chaplin.I recommend this film for all to see. It's age has not diminished this little love tale for a family, in fact, it makes you realize family love even more. You'll laugh, cry, and have a great time out. Rent it. Buy it. View it. It's a film for all to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A picture with a smile and perhaps, a tear.That is the first line of the movie as it begins, and it stands true. We cry when the kid is being taken away from his father and we smile when they unite and share the feeling. Wow, I can't say ho much this meant to me as a father and son story. Now, we have got so many movie where a child is taken away and united finally, recent great movie is Finding Nemo. But what's special about this movie is simplicty, honesty and a rare kind of emotion that only Chaplin could bring into us.Done by the genius Chaplin, there is not a moment where we are left without a feeling, we either smile or bring tears. So to say there is never a dull moment would still be an understatement. Look for that dream scene and most of the things that we wish to do, are done there. Winning over a fight from a neighbour, meeting angels and all. Now, look at the editing in this less than an hour film, its neat and precise. The cinematography tells us the story superbly by moving camera at right pace. The music supplements at most places and yes it is great music in the context of the film. Acting is sublime by Chaplin, only few can do what he did and even today, hardly anyone can match him. It's a great movie undoubtedly and a must watch, atlas watch it before you die, you may learn something you never wanted to miss. It's 5/5 for one of the finest silent movies ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Note: For this review, I watched the original 1921 version of The Kid (as opposed to the 1971 cut, which includes a musical score composed by Charlie Chaplin).Silent films have always fascinated and impressed me for as long as I can remember. Modern cinema has the advantage of words and improved cinematography, effects, etc., that makes it easier and easier to draw the audience into the world that the director envisions. In the case of Charlie Chaplin's The Kid, it has no audible words or flashy effects. It doesn't even have music. For 68 minutes, the film does not make a single sound. And yet, it's ultimately more engaging and entertaining than the majority of films released today. It is a testament to the acting, the directing, and even the cinematography; all doing their part to create an experience that is both wonderfully comedic, and surprisingly emotional. A triumphant achievement.A young woman decides to abandon her baby boy, and leaving him only with a note that simply requests that the person who finds the boy will care and love him. He is discovered by The Tramp (Charlie Chaplin), and after some deliberation, he decides to take the baby in, and names him John. Meanwhile, the woman at the beginning has grown very famous, but she is still reminded of her little boy, whom she misses terribly.The story is very simple, but in this case, less is more. While these plot points and story ideas have been done to death nowadays, The Kid remains an engaging experience. It's remarkable how fresh the film feels, despite its now clichéd story concept. The Kid is truly a timeless picture.As previously mentioned, there is no music in this film (or sound of any kind). A film's musical score is often responsible for setting the tone or mood of the scene. And so, without the advanced cinematography and effects we have today, The Kid should be emotionless in theory. And yet, it is quite the opposite. You will laugh. And you will cry. While the cinematography (while simplistic) and directing are supporting factors in this, the real reason why The Kid manages to succeed emotionally and comically, is due to the acting. There a number of fine performances here. The obvious one is Charlie Chaplin himself as the The Tramp. His comic scenes are nothing short of hilarious, and even his more subtle comedic ideas are chuckle-worthy. And yet, his evident care and love for the child he adopts is very sweet, and gives the character (and performance) layers. The child he adopts, John, is portrayed by Jackie Coogan. Coogan was only 6 years old when he performed in this film, and yet, his performance is nothing less than perfect. Like Chaplin, his comedic bits are very good, but it's really his emotional pieces that sell the performance. His performance would have been noteworthy no matter how old he was, but the fact that he was only 6 is unbelievable. A miracle, even.The Kid is an utter delight from start to finish. Very funny, very poignant, and boasting some fine performances, The Kid is a winner through and through. It gives you the laughs, the tears, and the craft to provide a very satisfying 68 minutes. Absolutely timeless, and an absolute must-see for anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching tale that is still effective today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Kid is one of Chaplin's first major films. It combines elements of comedy and drama to tell a story that, even by todays standards, is highly engrossing. Charlie Chaplin plays the Tramp, a poor but sophisticated man. When he discovers a baby on the ground in the alley, he initially tries to get rid of it in a series of humorous attempts. Finally he finds a note inside its blanket, and decides to take care of it.The key factor that makes The Kid so compelling is the acting. Charlie Chaplin does his usual flawless performance, while Jackie Coogan makes a believable portrayal of the kid. If I did my math right, Coogan was only 6 years old during filming, which is phenomenal. The chemistry between the two characters is priceless. You grow to care about what happens to them, which is one of the things that makes the later parts of the film so interesting.The story uses elements of comedy and drama, and succeeds in both categories. The comedy aspects are still very effective today. Any of the fight scenes are exciting and well- planned. The dreamland sequence towards the end is pure genius. The drama aspects are also still fresh. Its probably the most emotionally touching film of its time. One of the few gripes I have is that there wasn't anything that made you want the mother to get her child back. There are obvious attempts to do this during the scenes where she breaks down thinking about the baby, but more could have been done.The Kid is very accessible even to today's audience. The mix of comedy and drama presents something that practically anyone would like. Chaplin and Coogan give charismatic performances that will make you leave with a smile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A beautiful film, 'The Kid' features touching performances from both Chaplin and little Jackie Coogan, as the abandoned child who the Little Tramp adopts and brings up as his own.Chaplin's first feature-length is perhaps a little light on the gags we are accustomed to, yet it fills any void with a fine sense of cinema craftsmanship and storytelling. Chaplin was more than just a master of pratfalls- he was an amazingly skilled director with a keen awareness of broader social areas. This is apparent in his sympathetic treatment of Edna Purviance's character, the unmarried single mother of Coogan who is forced to abandon the child as she does not possess the adequate financial resources to raise him with. Purviance, Chaplin's regular leading lady in his numerous comedy shorts, provides a warm and engaging performance as the woman, now wealthy, who regrets having given up her child.Coogan is absolutely amazing and lights up every scene, almost stealing the picture from Chaplin. Chaplin appears not to be too overly concerned with this, as he looks to be in complete appreciative awe of his young co-star's precocious abilities throughout.This is an incredibly moving Chaplin film with one of the Tramp's most emotive performances. Chaplin also provides a beautiful moment for early silent cinema in his creation of the dream sequence near the mind of the picture. It is beautiful, daring scene that must have taken quite a bit of time and skill to set up. Keep an eye out for Lita Grey (Chaplin's future girl-wife)as the tempting Flirtatious Angel in these scenes. Lita Grey apparently was the inspiration for the seductive Lolita in Nabokov's famous novel. I also appreciated the heart-shaped camera dissolves that are employed a few times. Also memorable are the 'boxing' scenes between Coogan and another young boy. That said, all of Chaplin's scenes with Cooper are infinitely memorable.A rewarding silent-film experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tramp goes feature-length</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charles Chaplin was born on April 16, 1889, in East Street, Walworth, London. Though his parents, both music hall entertainers, separated before his third birthday, they also raised him into the entertainment business. His first appearance on film was in 'Making a Living (1914),' a one-reel comedy released on February 2, 1914. It didn't take long for Chaplin to find his niche in the film-making industry, and his character of the Tramp ? who first appeared in 'Kid Auto Races at Venice (1914)' ? guaranteed his popularity and longevity in the industry. After a string of successful short films, among the most accomplished of which are 'Shoulder Arms (1918)' and 'A Dog's Life (1918),' Chaplin commenced production on his first feature-length outing with the Tramp. 'The Kid (1921)' proved an instant success, becoming the second highest-grossing film of 1921 {behind Rex Ingram's 'The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921)'} and ensuring another fifteen years of comedies featuring Chaplin's most enduring character.'The Kid' opens in somewhat sombre circumstances, as a struggling entertainer (Chaplin regular Edna Purviance) emerges from the hospital clasping her unwanted child. Unable, or perhaps unwilling, to care for the infant, she regretfully abandons the baby in an automobile, which is promptly hijacked by unscrupulous criminals. The car thieves discard the orphan in a garbage-strewn alleyway, at which point our humble vagrant hero comes tramping down the street. Upon his discovery of the little bundle-of-joy, Chaplin demonstrates the most practical response, and glances inquiringly upwards, both at the apartment windows through which residents like to toss their leftovers, and at the Heavens, who conceivably might have dropped a newborn from the sky. After several awkward attempts to unload the baby on somebody else, Chaplin lovingly decides to raise the kid himself, crudely fashioning the necessities of child-raising (a milk bottle, a toilet seat) from his own modest possessions. Five years on, the Kid (Jackie Coogan) has blossomed into a devoted and energetic sidekick, a partner-in-crime if you will, and it is then that Chaplin's fatherhood is placed in jeopardy.The Tramp's young co-star was the son of an actor, and Chaplin first discovered him during a vaudeville performance, when the four-year-old entertained audiences with the "shimmy," a popular dance at the time. Chaplin was delighted with Coogan's natural talent for mimicry, and his ability to precisely impersonate the Tramp's unique expressions and mannerisms ? becoming, in effect, a childhood version of Chaplin ? was crucial to the film's success. The domestic bond exhibited by the pair is faultless in every regard, and, adding to the poignancy of their relationship, Chaplin began work on the production just days after the death of his own three-day-old newborn son, Norman Spencer Chaplin (during his short-lived marriage to child actor Mildred Harris). The mutual compassion and understanding underlying the central father-son relationship remains very touching nearly ninety years later, particularly when the pair employ their combined talents to promote the continued prolificacy of the Tramp's window-repair business. However, even during proceedings as ordinary as a pancake breakfast, that the two share a genuine affection for one another is beyond question.According to Chaplin's autobiography, actor Jack Coogan, Sr (who plays several minor roles throughout the film, including the troublesome Devil in the dream sequence) told his young son that, if he couldn't cry convincingly, he'd be sent to a workhouse for real. We can never know for certain if this was the case, but what we do know is that, during the separation sequence, young Coogan delivers one of the most heart-wrenching child performances ever committed to the screen, his hands stretched outwards in a grief-stricken plea for mercy. His performance is intercut with Chaplin grappling frantically with the authorities, his widened eyes staring directly at the camera, as though actively pleading for the audience's sympathy and assistance; it's one of the director's all-time most unforgettable moments, and first decisive instance that Chaplin was able to so seamlessly blend humour and pathos. In the 1970s, Chaplin ? ever the perfectionist ? re-released the film with a newly-composed score, and deleted three additional sequences involving Purviance as the orphan's mother, which might explain why the kid's father (Carl Miller) apparently serves no use to the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I don't consider The Kid Charlie Chaplin's best, along with Limelight it is his most charming and most touching film. The Kid is a wonderful film and a near-masterpiece in my opinion. If anything though I feel it could have been longer by about 5 or so minutes, but it is my only minor complaint of this film.The story is quite a sentimental one, but it is also very touching and very involving. I love the comedy which was very unique and I think holds up well, it still makes me laugh and smile. The Kid also has a lot of sentimentality and it is very strong. But it is incredibly touching too, any scene with Chaplin and Jackie Coogan makes me cry as the final scene gets to me every time. The film also moves quickly, and has many effective scenes particularly the brilliantly done dream sequence. The performances are astonishing too, Chaplin is excellent and conveys a perfect balance of sympathy and humour, but Jackie Coogan almost upstages him in one of the most adorable and heart-wrenching child performances on film. The Kid is lovely to look at too, and has a charming score.Overall, while not Charlie Chaplin's best, it is a beautiful film. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

You can tell that this film meant a lot to Chaplin emotionally. And Coogan is just as cute as can be, even when he's throwing rocks at windows with his tiny arms. Another thing I noticed was that the title cards in this film were much simpler and to-the-point, unlike the cards in Griffith's films, which were always very poetic and biblical-sounding, even in Broken Blossoms, where things were as far from epic as they could be. I must also say that the DVD restoration on this film is astonishing. It literally looks brand new, like it was shot yesterday.DOUG: In 1921, silent filmmaker extraordinaire Charles Chaplin (Charlie to his fans) released his first full-length motion picture (what passed for full length in those days at 6 reels and 50 minutes), The Kid. Let me first say that the DVD restoration for this film is excellent. It looks like it was shot yesterday. You can make out every window on the buildings, every leaf on the trees. I imagine this has something to do with the fact that the film was re-edited and re-released in 1971. I do kind of wish we had checked out some of Chaplin's earlier short work leading up to this, but we still have plenty more of the Tramp to go. This film was wonderful. Jackie Coogan is simply adorable as the title character, a perfect sidekick for the Tramp. Of course the big moment in the movie is when the workers come to take the kid away to a workhouse, and the Tramp ferociously fights back and reclaims him before they can cart him away. This is an intense moment in a very light and comedic film, no doubt with roots to Chaplin's own childhood. In Intolerance we also saw workers taking a child away against a parent's will, so I wonder if this was an issue in the 10's and 20's, this thing of taking young children away from parents who were deemed "unfit," to give them a "better home." We're rooting for the parents all the time; "All I know is that some strange men came into my house, asked me a lot of weird questions, and then tried to take my son away!" And hey, we get to see a glimpse of young Lita Grey, who will become important to Chaplin later...Last film viewed: Way Down East (1920). Last film chronologically: The Mark of Zorro (1920). Next film: Nosferatu, A Symphony of Horror (1922).The Movie Odyssey is an exhaustive, chronological project where we watch as many milestone films as possible, starting with D.W. Griffith's Intolerance in 1916 and working our way through, year by year, one film at a time. We also write a short review for each and every film. In this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period, the films of the era, and each film in context, while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies, most of which we never would have watched otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good Sentimental Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They say Chaplain is a cultural icon and all that but I'm not so sure anymore. There has been a generational discontinuity, at least in the USA, that seems to have happened about 20 or 30 years ago. I suspect that most people over the age of 40 could identify Charlie Chaplin, and most people under that age would have to stretch a bit. Just one more item in the cultural data base gurgling its way through the age structure towards extinction.Generally I disapprove of kids in movies as straightforward objects of a particularly putrid kind of manipulation, but Jackie Coogan is an exception.Sentimental manipulation there is, but it's mainly limited to one or two scenes. The comedy is pretty acerbic. Saddled with possession of an abandoned baby, Charlie holds it in his lap and sits on the curb to think about how to get rid of it. He notices a sewer grating in the gutter and lifts the lid thoughtfully for a second before glancing around and lowering it again. That's not what passes for sentimentality.Besides, Coogan is cute when he's 5 or 6 years old, a ragamuffin dressed in floppy over-sized bags of clothing, so that when he runs at high speed he looks like a little football with tiny feet on it. And the kid can act too.Charlie demonstrated every move the kid was supposed to make and Coogan did a good job of imitating him, which was all he had to do. Coogan is also refreshing when compared to all the adult actors in the film because he's too inexperienced to know how to overact. Chaplain is good too, of course. How could one person be so inventive? It's said that TV "eats up" talent because of the constant demand for new material. One of the better series, "Twilight Zone," had about three good years of collaborative effort in it. Chaplain in the same period of time appeared in 62 films and directed something like 28 of them, and he was just getting started.I'll give one example of a joke, without an iota of sentiment in it, to illustrate how well Chaplain and Coogan worked together. Coogan gets into a street fight with another kid, a big bully, who knocks him about. Chaplain spots this, interrupts the fight, and takes Coogan to a neutral corner where he gives him a quick lesson on boxing -- go for the belly, keep your guard up -- and sends him back into the fight. At this point the bully's hugely muscular big brother swaggers over to Chaplain and says, "If your boy beats my boy, I'm going to beat you." Coogan begins beating hell out of the other kid, knocking him down again and again while Chaplain sweats and twitches with fear. Finally Coogan lands a tremendous blow on the bully's chin and flattens him. But he swings with such force that he himself twirls around a couple of times and falls flat on his back. Chaplain dashes over, puts his foot on the Coogan's chest to hold him down, quickly counts to ten, rushes to the befuddled bully and raises his hand -- the winner!A rather tight rein is kept on the pathos and the comic material is edgy. You'll enjoy it. Especially if you're one of those rare folks under 40 with the patience to sit through a movie in black and white that has no dialogue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kid Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Kid starring Chaplin and Coogan is both enjoyable and sentimental. The way Chaplin forms a relationship with Coogan is both funny emotional. It's clear from the beginning that even though Chaplin has been handed a baby he does not want at first his antics show otherwise. As the plot unfolds Chaplin is quick to protect Coogan and even manages have a special relationship with him that he formed throughout the movie. This movie back then reminds me of "Big Daddy" today starring Adam Sandler and Dylan Sprouse. Just like in "The Kid" an unwilling main character (Sandler) cares for a young kid that he didn't want at first but then forms a special relationship with him at the end. Both Sandler and Chaplin find themselves in trouble with the law over the kid but in the end it's clear to see they were made for each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite a surprisingly good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who has missed out on multiples of "classic" movies, I decided for this next year to watch the movies on IMDb's top 250 movies. To work up to now (and also to avoid seeing sequels before originals) I started with "The Kid," the classic Charlie Chaplin movie. I knew who he was and could tell you what he looked like, but had never seen one of his films. This movie was really well done, for the time it was filmed and the plot they had. The facial expressions of everyone involved were descriptive enough to get the message across, despite it being a silent film. I was especially impressed with the kid, "John," and his acting, from the various moods conveyed through his face to his cooking and acting. Little things, such as when he was preparing food and gave a little nod, signaling the food was done to his tastes. The plot is easily understood, even with only a short amount of written dialogue, and should not be intimidating to audiences who are unfamiliar with silent films. A woman wants to drop her child off so he can be properly cared for, and after a huge mix up, ends up being looked after by The Tramp, himself. She goes on to become famous, and upon discovering her son is still alive five years later, tried to get him back. Despite it having a bit of slapstick comedy and being so old, there were parts where I honestly chuckled out loud, and parts where I felt a bit sad. The music adds to the scenes nicely, as well. It is a short movie, coming in under an hour, and is apparently a masterpiece of Chaplin's, so I am going to go ahead and recommend this movie to everyone. You give it 15 minutes, and you are already almost a third of the way through. And if you really do not like it, you never have to see it again, but you will have seen it. I do not regret seeing this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elegant Movie Must See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The KID is a very concise movie by modern standards I think. BUt at the time it was made, perhaps it was perceived as elaborate. This was longer and had more scenes than many movies at that time. THE STORY is simple, and very well told, with only a few distractions from the main line. The strength of the story is great, drawing from the abandoned child theme from ancient tales (AHM the scholars call it) of Moses, Krishna,... many others probably!! In this a prophecied baby is abandoned due to bad circumstances, and raised by common folk, to grow up to do great deeds. These stories are so fundamental to HUMAN storytelling, that the mere introduction of the idea connects the viewer to the entire history of story telling, a comfort achieved within the first 10 minutes of this movie. The rest of the movie is framed in a very MODERN set of circumstances( at that time).The Camera-work, angles, timing, editing is close to perfect, a marvel perhaps at that time. This beats out vast majority of MODERN movies in quality of image. I am GUESSING they used tripods and abundant light, and rehearsal of shots. CHaplin's later movies (modern times, great dictator) may have improved on this one in technical senses, but THE KID is technically sound enough to meet the requirements of any CINEMATOGRAPHIC- or CLARITY-buff(except the color part). This is a GRAYSCALE movie!!!The ACTING performances are all masterful, they may be slightly overacted by SOUNDED standards, but needed for a silent movie which is to be viewed by people of cultures across the world. THe movements and expressions had to be very universal to be communicated effectively. Remember, even within USA, we had a large variety of cultures within as it we had plenty of regional variation and first or second generation immigrants!! I did not like the overmakeup sometimes, but that is my only criticism of this movie, along with one more criticism which I reserve for people who have not seen the movie yet!!ANY STUDENT of cinema has no business not seeing this movie.COMEDY and DRAMA Fans, will have the best of this movie. ACTION fans, limited scope here, but have several somewhat pioneering scenes, including great rooftop chase(first?...correct me) THREE's Company fans will see where Jack Tripper may have borrowed some of his signature moves.CRYers will have two scenes to refresh their tear ducts.KIDS will be delighted with this easy to follow Film!!T H A N K S F O R R E A D I N G ! ! ! !My review is OVER, THANK YOU!

		<fullReview>Wonderful picture mixes sentiment , drama , slapstick and pursuits in a winning combination . While walking the slums the Tramp (Charles Chaplin) meets a baby left by an unfortunate woman (Edna Purviance who played several Chaplin films) , including a note : ¨Please love and care for this orphan child¨ . He then cares for an abandoned child , as Charlie struggling to nurture the castoff illegitimate kid (Jackie Coogan who launched as the first child superstar) . The Tramp has to face nasty cops , doctors and orphanage workers who want to carry the kid to County Orphan Asylum . As events put that relationship in jeopardy .This sassy picture packs slapstick , inter-weaving gags , melodrama , opulent Victorian sensibility and a lot of laughters are guaranteed too . ¨The Kid¨ is a culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant drama that originated a great influence of wide range . Ordinary sentimentality is made available both by the balancing presence of harsh reality and Chaplin's amusing grace of pantomimic skills . The sensitive drama is set amongst garbages , flophouses , a slum world described in Erich Von Stroheim style . Being accompanied by an adequate soundtrack , as the main theme from Charles Chaplin's score is based on a theme from Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony . Duo starring is frankly magnificent . As Charlot's marvelous acting as a tramp who takes home an abandoned baby . Nice acting by Jackie Cooper as streetwise orphan that launched him as major child star , and it's easy to see why . Furthermore , agreeable Edna Purviance as unlucky mother , she acted in a lot of Chaplin shorts and in A Woman of Paris: A Drama of Fate .The motion picture was masterfully directed and played by Charles Chaplin . The production company tried to cheat Charles Chaplin by paying him for this six-reel film what they would ordinarily pay him for two-reel film, about half a million dollars. Chaplin took the unassembled film out of state until they agreed to the one-and-a-half million he deserved, plus half the surplus profits on rentals, plus reversion of the film to him after five years on the rental market. Deemed to be Chaplin's first real feature but he had made many shorts such as ¨The Vagabond¨, ¨Night at the show¨, ¨Burlesque on Carmen¨, ¨The immigrant¨ and ¨The circus¨ . Chaplin subsequently would make a string of successful films such as ¨The Gold Rush¨, ¨City lights¨, ¨Modern times¨, ¨The great dictator¨, ¨Monsieur Verdoux¨ , ¨A King of New York¨ and his last movie ¨Countess from Hong Kong¨.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Kid (1921): Dir: Charlie Chaplin / Cast: Charlie Chaplin, Jackie Coogan, Edna Purviance, Carl Miller, Tom Wilson: Chaplin's first silent feature length film blends sight comedy as well as drama and emotion. Jackie Coogan plays the kid but the title may suggest Chaplin himself in his ability to prevail within the realms of responsibility. Plot regards a young kid who is made suddenly available to his care and a series of slapstick adventures follow as authority attempt to claim the kid. Chaplin branches out as his trademark Tramp raises this kid and together they team up to make cash. Coogan breaks windows and Chaplin repairs them for cash. Coogan is credited as the first screen child actor and his ability to mimic Chaplin's actions are flawless. When he is finally taken away it provides the emotional core. Edna Purviance appears a Coogan's mother whom gave up the kid in hopes that someone caring would raise him. She eventually turns up again but the return is not as cliché as expected. Carl Miller appears as the man who stares at her photographic image before accidentally losing it to fire. Tom Wilson plays a police officer who pursues Chaplin to obvious comic effect. The visual elements were top notch for its time particularly a Heavenly dream sequence but this film will mainly be enjoyed and remembered as Chaplin's first successful feature film. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First of Many</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin's 'The Kid' is the first of many golden treats Chaplin gave us during his extraordinary career. As an actor, director, producer, writer and composer he shows how to make a perfect blend between humor, drama and a taste of surrealism. It's The Tramp in all its glory. A character that "speaks" a universal language and makes us fall in love with it over and over again. Though it isn't The Tramp that steals the show completely. 'The Kid' is the real star of this movie. The child actor arguably gives one of the best ever on screen recorded performances throughout movie history. You can literally feel the pain in his eyes when separated from The Tramp. On the contrary the sparkling eyes touch you when he's with his so called adoption dad. How Chaplin did this is a big question mark. Or should we give the child all the credit? Nonetheless it certainly tells us something about the genius of a storyteller he was and his ability to translate emotions of this kind to the big screen. Although 'The Kid' can be seen as a child of its time the humor is timeless and an universal language everyone speaks. The shots sometimes feel quickly cut but then again this was common for 1920's Hollywood. I must admit Charlie Chaplin is a personal favorite, if not a personal hero. Conclusion: The greatest films are those which make us think about the carefree times when we were a child... 'The Kid' is one of those and a true treasure in movie history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The kid review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Kid" by Charlie Chaplin was yet again another funny movie. The movie featured comedy but also had a relationship that grew throughout the movie. Charlie first finds the baby and wants nothing to do with it. He tries really hard to get rid of it but fails every time. He then doesn't really have a choice to take care of him. The relationship the two had was a very amusing relationship. The things they did were hysterical. It was a father son type relationship that made you laugh. The kid breaking the windows so Charlie could fix them and then be chased by cops was just one of the many funny things that they did. The end of the movie really showed the true development of the relationship between the boy and Charlie. From the beginning, Charlie did not want the baby but grew to like him. They did everything together and when they wanted to take the boy from Charlie, it hit him. He had grown to the boy and did not want to be separated. He fought to keep the child with him. That shows the type of relationship they had and how strong it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coogan gives one of the best child actor performances I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A comedy with a smile--and perhaps a tear"Charlie Chaplin's first self-produced feature film, The Kid, is a tender and sweet tale that once again manages to balance those emotional moments with a great amount of slapstick comedy. The master of pantomime surprised me here by taking a step out of the spotlight and letting it shine on the young newcomer, Jackie Coogan, who steals every scene he is in. Coogan is extremely cute and he held his own next to Chaplin in the comedic department as well. As the title suggests, the main character in this film is the kid who has given the character of the tramp something to live and fight for. The scene that stands out for me is the one where the social workers show up and try to take away his adopted son from him. That scene is a real tearjerker, but at the same time there are some excellent moments of physical comedy that balance them out. The editing was also very well done giving the action scenes some believable effects as Chaplin runs through the roofs to rescue the kid. I actually watched Chaplin's re- edited 1971 version of The Kid that includes an original score and is 15 minutes shorter than the original, but I really enjoyed it and found it moving.This silent film written by Chaplin opens with a sobbing unwed mother (Edna Purviance) walking out of a charity hospital with a baby in arms. Along the way she spots a fancy car in front of a mansion and decides to leave the baby hidden in the back seat with a note asking for whoever finds the baby to take care of him. As she walks away a couple of thieves unexpectedly steal the car and once they discover the baby in the back seat they dump him off in an alley. After having second thoughts for what she did, the mother decides to return to the mansion but once she arrives the owners tell her that the car has been stolen. Meanwhile, the tramp (Charlie Chaplin) stumbles across the baby as he is passing by the alley. At first he tries to get rid of him, but eventually he decides to keep the baby and adopts him. Five years have passed and we are now introduced to the tramp and his kid (Jackie Coogan). He is working as a glazier, and business seems to be going well thanks to his kid who helps him out by smashing the neighbor's windows. The child's real mother has become a famous Opera singer and continues to feel haunted for abandoning her son. She does charity work in the same neighborhood where the tramp and the kid live. The tramp and his kid have overcome many obstacles together, but when the boy becomes ill new trouble arises and it could separate the two forever. The Kid might be almost a hundred years old, but it is still a fascinating watch. It has a great amount of heart and it feels fresh thanks to the tender and sweet story. Chaplin's films are a delight to watch and there is something powerful in the way he portrays his message without using dialogue. His films are told through action and his physical performance is always impressive. In the Kid, Chaplin has found a great sidekick in Coogan, who makes the film all that more tender. I wasn't a huge fan of the dream sequence which felt a bit out of place, but the rest of the film was really a delight. The Kid is a special film and one that cemented Chaplin's status as the best producer, director, writer, and actor during the silent film era. It also has a touching father and son narrative that despite being simple reaches for the heart. It's a beautiful film with a perfect running time for a silent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The woman (Edna Purviance) abandons her baby in a limo with a note that reads "Please love and care for this orphan child." She intends to commit suicide, but changes her mind. Meanwhile the limo is stolen by thieves who dump the baby in an alley. The tramp (Charles Chaplin) finds the baby. When nobody else would take him, he discovers the note, and he decides to raise the boy (Jackie Coogan). Five years later, the woman is now a big star but her missing child still haunts her. When the authorities find out that the tramp isn't the boy's biological father, they come to take away the boy. The woman finds her note in the tramp's room, and realizes the boy is actually her's. The tramp battles to rescue the boy from the authorities.This is funny and emotional. It has the slapstick antics of Charlie Chaplin. The emotional impact comes from the kid. It doesn't get more heart wrenching than when the kid is taken by the authorities for the orphanage. I do have a minor difficulty with the heaven dream near the end. It disrupted the need to finish up the movie at that point. The only thing it achieved was to have an awkward encounter with the bully and his girlfriend. Although it has some fun with Chaplin flying around. If he actually went to heaven, then it could have ended in an interesting way. The dream explanation just fakes out the entire sequence. It's a minor problem which doesn't really detract from the overall awesomeness of the movie.</fullReview>

Also, ccthemovieman-1 ("One Of The Most Memorable Silent Films Ever", ccthemovieman-1 from United States, 24 November 2005). And, vladymirror mentions the miraculous rags-to-riches climb Chaplin made ("the greatest", vladymirror from Japan, 26 September 2003).Michael DeZubiria ("A picture with a smile ? and perhaps, a tear.", Michael DeZubiria from Luoyang, China, 27 April 2008) mentions Coogan's excellent performance.SnorriSma1989 ("Ninety years later.......", SnorriSma1989 from Norway, 8 January 2011) mentions what I was going to write; that the scene where Chaplin recovers Coogan after the latter is taken away by child services parallels real-life Chaplin being taken away from his mother. It also offers the filmic possibility that Chaplin would be reunited with his late son."The Kid" is an amazing work of art that helped define cinema's possibility of moving an audience. With Chaplin's official score which was added decades later, it becomes an excellent show to be viewed with the accompaniment of a symphony. (I saw it with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra on 1/31/14.)My only quibble with "The Kid" is that Chaplin directed it. With all of Chaplin's films where he was such a dominant artistic influence, direction is one duty I wish he delegated. Chaplin is a good director but he wasn't in the same class as others (e.g., Hitchcock) who followed him. The Kid is interesting to look at, but visually there is some room for improvement.Chaplin's other contributions (i.e., acting, writing, producing, editing and the score) are first-rate. It is too bad that Chaplin and Coogan never worked in film together again. The chemistry between them is sublime. Coogan mimics Chaplin wonderfully; this kid's performance is sensational.The sheer audacity of "the Kid" should not be forgotten by contemporary audiences. Chaplin mixes comedy and pathos beautifully, contributing a sense of great intellectual depth. The story has autobiographical elements. Chaplin is allowing a youngster to upstage him. Chaplin's narrative skills moves his audience emotionally in ways that had never been previously experienced with a movie. I really like how Chaplin introduces his character. It is one of his most noteworthy visuals. As the Little Tramp is walking along a street multiple people are dumping garbage that falls near him. This introductory scene really establishes what the Little Tramp represents; and contrasts with the final image substantially.The absurd business that Chaplin manages with Coogan's assistance is exquisite and among early cinema's richest moments. Chaplin makes it seem impossible that his character actually manages to survive with a child in tow by having his character return money to the woman whose window he repairs. I really like how Chaplin consistently suppresses an explanation of how the Tramp survives his misery. This is a good technique for aspiring screenwriters to note.Viewing "The Kid" today, preferably in a concert hall with a symphony playing Chaplin's excellent score, remains a tremendously rich experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Version I saw: UK bluray release Actors: 7/10 Plot/script: 7/10 Photography/visual style: 6/10 Music/score: 7/10 Overall: 7/10 It could be said that this was Charlie Chaplin's breakthrough film: it was one of the longest films he had made up to this point, having previously focused on short films of around 15-25 minutes' duration. I think it could actually be considered two short films, as it has a lengthy dream sequence midway through it in which Chaplin dreams himself as an angel in paradise.While Chaplin has a deceptive way of seeming effortlessly funny, I feel that this film is more one to smile all the way through than a riotous comedy: there are not as many outright laughs as in some of his other films.However, while it is not as political as other Chaplin films, The Kid does pull a similar trick of sneaking in social issues, and even manages to make them more deeply affecting than in the others I have seen. The scene in which the child is taken away is particularly touching, with the panicked, desperate expressions visible on both of their faces.For my full review, read my Blogspot independent film blog, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/the-kid-1921.html</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin and Jackie Coogan form a palpable bond in this delightful story of love between the Little Tramp and an abandoned child he raises.Through an ingenious twist of fate "the kid" is reunited with his actress mother, the beautiful Edna Purviance. Thus, this movie presages the equally enchanting "Captain January" of 1924, which starred the charismatic child actress Baby Peggy. Coogan, only four when this was filmed, is a real cutie and so much more likable than Shirley Temple, who was quickly to follow in the talkies. (I was surprised, when I read his entry on Wikipedia, to realize that it was Coogan who went on to play Uncle Fester on the Addams Family!)While the father/adoptive-son relationship is the heart of this film -- how 'bout that goodnight kiss in the flophouse? -- almost every sequence is a delight, from the window-replacement scam and the fight scene to the Tramp's flirtation with a housewife and the mesmerizing dream scenario.In all, a delightful experience!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chaplin's first feature and his finest hour. It's quintessential Chappers, a perfect mix of sentimentality, slapstick and social conscience; all his strengths distilled into one perfect gem. From the opening with Edna Purviance's eviction from the charity hospital to the uncaring authority figures to the struggle to put food on the table, this is a film awash with Chaplin's empathy with the poverty-stricken.Not that it's a heavy film. It's absolutely hilarious, with Charlie showing preternatural comic timing as he escapes bullies, scraps in the back of a truck, dodges cops and turns his bedspread into a poncho. As the kid, Jackie Coogan is just incredible: he's not only utterly adorable but is a terrific little actor, too. Look how cute and funny he is when the cop catches him throwing stones, and how heartbreaking when the orphanage goons come to take him away. All this and a flying dog too. Gorgeous stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic in every sense of the word</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two things I find impressive about Charlie Chaplin's "The Kid":1. Its enduring sentiment plucks at the paternal heartstrings (even of those who aren't fathers).2. It stands as Exhibit A of Chaplin's innate knack for making us laugh one minute and cry the next. "The Kid" is a movie that's so disarming in its sweetness that you can't help but be moved. Chaplin's Tramp character happens on a discarded infant and raises it as his own. The pair nurture a sweet scam wherein the Kid chucks rocks through windows, and the Tramp shows up with a fresh pane of glass. But when the Kid falls ill, the soulless orphanage comes calling. No spoilers intended, but what happens next will jerk the tears from even the coldest heart.Chaplin knew what he was doing when he cast Jackie Coogan in the title role, and it was a stroke of genius. Coogan has the great sense of comedic timing to make his delinquent character lovable, and he's just a damn cute kid. He's no lightweight in the physical comedy department, and he holds his own in his scenes with Chaplin. It's a thrill to watch. And almost 100 years later, the film holds up extremely well.9/10</fullReview>

And even though there is no sound (except music), it was not as hard to watch through as I imagined it to be. My curiosity about film techniques and lifestyle at that time drove me through it. :P I was even surprised by some techniques.For some reason I could enjoy it, but to be honest it was my first and my last Chaplin movie. ;-)I doubt it is a movie someone is looking for when browsing the top250, lol.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet silent-era classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sweet silent-era classic. Produced, directed by, written by and starring the greatest comedic actor of all time, Charlie Chaplin. He pretty much invented physical comedy for the silver screen, and also perfected it.It is amazing to see the creativity displayed by Chaplin in some of his sight gags. Not only to think of the scene, but also to make it and act it out. Simply astonishing some of the stuff he came up with. Plus, it all fits in with the plot of the movie. It's not just a random scene slotted in gratuitously. So many brilliant, laugh-out-loud moments. Also amazing to see what you can achieve cinematically when you don't have the "luxury" of sound.However, there is more to Chaplin than just comedy, and it's no more evident than in this movie. This is also a good drama, and a bitter-sweet, emotional one too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sentimental and Touching: The Best Picture of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Kid" makes the case that Charles Chaplin was the greatest silent movie star of all time. Now that does not disregard the excellent works of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd, but Chaplin was the best, and, to prove the point, he had the greatest number of major screen hits: "The Kid" (1921), "The Gold Rush" (1925), "The Circus" (1928), "City Lights" (1931), "Modern Times" (1936), "The Great Dictator" (1940). And he produced, directed, wrote screenplays, composed, edited, and acted (starred). "The Kid" was Chaplin's first as a director. The movie begins with a title card, "A picture with a smile - and perhaps, a tear." An unwed mother (Edna Purviance) and entertainer "whose sin was motherhood" walks out of a charity hospital and abandons her baby, and Charlie Chaplin eventually happens to notice the infant wrapped inside a blanket. He tries humorously and awkwardly to pass the little tyke onto others, but just cannot succeed. So he decides to raise the baby as his own. Five years later we see a spunky kid with baggy pants (Jackie Coogan) named John." It is obvious that Tramp's reward for his adoption is the happy presence and meaning that the Kid gives his life, despite conditions of poverty. The two are partners who work together to raise funds, which are always short. Their "work" consists of the energetic Kid breaking windows with rocks, with the Tramp just happening to show up as a glazier with a window replacement kit. There are a number of classic scenes: the Kid's grooming session, pancake breakfast, the bully fight, flophouse, and dream sequence. Meanwhile the Kid's real mother, who has finally made it big, has wanted her child back for some time. She is still searching. Will the three lives intermingle?The blend of comedy and pathos throughout are skillfully handled by the director. Also, there is incredible screen chemistry between Chaplin and six year-old Coogan, who made his debut. The latter stole most scenes, especially the part where the County Orphan Asylum authorities are separating him from his father. Chaplin didn't seem to mind as he and Coogan made quite a pair! The Chaplin-Coogan combination was a winning one, and Coogan's career as a child star, the first one in movie history, was launched. Chaplin himself became ? not only the biggest Hollywood actor in the world ? but also the most famous personality on earth. His image was recognizable in most places. The music score is very sentimental, and appropriate. The original 68-minute feature was trimmed to about 53-minutes by Chaplin in 1971.</fullReview>

The movie and the humor are timeless.An impecunious and unmarried woman deserts her just-born son to commit suicide and leaves a note with the baby asking to 'love and care for this orphaned child'. The baby is deposited in a car, which gets stolen by burglars, who eventually keep the baby next to garbage. The tramp finds the baby and despite several attempts to find the parent, he decides to take care of the boy. He makes arrangement for the boy to feed and purge. They team up to find a way to earn a living and they succeed by breaking glasses and fixing new ones. When the boy falls sick, a country doctor asks the Orphanage to come and claim the child for better treatment. The Tramp and the kid refuse to be parted and after a desperate and frenzied chase, they get back to each other. In the meanwhile, the kid's biological mother becomes a celebrated actor and the kid's father a celebrated painter. They reconcile and forgive each others' mistakes. The woman gets to know the real identity of the kid and declares a reward for those who return the kid. The kid is delivered to the woman but The Tramp, who has taken care of the boy for so long, is called up to the woman's mansion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Achievements in the Silent Era of Filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin's first feature-length theatrical is one of the greatest achievements of silent era of filmmaking that paints one of the most heartfelt portrait of father-son relationship on the silver screen, presents the gifted talent at the prime of his creativity, and despite being nearly a century old classic, can still put most comedies of today to shame.A comedy with a smile &amp; perhaps a tear, The Kid tells the story of a tramp who after coming across an abandoned baby takes him under his care after which the film jumps five years in the span of which the grown child now works as his father's sidekick, helping his glazing business by breaking windows around the town. But an unfortunate set of events soon put their relationship into jeopardy.Written, produced, directed, composed &amp; edited by Charlie Chaplin himself, who also stars as his signature character, The Kid is clearly a one-man show yet there isn't a single aspect where Chaplin's work isn't impressive enough. Plus his remarkable ability to fuse comedy with elements of drama in a seamless manner not only makes this tale a roller-coaster ride of rib-tickling laughter but also an emotionally moving story.The chemistry between Chaplin &amp; Jackie Coogan, who plays the young kid, is absolutely spot-on plus their on-screen bonding feels wholly convincing. Technical aspects are full of little innovations, Cinematography crisply captures the unfolding events, Editing is tight for the most part but that dream sequence did feel a bit unnecessary. However, the wonderful background score does rank amongst my favourite soundtracks.On an overall scale, The Kid remains one of the most memorable, influential &amp; greatest films of all time whose significance &amp; contribution to the art of cinema cannot be downplayed. It has effortlessly managed to stand the test of time for what soon will be one whole century and thanks to its universal themes, will continue to do so for as long as cinema exists. Truly an unforgettable classic, definitely one of Chaplin's finest &amp; certainly amongst my all time favourites, The Kid comes strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ninety years later.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time THE KID reached theaters in early 1921, Chaplin had already been a household name for years and was, by this time, to some degree taken for granted by critics. However, having spent nearly two years on a production which resulted in a completed film of six reels, it must have appeared inevitable that the comedian had made himself worthy of another evaluation. Chaplin's first feature film as a director is presented as "A film with a laugh ? and perhaps a tear" in an opening title, and this promise is being kept throughout; quite definitely so. The film has the Tramp finding an abandoned baby, whom he eventually adopts. As a few years go by, the two of them struggle to make both ends meet, and they are forced to use some quite imaginative methods in order to survive: a brilliant sequence has the Kid breaking windows while the Tramp casually walks by as a glazier? Obviously, they are frequently in trouble with the law, and the Tramp might not come across as an overwhelmingly ideal parent; at least not at first sight. However, eventually a visit from a representative of a children's home put to question who is really capable of giving the Kid love and affection when he needs it the most?Having started out his film career doing pretty much what most of his contemporaries were doing at the time (running around and knocking down a by-passer with a brick in the head simply because he looks kind of stupid), Chaplin had undergone a truly phenomenal artistic development during his first seven years as a film-maker. Although his talent had been evident from the very start, and he had several outstanding short comedies on his credit by this time, THE KID is probably the film where his ability to convey a strong dramatic aspect within his comedy reached full maturity. The chemistry between Chaplin and child actor marvel Jackie Coogan is not only touching, but appears to be truly genuine; it actually started a trend of adopting abandoned children among film comedians for the years to follow, of which Lloyd Hamilton is one example. However, one of the reasons why Chaplin's version remains so much alive in public consciousness to this day, while most attempts at imitating him are forgotten, is that the comedian based his story on truly personal experiences and concerns. Although being far from the first time he looked back upon his tough past as a poverty-struck boy in London in order to find a setting for his films, he had never before dared to let the pain which he suffered during much of his childhood become so visibly reflected. His memory of being taken away from his mother by cold authorities as a child is an unavoidable parallel, and it has also been suggested that the film may partly reflect Chaplin's sorrow over having lost an infant child at the beginning of the production.It is true, as some contemporary critics have noted, that the film does make use some of time-typical elements which might appear dated today, such as a few scenes with the mother and certain title-cards. The structure of the film appears more predictable in some regards than later productions of Chaplin such as THE GOLD RUSH and CITY LIGHTS. However, it would be quite pointless (and unfair) to expect THE KID not to have been affected by the time during which it was made. In the years that followed, the silent film language would reach perfection, as directors both in Hollywood and the rest of the world developed ground-breaking methods to convey depth and complexity through subtle nuances. Although I believe he is not generally given the credit he deserves, Chaplin's contributions to this progression stand as incomparable in several ways. With THE KID, he set a whole new standard as to what level the genre of film comedy could be stretched. Although Roscoe Arbuckle, Mabel Normand, Mary Pickford and Max Linder had appeared in features already (which had resulted in some fine comedies, indeed), Chaplin's ability to evoke genuine concern for the Tramp and the Kid left an impact which is evident not only in the later features of other great silent comedians such as Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and Harry Langdon, but remains visible to this day. Chaplin reached an emotional level which interacted smoothly with the comedy, forcing us to wipe our eyes even though we laughed ourselves silly some five minutes earlier. At ten years old, it was probably the first film to ever make me cry?and I still do, when revisiting it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin's first masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Charlie Chaplin's earliest features and first successful attempts at mixing slapstick and sentiment pairs the Little Tramp with a pint-sized alter ego (little Jackie Coogan), abandoned at birth and raised in poverty to be the spitting image of his surrogate father. The two established such a rapport that Chaplin apparently didn't mind having a child steal the film out from under him, not an easy task when working with the acknowledged king of silent comedy (notorious for his equally regal ego). The young star proved to be no less adept and resourceful at evading cops and whipping bullies, and while only half the size of his mentor was at least equally as funny. Chaplin himself was rarely more inventive, and the pathos promised in the opening title ("a comedy with a smile, and perhaps a tear") is, mercifully, kept on a tight leash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Kid represents cinema at it's finest. It has an amazing screenplay, amazing cinematography, beautiful set locations, and a story that will entertain and engage viewers of any age. What is incredibly effective about the film is how it is very much a drama as much as a comedy. The audience cares for the story's elements, and with that there are also various laughs found throughout the film. Granted, this is my first Charles Chaplin film (even though I do recognize that famous mustache!) so I am obviously going to be very impressed. I am just starting to see more silent films, so there is still much more to see. However, it is hard to imagine another silent film that will be better than The Kid, because it is pretty much perfect as any film goes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Chaplin's best. Chaplin's character fins an abandoned infant on the street, and with more or less willingness, take charge of him. All is going well until five year later when the kid falls ill. A "country doctor" (in reference to a 1909 movie) is called, and decides that the sick kid need proper attention and care. Subsequently, a rigid and horrendous orphanage director comes with an officer to take on the child. Which, of course, Chaplin tries successfully to avoid, and ends up in a workhouse. Unfortunately, the formerly desperate mother, now become a star, posted an ad to reward who would bring the kid back, and while Charlie is asleep, the workhouse manager brings the kid to the police station. All ends well as the mother is not a heartless b***ch and welcome Chaplin to her place to see the kid. End. OK, this was factual. Now for the emotional part, Chaplin fulfill this masterpiece with laughters &amp; tears, as we are foretold from the very beginning. This movie, seen now, emphasizes the different way comedies have turn now; no long declamation, forceful words to delineates as strong feelings, just suggestion, appeal to our heart. Simplicity and efficiency in the humor as in the pathos.</fullReview>

In Coogan you can see little Charlie Chaplin. Little kid plays his role better than well... he's great and so is "the big" Chaplin as well! There's so much beauty in the story. The movie tells in a simple way a story about a little boy, a tramp and a desperate woman. In a cute Chaplin way everything has a happy end but before the happy end there's a lot of sadness... and of course also many funny scenes. I think it's amazing how Chaplin can make little things so funny. Charlie Chaplin's mimic is amazingly good, best in the world. His face can show all the feelings incredibly well and little Coogan has learned that from Chaplin. This film must be the most beautiful story about vagabond's life. Maybe Chaplin's best film! All Chaplin's films are worth of watching and especially this one! This movie shows that words are not needed in the movies... words are just disturbing the great mimic. One picture tells more than thousand words, Chaplin really shows that that's true!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kid, The (1921) **** (out of 4) One of the greatest films to mix laughs with tears, this masterpiece has The Tramp (Charles Chaplin) taking care of a young kid (Jackie Coogan) but soon issues might tear them apart. It's well-known that Chaplin's studio wasn't fond of him going into a feature length film but thankfully he got his way because this is clearly the first masterpiece in a long line of great films. THE KID is a rather remarkable little film and one I'm always fascinated by because it's somewhat hard to believe that Chaplin was able to create such a great film in such a short running time. The film starts off with some wonderfully funny sequences including the one where our Tramp first finds the baby boy. Just take a look at this sequence and not only see how funny it is but also look at some of the black humor. There's one part where the Tramp is sitting with the baby by a drain and he opens the drain and thinks about dropping the baby down it. Another terrific moment is when we get back to the rundown home and see how the Tramp fixes up the kid's bottles. The laughs don't stop here because they get even better as we see how the Tramp and his new son make a living. Of course, the last part of the film contains the drama and man is it very powerful. Everyone knows the famous shot of Coogan on the back of the truck screaming out. This is certainly a very powerful scene but so is the look on Chaplin's face as he realizes that he might be losing his buddy. Both Chaplin and Coogan are perfect in their roles and it's rather amazing to see how much they do come across like a real-life father and on. A lot of the current versions are a shorter cut that Chaplin did in 1971 to remove footage of the mother. Film buffs will argue about which version is better but no one which one you select you're in for a great time.</fullReview>

It was a huge success, and was the second-highest grossing film in 1921, behind The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. In 2011, The Kid was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."

		<fullReview>When it comes to classic cinema and especially those often bunched into the "masterpiece" corner, you must prepare yourself when reading reviews for strong gusts of superlatives and overblown gushing over minute details. Your shining suit of scepticism should be worn at all times, weary traveller. Although a fun and enjoyable film, The Kid which has been met with steady and sustained acclaim since its debut in 1921, you could argue is a good example of such criticism gone awry. It's a sometimes-amusing and often-heart-warming feature, sure, but a masterpiece? Not so much. At least not for me. The comedy's plot which revolves around the Tramp adopting an abandoned orphan from infancy before fast-forwarding five years where they run a bit of a racket together, is light and fluffy and has a distinct charm permeating the interactions between the two actors. But aside from a few sight gags and one touching piece of drama, there's not much else to be had from the experience and by the time it reaches the 40 minute mark, feels a bit winded. So much so that Chaplin tacks on a bizarre dream sequence seemingly to fill up some time. Critics often praise this scene as "out of the box" and "daring" and they're right. What they often overlook however is the fact that it's rather useless and superfluous to the already very little going on. It's no surprise to find out that The Kid came at a time when Chaplin was creatively bankrupt and had been so for quite some time. This scene in particular along with the more famous abduction scene are key examples of where film criticism seems ardently opposed to calling a good film a good film instead of throwing more unwarranted praise into an already overflowing river of rose-tinted admiration. The abduction scene which I reference is great, yes, and rich in pathos, but claims of it being the most emotive scene in a comedy, nay film in general (yes this is claimed, believe it or not) are about as grounded as Chaplin's take on whether dogs go to heaven or not. The Kid is a lovely and charming miniature film with affecting performances resulting in some good laughs here and there that must have raised roofs in 1921, but that's it. Nothing else. Anybody who tells you there's more to it than that is probably just as likely to make an argument for swapping your mortgage in exchange for a 100- year-old bottle of wine. Because it's distinguished, it's cultured, it's a classic and you obviously just don't get the whole picture. Instead I'll let you in on a little secret. It's a good film as I've said, maybe even great, but it's certainly not the masterpiece it's so often regurgitated to be. Let's move on.</fullReview>

Music was superb, as well as acting by everyone involved, but the true star in here i think was directing by Chaplin himself. Movie doesn't drag for a second and to think that it was made back, way back in 1923 when it is so involving even after seeing it first time after 93 years makes one thing clear - Charles Chaplin was a true genius.Overall, "The Kid" is a must see for all who likes Chaplin and Tramp.

		<shortDescription>The Kid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin actually took forth casting credit, directing and producing this memorable silent film that achieves an impressive level of pathos and giggles. The beat street cops are often made to look quite foolish while the Tramp (Chaplin) runs around trying to avoid them or keep from being apprehended by them. Edna Purviance is an unwed mother who decides to place her newborn in an abandoned cab, hoping he will be taken to an affluent home. That cab is taken by nefarious crooks, with them eventually realizing that the kid is in the vehicle, abandoning him in an alley! That is when fate would lead penguin-wobbly Tramp to find the kid. Eventually the Tramp and kid would bond and learn to survive together, doing whatever they could to make ends meet (including one hilarious job of repairing windows, with the kid hurling rocks into windows with Tramp "just passing through" to help for a voluntary fee). Eventually the welfare folks would be told by a misanthropic doc that the kid (Jackie Coogan, just adorable) needed a home better than his current arrangement with the Tramp. The remainder of the film has the Tramp trying to hold onto the kid with difficulty. The heartstrings are certainly intentionally pulled as the Tramp and kid hug after being pulled apart by the welfare officer, doctor, and police officer?the cop chasing the Tramp who is chasing the truck carrying the kid is a significant scene. The "dreamland" sequence is a dazzler as the Tramp falls asleep at the doorstep of his locked home (a dump but home just the same), carried away into a dream where he's among angels, and the kid, falling prey to mischief orchestrated by devils (a female angel is lured into seducing the Tramp which leads to her brutish beau and an angel police officer (!) getting involved. The managing to live through meager means (how they live in their little home, making pancakes, keeping themselves clean and fed (I loved how the Tramp counts their flapjacks to make sure each has the same amount), and using whatever resources were available to them), the unavoidable brawl that exists in this poverty-row street environment (the kid is goaded by a bully looking to start something) which soon has the Tramp trying to keep from getting himself throttled by a dump brute (he's the brother of the boy getting pummeled by Coogan!), and the chummy flirtation between the Tramp and a copper's missus (how the Tramp finds out and has to flee is priceless!) are all fun highlights. The Olvera Street location, its crumbling neglect quite an assist to the story told by Chaplin, lending a great deal of aesthetic significance to its characters and their existence in less-than-desirable surroundings, is quite vital to the film's power. The addition of the manipulative music just adds further emotional power to the images, whether during the more spirited comedic action or potently melodramatic scenes. A triumph.Watch for the scene early on where the Tramp, momentarily before coming to his senses instead of following desperation's talking, contemplates dumping the baby in a sewer when opening a road grate! The attempts to dump the baby off in the baby carriage of a mother, with her objecting violently by thwapping the Tramp over the head, and how a copper soon emerges to make things even worse (fate stepping in to make sure the Tramp and child remain together) is pure gold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Picture With a Smile and Perhaps, a Tear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen several of Charlie Chaplin's films now, The Kid was yet another gem in his long-running list of classic films. I think the opening intertitle said it best "a picture with a smile and perhaps, a tear." It was much like many of his other films in that it blends slapstick comedy with an incredible amount of heart. I watch hundreds of films every year, and the number one thing that bothers me is when a film tries to be something it's not. Whether that means it focuses too much on one genre or tries to do way too much with its script, I can assure you that The Kid does not have these issues. I think this is most prevalent when the Tramp, played by Chaplin, is running across rooftops trying to catch up to his adopted son being taken away by the authorities. I laughed multiple times as Chaplin pulls the clumsy Tramp gags he does so well but it was hard to hold back tears a few seconds later as he reunites for a few moments with his son.The performances are also worth mentioning. Jackie Coogan, who plays the five year old boy, John, that Chaplin adopts, really nails the humor. As far as I know it was the first major role for someone so young, and Coogan gives a memorable performance. The scene in which he is breaking windows for his father to fix and constantly running away from the police officer is very reminiscent of so many of Chaplin's gags. Although Coogan was great, Chaplin is why you watch the film, and I think The Kid is about as personal of a performance as you will get from Chaplin. He had just buried his infant son shortly before filming began on The Kid. His performance is evidently flooded with closeted emotion. Even considering my favorite film of his, City Lights, I think The Kid is his most emotionally powerful film.I think the fact that this film came out in 1921, shows just how ahead of its time it was. Before the film and even a little bit after, adult actors were playing child roles. At least Chaplin and the studio had the guts to put their faith in a young five year old, and I think everyone can agree, it paid off. The film does have some dated elements though. For instance, the bully that the Tramp fights is noticeably wearing a stuffed shirt to make him look buff and more intimidating, something that films would never do now-in- days. Considering the bully punches through bricks and takes down a light post with his bare hands, I guess it was worth it. The slapstick comedy angles are very much a figure of silent films in the 20's. The stupidity of some of the fight sequences are both very dated but endlessly entertaining.So even though The Kid can be taken as a slapstick comedy, I think it's the dramatic and thought provoking elements that make the film so special. To a certain extent, this film deals with the age old question of "who is qualified to be a parent?" Of course, it appears the film does have a happy ending but I wonder what happens next. What happens after the lady gets her son back, does the Tramp lose him forever? What gives her the right to take back her baby after giving it up in the first place? Is the fact that the Tramp poor play a factor into the decision to take the kid away from him? I think it's these questions that make this film more than just a laugh out loud comedy and a film that should be studied and understood to be way ahead of its time. I think that's why I always seem to enjoy Chaplin's films, they deal with political and real life issues without bashing these ideas and opinions over the viewer's heads. To me, The Kid exudes a language unspoken in that it takes on issues and ideas that just weren't looked at in the early 20's. The Kid's balance of humor and heart along with its strong political ideas make it one of Chaplin's best, and certainly his most personal and emotional filled films.9.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basic Human Needs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FOLLOWING BRIEF STINTS of toiling and learning to adapt his considerable stage born talents to the relatively new medium of film, Chaplin found a continual progression upward in stature. From his 1914 signing with Mack Sennett's KEYSTONE Film Company, ESSANAY, MUTUAL, then his own company released through FIRST NATIONAL, the "Little Tramp" found increased funding, audience recognition and artistic control.* WHEN THE PRODUCTION of THE KID was begun, his power and prestige were at the pinnacle. He had been directing in his first studio, Keystone, but only his shorts. Now he had the prospect of doing a full length comedy feature film. Some surely expressed their doubts about the wisdom of such a move. Was this pushing the envelope too far? NO DOUBT THE neigh sayers had thought that the content would follow a path identical to the 2 reelers that were so successful. This is where his critics greatly underestimated Charlie.THE SIMPLE ADDITION of some rather earthy elements (like illegitimate birth or suspicion of same), the cold &amp; indifferent society at large and the strength of the human needs for love, security and companionship made all the difference.SKILLFULLY BLENDING IN those elements with the adventures and misadventures of the Tramp, Chaplin brought us a movie that was hard to classify. Was it a Comedy? Drama? An Adventure? What? THE ANSWEER IS really quite simple, Y-E-S!NOTE * Of the power and control over his own productions was maximized in 1919; when Chaplin joined with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and D.W. Griffith in the formation of the UNITED ARTISTS Corporation. Now they had not only their production companies, but also UA to release and distribute.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found it quite hard watching dated movies, I've never watched any Chaplin movie before. But I realised how everything is there ! No spoken dialogues, no colours, and yet one of the most touching movie I've ever seen. Simple and fresh. The story, the ups and downs, the fighting, the dreaming, the happy ending. In 50 minutes an absolute roller-coaster of emotions ranging from total to despair to complete joy, a lot of compelling moments and overall, lots of love and compassion.Also now I understand where many newer actors like Jackie Chan got most of their inspiration from. Amazing !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not one of his best movies, although the tramp and the kid are adorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The kid" has brilliant scenes with Chaplin's stamp: all the footage of the relationship between the tramp and the kid (every scene! amazing! what a good child actor! how nice are the tramp's mannerisms!), the street-fights, the policeman's house, the dorm, the dream... Though, not everything is good alike: this is not because of Edna Purviance's acting, but the woman's story is much less interesting, and somewhat badly developed. The end is also poor: I am sure that Chaplin was able to create hundreds of more original, entertaining, and touching ways of showing the same than the abrupt last scene he shot. To resume, "The kid" is a quite good movie, there is no doubt about that. If this review may seem to be exaggerate in criticism, that is because we always expect a masterpiece from Charlie Chaplin. Though, we cannot tell that about this film, one of his most famous ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, Charlie Chaplin's seminal work was "City Lights", but this is a charming tale in it's own right. In retrospect, the idea that The Addams Family's Uncle Fester, Jackie Coogan is the young cohort of the comic genius seems a bit surreal from today's perspective, but should in no way detract from your viewing pleasure. The characters of The Tramp and The Child form an inseparable team after the 'adoption', and one would be hard pressed to hold back a tear or two when the Social Service Agency of the era comes calling to remove the youngster from Chaplin's care. With Chaplin's agonizing attention to detail, the story goes from slapstick to pathos and back with such fluid movement that one is taken from joyous laughter to tearful sorrow virtually within the same scene. It's a testament to Chaplin's skill as a writer, director, producer and actor that he uses his talent to convey a story that's heartwarming and meaningful some ninety plus years since originally made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Film - except for one thing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE KID (1921) tells the story of an infant who is abandoned by his mother, and the poor Tramp (Charlie Chaplin, of course) who takes him in, as well as the joys and struggles that they face along the way. When the child's mother (Edna Purviance) becomes a famous actress, she decides to perform charity for others, which brings her in touch with the Tramp and her child. Directed by Charlie Chaplin.THE KID is Chaplin's first feature, and is usually cited as a breakthrough in comedy for mixing humor with pathos, or poignancy and sadness. The story is fairly simple but told economically and skillfully ? except for a detour into a rather bizarre "angels and devils" dream sequence that doesn't add anything to the narrative. It's really strange and I didn't find it particularly amusing. Except for that, though, the film is quite funny and moving. Charlie Chaplin displays his usual charm as the "little tramp" character, but the real revelation here is Jackie Coogan, who plays the kid of the title. His performance is so natural and unforced, so real and vivid, that he went on to become a star during the silent era. The scenes where Chaplin and Coogan's characters are separated are downright heartbreaking, especially due to Coogan's vivid expressions. There are many comical scenes as well, involving the Tramp's window replacing business and his run-ins with the cops, and tender scenes in the Tramp's tenement apartment. Chaplin shows a little more cinematic flair in this film than in many of his shorts, especially with the climactic rooftop chase, and he vividly captures the atmosphere of poverty in which his characters live. He uses undercranking at times to speed up the movement, an effective device that was used commonly in slapstick comedies. The editing is smooth and the print from the Criterion Collection is pristine, featuring the original orchestral score that Chaplin wrote for the film, which fits perfectly. Except for the jarring dream sequence, this movie is a marvel. SCORE: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Charlie Chapling movies! This one is also good, just not great for me personally. I was thinking all along. Hmmm.. those other ones were better. Funnier! And so, at the end of the movie, I took a look at the release year, and I see this is one of his first movies. So, in my opinion his movies get even better as he gains experience making them. This is a good movie though. Stands for repeat watching! As all his movies do! Wow, why have we stopped making movies like this?? This is some quality comedy, better than most of the Hollywood ones, who mainly seem to be making R-rated , jokes, inappropriate for kids and even too unclean for adults many times. Besides, C.C. is a master of body language it seems. And choreography. This movies are brilliant. Even if made today. But they were made like almost a century ago. Pretty much the first movies ever!So, yeah, C.C. movies highly recommended, other ones even more than this one.Real rating: 7.1</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much has been said about the use of pathos in The Kid (1921): how Chaplin seamlessly blends humor and heart, how it was the first comedy feature to have a narrative with real stakes in the balance of all the gags and comedic set pieces.What always impresses me the most about this movie is the talent of young Jackie Coogan. I am not at all partial to child actors, especially during the 30s-60s, but Coogan is truly a natural. He's so genuine and unaffected in his technique, and he gives what may be the greatest child performance of all time.Chaplin is greats as always and Edna Purviance turns a brief but moving performance as the single mother who makes it big.A beautiful film, not to be skipped over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indeed Six Reels of Joy! A picture with a smile-and perhaps, a tear.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Chaplin's and one of the first full-length movie for Hollywood. Before then, most silent films were still short and quickly put out. It took nearly a year for Chaplin to finish this movie. Although this film started out as another short film, by the time it was done, Charles taken more shots and retakes than any film before as done. By completion, it had grown into a six reel feature film. The Kid is thought to be influenced by Chaplin's own childhood and what was happening at the time in his life. At the time his wife Mildred Harris was pregnant. On 1919, she gave birth to a malformed boy that die 3 days later. The event took its ton on Chaplin's personal life. It seems to have influenced Chaplin's work, as he planned a film that turned the Tramp character into the father figure of a young boy. You can see that he transmute his personal pain into something that stir people hearts. His relationship with Mildred Harris have become soured to the point, that Charlie Chaplin became afraid of her trying to steal the film from him during the divorce hearings. The film opens up with an unwed poor mother (Edna Purviance) coming out of a hospital with a baby. You can tell it's illegitimate, as in Chaplin's life, who was himself illegitimate, edits the image of the father an artist burning the photo of the woman. The woman hold the baby and walks as if Jesus holding a cross which is shot fading out. It's hard to tell what Chaplin meant with this explicit Christian symbolism, but the symbolisms returns throughout the film confusing more people. I can only sense that Chaplin was going for fragility, and transience of true moments of human love, over the sacrifice of pain. By having a halo seem to appear the mother head for a few moments, it might represent Virgin Mary. Anyways, she comes across on her self-journey seeing a bride who just got marry. The bride drops a withered flower, symbolizing her loss of virginity. By doing this, I believe it represent her sacrifice her life by marrying an old man that she does not love for money. Within a few seconds, Chaplin takes pose symbolism that commit on hypocritical American piety, puritanism, and organized religion. It's hard to make a saint out of this movie character when she gives up the kid in hope of a better life by leaving the child in a rich person's car. Instead of an rich person finding the baby, two thefts stole the car, and tossed the baby out near some trash cans. It is there, that the Tramp (Chaplin) find the baby and does everything at first to dispatch of the baby, even contemplating throwing the infant into a street grating. While it might be a bit funny, its dark humor isn't what I thought of this family movie coming in. It was a bit disturbing for the Tramp to even think that way. Anyways, the Tramp accepts fatherhood, and adopts the kid. 5 years pass, and the baby grew up as John (Jackie Coogan). John help the Tramp get work by breaking windows for him to fix. Meanwhile, the grief-stricken Edna has seen the error of her ways and leaded a life of charity. Edna and John meets when John started a fight with the local bully. It is here, that Edna believes that John is her long lost child. Soon the Tramp get into trouble too, as agents of the law figure out that the kid isn't his own and try to send the boy to an orphanage. That scene alone will get you emotional. The Tramp now has to try to find a way to keep his only love from being taken away, not only by the law, but the mother wanting to see him. The movie goes pretty good until "Dreamland," sequence with angels in residence and devilish interlopers with temptation arrives in the form of 12-year old Lita Grey, whom Chaplin would marry and bitterly divorce in real life (Grey was the source of inspiration for Vladimir Nabakov's "Lolita"). That is where it lost focus a bit. I didn't like the ending as well. In no way, should John ever be reunion with the mother who abandon him. Jackie Coogan does a great job. It's weird in a way that the actor would end up playing Uncle Fester years later on 1964's Addams Family. There are several version of this. In 1971, Chaplin, who was eager to share his work with a new generation, that he re-cut the picture, resulting in a version that was shorter. I thought the scenes he cut were very good and added a little more depth to the characters. There is a crucial 80-second scene which is missing in that version. The mother goes to a bridge and encounters something which makes her decide that she wants the child after all. Since films and soundtracks are often copyrighted separately at the time, it was hard to find the right song for the film. Chaplin wrote all of the music for his pictures and few survive over the years. The film is still riddled with age related artifacts that, even with this skillful transfer, are still present. Film grain is moderate. Black levels are sometimes weak. The gray scale is adequately balanced. Aliasing, edge enhancement and shimmering of fine details are all present and sometimes distract. The audio is 5.1 and nicely balanced. I couldn't see the lettering in my version. Overall: If you are a Chaplin fan, this movie is a must have. If you are not a fan, but are curious what all the fuss is about, this movie will let you know. Without a doubt, one of the most beautiful, moving, and tearful both in sadness and in joy, movies ever made.</fullReview>

Like most Chaplin movies,after a certain point,the audience will demand more than laughter. And it was provided. There was a time when i believed that Chaplin was merely a comedian.

As "the kid" grows older, they become partners in crime, until one day when the child falls ill and hospital workers endeavor to take the boy away. One of the most famous silent films of all time and it is also regarded as the first-ever comedy-drama in cinema.Beautifully reflecting his growing maturity as a filmmaker as well as his ardor for the work, The Kid stands as a splendid introduction to Chaplin's movies.Projects such emotional veracity while getting such constant giggles that if there ever was a legitimate use of the cliché "you'll laugh, you'll cry," this is it.Watch it to truly appreciate this landmark silent film.</fullReview>

There are many entertainment options out here which rely on different parts and here we have a true laugh on a very great matter. This is my first film by Charlie Chaplin and I am blown. The film is short and explores the struggle of father and son for making their hands meet by the end of the day. There are so many moments when you can't stop smiling be it the innocence of the child or the superb acting of Charlie Chaplin. However you should also make mindset for the period in which the film was made and don't expect much effects in the end. This is a true family film."A recommended watch."</fullReview>

They have a great screen chemistry that really translates well on screen.I often wonder what type conditions child actors of that era endured. I don't think they had the child labor laws that are in place now. I think it's sad how Jackie Coogan didn't receive a lot of the money he earned. He was the youngest self-made millionaire in history - but when his dad died and his mom remarried, they refused to give him his earnings. I think he did eventually receive some, but a small portion of the total.But not being a fan of the silent era and not having seen many, I can't really comment much on any comparisons of others of the time. I just know I usually can't stay interested in silent movies beyond a few minutes - but this one kept me engaged to the very end. That, in and of itself, speaks of the excellence of this movie.One odd note - as I was watching Chaplin, I kept finding myself thinking he resembles Hugh Grant (or vice versa).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin's "The Kid" is, quite simply, a masterpiece of silent cinema, one of the most emotional visual journeys every viewer must undertake. Simple, subtle and straightforward, Chaplin succeeds both as an actor and a director. As an actor, he plays his usual role of Charlot, a goofy flat-feet-ed short man with a hat and a mustache, who, in this case, finds a baby on the street and decides to raise him. As a director, Chaplin manages to employ a quite "cinematic" style, quite contrary to many of his former movies. Because cinematic art, generally speaking, is composed of two major elements: the narrator's ability to choose his focus and the film's reliance on visual rather than verbal information. This film excels in both. Not only is it purely visual, but the manner in which Chaplin places his camera highlights the characters and helps narrate this unornamented tale of parental love. It is highly emotional yet it never crosses the line to melodramatic. It is capable of producing a great deal of through to the viewer yet its subdued themes and messages are never overstated, they never become clear and evident, they sort of come out through the laughter and the tears. His mise-en-scene is powerful, yet exceedingly candid and forthright.</fullReview>

I dare to say that this is a silent movie that would like to people who does not like silent cinema.It proved to be highly influential on several films which combined, drama, comedy, reality and fantasy.I am not going to say more about it because I believe that little can be added about this movie except that is an obligation for everybody who is really interested in good cinema. Another one of my must sees.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shortened version best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Chaplin film I saw properly this is a magical film. Its a milestone in film history as the first example of a silent comedy feature integrating drama and pathos into the comedy. Jackie Coogan gives a great performance in the title role almost as a miniature Tramp which is probably what Charlie meant all along. The Kid and the tramp are two of a kind, just as Charlie was a child performer too, a clog dancer with the Eight Lancashire Lads. In many ways this is Chaplin's most personal work almost re-enacting episodes of his own poverty stricken childhood of the 1890s. The only disappointing sequence is the Tramp's dream of heaven which seems a bit irrelevant but does look pretty. The version I prefer is Chaplin's 52 minute reissue. I've seen the scenes cut from the 67 minute version on a Public Domain DVD, they don't really add anything to the film and are rather over-sentimental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chaplin finds abandoned Jackie Coogan and brings him up as his own in this 1921 silent comedy. There's less slapstick on display than usual but the requisite sentimentality never becomes as cloying as it does in some of Chaplin's later work.This is not to say there's no fun to be had - the boxing scene is particularly amusing - but it's the chemistry between Chaplin and Coogan that helps "The Kid" live up to its introduction: "a picture with a smile - perhaps a tear."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen one Buster Keaton silent comedy film, and enjoyed it immensely, so it was obvious I wanted to see the most famous British silent star working in America in a film. Basically The Woman, or Edna (Edna Purviance) comes out of the charity hospital, carrying her new born baby, which she places in a limousine with a pleading note, and she runs away to commit suicide, which she does not go through with. The limousine is stolen by two crooks who find the baby, and dump it in a garbage can, where he is found by passing Tramp, or Charlie (Sir Charlie Chaplin). The Tramp cares for the Kid, or John (Jackie Coogan, who grew up to be Uncle Fester in The Addams Family, 1960's TV show) for five years, and in that time Edna has become an opera star doing charity work for poor children, hoping to find her son. The Kid is The Tramp's partner in crime, breaking people's windows so that Charlie can put a new piece of glass in and get money from it. A doctor comes round to see the Kid when he is sick, and he is shocked to see the note left when he was a baby, he says he will get the Orphan Asylum men to come and get him. This note is passed to Edna, who realises they have found her little boy, and the Tramp manages to save the Kid before he gets to the Asylum. The Kid is taken away again, and after a quick dream involving angels and stuff, The Tramp wakes to be taken to Edna and the Kid where they all unite at her mansion. This is notable for being the first feature length comedy to combine comedy and drama, and only a fine director and star like Chaplin could do it. It is a film that makes you laugh at the moments of slapstick, and with the help of the music and the touching abandoned child story and some great music by Eric Rogers, it has emotion too, a great classic. Sir Charlie Chaplin was number 50 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 24 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, he was number 38 on The World's Greatest Actor, and he was number 67 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, The Tramp was number 38 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, and the film was number 99 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for when The Kid is taken away and then found again. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Kid is not Charlie Chaplins best movie by far, it is simply one of his good movies, one that is easily watchable and quite funny. Charlie Chaplin is easily in the top five directors of all time, and is one of the few that has never had a bad film, some are better than others but they never suck. The story is pretty good, not very original or developed but good all the same, and works well. The screenplay is excellent. The acting is amazing, Charlie Chaplin and Jack Coogan are truly phenomenal it is extremely hard to get emotions over without talking and they do it perfectly. The direction is even better than the acting and is truly great, one of the best directorial jobs ever. The visual effects are fair, but just genius for the time they even have people flying. Well worth a watch but not brilliant.</fullReview>

Charles Chaplin is excellent as the tramp, a man from the 19th Century who's out of place in the 20th Century. Jackie Coogan and Chaplin are wonderful when appearing together.

		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin, as the unnamed Tramp, finds an abandoned child and raises him as his own. Five years later, the child welfare organizations try to take the child (Jackie Coogan) away, while the child's mother (Edna Purviance) is still trying to find him.Chaplin's first feature is another masterpiece, and a real tearjerker. Some scenes are probably there for comic relief (such as the scene with the doctor), but some are almost sad, and Chaplin continues his streak of movies dignifying the underdog.On a side note, it's hard to believe that The Kid is played by the future Uncle Fester, but it's true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin Plays 'Spot the Easter Egg'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Easter Egg is a hidden joke or reference in a movie, and Chaplin put one in 'The Kid'. How many of you have seen the movie and wondered why Chaplin put in a title card referring to the doctor as 'The Country Doctor'? The entire movie takes place in a city, so why should the doctor be a country doctor? The answer is this: in 1909 D.W. Griffith made a movie called 'The Country Doctor', and Chaplin was making an ironic comparison between the doctors in the two films! Griffith's film is hard-hitting, unforgettable and a superb piece of cinematic artistry. It's sentimental theme would have appealed to Chaplin, and I'm sure he was right in thinking that his audience in would remember the movie, despite the fact that it was made twelve years earlier: once seen, never forgotten! So there you have Chaplin's Easter Egg in 'The Kid'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good natured, but not that funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chaplin's The Kid is more of a 'normal' movie that makes points towards wealth/poorness and is interesting more like a social study, instead of a slapstick comedy.The Kid, a brilliant Jackie Coogan, is abandoned by his then poor mother, who's idea it is to leave her son in the hands of some rich people. Instead, the car in which she puts the baby is stolen and The Kid is left abandoned yet again somewhere in the streets. The Tramp just happens to walk by and decides to play the father.The movie then takes a funny turn as 'father and son' pull some schemes to earn some money, until The Kid gets ill. Then he's taken to an orphanage, but he's 'rescued' by The Tramp.New problems arise when the real mother, who now is a famous actress, wants her son back and finds out about the true identity of The Kid she met some times. But thankfully, all ends well.Movie starts out by stating: 'a picture with a smile - and perhaps, a tear' but there aren't that many funny scenes in this Chaplin. Too bad as the movie is good natured and moving at times. Although a good movie overall, not the classic many people think (IMHO).6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I happen to love this movie, just as well as any other Chaplin films I have seen, The Kid portrayed Chaplin as a loving, caring guy, which is a change from his other films I have seen, such as The Circus (1928) which was a comedy. Chaplin is known for comedy but I loved how this film brought out his inner love for the child. This film used various "fast" parts, for example, when Chaplin and the kid are trying to get away from the police in his house. Another example is when Chaplin is running away from the man who wants to beat him up because the kid messed with his little brother. Chaplin used some medium close-ups and a lot of pan shots to show the whole view of the scene that was going on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin's tramp character takes care of a young, abandoned son.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So when I was coming up with what would be a good film to review first, I figured I might as well start with the oldest film that I have seen. That film would be "The Kid." The Kid is a 1921 film made by Charlie Chaplin. Do I really need to explain who Chaplin is? No, okay good. Chaplin directed and starred in this film about his famous "tramp" character taking care of a young child abandoned by his mother. And thus Chaplin's typical slapstick humor ensues. I know some people could argue that this film isn't edgy enough because it's just Chaplin running around being Charlie Chaplin. And although that's true I do sense a lot more heart in this film, especially during the opening scene, where I legitimately felt bad for the mother getting rid of her child. Life can be cruel sometimes. That being said because this is a Charlie Chaplin film, and to me the comedy and drama didn't blend that well. And keep in mind this is the only problem I have with the film. Because it's a Chaplin film and because it's about his tramp character, you sometimes can't tell the difference between comedy and drama. Like seriously your son being taken away now is not the time for comedy! Other than that I absolutely adored this film. And it looks like audience members did to. The acting was great, the score was beautiful, and the story is filled with plenty of heart. The Kid deserves the rating of a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most heartfelt Charlie Chaplin film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most heartfelt Charlie Chaplin film I've seen so far. As the opening title sequence says "A story with a laugh and perhaps a tear." Or something like that. Anyway it's about The Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) who finds a child (Jackie Coogan) from a mother unable to take care of him. At first Chaplin is unwilling to take on the responsibilities of a father but eventually adapts to Jackie Coogan and becomes a good father. Coogan even takes after Chaplin and does all the things that he does. We cut to 5 years later when everything seems to be going fine until a doctor (Henry Bergman) finds out about it and comes to take Coogan to a orphanage. But Chaplin fights back and he and Coogan are united. I have to say for a filmmaker who has mostly made a career of of slapstick this actually is a very mature film from Chaplin. It's the first time that he's taken a very grown up topic like parental responsibilities into one of his films. But it's not all completely serious, it's still pretty funny, and the trademark Chaplin slapstick is there. So basically this combines two things that Chaplin was obviously really good at. I say absolutely check this one out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Kid (1921) is an indisputable cinematic masterpiece, and one of the greatest films of all-time. The late, great Charlie Chaplin (star, writer, director, producer, editor, and composer of The Kid) reprises his role as The Tramp, who is on a morning stroll when he finds an abandoned baby. After several attempts to get rid of the child, the Tramp names him John and decides to keep him. Five years later, life is magnificent for the two, but an unfortunate series of events results in the Tramp having to fight off the authorities to save his kid. You will laugh one minute, then cry the next, I know I did, and I have never shed a tear during a film before. 10 out of 10 stars. This film is perfect, no other words to describe it.4/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Chapline- The Great man. Chaplie's movie- 'The Kid'(1921).Charlie Chapline's 'The Kid' made in 1921,and then the era of some silent movies emergence. The film director CharlieChapline here played an Unix role,like comedy,in his whole cine cultures.Here the opening title tag remember us the totality,as it is mentioned 'A picture with a smile-and perhaps,a tear.' Thewomen symbolized here as a motherhood,as she shown in ascertain charity hospital. Edna -the lady had her child,very cute,but almost disregarded, in the sense of getting off into his mother.There are some scenes we got different picturesque. The holistic,ritualistic cultures amidst the whole cine vision. Avery pleading marriage ceremony, child care,and some authoritative figures. Of course some central characters,then principal figures. The child titled in this films Jack Coogan. His mother illness once drop-ed him in limousine ,then few days later the baby had discovered in garbage can. The child almost was nourished by CharlieChapline. Once their intimacy became into a deep friendship.The scene after five years,when Edna was in a opera house,she became young-star. But could she able to find out her little boy. The mother denial,and repeatedly agreement dependence of authority think us how one child absence Medea Major effects onto mother.But the baby was almost seen as a fine,no problem was in his life. The baby was well trained by Charlie Chapline. There was such a compromise between them,when the baby broke some glasses and the Charlie was the maker. Absolutely there is NoDoz the whole depiction compromise it's poor stage of life,even they put their queries-'You know what street we worked today?'Charlie had here a great care taker of his child. The ending situation almost painful,and the baby almost had stolen by criminals,and Charlie had seen in a vision with a baby. He was making exchange from his hands to another,once the baby found his mother,and the seen was regarded as a happy-ending.The proprietor reads off a reward for the kid and takes him into-Edna.I specially grateful both the cinematographer and director,as they did'not hesitate to draw pictures here a complete comedy like. Beautiful sound symphony effects,camera works,evaporates the narrative comedy nature. Viewers don't gratify to Chapline's improvement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin's "The Kid" Chaplin's first feature length film is also his most whimsical. Showing the tramp in a somewhat darker vein (Smoking, engaging in petty theft etc) it is also the only one in which the character gets to be a father figure to an adorable little tyke played touchingly by Jackie Coogan. This film is not as accomplished or as revelatory as his later work ( "The Gold Rush", "The Circus" or his great masterpiece "City Lights" but it does demonstrate his matchless gift for physical humor. It features one his most accomplished bits of slapstick as the tramp fights a bully who is larger than he is. Chaplin when he started this film had just experienced the devastating loss of his infant son and the resultant end of his first marriage. I believe this film represented a sort of catharsis for the filmmaker as well as a sort of wish fulfillment, The film is unique in that at the end the tramp is reunited with his son and with the boys mother. Although not shown it is implied that they will all live happily ever after as a family unit. Thus the film marks the only time the tramp had a completely happy ending. Interestingly Chaplin, an aetheist films with religious imagery. It is interesting that this non religious man was one of the most spiritual of filmmakers. In the end the film is about redemption. The tramp is redeemed by his love for his son and the boys mother who abandons him at the beginning achieves her own redemption when she is reunited with her lost son. The film contains a charming dream sequence which although somewhat silly is full of pathos. Although not as good as Chaplin's later work his genius shines through and this is still a beautiful story about the healing power of love.</fullReview>

Chaplin's comic persona in his movies was just pure genius (of which makes me think of Clint Eastwood's persona in his movies, but more of the comedic type.) The casting for this movie has one thing in common with Cuaron's Gravity (2013) and that is that both movies have 2 actors in them.

Dreams are not limited to the same restrictions as reality; Chaplin uses the tramp's fantasy to present images in action that the audience previously could only imagine.

		<fullReview>I'm a Keaton fan. To me, Charlie Chaplin has always meant the forced, artificial sentimentality of City Lights, Modern Times, and The Great Dictator, or the unfunny (and borderline disturbing) Monsieur Verdoux.But I never saw any of Chaplin's earlier films, so I decided to give him another chance at the week-long showing of The Circus at New York's Film Forum, and I was surprised that I liked it. I was impressed that he made it through a movie without pouring on the corn syrup, so I decided to give The Kid a try (partly because I'd never seen a performance by Jackie Coogan -- Uncle Fester in the Addams Family doesn't count).And I was blown away. This film is a masterpiece, showing that the early Chaplin could combine slapstick comedy, drama, and an appropriate level of sentimentality to devastating effect. And Coogan was astonishing -- not the typical child-actor, but at least an equal partner with Chaplin in the picture, despite his age. It's a pity Chaplin later degenerated into sentimental crap, but if the treacle of his later films makes you gag, give this one a try. I can't believe I almost didn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin is a Tramp in this one who suddenly finds himself unexpectedly saddled with the unwanted responsibility of looking after an orphaned child. At first resistant to such an idea, the Tramp eventually comes to love and appreciate the child's happy presence in his life, an otherwise dark and dreary existence. However things get complicated when the child's birth mother comes looking for him.This enjoyable comedy romp also has lots of drama and delivers not only laughs but gut-wrenching sad moments and delightfully happy ones. This isn't just comedic silliness but deals with real world serious issues such as poverty demonstrating how love can surpass most any bounds and/or limitations. Jackie Coogan as the five-year old version of the kid is an absolute delight and plays off of Charlie and his Tramp character wonderfully. Just a terrific job from a young talent who never once becomes annoying or irritating to the viewing audience as so many children in films often seem to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In no particular order(As on 25th September 2008): (Rule:More than one parts/(Most) Trilogies count together as single subject.)Kid,The(1931)-A beautiful relationship between a man and a child. Just one name: Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin.M*A*S*H*(1969)-The Best Black/Dark Comedy ever. Nothing is Darker than ...a War. This movie has shown us the best use of loudspeakers: to amplify and broadcast moans Serpico(1973)-A Screaming movie.A mind-blowing performance by Al Pacino as an 'honest cop'.'GodFather' Series(1972-74)-The Third Part was good too.Dressed To Kill(1980)-First of my favorite two Murder Mysteries. One step better than 'Psycho'.'Terminator' Series(1984-91)-Schwarzennegger plus Cameron. Stunning Action/Performances/Script/visual/sound effects. Can't Believe it was made so long ago. The Terminator is chilling cold and so are cool his damn good one-liners.Cry Freedom(1987)-Perhaps Denzel Washington should have won his first Academy award in 1987-1988 itself and not been made to wait till 1989-1990 for Glory (pun intended).Good Morning Vietnam(1987)-A pacifist radio commentator in the middle of the Vietnam War. A true classic.Hannibal Lecter-Trilogy(1991-03)-A serial killer who is-brilliant, ruthless,romantic, with sharp olfactory nerves, on the run, cannibal and an outstanding psychiatrist-all at the same time. Lecter is chilling cold and so are cool his damn one-liners.Schindler's List(1993)-Violence is an inevitable part of life. But it should be meaningful and justifiable. Oskar Schindler in the middle of a meaningless massacre. May sound stereotyped but-The Best Movie Villain EVER-Amon Goeth.Se7en(1995)-Second of my favorite two Murder Mysteries. The villain is a genuine nightmare. May sound clichéd but-The Second Best Movie Villain EVER - only after Amon Goeth in 'Schindler's List'. He is chilling cold and so is cool his damn good justification at the climax. He is just plain good old EVIL served chilled. Just like he says: "When this is finished, it will seem surreal, but it will be a whole, crystalline reality. And, no one will be able to deny it, no matter how hard they try." Crimson Tide(1995)-The friction between a Boss and his junior is universal but why during the time when your enemy is about to/has fired a torpedo on your submarine? The Best Submarine Movie ever made. Better than the supposedly best-'Das Boot' which is pessimistic, unlike this.Life Is Beautiful(1997)-A Poetry as optimistic as possible, on a subject as pessimistic as possible:Gas Chambers Matrix-Trilogy(1999-2003)-The SECOND Best meaningful Sci-movie/s ever made.Sixth Sense, The(1999)-A grand Psychodrama. The SECOND best child performance ever witnessed by me -Osment.Cast Away(2000)- This movie is an epitome of acting and should have won the Best Actor Academy award and not Gladiator that year. Instead, Crowe should have won for 'L. A. Confidential(1997)' or 'A Beautiful Mind(2001)'. And instead of 'Training Day(2001)', Washington should have won for 'Malcolm X(1992)'. He can perform like 'Training Day'-in his sleep. And instead of 'Scent of a Woman(1992)', Pacino should have won for any of the six roles that he was nominated for before 'Scent'. OK, enough of backward speculation.Erin Brockovich(2000)-After 'Silence Of The Lambs', perhaps the only other Leading Female Role (Legal Assistant) and its excellent execution in terms of POWERFULNESS. During a tense situation Erin say to her boss here :"F*ck you Back". That was the epitome of the guts of her character in the movie. A real story.Unbreakable(2000)-The only other better Superhero movie before Nolan brought Batman. Just One Name: Samuel L. Jackson.Artificial Intelligence(2001)-"The Most Realistic Non-Exaggerated Practical Sci-Fi movie ever made". Not everybody's cup of tea except those who have done post-graduation in Artificial Intelligence (like me) or in Robotics. The BEST (child) performance ever by any (child) actor, Osment, especially considering the demands of the complex role.Beautiful Mind, A(2001)-The perfect tribute ever given to any Scientist by Hollywood. Perhaps Howard's next-'Angels and Demons(2009)' will match that as a tribute to Scientists/Science.Lord Of the Rings-Trilogy(2001-03)-The Best Epics ever expressed as a movie.Minority Report(2002)-The SECOND best along with the Matrix series in Sci-fi. In terms of practicality, it is second only to 'Artificial Intelligence(2001)'.Batman Begins(2005)-The most adored Realistic Superhero (without any superpowers) in the world. A movie that justifies the spirit of The Batman who is a hero for a mature man as well as a child. Nolan's Batman is not for children to watch. Actually, if correctly depicted (as Nolan did), the Batman never was.Munich(2005)-Who would not like to see all terrorists in the world nailed in a way similar to their own Modus Operandi? Dark Knight, The(2008)-A movie is only as good as the villain in it. A Posthumous Oscar is lying in wait for Heath Ledger for his Joker. Anyway, Slaughter is the best medicine.Finally that's it. Maybe upcoming Howard's 'Angels And Demons(2009)' and Cameron's 'Avataar(2009)' will modify my List from my PERSONAL TOP 25 of All Time to PERSONAL TOP 27 of All Time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Chaplin film I viewed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film touching in a way, the main reasons for this may have been that it was the first Charlie Chaplin film that I had viewed, and I saw it in a film class, which might have made me pay extra attention to the film. However, I am writing this comment quite a while after seeing the film, and since then I have seen a few other Chaplin films, and in my opinion, if you've seen one Chaplin film, you've seen them all. True, this film has a bit more touching feeling to it do to the "adult/child, father/son" relationship, but the overall reaction I had at the end of the film was the same as any other Chaplin film. Now maybe this is just do to the limitations of the silent film era, but I tend to group all Chaplin films into the same mold. So if you see this one, and really enjoy it, go ahead and check out his other films, because you should enjoy them also, just don't expect much new.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Moving Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having joined forces with First National Films, Charles Chaplin pulls off a moving story of pathos with 'The Kid'. He sends Jackie Coogan out breaking windows, and then walks by the property with his tools as a window fixer in order to generate revenue. It was a successful move into the era of making feature films rather than two reelers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flight of fancy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a dream sequence here that I want you to take a look at. We are in the slum from everyday life only now it has transformed into a heavenly eden, with everyone rejoicing and the Tramp strolling around on wings; innocence, joy, it's all as should be or was once, except the devil appears to trick the balance.It is a poignant entry into the world of Chaplin, why he works for some, why he doesn't for others, and it's telling that it happens at the moment of crisis, with the kid snatched from his foster dad and everything looking unsure, holding pain. So, this is the blueprint that is meant to explain the lowest ebb of the life energies; good and evil as clear entities, with a clear division between them and evil as external agent of some whimsical malevolence.The moral lesson that bubbles upwards from the internal vision is mostly trite; the forces of antagonism - on the superficial level they appear as stern moralists or law-makers, officers of a state attempting to control reality - as the agents of some faceless but institutionalized, hence deeply-rooted cruelty, and the benevolent hero on the other side restored into faith by a miraculous chain of events.So, good and evil arise and disappear in equally random, inexplicable flows and ebbs. Nothing governs here, and so the fact that good has the last word fails to convince. It's the magical flight of fancy, which is perhaps the whole point to begin with.But right down to the cosmological bone, I am a Buster Keaton person; the face is a stone mask there, wearily enduring whatever mockery the world or hapless fate throws at him as part of the wondrous slapstick of life. He's just not welcome home with the beautiful girl and the rosy future ahead of him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nowhere NEAR the standards of Chaplin's later feature films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen just about all of Chaplin's feature films and I would have to say that this is the worst of them, though it does have a rather high IMDb rating and quite a reputation. For me, the problem with the film is that it doesn't even come close to the polish and quality of films made just a few years later. THE GOLD RUSH (1925) and THE CIRCUS (1928) are masterpieces, as were his next few films. They managed to combine pathos, excellent story telling and comedy. THE KID, instead, was mostly a very superficial attempt to elicit tears and pathos--while having very little comedy and a paper-thin plot.On top of these complaints, I also was amazed how "out of left field" his whole dream sequence was. The flying angels and neat special effects did not in any way contribute to the plot and it served more as a distraction.So, in summary, I found the film not particularly enjoyable. See any of his other features (even the much earlier and very rough TILLIE'S PUNCTURED ROMANCE) or a feature by Harold Lloyd or perhaps Keaton. Historically, this is an important film because his other features and those of Keaton and Lloyd did follow THE KID, but unless you are watching this solely for historical interest, don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin's early childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you take a close look at the slum scenes where The Tramp lives with The Kid, they are very uncanny to the settings of Chaplin's early home in England in the 1994 film CHAPLIN. It is a fact that Chaplin did not have the best childhood growing up. Many of the moments in this film were taken out of Chaplin's life. THE KID is Chaplin's first attempt to use film as a vehicle to not only entertain the audience but to inform them as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferris Bueller's Day Off... For my grandpa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMDb Top 250: 159The Kid is the oldest film on the Top 250. It's nine years older than my grandpa, like Ferris' Day Off is nine years older than me. A 90 year old film... You should see it for that reason only. History. From a time of post world conflict, during poverty, not yet prosperity, and no one knew who Hitler was yet. A moment frozen in time.But this is a film review. This 'comedy' is about an orphan adopted by the Tramp, and their adventures. It starts off too heavily-handed, especially for such a short film. The joke don't start till 15 minutes in, which is too long.There are some bad cuts, taking into account the film's age. Flying Chaplin will seem to teleport in one really bad cut.Also, the music is not fitting at all. Tense music plays during sad scenes, quiet music plays during chases, it doesn't help the atmosphere. There are some good scenes though, like the fight and the window scam. There's just not enough of them. Also the end is too quick and abrupt. The end scene is less than a minute, with little resolution. A classic, but overrated. 7.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin sucking it hardcore again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was yet another dull and pointless Charlie Chaplin movie. His antics as usual consist of getting hit in the head, doing exaggerated pantomime (sp?), and running around and into various objects. The plot is pretty non-existent but it consists of Chaplin (playing a yet another bum) adopting this orphan kid and the antics that follow. This movie, like pretty much all of Chaplin's work comes off as dated and drags on due to inconsistent plotting. I don't think there is anything that funny about Chaplin's schtick. It might be funny for kids because it plays like a cartoon, but Buster Keaton is vastly superior. Keaton doesn't come off nearly as dated and his movies actually have more of a plot then some poor guy just bumming around. Also his slapstick is more elaborate, creative, and in my opinion memorable. Chaplin benefited heavily at the time because he represented a move away from the rigid Victorian standards of the previous decades, and was a character that a large working class country could identify with. However today he doesn't hold up too well especially when compared with Keaton. Nevertheless if you like this guy then you will probably dismiss what I'm saying and rent or buy (if you're so enclined) this movie. Hopefully though you won't see it, because it sucks. Rent something by Keaton or even the Marx Brothers (if you don't mind talkies) if you are in the mood for a really old comedy, you'll be glad you did.Zoopansick</fullReview>
