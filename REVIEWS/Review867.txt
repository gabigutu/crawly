		<shortDescription>What the hype is all about.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't see infomercials, yet have heard that Tony Robbins is a friend of a trusted friend, so that piqued my interest.Sadly, when I watch a film listed as a documentary,I'm expecting journalism,which means the film maker should check the material before release. this wasn't done for I'm not your Guru. If you're one of millions that haven't spent between 5 and 10 grand to fly, stay and attend these self help for the masses, you might be curious what the hype's all about. In this film, that'll be answered, with bias.As Tony Robbins admits, were in the age of entertainment. This film shows very select bits or clips carefully hand picked from one of Tony Robbins Date with Destiny self help events with approx 2500 attendees. It appears as if Tony had final approval for the finished product. If you're curious about what people pay so much for, this is the longest advertisement for his seminars you'll see.The worst part of the film for me, aside from the two hour advertisement to sell more seats to Tony's seminar/events, are the following offensive aspects: 1) I don't like someone teaching communication techniques that has the vocabulary of a 12-year old with a foul mouth; hear me out; which Tony justifies as part of the process- that it shocks the attendees into awareness. He says he deliberately breaks linguistic taboos. I totally disagree. When someone throws "f" bombs in every other sentence it tells me a) he should wear a tattoo across his forehead "no gentleman here": b)expletives repeated over and over and over reveals the speakers lack of educated intelligent communication skills to articulately express concepts that might be helpful. 2) A documentary in my opinion shouldn't serve as an advertisement for a product without thorough fact checking, it's a cheap way for Tony to recruit more attendees. The release on Netflix was timed with promotional give aways and contests that also should have fine print carefully examined. 3)I expect a critical journalistic expose of our cultures religious, self-help, pseudo-psych gurus, leaders, and charlatans. This film did none of the above. I was disappointed to see it as an extended length infomercial of Tony Robbins.(Anthony J. Mahavoric). If you're already a convert, you might like it. If you're already an Oprah fan you might like it. If your a person that feels these programs are run by unqualified, hacks that do as much damage or more than good, this won't help you learn anything new, except how the masses buy what they've been sold hook line and sinker...Baaah baaah baa little sheepykins...follow along now. If you are curious about what the masses are paying thousands of hard earned dollars for, this will give you a glimpse at the typical followers, the demographics of his attendees, and carefully chosen Tony Robbins flattering film bits or bytes. Spoiler Alert:I complain that the filmmakers didn't research Tony's life well enough, for this to be deemed a "Documentary". During the film Tony makes statements about his personal past that aren't substantiated or fact checked. I enjoy well made Documentary films, I watch to learn. I think the title/genre carries a responsibility for the filmmaker to do more and present beyond the singular support of promotion to the cause.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little too Familiar...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I note some fake reviewers using the same "Familiar" phrase. I have watched the scores on this movie plummet. Perhaps if he could persuade more of his mind controlled minions (the ones so 'familiar' with him and his 'work') to give more 100% reviews he could help stop the rating slide. You have to look hard to find a plot in what so many reviewers call a 2 hour long infomercial. I have seen much better infomercials and I think putting this 'movie' in that class does infomercial's a disservice.The damage and successes that come with his at times physically aggressive and often sleazy interventions are typical of coin flip amateur psychology. Fortunately for his ego he has surrounded himself with a team of free groupies (that he calls staff) who are so enamored by his pituitary tumor induced Giantism that any failed interventions are spun as successes and successes are held up as further proof of his divine glory.Obviously out of some sense of guilt it is explained on multiple occasions that his Tourette like obsession for the f word is actually a cunning use of "taboo words" to break peoples states. We can only blame the first audience that laughed when he dropped an accidental f bomb, and so it was that Tony learned that by saying it repeatedly he could get laughs and attention. He does and incredible job of squeezing the f word so many times into his sentences that all one can remember was, f*CK that was the f*King sh*t, that was so f**Ked up, I am now free of all the f**king bull s*it and ready to get f**king real, f*Uck yea!? ad Infinitum.On a positive note, the DJ who does these shows is amazing, rapidly finding the perfect music to match the touching moments when people bare their all, Jerry Springer style, in front of thousands of strangers. The atmosphere at these events is electrifying and is undoubtedly a great meet market for 30 somethings in need of a trans-formative life change.A word of warning for men, as we can see, Tony is top dog and will happily attempt to destroy your until now great relationship to get 5 minutes of Fellatio back stage with your now former girl. Its stunning how many pretty girls he chooses, seemingly at random from the audience for 'interventions'.Overall a must see 'movie' if you have two hours of your life you never want back or if you are considering canceling a Netflix subscription and just need one good reason, this is the movie for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WTF It's like church without religion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give it a 2 because it was entertaining at first. The suicidal guy lifted up, cool scene, entertaining. Tony saying the F word, shocking and funny. Learning that they paid $4,000 per ticket? Wow. The man can speak, he can make them cry, he can make you think positive but he can't possibly cure your issues. The woman made to break up on the phone with her boyfriend, lol funny and weird. talk about pressure. Hey it's those peoples money and they can spend it how they want but less than halfway through, it got old. Netflix brought me here. I don't think it was investigative enough or showed the bad side. Tony has been around forever though, he knows how to hustle that is for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can anyone take him serious? 1) saying f***k 23 billion times doesn't make you cool, it's like "oh wow, he says f***k all the time but still he is such a serious dude" no he is not. 2) you're not a "practical psychologist"!!! The reason why people go to therapy for a long time instead of 6 days is because change takes time. You don't heal those people, you are making yourself their guru, and that's why they think they are healed, Jesus Christ this dude is so frustrating. Any real psychologists out there rallying the streets against this??? 3) and by the way, the documentary is not really a documentary, because a documentary documents stuff and doesn't just show one side of the story... Gosh 4) also I like to suggest real therapy to Robbins himself. Starting to cry over a "clients" story is either unprofessional or staged. And also he says he is obsessed with other people's problems. Funny, every time someone tells him their problems, he relates them to his sad life story. I just don't believe anything he says!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tricked by the Netflix Logo...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Netflix Logo tricked me into watching this infomercial disguised as a documentary. From a movie making point of view it is flawless. Beautiful camera-work, perfect editing and intriguing soundtrack.As the director proved time and time again, he is a master of his art, e.g. the Metallica documentary. But this time he failed in separating his personal experience from his job as a documentary filmmaker and basically made a concert movie that serves as an advertisement for Mr. Robbins and his empire.The length of the documentary with almost 2 hours is also contributing to the fact that i fell like someone tried to brainwash me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was a big fan of Tony Robbins going in. Not so much after this. Thought this was going to shed more light on his life coaching, lessons for success. Instead it shows that Robbins fancies himself a pop psychologist (with none of the training). He even has a woman call her boyfriend in front of a room full of strangers and break up with him! How humiliating for the woman and the man. Who is Tony Robbins to be breaking up relationships after talking to someone for 2 minutes? No relationship is perfect. Jesus, he'd break up every relationship.He is also VERY profane. He rarely says a sentence without dropping an F bomb. It's over the top crude.I still like his message of choosing to be the kind of person you want to be, that the only thing you have control of are your own choices in life, etc. But that's not original. All of that goes back to a guy named Napolean Hill. You can see his stuff on YouTube. There's also a lot of feel-goody talk about "love". No, life isn't about love, it's about mental toughness and grit and focus on goals. That's what the better life coaches have taught, like Hill. Feeling all lovey dovey with everyone doesn't pay the bills.Tony is a salesman. He got into the self-help racket when he was a young guy, saw that people liked his act and that he could make a living doing it. That's fine, but now he's some kind of preachy, self-ordained cult leader, pretending he can solve all of your problems after talking to you for 2 minutes. No. 1, I don't care about his pseudo-psychological diagnoses of people; and No. 2, people's lives are more complicated than that. This reeks of a spectacle more than something meaningful to these people.So, overall, hugely disappointed in this documentary and in the man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give yourself the chance to experience what this man can give you...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets start by saying I AM A FAN of the techniques that Tony Robbins offers those willing to have a go at improving some aspect of their lives. For me these techniques work, I apply them everyday and they have kept me above water and focused on some of the more important things i wish to achieve in life. So am i biased when it comes to recommending this movie? Probably. What intrigues me is the resistance and cynicism with which some approach this man. We all have some areas in our lives where we know we are falling short. But how many of us ever actually spend the money, get on an airplane and go and try and figure these things out? Very few is my best guess. It is however, easier for those who choose to avoid such personal issues to dismiss or be critical of the approach. I don't love everything at a Tony Robbins event. In fact there are things that can sometimes be annoying (such as groupie fans that hog the microphone just to hear the sound of their own voice and perhaps feel relevant, or "Significant" as Tony might say).Why I recommend this movie is because of the 'taste' it provides of a man who is genuinely motivated by the desire to help others improve their lot in life whilst actually offering a few tools that work in the real world. Whether he makes money out of the process is irrelevant to me. In fact, he should charge for what he does as the audience member then has 'skin in the game' and might actually be more motivated to make the changes which ultimately will enhance their own lives....which is the whole point. Is $5000 really too much money? Is it? What if it rekindles your relationship with a cousin or a sibling who you haven't spoken to in several years? Is it to much money to help a couple who live together but have basically stopped communicating properly? Is that $5000 better spent on a holiday where you can continue the lack of communication but only this time with a cocktail in hand and a palm tree in the background? I know a fair few people who proudly assert their religious, spiritual or atheistic nobility who unfortunately have deeply fractured relationships with loved ones, are difficult to sit next to at work or who just don't seem to be very happy in life (sorry for judging). Personally, i challenge any of these people to attend one of Tony Robbin's seminars and not come away with just one life changing adjustment which in turn has an amplified effect on one's sense of well being or fulfillment.The emotions we see in the film are real. What the film unfortunately fails to convey is the length of time, the effort, energy with which one man on the stage manages to speak about how we can improve aspects of our lives for 12-14 hours straight (with only momentary breaks). What the film also fails to convey is how during this time - however cynical you may have been going into one of these events - that you too are still sitting there 10 hours in, with more energy and hope for the future than you had before you came in. Donna Karan said it best when she said that even though there are 3000 people in the room, for some reason it feels like he is just talking to you. The dialogue that he expertly encourages, is the one you ultimately end up having with yourself. Going to an immersive event is what forces this inner conversation...otherwise it's all too easy to just sit back and watch the next episode of Game of Thrones.If the film leaves you with a curiosity to see what the event is like in person, then it has served its purpose. The real value is in attending and participating, not sitting back in an arm chair and criticizing. I have read that some say it's just a glorified commercial for an event. This - in an of itself - doesn't meant that you wont derive something of immense value by actually attending. We all have areas in our lives where we can do better. I appreciate the way this man has chosen to make his money....it's certainly more admirable than the way I have chosen to make mine (or lack thereof!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>because it's an excellent piece of propaganda / advertising, not a documentary. No doubt, it was interesting to eavesdrop on one of Robbins' seminars and check out what the decades-long fuss is about. However, there is an astonishing lack of questions, offstage (or even backstage) interviews, critical questions raised, skeptical viewpoints (or even viewpoints of anyone other than Robbins, his sister/assistant, or his acolytes) or just simple commentary in this "documentary". There IS an alarming amount of emotionally manipulative music, scenes of people weeping, and fables and general statements offered by Robbins. In addition, for some odd reason, every featured participant seems to be a naturally or artificially hot woman with simple, selfish concerns (weight, sex life, etc.). The few true sufferers ( the suicidal dude, the abuse victim) do seem to be comforted by Robbins' platitudes (the abuse victim is $100,000 and a career richer by the very next day, the geeky suicidal guy appears to be comforted by a few minutes of Robbins growling at him). Throw in a vacuous hippie (mr. white dreads) and a weak guy dragged there by his gf (the "lion") and you've got the whole picture. Sure, these burnouts &amp; simpletons are free to throw away thousands on this cultish, empty self- help time waste and Robbins is free to exploit them. Both sides appear to be satisfied. Sometimes, placebo does work. That's not the issue here. The issue here is that this infomercial is being presented as a real documentary, which is laughable. Save it for Scientology.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After being an attendee to Tony's events for more than 6 years, I owe so much of my success, happiness, and my leadership skills whether at my business or my home to Mr. Robbins. This movie shows a glimpse of an amazing and life changing seminar called Date With Destiny. An event that if you decide to attend, you will never forget as long as you live. You will learn to love and have compassion for others, stop your selfishness and focus on others and contribute beyond yourself. You will learn how you are wired and the reason behind every thought and decision in your life. This movie has been masterfully filmed and Tony's art of intervention is displayed in such authentic way as I'm use to seeing him at every event that I have attended. His compassion and care shines through the movie. The only thing that I have to say to the viewers would be, watching this film should not give you any indications that you don't need to attend Date With Destiny because you know what the seminar is all about. The best comparison example would be the same as going to Disneyland vs. watching the tour of Disneyland on your TV set. If you have any desire to grow, to love and to receive love, to understand who you are and who you want to become and the legacy you want to leave behind, JUST GO. The best give you can give to yourself and everyone around you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much cursing I created an IMDb account to tell you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll never know precisely how this documentary/movie/whatever it is, plays out. There was so much profanity within the first few minutes, I sort of lost my desire to watch the rest. A WHOLE lot of F word variations, some S##T variations.. just, too much. I thought he was classier than that so it it surprised me a bit, but over a short time it just got kind of trashy and embarrassing. His audience would cuss too, no doubt brought on by his own cussing. Pretty disappointing really. I expected better. One or two curse words might have been OK, but this was so overdone I exited out and just had to write about it. Also within the short time I watched, Tony managed to talk about masturbation, and got one of the audience members to tell us that she taught her own daughter to tell her estranged father to go F%%K himself. High class I tell ya. I won't ever be tuning in to another one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved this movie! - Highly recommend!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved every minute of this movie. What is interesting is that this movie gives the viewer an inside look at the experience of attending one of Tony Robbins Seminars. It is interesting that Tony Robbins' attendees are suffering with severe emotional issues from unspeakable traumas and have suicidal tendencies, anxiety, depression, and other emotional issues. He gives them a safe place to express, gain acceptance, and heal. He also provides methods to empower people to take control of their emotional lives. For someone who has never attended one of Tony Robbins' seminars, it is not what you may expect or imagine.The movie also captures Tony Robbins behind the scenes and how he prepares for his seminars to get ready and keep his energy up, what drives him to do what he does, and what is the end goal and outcome for attending one of his seminars. I think people who have had breakthroughs with Tony Robbins' teachings will enjoy this movie tremendously. For those who have no experience or understanding of who Tony Robbins is, what he is about, and/or have never experienced the impact of Tony Robbins methods, this movie is an opportunity to get a glimpse into one of his seminars to see what happens to transform and change people's emotional well being and take control of their emotional lives. Highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drop the Jaded Skepticism. Review the film. Not the man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't trust the pointless, academic negativity you see here. Directed by Joe Berlinger of critical darling "Paradise Lost," "TONY ROBBINS: I AM NOT YOUR GURU" is a powerful piece of vérité about a most unconventional, controversial man. The na?ve negative reviews you see here for this film are simply bad because the reviewers are reviewing the "man," and not the film. There are pointless accusations that Robbins believes he is "cool," because he uses foul language. What, on earth, would that simplistic point, an inference, no less, mean in a documentary? Maybe he should have created a less complex portrait by cleaning up his language for the first- graders who saw this by accident. There are pointless slams about his lack of psychological education, when that entire industry?has anyone seen the mental gymnastics it took to explain the latest, wildly wrong- headed DSM by a psychiatric and psychological community who have expressed embarrassment about the discipline's lack of direction?and, again, this has nothing to do with the film. Neither does denying that some individual could experience cathartic change from the oddness of the Robbins event put under a microscope in this film?from its planners and facilitators to the bizarrely American come-from-nothing story of Robbins himself, a man who knows the significant abuse many of his followers have come to share (we are talking genuine abuse: murders; rapes; abandonment?not tiny things). The film, in a sense, poses a question can someone articulate, a genuine communicator, who has suffered and risen above enormous pain?is someone like that, even when that individual becomes a cottage industry onto himself?better than an academic who has only sat outside true pain and does his or her best to understand what that other, the patient who has endured the unspeakable, has gone through? For a strong portrait of a uniquely individual American, see it; if you're a die-hard skeptic?I double welcome you. But grade the film?not the man or what you believe is possible.</fullReview>

It was a beautiful piece of work showing the authenticity of this man in the way he works with people and in the way he approaches life. It gave me things to think about myself and even though it was just 2 hours I really got some of the energy and vibe going on there in that 6 day event.

It will teach you, it will challenge you, it will open you and it will leave you feeling love for those who are featured in the film, whose lives will be forever richer and more fulfilled. It also may have you question what you believe is 'right' or 'PC' in how people can change, and what we have been taught. You don't need to be a fan of Tony's or a current client to receive value from this film, what you do need to be is open to watching with open eyes and an open heart.

		<fullReview>This documentary films a six day event in which Tony Robbins works with attendees to change their life. Presumably, everyone has some different area they want to work on. Several times throughout the film, we see computer screens or paper lists mapping out the day. What I would have been most interested to see is the steps of the process, perhaps following some attendees through each piece. I imagine they felt that that would be giving away his product for free. Instead, we see several "interventions" in which Tony sometimes seems to speak truth, and sometimes tells people to do some confusing things. I wanted to believe that this man understands how we work and can get to the core of all our issues, but this film didn't make me believe that. It didn't disprove him either, just left me less interested in what he has to say. I've enjoyed his podcast appearances much more than what I thought was going to be a look into the inner workings of an effective process.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this brand new Netflix original doc the other night. I don't have a lot of background on motivational speaker and "guru" Tony Robbins, other than is little role as himself in the 2001 Farrelly bros. comedy, "Shallow Hal", although not sure that's really how he works?? o.O This movie covers a week-long seminar, which people from around the world attend and shell out a cool $5 grand! It also goes into a bit about who he is, his life growing up, interviews with him, and a lot of what led him to become the self-help "expert" he is now. I don't necessarily agree with his methods (don't disagree with them either, just not sure), but it was really powerful watching him do his stuff in this movie, and watching the attendees open up about their own lives and problems. I think for me the most powerful moment(s) involved the woman from the "children of god" sect. Wow! But regardless of what you think of Tony, I would definitely encourage giving this doc a watch sometime. Thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life Changing - A Must See!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary does a fantastic job of showing viewers the power behind the experience of this event (Date with Destiny). Tony Robbins has invested his entire life working to create breakthroughs for people (whether someone simply attending one of his events to professional athletes, multi-billion dollar entrepreneurs, and even Presidents of the US). What you'll find in this movie is a backstage look at how Tony takes all the skills &amp; techniques that he has used through the years to help businesses and executives experience real world financial breakthrough ... and uses those techniques to help individuals to experience the emotional, spiritual, physical, and psychological breakthroughs that they've been seeking for decades. I, too, was a skeptic at first. However, I attended this event and was blown away by the fact that Tony Robbins literally gives everything he's got to ensure participants truly have a transformative experience. He is in the room for 12+ hours and doesn't "cut corners" to make it easier for him. After attending, you will quickly find that what he brings to the event is far more than what you paid to attend. I would wager a bet that the majority (if not all) of the critics of this movie have never attended an event. I honor them &amp; respect where they're coming from ... as I mentioned, I was also skeptical at first. However, they are speaking from a limited perspective. It was Theodore Roosevelt who said "It's not the critic who counts; Not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could've done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena..." The critics of this film are good people, well-intended citizens who are just doing their best to look out for others' best interest. The only difference is ... they've not been in the arena and seen the countless lives changed who've attended Tony's events over the past couple of decades. Check out the film and make your own informed, intelligent decision. It is very moving and, if you're open to it, you may even find your heart tugged in a direction to see life from a new perspective. Many blessings &amp; happy viewing!</fullReview>

His never ending commitment for himself to personal growth is absolutely hands down the perfect opportunity for you if you have not or if you do not know about Tony.Of the many techniques he will teach you, one is how to role model someone you admire and turn years into months, months into days and days into minute creating absolute certainty in having a full and productive life, living on your terms.Tony has spent his life perfecting techniques that break patterns. In this very important documentary, you will get that this works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Have To Watch This!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is going to show you what Tony Robbins stands for and how he helps change people's lives.Some of the scenes are very moving and this movie helps you feel what they are feeling when you are watching it. Maybe not all that they are feeling, but it is a movie that has to be be watched.If you want to know what goes on during his events and a little bit of what happens behind the scenes, or even how he moves people. Then this movie is for you.Because most people don't realize what he teaches or even what he does, but most people have heard about him. Now you get to see a little bit of what goes on during these events and how people feel when they are going through them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Want more out of life?? MUST Watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If your most recent memory of Tony Robbins, is the young, enthusiastic man doing infomercials and selling Personal Power tapes? Then you're out of date! Tony is the gold standard in interrupting limiting belief patterns, finding your purpose, redesigning your values, repairing relationships and creating lasting change in your life. If there's a tiny piece inside of you that is unfulfilled with your life, your work, your relationships, or? you just want to be the best you can be... then watch this tonight! Having attended the event myself, Joel did an INCREDIBLE job of representing a 6 day event in only 2 hours!! The film maintains the integrity of the experience, and brilliantly puts your butt in a front row seat. Interestingly enough, it took Joel 2 years to convince Tony to let him film the event ... and this is NOT a TR promo piece. This is an inside look at a private event that makes a difference in people's lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plays like a concert movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not too familiar with Tony Robbins before seeing this movie. Personally, I found him shallow and superficial, turning psychotherapy into a simple-minded show while making some quick money out of it (I do get the idea that it is not just about the money for him though). I think the participants who are seriously seeking help would be better off with a good professional therapist (that is, if you can find one).That said, this is a nice recording of a Tony Robbins "event". It plays out kind of like a concert movie: you get an idea of what is happening out there plus some backstage comments. If you do like the band, good for you. If you do not like the band, well, you still get an idea of what it is about plus some touching moments. At worst, it might look like a Tony Robbins commercial, but it is what it is: recording of an event.</fullReview>
