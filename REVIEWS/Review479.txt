		<shortDescription>Divergent... Insurgent... Washing Detergent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The worst of the Divergent series to date, in Allegiant we finally see what lies beyond the walls which encircle Chicago. Answer: 120 minutes of utter tedium. We follow our protagonists- doe-eyed Tris and perpetually dull Four- through the wastelands and into the hands of sinisterly-titled Bureau of Genetic Welfare, led by Jeff Daniels' character David.What follows is multiple occasions of Tris being called up to David's office for meetings- like an episode of The Apprentice- but instead of getting fired she exchanges some of the dullest exposition dialogue heard in the cinema so far this year. The set of David's office is so over-designed and green-screened to the point that it just became a distraction.There are large swathes of the film's running time where nothing seems to happen, no surprise considering this is the first of two parts of what is one book. The decision to split the final novel into two is for reasons which can really only be described as monetary, a gamble which appears not to have paid off judging by the box office takings. Miles Teller's character attempts to inject some comic relief into the proceedings but even his jokes fall flat. An absolutely turgid affair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film with damaged genes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shailene Woodley is one of my favourite young actresses. Ever since she did that dramatic 'crying-underwater' scene in "The Descendents" she's been someone to watch. And, while it was another "Hunger Games" wannabe ? "Divergent" was a good story, well acted and with good visual effects.Unfortunately the series has progressively gone downhill: "Insurgent" was poor but coherent; and now "Allegiant" is both poor and mind-numbing.After the revelations at the end of "Insurgent" Tris (Shailene Woodley), Four (Theo James), Christina (Zoë Kravitz), Peter (Miles Teller), Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and Tori (Maggie Q) defy Chicago leader Evelyn (Naomi Watts) and make a dash for escape beyond the Chicago walls to find those living beyond in the alleged wilderness. There they meet 'Pure' leader David (the ever-busy Jeff Daniels) and his acolytes. According to David, Tris is key to the world's recovery. But can he be trusted? It is telling that every screenwriter in this series has been different, and this time Noah Oppenheim (from the similar "Maze Runner") with Adam Cooper and Bill Collage (from "Exodus: God and Kings") have the pen, but do little positive with it. Much of the dialogue clunks onto the ground much like the leaden transports featured in the film. And some of the plot points are obvious beyond belief. No real spoilers here, but when one of the lead characters gets shot it was so blindingly obvious that it was about to happen that I audibly groaned with disbelief that the writers had so little respect for the audience.As another example of bone-headed writing a nerve gas used in the film is so much heavier than air that it sits on the floor for minutes at a time. How will they ever escape in Chicago? (Erm ? climb up to a second floor perhaps?). Presumably everyone was OK since they only got a small dose? so were just 'a bit' brain damaged? (More Trump voters ready for action).The special effects are pretty ropey in places. Some of the green screen work (an early shot with Miles Teller in particular) is really poor. Just about nothing looks real.The director is Robert Schwentke ("Insurgent"; "Flightplan"; "The Time Traveller's Wife") but this doesn't extend his reputation (apart from presumably with the studios, since poor as it is it'll no doubt still attract an audience).Shailene Woodley does herself credit with the material she has and has chemistry with the hunk of the piece, Oxford-born Theo James. But she is far better than this stuff. Unfortunately, this series doesn't end as a trilogy: she will be back again as Tris is "Ascendent" in 2017. But before then she has a starring role in Oliver Stone's Edward Snowden biopic, so hopefully can prove herself there.(Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

		<shortDescription>Yet Another Clichéd and Predictable Young Adult Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The age of the young adult franchises are upon us now more than ever with yet another entry in the 'Divergent' series being released. Maybe it's just me, but I'm growing tired of weak films filled with same old clichés and unoriginal story lines based around the genre of 'young adult sci-fi'. Sure, a lot of people can say the same thing about the overabundance of superhero films, but there's a clear difference in quality. But the bottom line is that I'm just not the audience for these films.Allegiant directly follows the events from Insurgent after the demise of Kate Winslet's Jeanine character. Naomi Watts reprises her role as Evelyn and pretty much follows the same unfortunate path that Jeanine did as leader of the dystopian Chicago. Four and Tris, played by Shailene Woodley, lead a small group of survivors into the outside world which was teased at the end of the last film. From there, every cliché you can possibly think of, follows. The characters who you think will die, die. The people who you think will be good or bad, end up being good or bad. There is nothing surprising or noteworthy about the film's plot.The positives do however come from some of the performances. Theo James continues to be a pleasant surprise and does as much as he can with a weak script. He has a definite future in the film business. Woodley is solid as she usually is and so is Jeff Daniels and Naomi Watts. The problem is that the film around them is average at best. The pacing is painfully slow at times and nothing really happens until the final 20 minutes. Of course, it's set up for an unnecessary and unplanned 4th film purely for the reasons of making money, because there could have easily been an ending here. Overall, a weak script and horrible green screen moments end up making a disappointing third entry in the series.+Music+Performances from James and others-Green screen moments-Pacing-Nothing original and full of clichés4.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ridiculous nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so the first movie ("Divergent"), despite what the people who read the books say, was basically another soap opera - slash - action movie directed at what I am guessing teen audience. Just like Mockingjay, just like Maze Runner. But despite the absolute soap overload in some parts at least the plots were somewhat original though they all had that tell-tale post-apocalyptic-dystopic- 1984ish plot commonality, but all of them kinda "did okay" at least in each own way and at least managed to have SOME major and original plot differences that made them over all okay and entertaining to watch.But this movie... oh boy. Flying "cars", even more conspiracy nonsense, small flying discs that create placenta (or was it "plasma"? lol) bubbles around people, small spheres that create a forcefield/illusion/barrier/something, more evil manipulative characters that make no sense, new evil characters, new absurdities of human behavior.... and genetic manipulation? Genetic projects? Memory wiping gas-serum-something? Or how about this: poisonous wasteland covered in radioactive puddles and 100% scorched earth and not a single vegetable left alive... but guess what, people live there, in tents and stuff. Probably doing pow-wows to entertain each other or some other nonsense.I am at a loss. The plot of the movie Vs the actors and the way it was filmed is like... like... eating a pancake, a pretty good one, but there's just one pancake and the rest is a bucket of cream, chocolate, syrup, candy canes, cake sprinkles and whatever else dumped on it. OK another analogy: imagine if a hyperactive 6 year old had to write the plot of all Star Wars movies. Sure there would be action by the boatloads, but the plot would make absolutely no sense. A total overdose of hyped up nonsense, and this is exactly what this movie is. Literally 30 mins into the movie the plot just went supersonic and went in one eye and out the other. Absolute garbage that made no sense at all. Plus the plot now has like 100 different cliffhangers to hang on to, so they'll be milking this movie until the next coming of Christ or until the audiences are just numbed by the continuous river of nonsense that this movie is.Oh and last thing - IMDb mods, better wake up and do your job. Some of the reviews here are so flat, so like a rant a used car salesman would make that they are obviously paid/fake and are not honest... like not at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not blame anyone who has given up hope with this franchise and passed on checking out this. I went because I am Sheilene Woodley's number one fan and supporter (check my reviews of her films for proof on that), so anything she does I will see, included this franchise which for me, in the first two entries, proved to be a mix of some few good elements, Woodley's performance being center on that, with some bad filmaking overall and a story that was always so bad it made me laugh.That element is partially back, once again through the entirety of the duration of the film almost nothing makes sense. The story is just so bol*ocks I am inclined to laugh at it. Yet this time around I didn't even manage to do that. It just makes no sense whatsoever, nothing that is going on on screen is ever motivated, but even worse, it doesn't fit with the other two films and just emerges as an absolute mess.Even Shailene Woodley who in the past managed to elevate the non sense that was going around her, with the help of Theo James' charisma, can't do anything with this material. She isn't bad in anyway, it would be impossible for her, but no one on screen manages to make heads or toes of their character, simply because their isn't anything to be understood, it is just a screenplay that mixes random exposition to ever changing motivations because the story requires it. Even the cinematography, for the most part, is as dull as it can be: basic coverage of dialogue scenes and where it tries to do something new like some good tracking shots it fails miserably because they look terrible.What remains good is the imagery that the series has offered throughout, don't misunderstand me: for the major part the CGI is mediocre and touches bad in many points, but the art concepts and the visual ideas still work very well and provide that minimum flare that mixed to some laughing at the story and Miles Teller not giving a sh*t for the third time, which I must admit is the best part of the film, manages to get you through the film indifferently.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you are a true fan of the series, the film in itself is boring and uninspired with yet another laughable ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inexplicably bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first two installments in this series were if nothing else enjoyable. The first one, in fact, was well acted and directed, with a satisfying plot and held its own. The second which did have a wayward plot and a messy script was still salvaged by the acting and the cgi-fuelled set pieces which were cool to look at. But this movie fails in every possible aspect. Firstly, let's consider the acting, Shailene Woodley who was the most stellar aspect of the previous movies, is extremely dull and lacklustre. She seemed completely disinterested throughout the movie. The script didn't require her to do anything more than recite a handful of lines but she did engage the screen only periodically. Her character who is shown to be strong and defiant previously, turns into this mute easily-manipulated by stander who does very little in this installment. Theo James as Four, however, I felt performed decently well with what he was given, even if he still grumbles most of his lines. Jeff Daniels and Naomi Watts arguably manage to fit the bill of their generic and plain characters. The CGI, which has been a plus point of this series so far, is squandered in this one, with the surrounding green scene being glaringly visible in several scenes. From a visual concept and set piece point of view, something that Insurgent did manage to execute well, this one once again falls short. With the acting already poor, we do not even have some eye candy visuals to enjoy. Now, the plot. Convoluted and poorly unraveled. Nothing seems to make sense. Character motivations are inconsistent with previous installments and seem to change with the requirement of the script. Whatever exposition is provided is achingly plain and vague spurring endless questions about a variety of plot points, so much so that they threaten to put whatever sense the preceding movies made in much jeopardy. SPOILERS AHEAD- Here are some questions and oddities with the regard to both certain nagging minutia and also larger plot points which completely spoil the overall experience of the movie. The wall climbing scene early on in the movie, which while having been the best actions sequence, was still annoying. Tris is running from the wall to the generator which is powering the fence/wall, three vehicles full of men are shooting at her but their aim as required, is pathetic. Four, who unlike Tris, isn't even running, is also untouched. Soon after, atop the wall, the group decides to begin celebrating their victory prematurely with only Tori returning fire and staying rooted in the gravity of the moment, and as inevitable she gets shot and dies. Why? Why would these characters behave SO very oblivious to the danger at hand. Having been 'rescued' by the Bureau of Genetic Welfare, they're shown the poorly rendered video clip explaining 200 hundred years worth of history. So, genetic mutation in humans was introduced and people were divided on this and then they fought and destroyed most of the world? Some select pure individuals formed the Bureau and the rest died/or were placed in the Chicago experiment to gauge if they were 'curable'? For 200 years? They ran a massive experiment to find if a pure human was possible from among the 'damaged' individuals? From what I see, the life that the damaged lived inside the wall was a much more civilized and peaceful society until Tris wreaked havoc in the first movie, while outside the wall, people seem to be living in a wasteland. So I'm supposed to understand that the 'pure' people set up a massive civilized city for the 'damaged' while themselves living in a barren landscape fighting people at the fringe??? Even the Providence was a tiny area of fairly futuristic looking infrastructure. It is later revealed that David wants funding for his project. Funding? Funding for? For reinstating the factions by wiping the minds of the people of the city? But he did just that without having received funding from the providence, didn't he?? So was it funding for renovation of his own floating castle home at the Bureau? And back in Chicago, Joana sees that Evelyn is killing people that worked for Jeanine, so she, the Wise one, decides it is time to divide whatever people are left, in half and have them fight each other to the death?? And then that gas. That gas which is supposed to be inhaled but is so heavy that it harmlessly settles down at feet level, giving ample time for the warring people to run up a flight of stairs. Evelyn gets shot by Peter in the back/leg, but clearly doesn't seem to have any injury when shown from the back. Tris shooting the ventilation system through the wall absolutely the weakest resolution to the conflict. And magically, the gas recedes quickly and all those people who had previously been fighting each other to the death, come out of the buildings all smiles and happy, some even smiling and pointing at God knows what. So absurd. Overall a very disappointing and frustrating mess that reeks of ignorance on the part of the filmmakers who seem to have concluded that they can string up any random events in a dystopian setting amidst a bunch of teenagers aided by mediocre visual effects and some set pieces. Hopefully, with the change of director, the final movie will be better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Long and Boring Franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Divergent Series: Allegiant" is another part of this too long and boring franchise. The saga of Tris and Four and their friends is repetitive and predictable, using clichés and special effects. The screenplay is poor and stupid. For example, David is capable to close doors and remotely controls the city; why does he need someone to release the gas in Chicago? The worst is that the story does not end and there will be another sequel to gross more money for the producers. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): "A Série Divergente: Convergente" ("The Divergent Series: convergent")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read all of the books because of how curious I was to see if the movies matched up. What I really enjoy in an adaptation movie is how it brings a story to life; Allegiant takes the story which was quite interesting, and throws the story line in pieces. The suspense and anticipation that I experienced with the previous two films and stories is not the same as with Allegiant. Besides the story line taking a tangent from its original story, the revised story line is bland and predictable. I do not have high expectations for the sequel if they continue to deviate from the original story so drastically. I really hope that I will be proved wrong, but I am thoroughly disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For this one, I will not need many words to write a review. This one is plainly stupid. Unnatural human behavior, unnatural dialogues, plot filled with holes like a good Dutch cheese! Just one example: Director controls shutting of doors in an underground technical tunnels of the distant city, yet he needs to infiltrate a city with a person to talk one of the leaders into pushing a button to get a gas flowing into the city! Would be a good idea to have that function also on a remote control, wouldn't it? Or? if everyone will forget everything, why not fly a freaking squadron into the city and have this button pushed? A separate word of praise to movie industry censors! Killing where blood is seen ? R rated and kids can't watch it. Killing when no blood is seen ? kids are safe to watch. How could one make it all be more ridiculous? The guys gets a headshot from 1 inch distance, falls dead, but no drop of blood to be seen anywhere? Come on guys, someone needs to get real?.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what I was Expecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to go watch this movie series just to justify the mixed ratings I read.Well, I have to say, In My Opinion, there was more going on in this movie that was unrealistic and slow than favorable / enjoyable moments.So, personally, I won't hold fire against the comments that rated this movie below a 7. I actually would say they are right on target.I have to say movie quality has certainly went down over the last 6 yrs. I'm beginning to believe many directors and movie industries are expecting movie goers will watch anything with engaging previews to suck us in and torture us with the rest of the movie being BAD.I am a sci-fi fantasy type movie lover, loving the tech and all that stuff, however, there is a threshold as to what I enjoy watching when it comes to this type of movie genre and this movie just don't quite get there for me. Divergent followers or not, this movie fails for the length of time and plot it delivers to be enjoyable.As stated before, I don't believe in rating movies terribly low, so I give this movie series a generous 6 without going into more details.Thanks</fullReview>

Some of the green screen work is really bad. Nothing looks real enough. It departed from the book in the previous movies but it was almost acceptable.. this is awful.It may not be terrible for some people but i'm sure that fans of the book are not going to like it. Even those wishing to change the book's finale.I have to say the acting work is not that bad. They do what they can with what they have. Tho I'm not a huge fan of Shailene Woodley or Theo James, they are not bad actors. So they managed to go through the movie unscathed.. It's too bad they have changed it that much. The relationship between the characters has so much more to work on in the third part of the book than in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Significant Improvement on the last Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of this franchise, but the first movie was reasonably solid and entertaining. The second was hugely disappointing and actually fairly boring.As for Allegiant, I think they've somewhat rescued the franchise with this film. It answered a lot of questions and moved the story on. We find out the truth about what a Divergent actually is and the truth about what is the other side of the wall. There is some good action in the movie and it's still feels very much a twilight, hunger games style teen movie. The acting is fairly average for what you would expect.The overriding feeling I got though is how on earth have they got 4 movies out of this franchise? We haven't come a long way in the story so far yet we've sat through 6 hours of movie time. I don't therefore have high hopes for the 4th and (hopefully) final installment. Large sections of all 3 movies could have been cut out and merged and we could have seen 2 really good 2 hours movies. Instead it will go down as another disappointing franchise spread needlessly over 4 movies. Money...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only bit of joy I divulged from this film was a slight huff of a laugh at Peter's line, (portrayed by Miles Teller), remarking on the weird showers. And I think that was only due to the fact that the movie had been so consistently horrendous up to that point, any scripted line approaching tolerable was a shock to the system. Honestly, an embarrassing ordeal not just for the author of a much better book series than these movies seems to paint them as, but for a very talented cast of actors as well. One sidenote: Jeff Daniels' role as the not-so-secretly-self-serving-CEO-with- corrupt-intentions is getting quite old at this point - see Looper, Steve Jobs, The Martian (to an extent), Allegiant, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh Boy, Another Snoozer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel insulted by the Divergent movies. Why? I'll tell you. When I was in high school, I desperately wanted to gain more friends and feel like I belong. It was unfortunate that I had to come across these feelings just as Facebook had taken over. This is where Harry Potter comes into play. I saw myself as Harry, rejected, in need of loved ones, and eventually finding a place where he is valued for who he is. So it was convenient timing that the franchise was at its peak in my teen years, the last of the movies premiering the same summer I graduated high school. But does this Divergent book series live up to reflecting those years the right way? I guess so. Does the movie series live up to my expectations? No way.I get it, Tris is a hard worker who is trying to figure out where she belongs. I've been there before along with every other teen. I guess Divergent stands out from other young adult novels by how it criticizes humanity and exposure therapy. Then again, these details ought to actually have some serious attention paid to them while bringing the books onto the screen. The most boring of all of them being Allegiant.As far as the continuation of the series goes, it's essentially Tris leading her friends out of Chicago, over the wall separating them from the outside, and meeting with the Bureau of Genetic Warfare, the outside organization that found ways to control human genetics. They have also found ways to control the people camping outside their city by kidnapping and erasing the memories of the children. This reality is not bad, I just don't care about this world in the same way I did about Hogwarts.This movie wouldn't have sucked if you enjoy listening to painfully obvious messages like, "is it better to kill a healthy child or a sick old man?" Or, "people are sheep. They need a shepherd, lest they be slaughtered." Or, "Leaders make tough decisions to protect their people." Now look, they're all well-meaning philosophical statements, but hasn't The Hunger Games already done all this slightly better?Not to mention there's so much lazy exposition through computers and characters saying their exact feelings in the most obvious way. Seriously, this series is 4% emotion and 96% exposition.That's really one of the only pluses of this teen franchise wannabee. The most excruciating part of this movie series, especially this one, is the acting. Although all the actors still look the part, their performances will stab you in the ears and eyes because of their absolute disinterest. All they do is put on one clueless facial expression, leading actress Shailene Woodley having the worst case of it. Her pale face turns intentionally spectacular moments into absolutely hollow wastes of screen time, she won't even rattle after hearing her life is on the line. Then there is of course more of her mega awkward romance with Theo James, two who you can tell she doesn't really like in real life. She barely even looks him in the eye.The pain doesn't stop there though. The Whiplash star Miles Teller gives the most inexcusably annoying performance in the series. I can't put my finger on as to why, but every time the kid opens his mouth, I just want to strangle his neck and yell in his face, "SHUT UP!"At least the new villain played by Jeff Daniels acts different from the rest, as he miraculously overplays the part, yet at the same time underplays it.These dreadful performances make me seriously plead, "why Lionsgate, why? Why get Robert Schwentke to direct?" He showed no appreciation to what he was doing with the story's message of union within people. He rather follows the directing advice of George Lucas by telling his actors, "faster and more intense." Except he took faster as in "let's get this take done faster" and more intense as in "we should more intensely get our scenes filmed today so we can premiere this movie in six months as scheduled!"So, what's going to happen next? Will Lionsgate change the controversial ending of the book? I don't think there's any reason to worry, as reading the books would prove more valuable than seeing these half-baked movies. The books bring some meaningful messages about how our thoughts and feelings create more safety than if we were without them, and how we ought to be unified in our diversities, not segregated by categories. So say no to cliques. We are one as a nation. While Harry Potter did add to my life as a teen by making me feel like I belong in a society of segregation, the Divergent book series also do a satisfactory job at teaching our current youth to ignore the government's declarations on segregation. Yet the movies, Allegiant in particular, insults Veronica Roth's thoughts on America. So I won't be watching this on Blu-ray, and neither will you.Overall Grade: D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't bore you with another detailed review of "Allegiant" It's been well covered already but I will say that if you are a fan of the books... No need to freak out! Was "Allegiant" the movie perfect? No. Not by a long shot. It obliterated and basically stripped many of the complex and more interesting layers that brought the characters body and soul in the book. We were left with a very skeletal, fractured and less interesting story. The movie did veer from the original work quite a bit but the substance of the story was still there...it wasn't lost. We still get the point of what the purpose of the experiment cities were designed for. We get the struggle for power and the fight for humanity to fight for its survival against what seems like insurmountable odds. We get the theme of loyalty and family, ambition and greed vs sacrifice and selflessness. All the elements are there.Was I annoyed that this movie is part 1 of 2? Not really. I look forward to seeing how the writers and director will adjust the story. Many fans were unhappy with the ending of the book anyway and would like to see it fixed. We'll have to wait and see if the powers that be stick to Veronica Roth's vision or create an alternate. But really, there is no need to feel disappointed or distraught. It is after all an adaptation! Theo James as Four was awesome, though I felt his character wasn't given much substance in this flick, still he was fun to watch. Bill Skarsgard who played Matthew was a nice surprise. I loved every scene he was in and Miles Teller stole the show as the always self-serving jerk, Peter. We didn't get much from Zoe Kravitz and Maggie Q was great as Tori. Shailene Woodley was OK. She could only work with what she was given. But the fellas carried this movie from beginning to end. Even Jeff Daniels had his moments.Overall, I thought it was entertaining. Not perfect but I give it a pass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry all you who hated it but I actually liked this and thought it was one of the best in the series.Shailene Woodley has grown in this role and along with the perfectly cast Theo James they portrayed this well.The special effects are better than the previous movies and the action moved at a good pace. I for one wasn't bored and comparing it to the awful Hunger games Mockingjay part 2 which really did send me to sleep, I thought Allegiant was very good.Maybe it helps that I have never read the books because many of those that didn't like this movie had read them and I know movies of books are often disappointing.Was a shame Maggie Q got killed off so early and I think she was underused in this movie. I would love to see her reprise Nikita maybe in a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am angry... If they were going to divide the movie, they didn't have to do this... They say they 'covered the story' in this movie, they basically skipped a whole plot... For example, in the book Nita does hate David, but she actually Tries to destroy the Bureau by blowing up a part of it as a distraction (which basically kills Uriah, the guy's not even in the movie to begin with) then trying to release this death serum, Tris stops them of course, and a bunch of other stuff happens... Only then does David try to 'reset' Chicago... And Tris is supposed to die in the process of saving the dam city, then there's this bit at the end involving Evelyn, if they were going to make a series they could've used that... There's just so much stuff wrong with this movie, the most annoying of course are the small but plentiful errors, like never seeing Tori's brother on the other side of the wall, that happens in the book....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So... Without spoiling the book OR this movie; the movie sucked, the book did not. There is way, way more sci-fi then necessary, and BAD sci-fi that is! It's really poorly done, bad CGI and stuff. And where the story from the books was at times confusing, this was downright dumb and mad no sense. The biggest book-moments were cut out, probably to make room for the bad CGI... I kind of expected it to be bad, 'cause the 2nd one wasn't that good either. It also seems the actors get less and less convincing with each movie. Contrary to the Hunger Games (that also differed from the books somewhat, but functional imho), these don't live up to the books at all. If you read them, don't watch the movies. If you've watched the movies but started liking them less and less, read the books instead! They're worth it!</fullReview>

A transport capsule that can't be controlled remotely by an organization with advanced technology? A gas that is released but falls to the ground? What kind of gas is that? A gas with that goal should flow in the air and slowly cover the area before falling down. And why release it so slowly? It should be pressurized to be let out in seconds! And a room, and corridors to that room, that isn't constantly filled with a gas that will immobilize anyone who enters? And the protection to the central valve system so poor that a few shots breaks down the wall? And control of remote discovery modules even when she is a known criminal? PLEASE!!!I give it 3 stars because the actors are doing a good job with a lousy script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two hours after the movie ended, and I'm still shaking my head. Disgusted. Seems writers, director and producer DID NOT READ THE BOOK. I do not expect a movie to follow the book exactly, but the other 2 movies mostly did. The 3rd movie had very little to do with the first two. No point to the changes, it did not make the story more powerful, it actually neutered it. I can't see how Veronica Roth could have been happy with the Allegiant movie. Poor Naomi Watts, her lines were so horrible. Her Evelyn was just whinny. Miles Teller had nothing to do. The world they created in the movie, the airport and the fringe, not at all accurate. Again, the changes were pointless. If you are a fan of the Divergent Trilogy, do not bother with this movie.</fullReview>

The girl run to stop the gas but now she can communicate with the guy again (that's a lot of memory).- When they sucked out the orange gas, people were laughing (happy?). I think they should resume fighting? - Four's mother was shot in the leg but moments later she was walking up the stairs and standing on the roof like a champ with her enemy!- The old bad guy is watching them inside a bubble but then standing behind them like virtual reality.

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to love this movie, but it was downright disappointing. If you haven't read the books, I'm sure you will enjoy this movie more. The director basically changed the whole storyline. I expected changes, but not this much. They took away many scenes from the book and added many others that were not. Im glad he will not be directing the final movie "Ascendant". "Allegiant" has good action sequences, most of which did not happen in the book. For example, the scene where they left the city and were being chased by Edgar, the scene where Tobias was in the aircraft and assumed he was heading back to the city, the scene where Tobias was being trained by Nita etc. One big action sequence they could have left in the movie, was the one where Nita tried breaking in to get something and Uriah got severely injured. There were lots of humor throughout thanks to what they added to Peter's character. (Peter was not meant to be the 'funny guy' in the book) They could have left in scenes like Zeke and Tobias breaking Caleb out of prison. Tobias and Zeke had some interesting dialogue in that scene. (in the book) Also the exchange between Tobias and Peter. I feel that in the movie, his (Tobias) character was really boring. Characters like Matthew and Nita were extremely different from the books. In the movie, Matthew is this secretary type character and Nita became a "soldier". Peter also turned good in the book, not helping David as shown in the movie. The director also changed the verdict for Marcus, Marcus was supposed to be banished, not get his memories erased. The whole GD and GP situation was also not as secretive as they portrayed it in the movie. The movie also exaggerated lots of things. They pushed 'futuristic' too far and some things were a little weird, like the protective bubble thing and the liquid that Tris was suffocated by in the shower. In the book, the bureau was not that futuristic and they didn't use aircraft that often. Wish they kept the water and stone sculpture too. I found it interesting that when Tris was wearing the white dress with heels, she reminded me of Jeanine. Overall, I would rate this movie 6/10. For goodness sakes, if you are making a movie based on a book, FOLLOW THE BOOK!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out of all three movies, this one is the worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, this movie is just okay. The filming was different; nice landscape filming but a bit rocky at the start for close ups. The film starts out pretty abruptly as opposed to Divergent and Insurgent who gradually got into the movie. The plot is pretty boring and if you haven't read the books a bit hard to follow. The affection scenes were a bit lazily done and gave me no emotional feeling. When it came to the climax scene, it wasn't really "climatic" to be honest. It seemed like the scene was not important and was quickly done. Thruout the movie, there are many scenes where there is no continuity or mention or explanation for why that happened and felt like there was always something new and didn't finish that new thing that happened. The ending was not very special and thought there would be more. I understand that there is a new movie coming out next year but it felt like a 30 min movie when it was actually 2 hours. It felt like the characters were getting nowhere and just always seemed too relaxed, like when someone died the characters didn't seem to sad and moved on, or when they accomplished something they were very nonchalant about it. There were also some comedic scenes but they were very misplaced and at the end where the action is supposed to happen. It was very hard for me to find these scenes funny as I was expecting something a bit more exciting(more fighting, climax etc.). The movie had very good special effects and everything seemed very real. Overall I think the movie was okay but it could have done better.</fullReview>

I am pretty sure they didn't do it because they have to follow the currently trend right now, mindless action set pieces with very little story.

		<fullReview>Way worse than the first two parts. 'Open the door MOM', 'I won't remember you' - WOW way to go on emotional manipulation. I was very pleased with the first two parts and expected more from the last one but was let down terribly. The real-life lessons: always think on your own before you believe that they tell you. Tris did not take Fours word for it, that there was something wrong and I liked that-she made up her own mind. She also chose not to believe anything David was telling and went back to her home as soon as she learned he lied to her. He could not be trusted. So yeah, making up your own mind as soon as you see whats happening is an important thing. Plausibility: well maybe its just me but I don't really think that the movie makes much sense. If David control everything why did he not just release the gas from the central, why did he need someone from the inside to do it? I mean if he can close a door from his outside why can't he realise a gas. Also, if people are divided in factions were so committed to those fractions before (since its who they are as they are genetically modified that way) how come it is so easy for them to forget anything and how they are and follow into a war so easily. Why are the people not keeping the factions? Isn't that who they are? Character development: I liked the dilemmas that chapters faced in this one better than in the first two parts. It added more to their development. Tris-as I said I liked that she did give in and immediately listed to what her boyfriend had to say, I liked that she wanted to be convinced for herself and did what she believed was right. I liked that she used her own mind and made her own decisions. Strong character right there. Four-I liked that he questioned what was going on and that he did not believe everything in an instance. At first I thought that he was feeling jealous maybe (well maybe that is not the right word), something like put down that he was for once the under class. He was used to always be the first, the best and suddenly he was not good enough, he was in the lower level. I suspected that maybe that's why he wanted something to be wrong with the centre, he couldn't bear not being the best. And that's why he decided to go back home where he is indeed the best. Where he is in leadership or at least along it. Maybe the scrip writes wanted him to come across as a selfless, smart men that saw something was wrong and wanted to help his home, but if you look deep enough (and if this was a real life character) than its more about him not bearing the fact that he is not the best and wanting to go to a place where he is. Storytelling: it started on the right foot and it was actually quite exciting in the beginning but than the story started to get down. It became more boring and more obvious. There a lot of unanswered questions left like what is happening in between Chicago and the centre? Why did people resits going to a clean place? Why would they prefer to be outside in the dirt? Why would they not volunteer their kids to a healthier place?Didn't David say that Tris was the only one that was pure? Does that mean that David and those other in the city are damaged as well? Didn't he say she was the only hope, didn't he say that the experiment was to clean the human genome? Then why is the city not helping the centre and not extending the funding? What else are they doing besides the experiment? As I said its maybe just me but there were a lot of questions I had left after the movie finished. Maybe they will be answered in the last part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly disappointing. Weakest of the franchise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie last weekend with my family. We had high hopes for this movie in the beginning, but now......This has to be the weakest movie of the franchise. Let me first tell you the things I liked. Tris grew her hair out- thank heavens. Four (Theo James) was in it (YAY!). The scenery was cool. Well, that was a short list.Onto what I disliked. 1: The lame, never ending talk with David. *sighs* Tris must have talked to him for a solid hour of the movie and NOTHING came from it. I cant even expand on this because there is nothing TO expand on.2: The script. Weak. Just plain weak. And boring. Cliché. There was one point in the movie where Peter cracks a sarcastic joke that I just knew one of them was going to say something retarded. Ding ding ding! Christina had the honor of delivering that line. After a really LONGGGGGGGG PAUSEEEEEE.3: The orange floating bubbles. WHAT THE CRAP? 4: Tris. Did she start to look like Jeanine by the end of the movie? She was a spoiled, selfish brat in this movie. She treated Four like dirt when she wasn't making out with him in the corner. I was so disgusted with her and was hoping for her to die in THIS movie.5: The throwing away of good characters. Was Christina even a part of this movie?6: I hate Caleb. What a boob.7: Can Peter pick a side? Ever?Honestly if Four wasn't in it and Peter didn't crack his (couple) of sarcastic jokes this movie would deserve a 0. From the very beginning this looked like a low budget, junior director high school film.Watch just to go through the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Divergent Series: Allegiant The problem with a society run by teenagers is that all essential services would cease during July and August.Fortunately, the young folk in this sci-fi film have no idea what summer vacation is.Resistance supporter Tris (Shailene Woodley) refuses leadership of the opposition for a chance to explore outside her post-apocalyptic home.Along with some friends (Theo James, Ansel Elgort, Miles Teller, Zoë Kravitz), Tris is eventually captured by the Bureau head honcho (Jeff Daniels) and told of the genetic war that led to the social factions that control her and her friends' fates.The first instalment of the final chapter, this third entry in the dystopian series is also the worst. Continuing the uninspired storyline and the wooden acting of previous segments, Allegiant ups the ante with some B-movie quality special effects and embarrassing green screen work.Moreover, teenagers hate being classified unless it's them classifying themselves.

OK, from the start, this whole movie is so boring, the only good people that ever exist is Johanna.

Then, I already know there is something wrong with "outside", I already know that everyone except Kris and the gang are the bad guy. Its too obvious, too cliché. Same with the final installment of hunger game. I know that "clever" Kris will be lied by the "outside" and someone must save her. Same thing happen again and again, its not a twist at all, its called "expected". I don't know what to type anymore, and I'm proud of myself because I don't need to read a novel to know everything.

I hated the ending (as everyone did) and I hated the way Four's character became less of the man we had known and more of a dependent, whiny, jealous jerk. The movie fixes both of those issues for me. But that's about where the good ends for the movie. I realize they can't make it exactly like the book, but to make such a departure from the outside world of the book to the outside world of the movie made it hard for me to watch. They say this movie is part 1 of 2 and that they split the last book, but I don't recall there being much to tell after Tris saves the "residents" of Chicago so I'm not sure why there will be a 4th movie other than someone wants to capitalize on this series even further. The story mostly follows the same lines, but there really is nothing left to tell other than maybe how Chicago rebuilds. I have to say though I don't think I will be watching the next movie.

		<shortDescription>Very Poorly Done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a teenager myself, even I can see that this film is a poorly done teenage action flick. Shailene Woodley happens to be one of my favorite young actresses, but this role does not do her acting justice. We have seen her do far better work in The Spectacular Now and The Descendants.I have read the book Allegiant and enjoyed it. It is my opinion that the film merely focuses in on the top layer of the book rather than diving into its full significance. The whole book series involved an underlying theme of female strength and independence. This idea was completely diminished within the first several minutes of the film. As Tris and company are attempting to get over the wall, Tris turns to fight off the enemy. When she begins to run back toward the wall, she jumps into Tobias's arms and he proceeds proceeds to run up the wall. This scene was truly laugh-worthy. The ridiculous concept of a man carrying Tris up the wall was only supported by the poorly done special effects around them.The plot is quite shallow and predictable. It is a pretty poorly done action film with poor special effects to back it up. The concept of the gas is an extreme cliché and even that is not executed well. How long does it take gas to rise further than ground level? They just needed to power walk up a set of stairs to be free from harm.Overall, I would only recommend seeing this movie if you really enjoyed the book or if you are interested in wasting away two hours of your life. Several of my friends enjoyed the film, so if you are a teenager who merely wants to drool over Theo James this might be the film for you. Otherwise, I would pass on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I watched the 3 divergent movies that are out so far and my opinion of them is predictably bad. The premise alone makes no sense since it assumes people live in harmony when they are only allowed to do one thing and any divergence is considered anarchy, punished by death. Plus, the whole thing is excused with genetics and not personal choice. You are born to think in a specific way, if you are not, you are an abomination that needs to be exterminated. Predictably, the heroine is one such individual, not because she chose to think outside the box but because she was born special. Boring! Most of the first movie is about watching her training, which is pretty dull but at least gives an excuse to make her move around and see what the other factions are doing. Up to its third quarter it's a basic dystopia slice of life. The last quarter is when whatever logic this movie tried to have goes to hell. It comes down to evil faction A wanting to kill good faction B so it can rule supreme. For that purpose it brainwashes police faction C and sends it to kill faction B. If they have brain washing technology why don't they simply brainwash faction A and be done with it? As expected, the heroine finds enough time to break free, magically undo the brainwashing of her boyfriend with the power of love, and brainwashes the villain into stopping the execution. It only gets worse in the second movie where nothing makes sense anymore. The villains are chasing the heroine and are unable to capture her even when she on foot and they use cars. They can't even hit her with machine guns when she is simply running out in the open. In the meantime the villain finds this magic box that contains a message from the founders of this stupid faction system. The thing is, it can only be opened by a pure divergent. So she orders the heroine to be captured alive and brought to her so she will open it. Well then, thank goodness nobody knew how to shoot straight all this time or the heroine would be dead and the box would never be opened.This by the way is another thing that makes no sense. If her plan was to eradicate the divergence and control the city, why does she want to read a message that needs the very thing she is trying to eradicate? It goes against her master plan. Not only that but being a divergent just changed from being an abomination to being very important, a thing that contradicts everything the first movie was about.So the heroine opens the box and finds out that not only the divergence are the special ones, not only everybody else is a genetic mistake, but also she is the best of all divergence. Meaning that all this time she was the messiah instead of a mistake. How convenient.This brings us to the third movie where the heroine finds the bureau of genetic modification, who are the masterminds behind all this bullshit. They tell her she is the most genetically perfect human being, so the target audience can also feel special for watching this nonsense.For some reason, the bureau assumes that maintaining the factions is enough to produce divergence, which are genetically fixed. Something that makes no sense since the best way to have more divergence is to have children born from divergence instead of allowing genetically inferior people to be killing the divergence for centuries.This plan makes no sense and yet the bureau decides that now that the truth is out they must make everybody lose their memories and start from scratch. What kind of logic is this? Oh, and if you think the brainwashing BS was too much, get ready to face palm with the amnesia gas. I am not kidding you, there is amnesia gas which will make everybody forget everything and go back to killing the very divergence that are supposed to be genetically superior. Anyways, as expected Jesus-Chan saves the day for the third time, because of course she does, she is Jesus with boobs, and organizes the population against the bureau. Something that will happen in the next movie, which I don't care about because it's all one big pile of BS for brainless teenagers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really should stop going an seeing these movies because while I didn't mind the first in the series, the second wasn't all that great. As is the case with the law of diminishing returns this one was down right boring. In fact I ended up falling asleep halfway through and had to catch up with what I missed by reading the wikipedia article. In fact, I am going to do my best to resist the temptation to see the final installment, which is due out next year, though knowing myself a little bit to much I'll probably end up going just to find out how the series ends.Anyway, Allegiant starts where the previous movie finished off. The factions have been broken up and the city of Chicgao has descended into mob rule. The ring leaders are being rounded up, thrust through a kangaroo court and then summarily executed, all in front of a roaring crowd. It becomes pretty clear that Tris and Four probably should get out before everything starts heading south (though it is pretty clear that this has already happened). So they rescue Tris' brother and make a run for the walls, where they discover what it is actually like outside.Well, this film is now turning into one of those post-apocalyptic movies, where we have another faction outside of the city that created the city as some form of genetic experiment. Apparently the world destroyed itself through a series of eugenic wars (it sounds as if the whole idea was stolen from Star Trek, and I have at admit that the Star Trek version was much better ? which is saying something considering that I am not a big fan of Star Trek). As it turns out these guys that are running the experiment aren't the nicest of people, so our heroes then much put a stop to their nefarious plans (which basically sets up the plot of the next film).Mind you, I'm sort of wandering what the whole point of the story actually is. Under the factions life was pretty horrible, and once the factions were removed, life is pretty horrible. Is the author trying to suggest that the while the system that we have at the moment isn't the best, it certainly is much better than mob rule. Mind you, that has always been the case, especially when we look at how revolutions unfolded in the past. This is why I tend to prefer reform from inside that outright toppling a government. Still, the suggestion at the end is that we are stuffed if we do and we are stuffed if we don't, so we might as well do nothing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the foul movie.full west your time and Money..... I had originally expressed no interest in this series, but was invited to go along with some friends to see Allegiant. In order to have some knowledge of what was going on, I read detailed synopses of the first two movies. A lot takes place and I tried to absorb it. Still, I was the least informed. That said, it took me quite a while to figure out why people were acting the way they were. Who were the villains and who were the good guys. I realize that the leads were the ones we were supposed to root for. They worked so hard to get to this paradise. But wouldn't you know it, Jeff Daniels was there and he wasn't nice at all. The direction this took with a memory erasing gas was beyond the limits of my suspension of disbelief. It's the kind of thing a seventh grader would come up with for a short story assignment. I'm also astonished by the expertise at the time of crisis. A totally unfamiliar machine is mastered by poking at it. This is kind of the that is used on Star Trek the Next Generation. Anyway, the thing is pretty lame</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I just went and watched the new movie to the Divergent Series called Allegiant the other day and I have to say I was very disappointed with this movie and I really enjoyed all the other Divergent series movies but I just found that this movie was dragging on and was very boring.When I was watching Allegiant I found the first part of the movie (SPOILER) was very exciting when they were first trying to get over the wall of there city but then after that I found the movie just got very boring. I know that there is a part two of this movie coming out in 2017 and I just hope it's a lot better then part one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Allegiant...no better than where we started out. This is a terrible conclusion to a trilogy that had no significant point whatsoever. The writers of this movie demonstrated their own issues with authority and establishment. It was a modern-day knock off of Lord of the Flies and slightly better looking actors immortalized in what seems like a post apocalyptic photo shoot. The deviation from the first in the series, Divergent, was noticeable and the lack of character development and indulging of actors' images. Allegiant was a disappointment to wear this great trilogy could've gone. With the amount of money that's going into special effects, you would think they would invest more into good, solid script writing. I am sure this will feel too young teenagers who are struggling with their identities. Sadly, it leaves them with no real moral guidance and, once again, a diminished quality of representation of their generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked "Divergent," I LOVED "Insurgent" (a combo of the Hunger Games and the Matrix) but couldn't quite follow the plot in this one. I kept feeling like the author was trying to make some type of point about diversity, but the science fiction didn't seem to add up even for science fiction. On the positive side the special effects were fun and Theo James is hot and his character becomes more interesting in this film.The movie would have been better if the backstory/history had been told more, perhaps in flashbacks. The scenarios just didn't play out in a way that totally made sense. Maybe it will all become clear in the final episode; I hope so.The interaction among the characters is quite weak in this installment compared to the previous installments. Evelyn remains a mysterious character, and there's no love scene between Four and Tris, just some kissing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*Diverges* from the flawed source material; does not improve upon it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have decided that I do not like what the director, Robert Schwentke, has done with the franchise. He directed the second film, Insurgent, and the third, Allegiant. I can understand why anyone would want to deviate from the source material because there were many problems with Veronica Roth's writing. The books had a flimsy premise but excellent commentary. To reconcile the two, Schwentke got rid of pretty much all the commentary and turned the franchise into a B-grade sci-fi action flick, the kind with over-the-top "futuristic technology" and over- the-top post- apocalyptic landscapes. The major changes in the plot make it very campy, when the books weren't all that campy to begin with. If this franchise was trying to live up to the Hunger Games films, it did not go in the right direction.There are some positives - the cast did a fantastic job. Shailene Woodley's Tris in this film is a major improvement from Insurgent, in which "she cut her hair and grew an attitude" (as my brother described it). Theo James as Four (and to some extent, Ansel Elgort as Caleb) was given a bugger role and did a pretty good job. Miles Teller had been the best thing in Insurgent and he continued to be hilarious. He's very different than his character in the book, but I'm not complaining, because he is incredibly entertaining. Zoe Kravitz as Christina was okay. I'm glad that she got enough screen time to have a major role in this film. I also think the movie deserves serious props for having a very diverse cast, both in terms of race and gender.It is interesting that we are going to get a fourth film - Ascendant. The third film, while it didn't follow the book, does very roughly end where the third book ended. Minus the incredibly controversial ending. Which makes me think that Ascendant will likely be an original story and might diverge from that ending, but we shall see. I'm glad that we're getting a different director for the final installment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a solid take on the 'YA' genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So as we all know the divergent series is supposedly the new 'Hunger Games', in that sense I can see that its doing great at replicating the steady downfall that the hunger games series clearly had. Yes, this isn't a great movie, its not bad it's a solid film.Now I did enjoy the movie non the less, I really liked the new sci- fi elements with the whole world outside of Chicago idea. It had good performances, action sequences and some average special effects. If you're a fan of the series, it would be great. In the sense that it is basically the same movie for the third time. It's true, I can't tell the difference.It lacks identity and individuality, now if we compare this to the Hunger games we would notice large differences, from this point of view. For each hunger games there was a clear difference in tone and theme. In my opinion each were solid in and of its own. Now granted the last two hunger games weren't really near the standards to the first two films. They all have their own individuality.Now focusing back on insurgent(see I'm even getting the names wrong, they're so alike), I would say that Shailene Woodley and Theo James were really quite well portrayed and the relationship between Tris and Four are well established and not just completely ridiculous. Another honorable mention would be Miles Teller, he's Mr. fant4stic, he's the whiplash guy and now he plays a perfect asshole, just as he has done so well in the past of this series.All in all, Allegiant was enjoyable but predictable. However personally the action, acting and sci-fi elements sold me. A perfect definition of mediocre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as good as Divergent &amp; Insurgent! (WARNING: Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: This review contains spoilers(Just to let potential viewers know that I am a big fan of the Divergent trilogy (books and films) so I may appear slightly biased!)When I went to see this film, I considered the fact that I had put down the book version of Allegiant due to the reason that I have little free time this year and it failed to engage my interest enough to continue reading it. It meant that I was secretly a bit concerned that the film would fail to engage my interest. This also meant I did not know what was going to happen in the film; however I knew that Insurgent had moved away from the books slightly so I expected this to be similar. At the end of this film, I can say that I was very impressed with it.It followed on nicely from the previous film, and engaged my interest right from the start. The parts that didn't interest me so much was the parts with David and the Bureau of Genetic Welfare; it was a bit too science-related to really interest me, however it was necessary in order to fully explain the situation.The acting was very good; Shailene and Theo continue to do a good job as the lead characters. Ansel does a very convincing job, and Miles continues to be good as the infuriating, yet somewhat amusing (at times) Peter. Jeff Daniels is also very good at playing a very emotionless character who is rather deceiving.All in all, I don't understand the hate for this film. For the third in the series, it is just as good as the others, with impressive special effects and a good plot line. If you liked the previous films, then this one should be watched too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the sequel to the movie where KaTris shaved her head, Allegiant opens up what seems to be literally a day or two later... Except she has a full head of hair somehow.ALLEGIANT!!!!My experience with this series is not the greatest. The first movie - Detergent - was awful. The next movie - Insufferable - was awful again. The third movie..? Allegiant was absolutely disgraceful.The first half of this movie was just about okay. I would rate it 6/10. Then the second half plays and my brain starts getting blended. I cannot even begin to explain the IDIOCY from these stupid characters! Tris is an annoying little *****! If you like strong female leads, this movie is NOT the movie you will want to see.If you like movies with real emotion, this is NOT the movie you will want to see. Here you will see characters IDIOTICALLY expose themselves to their enemies, get shot, die, their friends barely shed a tear and then forget them for the rest of the movie.If you like natural movies without stupid Sci-Fi ****, this is NOT the movie you will want to see. Here you will have girls in glass tubes, then somehow the glass shrinks and turns into a gooey liquid and suffocate these girls like they are in condoms. (?????) I'm not even lying. That **** is in this movie. I could not stop laughing.This movie is atrocious. Watch The Hunger Games instead; a series that breaks the YA stigma and is well directed! You're not even going to like this film if you're drunk. Only one or two moments here can truly entertain an alcoholic. It's *that* bad.I recommend watching this movie if you are held at gunpoint and your kidnapper forces you too.1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first time I ever walked out of a movie because it was so bad. Sometimes I'll stay just to see how bad a movie will be, but this was a waste of time. Full of green screen closeups and CGI, I can imagine they only had a couple days of work for the extras. The script was is so lacking in logic or any semblance to reality, for me, it was an exercise if frustration to watch the film. I found the design of most of the CGI mechanicals to be silly and impractical. What they envisioned as "tech" of the future is too impractical to even attempt to suspend belief as I do in all sci-fi movies. Did they Botox Shailene so her face couldn't react to anything said to Tris? I finally gave up, wasted half of my drink and popcorn, and left.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me it was weak.What I liked about the The Divergent Series, was how amazing an action adventure the whole franchise is. Is it as good as Hunger Games? no need to answer that question, but it definitely was more brutal and grim, which I'll admit I liked, and what drew me in.This movie was more story than the other two. It does a lot of explaining about the entire series. The only problem is, as it turns out the story is not that impressive. It feels like they just slap something on paper in five minutes and filmed it. Not even The appearance of Jeff Daniels in the series could save it.The little action that it did have was good, and all done by the character Tobias Eaton which kind of sucks.Because of how connected all three movies are I have to grade it as a Sequel and not a sand alone, and as a sequel it's a weak leak because it changes everything that made we want to see the movie in the first place</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Jeanine defeated (and dead), Evelyn shows signs of becoming every bit the dictator her predecessor was, so Triss and friends escape Chicago and go into the blasted wastes outside where they find unexpected stuff which turns out to be not exactly what they had initially believed it to be (oh the problems of writing a spoiler-free synopsis).With this third entry, the Divergent series finally begins to feel like its own thing, not something which is nicking bits from various other well-known franchises. Unfortunately, what it's nicking is bits from every dystopian post-apocalyptic bit of sci-fi ever, but at least we're (mostly) spared the further adventures of Katniss and harry Potter's sorting hat.The good here is that the eye candy is well done, the action is well staged, there are less indistinguishable and interchangeable spear-carrier characters, there is (slightly) more plot than jeopardy and chase, and Jeff Daniels is terrific.Less good is the fact that some decent names are, again, in blink and you'll miss 'em roles, the main thug (stepping into Jai Courtney's shoes) appears to get a comeuppance but we're never shown it, and there never seems to be much at stake emotionally. Oh, and there is one of those mind-numbingly stupid moments when everyone stands around talking instead of getting out of danger, with predictable results. But I quite liked it anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Allegiant was such a good movie, it wasn't exactly like the book, but I really like the creative changes they made. first off,Allegiant is a combination of action, adventure, romance, and fantasy. I really liked that they didn't take the romance too far in this film. Secondly, I liked that the movie explains everything that you might have missed or been questioning after the first two movies. Thirdly, The acting was Phenomenal, the cast for this movie did a really good job playing with the audience's emotions. Lastly Allegiant did a really good job making the movie fit the age group of people who loved the book, when you make a movie like this it is really hard to keep it "kid friendly" when even the book is a little questionable, and I think they did a really good job making the film fit the PG13 criteria.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came in the theatre thinking this movie might be shitty since thats how movies with two parts usually turn out. They usually contain a lot of unnecessary dialogues just because the director has to spare enough scenes for the second part and end with an annoying cliff hanger. Fortunately, The Divergent Series: Allegiant - Part 1 isn't one of those part 1 movies. It was really fun to watch and they keep you at the edge of your seats for a good amount of times. There was some really predictable scenes like the one where the tattoo artist got shot, and you just know something is a little off about David although you can't really tell what it was. However, the movie turned out great, at least for me and my date. I couldn't get my eyes off the screen. I enjoyed the climax because i really didn't know what was going to happen and I kept wishing the movie was not going to end at an adrenalin pumping scene like the movie 'Salt' did. I really hate if a movie ends where it just began to get really exciting just because the producers want people to go see the second part. I liked the ending a lot and I can't wait for The Divergent Series: Allegiant - Part 2. The actors were good, not incredible, but good. I liked the effects, although they also weren't incredible. I liked the plot the most of all, but I still have questions. Hope it would get answered in the second part and that part 2 will turn out as good or even better. My date said The Divergent Series: Allegiant - Part 1 is his favourite out of the other Divergent series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, first things first I am a realist about movies and a huge critic. If I enjoy a movie, Ill make sure it does get good feedback and this relatively goes for Allegiant. Allegiant was a pretty good movie. The negativity is over-exaggerated, seriously over-exaggerated. I realize that a majority of people are hauling up all this negativity because they are getting butt hurt that the film sort of strays from the book. Yes, I have read the book but seriously they barely change the plot. I only remember bits of the book since I read it a really long time ago like a year ago and there is nothing to get even remotely butt hurt over.In summary, if you are scared this is going to be a waste of money and time, I implore you to go and see it for yourself. I went to the cinema with a low expectation of this film and by the end was questioning, what the hell these people are complaining over. Solid safe 7 out of 10. No generosity. It deserves a damn 7.

		<fullReview>Like others have said, while the first two movies followed the books really well this movie is enough of a departure to give you pause.When I read the books, I have to admit I was disappointed with the ending. So, I hoped Roth would use the movies to change the ending to be somewhat more palatable. With these differences I'm thinking I may be rewarded. We'll see.As far as the movie itself goes, the most disappointing difference is the depiction of the "world outside." The books describe a still viable country that isn't that far ahead technologically from the lab- cities (or even our own), except for their progress in medical and surveillance tech.The movie describes a much more advanced civilization. One that makes you wonder "why even have laboratory cities?" The mental picture we get from the books is one of a nation trying to restore its population with the few tools they have left. The movie makes us think they could get along fine without the experiments.I'm also disappointed with the speed that they glossed-over the relationship between David and Natalie. I'm hoping they refer to that more in the second movie.So, like I said, I like that we're departing from the books because I hated the book ending. But now I'm wondering if I should be more careful about what I wish for...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is coming from the perspective of a person who read the trilogy. Okay, we can all agree that the trailers and the BIG changes took us by surprise but I went to my local cinemas yesterday and thought about why not go watch Allegiant? It took a lot of will power for me to consider whether or not I am going to buy a ticket because I love the books so much and I know that Insurgent has been a slight disappointment due to changes also but, that movie was good. Anyway, The movie, Allegiant, translated its book parent to be mainstream like explosions, war, and whatnot. That is only because the book Allegiant is not really focused on the war but more focused on political matters concerning Chicago experiments and the existential crisis of characters who have gone and learned the truth beyond the wall. The movie was great it has kept the plot and the whole purpose of the story. The changes like earth being Mars, excessive airships and armies were there to make the movie appealing to those who like typical science fiction events.SPOILER-Y SECTION OF MY REVIEW: (contains minimum details concerning the part 1.) I liked that they had involved the Chicago factions to what is really outside the wall. It was an amazing exploration because the only people who were protecting Chicago from the books were Tris, Four, Caleb, Cristina, I think Uriah's brother or Uriah, I forgot. Anyway the point is, it WAS NOT THEIR FIGHT, it was the fight of every people and their rights of being alive Genetically Damaged or not! This has affected me greatly because finally when the heartbreaking event happens in the part 2, Ascendant, the heroes who have died will not only be remembered by their friends but, by their people. The movie gives more justice for them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon seeing Allegiant, I had mixed feelings about it. At first upon seeing the reviews I was a little in shocked at how much criticism it was receiving, but sometimes your opinion can be different from the critics who review the movie. So I saw the movie, and as I watched the movie I started remembering scenes from the book, since I haven't read the book in a while. There was scenes that surprise me, which I thoroughly enjoyed because I love surprises. And although, yes the movie strays away from the source material, we as people should be more open-minded about book to film adaptations. As a fan of the books it can be nerve wrecking to have a good book turned into an awful movie, but I like to think about how much time was put into making a film. An actor/actress works hard to follow the script that is given to them, the director has a vision in mind for the film, which is hard work in itself. And putting the film together takes a lot of shots to achieve in the amount of time they are given. This is why we have deleted scenes to begin with. I praise this cast for not giving up on this project and continue to do their best to pull off a movie adaptation of a best- selling series.All in all, I enjoyed this movie and recommend it to people who love stories and fans who can still appreciate a movie despite its obvious changes.</fullReview>

However, the story is pretty gripping and the action is on point. Even though Tris is annoying at times, she is nowhere near as annoying as in Insurgent.

		<fullReview>The Divergent Series: Allegiant is the latest Divergent movies that comes out at March 10 in England and March 18 in USA starring Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Jeff Daniels, Miles Teller, Ansel Elgort, Maggie Q, With Octavia Spencer, and Naomi Watts. Once again, Shailene Woddley is bringing the best performance through the whole movie, We get to see more of Tobias in this one instead of just Woodley's character, Tris. The Visual Effects were amazing, The cinematography was incredible and of course, The acting was fantastic, Especially Woodley. It's a lot more action packed than Insurgent and Divergent, there's a lot of running, the wall sequences that we see in the trailer was the best action scene in the movie. Four and Tris chemistry is better in this one. Though the last 30 minutes of this movie is more like "Ok people, let's wrap it up". But you will be impressed through the whole movie by Woodley's work. She's definitely a big ++ for this movie. The only issued i have was the pacing and plot. It was kinda messy but very well put together. 7.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Insurgent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised watching this movie. When I saw Insurgent it kind of disappointed me, cause I thought the series had a lot more to offer. It felt it wasn't living up to it's potential. This movie however, it had it all. The action, the romance, the plot: It was all there and it wasn't that bad this time.. The story was interesting, there where multiple stories to follow and I didn't feel for a specific character. Also the story has a pretty clear ending. Not a real cliffhanger, I wouldn't feel bad if this was the ending of the series. Props too Miles Teller, his character was pretty hilarious. You sympathize with him, no matter what he does. Not a bad movie, not a great movie, but a solid 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly thought this film was just awful. The first two films in the series were great and I would easily watch them again, but this film, it just had no drive to it until the very end. Good acting at times by some really top actors but most of the time, I honestly had no idea what was going on. The special effects in the film were quite good, bit over the top but it just made the film a bit fake. Really disappointed with this film, was very looking forward to watching it. It felt like the film was trying to be something that it's not meant to be, it felt quite forced and not right. As I said before the first two films were quite good and I was really looking forward to watching this but it turned out to just not be great. Hearing that the next film's budget has been cut doesn't really surprise me either. But in a nutshell, great actors, just not a great story line and film I've afraid which really is a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugely disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allegiant, is the third instalment of the Divergent Series, the first two in which i enjoyed quite well. Divergent was a great entertaining movie with some good action and a good plot, as was Insurgent. This movie however was bland, uncreative and poorly executed. With a two hour run-time, this movie suffers from bland characters and some of the worst CGI and green-screen effects I have ever seen in a movie. The effects are that bad, that the special effects from Firefly look outstanding. The only interesting character is Evelyn, played very well by the talented Naomi Watts, and she outshines everyone around her, making her very out of place when compared to the other poor actors.While this film could have been great, it does have an interesting plot, but it is adapted so poorly from its book counterpart, that you wonder why they even bothered. I can't review that much of this movie, because nothing at all happens, it is that terrible. I am only giving it a rating higher than a 4 because it has a talented cast, who are being forced to work with a director who does a dreadful job.4.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read all of the books, and I thought they were all pretty good. The book SHOULD make a great movie. But this movie is not like the book at all, and I think that's what made it fail so badly. The book was great, but with this movie being nothing like it, it's far from even okay. I understand that they were going to split it into two movies, but what more can they do? They left out the BIGGEST parts of the book, and altered the most interesting parts. Of course, there were some good parts, and some funny lines (but most likely only from Peter), but they didn't make up for the rest of the movie. All in all, it was a horrible adaptation of pretty good book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I saw this on DVD from our public library. I have a sound system with a mighty SVS cylindrical subwoofer and the sound track really gave it a workout. At key scenes the deep bass is some of the best on any recent movie, for those who like that sort of thing.In truth the "Divergent" series of stories has gotten a bit stale. Even though the locations and story lines may change we see the same characters behaving in their usual ways. Here the story opens with a group, including Tris and Four, escaping from the city by short- circuiting the electrified protection on top of the wall and barely escaping those shooting at them.They manage to make it across red parched land to a type of portal that "welcomes them to the future". It isn't really the future but it is the city where the experimenters have been directing and monitoring things in Chicago.Shailene Woodley is back as Tris and Theo James is back as Four. Naomi Watts is also back as Four's mother, Evelyn. The new guy is Jeff Daniels as David, who directs the whole operation, the big experiment in Chicago. Then Tris and Four need to get back into Chicago, the only real home they know, and save it from the warring factions.We enjoyed it enough as a 2-hour entertainment diversion but ultimately it is forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full of clichés and nonsenses.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Diveregent and Insurgent, now we have got new nonsense movie in Divergent series - Allegiant. It is definitely the worst of Divergent series of movies. Diveregent and Insurgent were at least watchable, although had some clichés. Allegiant, on the other hand, puts clichés and nonsenses on hole new level. Movie is amazingly predictable and full of clichés (David is firstly portrayed as good guy, and than becomes bad guy; Tris decided to trust David, although she knows him for a few days instead of Four, who is love of her life, because he is powerful and know what he needs to do etc.) About the performances, Shailene Woodley, who is very talented and promising young actor, just don't fit in her role. Other actors - Theo James, Jeff Daniels, Miles Teller were solid, but sometimes now convincing enough. Ansel Elgort, who portrayed Caleb, gave us really bad performance.Is this movie worth watching? The answer is: No. Plot full of nonsenses and clichés just doesn't seem interesting, just predictable. There is nothing unique and special in this movie. Avoiding it would be best possible solution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well has a reader i was surprised at the story and how it was going, but at the end considering this is the way it should go. The problem with movie adaptations when we read the books first is that we go with a pre-conceived idea about what we are going to see, and when it fails, in my opinion, to deliver it's rather disappointing. To me the problem here was the direction, sloppy. The performances, "mehhh!!!", and i'm sorry but after three movies i still don't feel the love between the two leads, and that was, to me , what led to movies to not be as good and loved how they should be. The imagery of this destroyed world is beautiful, but the costumes do not go along with it. The effort is there, but it lacks a lot of passion...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the third movie of the divergent series, I'm left with mixed feelings. Sure it wasn't as bad as the second movie, but it wasn't as good as the first either. As I haven't read the books I can't judge whether it was close to the real thing or not. However, the story was a little complicated and the actions wasn't there, the twists were few and far between, with the big "mystery" not helping to close the gaps of the plot. The special effects were okay, as well as the costumes. And as for the performances, they were descent enough for an action YA movie, though the romance wasn't really there, as the couple lucked chemistry. So 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie takes the exact same plot, style and ideas from the first two films in the series and does absolutely nothing new with them. There is less tension, everything makes no sense, is in your face obvious and bland. It's not even the end of the story. Remember when franchises were just trilogies? Those were the days. In fact, the series will turn into a real TV series through a fitting connection: the next film in the franchise called Ascendant, which will be a TV film.When the film started I couldn't remember what story it was continuing. Scenes from Hunger Games and Maze Runner and bits of trailers and teasers were mixed inside my brain and somehow completely covered the entire length of the movie. I kid you not, I had the sensation that I had already seen every single scene. It was that obscenely unimaginative.Bottom line: a complete waste of time. The Maze Runner is much better than this, even if it has almost the same exact plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly this part really misses on adding any new layers of main characters - same approaches, dialogues. There is no development, yet scenery changes, but in a disappointing way. There are moments, when they are again in high risk situations, yet manage to have some passionate kissing scenes, when all people they know may be brainwashed. That kills the story. Tris is way to easy to manipulate considering what she has been through and experience base she has, right hand of main governor is always a bloodthirsty idiot - not sure why considering that Four's mother is kind of willing to achieve peace. David is kind of clever man, his problem is underestimation of so called damaged and Tris. And then again - why so, if they have monitored them since ever. They know, what they are capable of. All in all this do not look good - I have not read the books, but I believe that this could be disappointing to readers considering the sales and positive reviews of books.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the moment I saw the trailer, I wasn't expecting much of the third installment in The Divergent Series. I loved the first two movies. I thought they were great. But not so much Allegiant.I think this film has too many similarities to The Maze Runner. For one, the setting the characters live in is revealed to be an experiment. 2, the setting is surrounded by a massive desert. And 3, the characters now have to escape from an advanced corporation whose intentions are supposedly the best.What got me mad was that this movie, I kid you not, did not follow the book. AT ALL. Say the film DID follow the book, all of the issues of generic plot points and elements would have been totally eliminated.But, the movie did have a good mix of action. I liked it. It was fun. And it had a tad of humor that may have been misplaced but was still appealing.But overall, I thought it was an okay movie and an okay sequel, though, for the following sequel, get rid of the screenwriters, cinematographer, and director, PLEASE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Third Part Is Not The Best, Surely It Isn't Too Bad, Either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was waiting a bit longer to watch the third part of the Divergent Saga, and yes, I like the first part very very much, while the second was good, but not excellent, and thus, the third one. Well, it is 2 hours long, and yes, because of that, it tends to be a bit too slow and dragging. Plodding tempo almost ruins the movie in the first third but later the film catches up and on. Main characters are still lovable and endearing, with Tris being even sexier and Four even wilder. The biggest asset is a welcoming addition of great drama heavy Jeff Daniels as David, and he shines throughout - old school works well, I say. There are certain weaker parts in that, too, and sometimes the movie seems to be a mishmash of awesome CGI and effects but lacking sense and depth. Sometimes, sheer love for loud shooting and wild tricks overshadows the essence and ideas. This is why this part is good, yes, but not the best, and now all the hot expectation is on the last part</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another lackluster installment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we go again folks. Another installment of the ludicrous Divergent series of movies. So what did I think? Well, there are a few sins that movies can make these days which automatically invite scorn. One of those is the notion that taking the last book in a series of novels and splitting it into two is a good idea. It isn't. The Hobbit proved that once and for all, yet here, the makers decided they could get away with it and not have it harm the story (laughable though it is). They failed.Another thing (and more of a personal gripe, really) is the conceit that you can put forward an all-powerful entity and then try to convince your audience that said entity is unable to fix a trifling problem. Allegiant does this with the introduction of the Pure. A technologically advanced faction of humans that has anti-gravity, camouflage holograms and all manner of science-y malarkey, yet is singularly unable to fix the human genome which is damaged, apparently.Hmmm... Where have I seen this nonsense before... Oh yes! Aeon Flux! Another movie that tried to make you swallow an advanced society that was horribly deficient in one area... medicine.Now, I'm not saying this couldn't play out, but it isn't very likely that the one technology/skill they need is the one technology/skill they are completely rubbish at.Anyway, what about the film? Is it any good? Well, it is a lot better than Interminable (or whatever the last film was called) but suffers in a lot of places.Chief among these is the tired old YA trope of "these kids are just an experiment" which we've seen countless times before. Add in a set of actors that aren't the best, along with clunky dialogue and yet another YA trope - adults are evil - and the stage is set for a disappointment.Shailene Woodley... Where do I start? She has an acting technique that comprises a wide-eyed stare and the conviction that she is always right. Yet you know if any of the other characters ever questioned "Why?" she would not have an answer. And about that wide-eyed stare... It often seemed to me as if she was channeling the cute look from Puss n Boots in an attempt to make her more endearing. All it did was make her veer into uncanny valley territory. As an actress, she is not very convincing.Then you have the really atrocious writing. Once again Peter betrays everyone, after spending most of the movie helping them. It's like he's a split-personality, yet no real reason is given for either his abrupt turn-coating or the fact that the others do little more than shrug, as if his antics are those of a cheeky schoolboy! Back to the tech that the Pure faction has... they have holograms that hide their presence, forming a wall of illusion between themselves and the outside that is so perfect. Yet when they use their "spy-tech" they are unable to render a stable image to the watcher? It doesn't add up.All in all, it seems more of an exercise of "Throw crap at the screen and whatever sticks, we'll use in the movie." This is an increasingly common attitude, especially prevalent amongst YA dystopian future movies, where, presumably, the writers don't think the audience will be switched on enough to notice the glaring inconsistencies and holes.SUMMARY: Bad story. Bad acting. Bad mumbo-jumbo techno-crap. Bad characters. Bad dialogue... Need I go on? When the best thing you can say about a movie is "It's not quite as bad as the previous installment." you should probably avoid it.</fullReview>

Die-hard fans might also find this movie a stretch or rather, a two hour stretch of a film that gets cheesier every ten minutes or so. The resultant product is something that isn't quite unlike a B-movie where everything from the costumes and character styling (incidentally, how did Tris' hair grow out so soon?) to the weapons (which look like they're put together by a 10-year-old) to their dialogue, will make you cringe.Continuing where Insurgent left off, Allegiant sees Tris (Woodley) making a break from Chicago along with Four (James) and friends to try and find out the truth behind their lives as well as the real story about the factions. The truth however, might not be all that Tris had bargained for.REVIEW: While the previous film in this series set the stage for a hopefully interesting follow up, Allegiant turns out to be a bit of a letdown.

So, Tris and Theo and their gang jump the wall and head out to the great beyond, only to find that they're not quite as free as birds. The Bureau of Genetic Welfare is headed by David (Jeff Daniels) who along with Theo and Tris, compete for who gets the corniest lines in the movie. Fashioned as a villain of sorts, David has some kind of mambo jumbo theory about their genetic structures and damaged genes. At one point in the movie, Tris wonders aloud about what really is going on. You might find yourself empathizing with her. Clad in a white jumpsuit with hair perfectly in place and Four faithfully panting after, Tris now has a new mission - to rescue the brainwashed and the tainted.Miles Teller gets barely any lines but nonetheless, he does steal the show whenever he is in a scene. But this is a given, as he is by far the most talented of the cast anyways. A plus point though is the set design, a curious mix of ultra-futuristic-meets-retro. But while the underlying concept of the series is the examination of a big social experiment, this gets lost in the film. Extremely lackluster fare, overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Allegiant is a big bummer! From the enthralling tales that were so successfully luring us towards its nail-biting enclaves, comes another one, a rather dismissive twist that takes the plot to weird levels of alcoves from where there is no possible return. The movie franchise has met an ugly thud and now we are left with a stale taste in our palate. We are thinking can someone really revive this? Just an year ago, Robert Schwentke had wrapped us a thrilling sequel to the first part where things seemed really promising. It was a fast paced dig, au contraire, to the first instalment and acquainted us to a fantastical world of simulations. I don't know how his direction degraded for Allegiant to meet complete chaos.The fact that we had a pre-written storyline in our baggage should have actually helped not played against Schwentke. His direction goes dodgy at so many occasions that it is hard to just pinpoint one. Also, the plot jack-hammers into a recess that we weren't really expecting it to converge into. Even though it was supposed to be from Veronica Roth's perspective, we could have used some better helming to ease into some mind-numbing revelations. The shoddy display at points where it mattered the most proves how little director cared about its eye-openers.SPOILERS AHEAD: What messed with matters further was the film's dramatic quotient. The fact that Tori got lost amidst a ruckus, and the next-to-absent "Evelyn and Johanna Reyes war" made things even worse. Jeff Daniels played a great David although his hands seemed more tied and his perversion not milked enough.Sometimes I think it is almost time to hand over the reins of the franchise into hands of a better TV show director. We could really use a better insight. Can watch it if you are inquisitive enough to know what happened next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've never read a book in the Divergent series, you may have actually liked this film, but as someone who read the series, and thought that Allegiant was the best book of that series, I am disgusted by what Hollywood turned in into. Entire story lines and major themes are just ripped out of the story, not to mention character mysteriously vanished without explanation, and where did all this technology come from? The bureau is supposed to be this weakly funded entity, not the premier power in the outside world, the whole thing just made me sick. After the first ten minutes, the film greatly diverges from the book, in a way that is incomprehensible to those who read it. The story, which is the final book but not the final film, takes place as people are racing to leave the city and are stopped by the faction-less. Tris (Shailene Woodley) and her group knows that they must find out what is on the other side of the wall and launch a daring escape, which was far more difficult than portrayed in film. When they get outside the wall, the group finds out what the world is like outside of Chicago, and it's like nothing they could have ever imagined, and it's nothing like Veronica Roth described it in the book. I understand that Hollywood needs to fit entire novels into two hour films and inevitably somethings just won't make the cut, but what's missing here are major chunks of the story. Maybe they are saving it for Ascendant, which is due out a year from now, but even then they would be so out of order, that the film series just wouldn't make any sense. If you're a fan of the series, you really need to read the books. Allegiant might be one of the best stories you've ever read and when you see what Hollywood did to it, you'll be as mad as I am.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Allegiant continues with the adventures of Tris(Shailene Woodley). After the events of Divergent(2014) &amp; Insurgent(2015), Tris, Four(Theo James) &amp; the rest of the citizens of Chicago wonder what is outside the wall, that surrounds them. Tris, Four, Christina(Zoe Kravitz), Caleb(Ansel Elgort) &amp; Peter(Miles Teller) go beyond the wall in Chicago, to explore what lies outside the confines of their city. Here, they meet Romit(Andy Bean), who takes them to an outpost led by, David(Jeff Daniels). Tris &amp; her companions soon realize, that everything is not what it seems to be. Allegiant is a good film. The suspense element in this film, is a welcome addition that wasn't present in either Divergent(2014) or Insurgent(2015). Apart from this, the previous two installments in The Divergent Series are way better. The main ingredient this movie is missing, is an intimidating &amp; memorable antagonist. Kate Winslet's character Jeanine, is dearly missed. The visual effects are great. The production design is superb. The way the art department has envisioned a dystopian Chicago &amp; all the other places in the movie, is awe inspiring. The performances are effective but, nothing to write home about. Shailene Woodley is brilliant as Tris. Theo James is superb as Four. Naomi Watts is awesome as Evelyn. Octavia Spencer is amazing as Johanna Reyes. Jeff Daniels gives an average performance as David. Jeff Daniels' David is nowhere near as spectacular as Kate Winslet's Jeanine. Zoe Kravitz is good as Christina. Ansel Elgort is effective as Caleb. Miles Teller is mind blowing as Peter. Teller's character, is the only comic relief in the entire film. Keiynan Lonsdale, Daniel Dae Kim, Maggie Q, Bill Skarsgard, Jonny Weston, Nadia Hilker &amp; Andy Bean are impressive as Uriah, Jack Kang, Tori, Matthew, Edgar, Nita &amp; Romit, respectively. Allegiant is worth a watch for fans of this franchise. Go for it but, don't keep your expectations too high.</fullReview>

There is no real story and the characters are blindly running around the place and you start to wonder of anything actually will happen in this movie. One would think that the third movie would progress the story significantly, especially after the good first two movies, but in the end, everyone was more or less in the same place were they were.The acting was reasonable and the gadgets were an original concept for sci-fi movies. The visuals, at time, where too obviously fake, but at times were pretty good as well. It's a shame they put so little effort in the story.The character development gave a bit of a surprise with Peter that again makes the same error as always as I expected him to change his way, but other than that the movie is predictable and boring, even on newly introduced characters. The fact that Four just kicks everyones ass, no matter how many opponents was disturbing.If you're following the movie series, I bet you could just skip this one, no worries.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>\Tris (Sheilene Woodley) and Four (Theo James) and some friends escape over the Wall that surrounds Chicago in the hope of a better life. In time they discover the grass isn't greener there. Oh, no this can't be true.I thought when our heroes went over the Wall and found themselves in almost the same type environment they escaped from that "here we go into more sequels" Tris buys into Director David's (Jeff Daniels) explanation as to what they are trying to do: repair all the damaged people and make them pure so they can live in harmony. However, Four knows better when he goes on a mission that steals children from the Fringe areas. The story is good and the acting all around is good too, but the real winners in here are the CGI, the movie sets and special effects. And not to leave out other gadgets Bond, James Bond would like to get his hands on. It's truly amazing how they can make a newer futuristic world look so Heaven-like. It was a thing of beauty. Hey, I was packing my bags. (Me too)The rest of the movie is how Tris and Theo try to leave this wonderful futuristic world that denies individuality. And we are not sure if sequels will be counted out. (We can only hope)Notables: Naomi Watts as Evelyn, Four's mother; Octavia Spenser as Johanna, an opposition leader; Zoe Kravitz as Christine; Daniel Dae Kim as Kang.Over all a fitting ending to this Trilogy, still ?.. we did like that futuristic world???It was a thing of beauty??.. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Only one "S" word was heard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here comes the most expected adventure in the 'Divergent' series. I always wondered what lies outside the wall. So this sequel takes us to the new land where a fresh development takes place. A few old characters were terminated in order to introduce a bunch of new ones. As a theme, it just looked like 'The Scorch Trial', but of course totally a different setting. The director was retained from the previous installment and I think he did a good job. The concept was too familiar. 'Scorch Trial', 'Catching Fire', 'Aeon Flux', all these films are just like this one. Thankfully, this story was decent. At least better than the previous and weaker than the first. The pace drastically held back due to the split of a book into two films. It has been done in the old days, but the present trend began after 'Deathly Hallows'.I was excited to know how big stretch it is going to be as a story wise. Because it looked like the things they've accomplished in one place and looking to explore beyond the boundary. I couldn't predict the story, but I knew what's going to happen in the end of every scene. The dystopian theme was clichéd, not the storyline. The way it ended is a sign for a big finale to commence in the final film of the series. Let's hope for 'Ascendant' to end on a high note.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**only a small spoiler**I originally went into the cinemas to see Eddie the eagle but i got the times mixed up, so i thought i'd see this because i was a fan of the first two movies. I had seen the reviews for this and was nervous i wouldn't like it. by the time the movie had finished, and by the way the ending is great, i was quite pleased, sure it isn't a perfect film but the action is great and the acting is pretty decent. if you liked the first two films i would suggest you see this.there was one fault that i felt let down the movie though. here's the spoiler, it's only little though, director Robert Schwentke decided that it would be better to solely focus on the main characters beyond the fence instead of focusing more on the whole dilemma inside the fence. In the city is where the plot was developing more and where some awesome action scenes could have been. I think that that decision weakened the plot and left some viewers angry.if you're thinking about watching it do it and if you don't like it you're going to have to wait and see if ascendant makes you happy again, if you do like it, then i hope you really enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Downward Scale In The Divergent Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allegiant is the 3rd movie out of the Divergent Series and the 1st part of the epic conclusion to the saga. This film does deliver action and suspense but, it has a hard time delivering the epic climax and the full scale between Chicago and the Bureau of Genetic Welfare. The CGI and effects in this movie are completely absurd and too distracting (in my opinion). I felt that it was overused too much throughout the movie and hopefully in the next and final film, editing producers will take that into consideration. The director, Robert Schwentke, didn't deliver a well performance in this film as he did in "Insurgent." This movie has it's pros, for starters; this movie has a great cast, Shailene Woodley and Theo James prove themselves as true heroes in this film. In addition, Allegiant illustrates action sequences that gives the audience suspense.In the next and final Divergent movie, Ascendant, the director, producers and editing team really need to focus on how they can create a movie that sticks to the books rather than doing a new interpretation of it. So far, these movies haven't really connected to books and possibly the reason why their doing very poorly in reviews and box offices. If they want the last movie of a worldwide phenomenon saga to be amazing then, my suggestion is to make sure that they STICK TO THE BOOK!!! It's unfortunate that Lionsgate is reducing the budget cost for the last film yet, it's the producers fault for doing a very poor job thus far with the previous films and this one as well.Overall, The Divergent Series: Allegiant has it's ups and downs but mostly poor level of work put into this film. The last movie has potential unless they stick to the book and reduce the CGI effects and make the setting more realistic.Rating: 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hungry Maze Series: Detergent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hunger Games mark 2, better know as The Divergent series is one of many YA movie series that aim to profit off the back of the success of such film series like The Hunger Games and Harry Potter. Allegiant is the third film in this franchise based off a book trilogy, and is sadly and illogically not the last.The acting in these movies is what you would expect from a YA series. Phone in acting performances by good actors and just bad acting from everyone else. Shailene Woodley has clearly gone to the Jennifer Lawrence school of how to phone it in for a blockbuster franchise, being quite frankly forgettable in this film even when she is the lead. Joining Naomi Watts and Octavia Spenser we have Jeff Daniels on screen, jumping aboard this shipwreck for a one-for-the-money job, devoid of all emotion, charisma, fun and frankly anything interesting, although his defeated villain "Nooooo" was a valiant effort.The biggest flaw with this film is the basis around Tris. She is told that she is the only pure divergent and so is basically the greatest of them all, but she sides with Jeff Daniels against her Boyfriend Four and is then shown how her choice was wrong.... So she can't be the pure divergent because all she does in the film is make the wrong choice. Why isn't Four the Pure Divergent? He is clearly far superior to Tris in every way. Having said all this there is the possibility that they only told Tris she was the Pure because of how she is as Gullible as a fish, but this wasn't revealed to be and so remains only a theory.The logic in these films are as stupid and illogical as an actual teenagers sense of logic. The one moment that stands out to me is when Four attempts to break out of prison only to be knocked out. As Four is knocked unconscious he is seen to have his cell door key in his hand... Later he is put in his cell, locked up, WITH THE DOOR KEY IN HAND. These have to be the laziest guards in film history for them to not even notice the key which is in his hand plain as day. There are many more moments like this in the film such as why do they still allow Miles Teller to tag along but Its Ansel Elgort who is the one to keep an eye on???Overall This is another YA money maker which brings nothing new to the table other than another acclaimed older actor who needs money. These films are what they are and if you go in thinking that then you can't go wrong, but unfortunately this film is not as good as the previous film due to the lack of Jai Courtney death scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of the books I can give this film a higher rating. I know it has been reviews saying it is boring and it should not of been split into two but it is faithful to the books. The film is a bit more relaxed than the first two but still continues the trend of a villain and they have to solve it but in this film they also have to set the scene for the final film and I believe that the film struggles as it is split before the big climax of the book.Also the lack of four in the movie as he spends some time missing effects the move as alone is not as strong a character. However, Peter continues with his wit and his funny comments which breaks up the film . If you like the books or the films go and see this film but it does struggle with the fact you are waiting for the climax.Source: http://www.huludb.com/movies/241178-the-divergent-series-allegiant</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I so wanted to love this movie. I particularly love Woodley and Teller. The movie they did together called The Spectacular Now was nothing short of...Spectacular. But, the Divergent Series started so strong, then took a big tumble with Insurgent, and barely recovered here.By the third act of the film..I began to at least hope for a thrilling ending. While I won't spoil anything i'll simply say, I was far less than thrilled. The acting was fine, and the addition of Jeff Daniels was fun but, having never read the books, I found the film to be choppy and uneven. Had so much been cut from the book, to make room for the final film, that it was obvious on screen? Was the narrative just not there? I don't know..all I can do is hope that the final film takes a cue from the final Harry Potter, or the final Hobbit, and uses what works..to conclude an uneven series that has so much talent at its very fingertips!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Allegiant" brings forward the series' strong story, but does so with a weak script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Divide and conquer ? the box office, that is. The pattern should be familiar to Movie Fans and book worms alike (especially to people who are both). Take a popular YA book series and make the books into movies, but spread the final book's story over two films. This was done in adapting the "Twilight" and "Hunger Games" books and then "The Divergent Series" followed suit. Of course, it was the same production company behind that decision in those first two examples that made the decision for that third film series as well, but the "Harry Potter" film series had already set the precedent by turning the seventh Potter book into a two-film extravaganza. In fact, 2013 is the only year between 2010 and 2017 without (in spirit if not in name) a "Part 1" or "Part 2" of some YA film series finale in American theaters."The Divergent Series: Allegiant" (PG-13, 2:01) represents the first half of "Allegiant", the final book in Veronica Roth's "Divergent" trilogy (with the second half of "Allegiant" hitting the big screen as "The Divergent Series: Ascendant" in June 2017). In the case of those final two YA book to movie series, "The Hunger Games" and the "Divergent Series", you could say "four is the new three". And after seeing the third "Divergent" film, "The Divergent Series: Allegiant", it could also be said that Four is the new Tris."Allegiant" picks up almost immediately after Evelyn Johnson-Eaton (Naomi Watts) takes over for Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet) as ruler of post-apocalyptic Chicago by putting a bullet in Jeanine's brain. Now, Jeanine's minions are on trial for aiding and abetting her murderous abuse of power. The faction system which prevailed in the city during the series up to this point is now defunct, but a new rift has formed in this dystopian society ? between those who want nothing more than to live in peace ? and those who still want to fight to force their will on all the people. Evelyn represents that latter group and Johanna Reyes (Octavia Spencer) represents the former. Our favorite young divergent, Tris (Shailene Woodley), aligns herself more closely with Johanna, but is more interested in finding out what is beyond the city walls and she's hoping that her lover and fellow divergent, Four (Theo James) will come with.Like Jeanine before her (although for different reasons), Evelyn is committed to keeping everyone within the city walls, at least for the time being. Tris isn't willing to wait. With the help of Four, Christina (Zoë Kravitz) and Tori (Maggie Q), and with the duplicitous Peter (Miles Teller) and Tris' brother, Caleb (Ansel Elgort), in tow (each having been forgiven for his previous betrayals), Tris makes a run for it. Although hotly pursued by Edgar (Jonny Weston), Evelyn's most loyal and ruthless lieutenant, Tris and company manage to make it to a previously unknown futuristic city inhabited by those who originally set up the faction system and orchestrated that grand social experiment from which Tris' group has just escaped.Tris and friends settle into their new home and start jobs serving the government. David (Jeff Daniels), the Director of the Bureau of Genetic Welfare, takes a personal interest in Tris. He convinces her that she is personally and uniquely able to help him reverse the genetic tampering that was done before the war that destroyed most of the planet two centuries earlier. It's nothing less than an opportunity to save mankind. Tris is a bit wary, but she wants to help. This time, Four is the one who is the rebel and refuses to go along with the program. He's jealous of David monopolizing Tris' time, but he also just doesn't trust David. With the help of Matthew (Bill Skarsg?rd), one of David's assistants, Four gets the chance to test his suspicions and try to change the course of events before something (else) really bad happens.With "The Divergent Series: Allegiant", the film series is showing some serious cracks. The visual effects, acting and overall story remain strong and I remain enthusiastic about the series' underlying message of tolerance and acceptance of personal differences, but the script in this third film has really gone off the rails. This movie doesn't have as much fresh action as the other films in the series (similar to "The Hunger Games: Girl on Fire"), but the script's big problems lie in its plot points and dialog. We see heroes as well as villains trust each other when it's obvious they shouldn't, and they say and do things that just don't make sense given who these characters are and what they're doing to pursue their goals.I can't get very specific and still avoid spoilers, but here are some general examples of what I mean: If you don't want people to see what's going on in a certain location, don't give them complete access to your surveillance system! If you don't want your superiors to know what's really happening on your watch, don't introduce them to the one person who is most interested and willing to tell them the truth! And if people tell you they're stealing your space ship ? believe them! Here's hoping that those obvious cracks in "Allegiant" don't turn into fissures in the final film and do to this series what the greed and selfishness in the series' story did to the great city of Chicago.

		<shortDescription>Divergent - one hell of a ride or is it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with, I would like to first mention that this is a 3 movie review. Divergent very true to its name describes a person altogether different from main stream audience. I liked the idea of placement of people in various categories based on an aptitude.The idea of a divergent seems to match with someone who is enlightened, a person very rare to found but not impossible to exist. The second movie does justice to this idea, as a divergent is the one to unlock the secrets of creator.Creation of an aptitude and related environment happens to be one hell of a job but who knows we might be on a ride to create one. What I expected in this movie was... the divergent become in some way related to creators. There is an idea of afterlife in every culture... it felt as if divergent were heading in that direction, but the standard of entire series degraded with introduction of idea of killing the ones that are not pure breed by creators. I am sorry guys it was disappointing. N s I read no books n saw no trailer.Rating : 6.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damn good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where were we? Ah yes, the movie picks up a few days (maybe weeks) after the second movie Insurgent. It strangely feels heavily like one of those movies that a person can watch without having seen another in the trilogy; yet still some elements are a bit alien. That is okay, because this movie also felt a bit alien as I watched it, and is it a wonder. When we finally take off to watch the movie, things have changed a bit. The factions are no longer, the evil overlord from the previous movie has been shot, and trials are under way for those once in power - but it is more an execution as a mob mentality kicks in and they are sentenced to death. The new person in power, Evelyn is following in Janine's footsteps and is on the verge of war as members of the old factions system, have created "The Allegiant".They get some minor moments in the movie. This movie is almost entirely futuristic fantasy mixed in with adventure elements. Action is plentiful, and I must say it is very impressive in this regard. Are there Mary Sue elements? Oh yes, absolutely. Tris is of course a unique breeding, even more so than other Divergents. Her mother is also plucked from 'the fringe' and chose to be part of the Chicago experiment. Oh wait, experiment? Yeah, much like "The Maze Runner", they are inside of a walled city separated from the rest of the world. Once they get out into the Scorch, er I mean the wastelands, they run into those that have been surviving off of the wilderness. Don't ask me how they survive out there without any animals. The wastelands, wilderness, badlands, or whatever they should be called - are in fact the charred remains of what appears to be radioactive weapons (presumably nukes). The entire landscape is a wasteland except for three areas which managed to survive - the Chicago Experiment, the Genetic Beaureu and Providence; each one in order is a heaven compared to the next with the Fringe being the worst of the lot.I will not spoil how the plot unfolds; but the movie quickly escalates into those that are in control of the world. Much like W.C.K.D. from the Maze Runner, they have an ace card up their sleeve to further their own agenda. As parts of the Chicago group are much more advanced than other factions, so is the Genetic Beaurue and moreso even Providence which looks like a complete utopia. Technology of ever increasing holographics, surveillance, as well as architecture to match is present. I won't know about you, but when I got out of the theater, I was glad to be back to city streets, non-abandoned urban decay, as well as technology that is strangely familiar. I am not sure why so many films base futuristic technology with a high tech, but minimalistic look, while still preserving an almost white aesthetic, with glass all around. Is it meant to look expensive? Perhaps each type of 'group' represented in the film grows ever increasing in the expense and luxury ratio.The film has a few cool moments, and completely does away with any unnecessary bloat such as the holographics run in the first film. "Four" has a few attack scenes where he owns. The executions were pretty emotionally charged. There is one scene that plays out of old school "Jurassic Park", but was completely unexpected - you'll know it when you see it. Many scenes look like they will have a standoff and compromise - they end quickly before the pacing even lets up. The film has just enough moments to question certain characters, and reveals it before the tension lets up. Lastly, the film likes to jump into specific scenes sooner than expected.The film gets solid marks in my book as it wraps everything up from the second film (I never saw the first). I would compare this to the likes of "Terminator - Genesys" in how it tries to rewrite things, and then concludes them. I recommend this movie to casual watchers, and especially to those that have seen the first two films. I would also recommend this film to those that like the "cyberpunk" genre - essentially where high tech meets low-life, as this film goes into it frequently with the military aspect.Originally posted to Orion Age (http://www.orionphysics.com/?p=10758).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had originally expressed no interest in this series, but was invited to go along with some friends to see Allegiant. In order to have some knowledge of what was going on, I read detailed synopses of the first two movies. A lot takes place and I tried to absorb it. Still, I was the least informed. That said, it took me quite a while to figure out why people were acting the way they were. Who were the villains and who were the good guys. I realize that the leads were the ones we were supposed to root for. They worked so hard to get to this paradise. But wouldn't you know it, Jeff Daniels was there and he wasn't nice at all. The direction this took with a memory erasing gas was beyond the limits of my suspension of disbelief. It's the kind of thing a seventh grader would come up with for a short story assignment. I'm also astonished by the expertise at the time of crisis. A totally unfamiliar machine is mastered by poking at it. This is kind of the schtick that is used on Star Trek the Next Generation.

		<shortDescription>A struggle to pledge my allegiance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the faction system destroyed after the revelation that Chicago is just an experiment controlled by the outside world, trials are held for the Erudite and Dauntless conspirators. A power struggle ensues between Johanna (Octavia Spencer) leading the Allegiants, who aim to restore the faction system, against Evelyn (Naomi Watts) and the Factionless ? who oppose such notion. Our protagonist, Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) however, refuses to take any of the leadership roles and chooses to meet the ruler outside the city walls. Together with Four (Theo James), Christina (Zoë Kravitz), Caleb (Ansel Elgort), Peter (Miles Teller) and Tori (Maggie Q), they literally dash beyond the walls of Chicago to venture into uncharted territory. They are taken to the Bureau of Genetic Welfare headed by Director David (Jeff Daniels) who dogmatically proclaims that the Bureau aims to fix the human genome damage caused by years of genetic tampering. With Tris, being the only "pure" from her city, David believes that he can use her genes to save the ones who are "damaged."Given a cliché screenplay, it is still actually possible for a good director to pull things off, make the movie marginally enjoyable. However, Robert Schwentke prioritizes style over substance and we are served a lot of predictable and cheesy scenes. The characters who you think will be good end up good, the bad still remain bad. For scenes where you think help is coming, rescue comes. When a strange thought passes that a character might die, that person does get shot five seconds later. You can practically keep a scorecard to track every predictable outcome you've guessed right.Apart from this, Allegiant in itself is genetically damaged by its plot holes and far-fetched story lines (Yes, it's sci-fi but you get what I'm saying). The film does not justify the consequential gravity of being "genetically damaged" (too smart, too compassionate, hence the factions). There's nothing wrong with it because that's just plain reality. This makes you question, David's propaganda to cure these people and ultimately the rationale of the film. Divergent is interesting in a socio-political level, but when Allegiant attempts to bridge the science behind the film's premise, the whole franchise suddenly looked silly.Acting-wise, lead actors Shailene Woodley and Theo James do not disappoint but not even their on-screen chemistry can redeem this flawed material. Miles Teller, who's born to play jerk roles, is fun to watch. He basically mocks everyone in the film with his one- liners and it translates on-screen that maybe, he would rather do Fantastic Four all over again than being stuck in this film. Jeff Daniels is a welcome addition to the series. He lays out expositions and makes things sound polished even though content-wise things are just a bunch of absurd stuff strung together. It's quite a waste actually that we have this pool of talented young actors who might be better off doing other films that showcase more of their acting skills; but every year, they are under contract to reprise these in this bland franchise.At this point, the entire franchise seems more like an experiment in visualizing over-the-top technological advances, boasting special effects, and showcasing awe-inspiring sceneries. Stripping down all of the post-apocalyptic glamour, the premise itself is weak and goes against science and psychology ? the film includes a five-minute backstory of the entire series' premise; however it fails to entirely convince. During the film's second half, an orange memory- erasing serum is released and it was around this point that I also wished it can wipe away my memories of the series, or maybe the YA genre in general, so I can fool myself that this is a fresh new take on dystopian films.Read full review here: http://goo.gl/hy5meF</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but could've been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, this movie is so different than the book. If you go watch this movie expecting to see the book's story adapted to a film (or as close as Insurgent was), you'll be disappointed.The movie is a good (not exceptional) re-imagining of the story in the book, and it succeeds to keep it interesting and dynamic.The CGI looks so bad at times. There's a shot at the city train while it's moving slow, and the motion blur applied to it was awful, like if it were going 15 times faster (or if the shot were made using a $40 cellphone).There's also a time when someone's looking at another transport and keeps their sight centered to the moving object, and the motion blur is applied to that static-on-the-screen object, and not the moving-on-the-screen background.Tris' and Tobias' interpretations are good, and coherent to previous movies, but it's a shame the writers (or maybe re-writers? Veronica Roth, books writer, did an excellent job) didn't use all of the potential of Nita and Matthew.They also had some bad decisions. Objects are supposed to act always the same (as an example, ice always floats on the surface of water) but the re-writers decided it would be a good idea to make that object act differently in different places (like 100 meters away).If you like the book series, go watch it. If you LOVED it, probably you'll hate this movie. If you liked the previous movie, you should watch it to get the story complete. If you didn't like the previous movie, this was no much better and you won't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunately NOTHING like the books.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a die hard book fan, so when it comes to movies I am always a bit dubious. The directors always change things and drop characters or snippets of the book that I love and wish had appeared, however in general you get over it and enjoy the films.However - Allegiant part 1 - may as well be called an entirely different name. It is so different to the book that you will just sit there with your mouth wide open. Now granted I read the books well over a year ago and was watching it thinking my god my memory had got rusty so i re-read the books and my god. The producers have taken Roths idea and then completely re-written it. Characters are lost, massive chunks are missing, but in most cases the whole book has been re-written. If I was Roth i'd be offended because it is nothing like the books - literally nothing.I gave it 5 out of 10 BECAUSE although i was severely disappointed it was nothing like the books and so overly 'Hollywood' i could have cried (poor Four what have they done to him- he's an action man that just fights and fights - no character development whatsoever) but as a stand alone film forgetting the narrative of the book its OK and watchable. If i had never read the books and had only been watching the movies I would have given it a 5/ 10. The characters are lacking development, the CGI is slightly insane and quite unbelievable at times and the film in its need to be face paced clearly leaves lots of gaping holes in the story. The whole thing just feels under-developed.If you are a die hard book fan - definitely give the film a miss you will just be insulted and annoyed.However if you are easy going and don't mind it being an entirely different story to what you expected - go ahead and try and enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a good film but not a bad film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the "earth-shattering" revelations in Insurgent, Tris and her boyfriend decide to go beyond the wall to discover and find a new world which had been separated from them for 200 years.I can see why the negative reviews because of its confusing plot and unsatisfying performances. But I thought this film had some improvements over Insurgent, particularly due to Shailene's performance. The visual effects were not an improvement over Insurgent and I found its predecessor's visual effects more satisfying. A lot of people claim ever since The Hunger Games has finished (which I find it heart-breaking considering I am a big fan), the YA crowd has died. I think Allegiant can improve a lot more but other than that, it's not a film you would want to watch over and over again just to please you but a film that has some subtexts and a plot to explain properly even though it's sometimes confusing and odd, same with its performance. Miles' one wasn't hilarious, he always betrays his companions and then he allies with them again? A bit of an unusual character to side with your haters. Jeff's performance was brilliant, he was able to portray his character fully and properly. He hid his antagonistic behavior until the end which I found it awesome and pleasing. Zoe's performance was appalling, she seemed as if she didn't even care throughout the whole film, she isn't the actor who you'd want to hire in a YA series. Ansel's performance was okay. Wasn't the anticipated person who would be the extraordinary but he wasn't as bad as Zoe's. Everyone else who I did not mention except for Tris, their performance throughout the film was lovely and astonishing.The Divergent Series: Allegiant. The film that has some improvements to overcome before releasing its final stand to governmental issues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Divergent Series:Allegiant-Part 1", starring Shailene Woodley-The Fault in Our Stars, Crossing Jordan_tv; Theo James-Golden Boy_tv, Underworld:Awakening; Naomi Watts-St. Vincent, Eastern Promises and Jeff Daniels-The Martian, Speed.This is the 3rd of at least a 4 part franchise, with this one being divided up into a part 1 &amp; a part 2-like the Harry Potter, Twilight and Hunger Games series did. The first one was Divergent and the second was Insurgent. I thought this was a good sequel because it actually advanced the story line and answered questions. To refresh your memory, this is sometime in the future where Chicago is an oasis in the middle of some kind of devastated wasteland, with a wall surrounding the city keeping it's citizens alive. The people are divided into different groups, depending on their personality traits; the peace lovers, the fearless, the intellectuals and the honest-I think I left out one but you get the idea. At the end of the last one Shailene and boyfriend Theo led a group in revolt against evil dictator Kate Winslet and they won, but then got a clue that more answers may lie outside the walls. Theo's mother, Naomi, has taken Kate's place inside the walls of Chicago and may be heading down a dark path to becoming just as bad as Kate was. Jeff is one of the answers lying outside the walls that Shailene and Theo find after they leave the city. Genetic engineering is another. The action sequences were pretty good-I liked the drone-type discs that were used in different ways. It's rated "PG-13" for action, violence and sexual content-partial nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 1 minute. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Movie - 7</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allegiant is the third movie in The Divergent Series franchise.The film continues exactly from the end of Insurgent to a journey that Tris and Four take to discover what is beyond the wall that surrounds Chicago,an experiment city.To be honest,this film is not great or clever,but if you don't come with maximum expectations you get an enjoyable film with a lot of action and satisfying scenes. The acting was great,there are at least seven characters that are well-known. The only cons that really bothered me in the film were the scenes that were too similar to other young adults movies which you can probably guess.Finally,if you don't come with too much expectations you will receive a 2 hours of an action packed film,which you probably forget at the end of the series.-Ido Yam-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlike Insurgent, it had an actual story but was let down by bad CGI and uninteresting plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So Allegiant is the third film of the Divergent series, an adaptation from one of the many teen post-apocalyptic novels. I really enjoyed the first movie, it was very entertaining and it had a good story and characters and the second one I thought was very weak and it didn't really seem to know where it was going until the last act.Allegiant picks up not long after it's predecessor and follows Tris, Four and a few others venture out beyond the wall. I'll start with the things I liked about the movie; the cast for one thing are still great. I think Shailene Woodley and Theo James still do excellently as their characters and despite Miles Teller's off- screen persona I enjoy watching him act. A new addition to the franchise is Jeff Daniels who looked like he came straight from The Martian to play the same character, but he suits that type of person so I enjoyed his role here. Another thing I always enjoy with these movies is the world building; I like the look and design of both sides of the wall and find it visually interesting every time I see it.Some things that didn't work for me in this movie now. The special effects for some reason, I don't remember it in the previous two films but here quite a lot of the CGI was really noticeable; some of the green screen didn't blend in to well and the flying vehicles sometimes looked a bit video-game quality. It didn't detract too much but it certainly took me out of the movie once or twice.Now I have to say the plot was handled better than Insurgent as it had more of a story and actually did things but overall it just didn't seem as big. Amongst the choppiness, Insurgent had tense simulations and a huge reveal at the end but Allegiant seemed just....Okay. It was comfortable, it was mellow, it didn't seem as impacting or meaningful. Also there were some major points that they kind of just brushed over; scenes and reveals I thought were integral to this world were shown or mentioned but nobody seemed to be that bothered and just accepted it.In the end although Allegiant was better that Insurgent in the sense of pacing and I enjoyed the landscapes and technology they showed, it didn't quite have the level of interest for me and the climax felt like something you'd see in a TV series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never left the cinema before with a meh-feeling. I did that yesterday. The story keeps getting worse. Also why I stopped reading the third book. I do not get why they split it into two movies, because this movie was boring. Some of the acting was awful, and the special effects not that great. And you almost had to laugh when people was killed, because there wasn't any blood. The last part of the movie was a bit thrilling and this was the only great thing about the movie. I would not recommend anyone to go watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film seemed to rely on the success or lack of the previous two films. The storyline was predictable and somewhat boring, as I found myself looking at my watch after about 15 minutes and thought about leaving. It's too bad a film which has potential has to fall so flat. If I had it to do over I would wait for this film to come to DVD. At least with a DVD you can skip to the end. I was just informed that my review needs a minimum of ten lines of text. It's pretty telling that after seeing this film I can't even come up with ten lines of negative or positive things to say. Would I recommend this film to a friend, no, enemy, maybe. The special effects were interesting, the storyline was lacking. All in all the money and time I expended was wasted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved it and can't wait to see the final movie, Ascendant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to watch the movie with my 14 yr. old son and we both enjoyed it very much. My son has read all the books and noticed some changes in it from the book's story but he didn't disapprove of the changes. He and I enjoyed the movie throughout &amp; were left wanting more when the movie was done. The 2 hours this movie lasted went by fast because we were so into it. We are definite that the final installment of The Divergent Series, Ascendant will be spectacular when it comes out next year. I was shocked to later read negative reviews from critics and some moviegoers about the movie. I didn't feel that way at all. It was very good in my opinion. I watched the first two movies and loved them just as much as this one. They all had their own interesting stories and show different story aspects of what can happen in the future in a post apocalyptic city. And Tris &amp; Four have changed so much from the first 2 movies...they are maturing before our eyes. Allegiant wasn't a repetitive story from the first 2 movies. It had its own twist that was satisfying. I guess everybody has their own opinion. To each is own. I myself, really liked the movie &amp; recommend this movie to others. Make sure you watch the first two movies so you understand what's going on in this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely the weakest movie in the franchise so far. It was watchable,but overall it was kind of boring and hard a muddled plot. It felt like a lot of important details were left out and it didn't make a whole lot of sense what was going on.It's far from perfect, especially in the CGI department. it's a fun movie that kept me entertained for it's whole duration. It was helped by my low expectations but overall I think is a big step up from the second movie.Another horrible addition to a horrible franchise. Enough said.

		<shortDescription>Should have stuck to the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the book series, I can say that this movie (which was meant to represent the book sharing its name) did not live at all up to any expectations. In summary the plot line was full of major holes, characters that were crucial in the plot's progression were absent and although the visual effects were well done, that is the only part of the film I think that kept me watching. That and waiting for (spoiler) Tris's death which (spoiler) DID NOT HAPPEN.First of all, I could not understand where some of the scenes were being pulled from. This was especially so in the beginning and included the part where an invisible wall concealed this whole army of people and then Tris and co were led away in orange blobs. I can't even begin to describe how over the top and really, really unnecessary that was. Then the deaths... during the team's escape from Chicago, Tori was tragically shot, "tragic" as an intention but weakly executed. It appeared like such a random event and I couldn't help but cringe as it happened. The layout reminded me way too much of Maze Runner, I feel like this movie was based more on that than on the actual Allegiant book. The effects were just distracting despite being great and really, I don't know how another movie could possibly follow as a part two as basically everything except Tris's death and the death serum happened.I am no expert and my opinions may be overly harsh as I loved the books, but this is how I found the movie to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Divergent Series: Allegiant - Part 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the unbearable torture I suffered with Insurgent, I didn't want to watch The Divergent Series: Allegiant - Part 1. But, well... I decided to risk myself. To my surprise, I didn't dislike the first 20 minutes of The Divergent Series: Allegiant - Part 1. There wasn't too much artificial drama or ridiculously transparent "conspiracies"; and even the exploration of the "outer world" seemed like an intention the venture into the science fiction field which hadn't been taken seriously in the previous films. Unfortunately, after those initial 20 minutes, The Divergent Series: Allegiant - Part 1 turns around itself, and it begins again, so once more, we have a Utopian society with a dark secret and a friendly and comprehensive leader who ends up being the villain. And we find out that the main character, Tris, isn't only special, but also super-special. All that is accompanied by another soporific parade of "action" scenes without any relevance to the screenplay, but ornamented with apparatus and laughably over- designed special effects. In summary: another movie with no rhyme or reason, in which everything happens arbitrarily. The general trick of the screenplay is constantly contradicting itself. Tris is a brave and sensible woman, until she becomes an idiot in order to swallow the villain's lies. The futuristic technology is practically magical... but the character Four solves everything hitting people, because that's the only thing he knows to do. And even though the (absurd) origin of the factions and its (questionable) purpose is finally revealed, it doesn't solve everything for being so arbitrary (SPOILER: everything is reduced to "genetic manipulation", an absolutely vague term to explain everything without explaining anything). I think this is the end for me; there's one film left in this saga (Ascendant), but I really don't think I'm going to watch it, because I have already wasted too much money and time in this franchise. In conclusion, The Divergent Series: Allegiant - Part 1 is a piece of junk; and I don't think I'm saying this only for my "embittered old man" condition; it even seems that director Robert Schwentke gave up, and he left the film in the hands of the special effects artists: "Do whatever you want; the more money you spend, the better". Needless to say, it will be a box office success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once the gang of survivors crosses the desert, they essentially enter into another franchise altogether.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>History repeats itself. It's not a new idea, and it's certainly not an original thought for a cinematic, dystopian future. But this franchise insists upon reusing it, not just in the arc of the multi-part story but also within each individual chapter. Here, the rise and fall of one oppressive dictator is simply replaced by another, almost as if the band of rebellious heroes must continue to participate in a coup d'etat routine, not unlike the repetitious adventures of "The Hunger Games' star Katniss. History - and teen science-fiction - clearly opt for do-overs at every turn.Previously, the city of Chicago stood as the last remaining civilization after an apocalyptic nuclear war. But its very existence has been revealed to be nothing more than a master plan of peace for its test subjects, implanted in the rigid social structuring of physical and psychological factions, in an attempt to keep humanity alive. It's a massive experiment, and its success is dependent on keeping people in the dark.But divergent insurgent Tris (Shailene Woodley) and her boyfriend Four (Theo James) don't intend to sit around as usurper Evelyn (Naomi Watts) and rival Johanna (Octavia Spencer) scrap over the spoils of a divided society. Instead, they're determined to discover what lies outside the great wall constructed around Chicago, supposedly erected to protect them from the irradiated wastelands beyond. Could it be an anarchic civilization of warring cannibals? Or a welcome party of technologically advanced alien beings?The way this film works, it could be anything. Once the gang of survivors crosses the desert, they essentially enter into another franchise altogether. Refusing to play by any of the rules it sets up, "Allegiant" invents new things spontaneously, each more incongruous than the last. If it's not blatantly stealing from properties like "Mad Max: Fury Road," it's reworking concepts seen in numerous other postapocalyptic teen thrillers. It certainly doesn't help that this series' release dates are alternated with other ongoing young adult book adaptations - hoping to capitalize on the trend but also confusing viewers in the process. And splitting this last novel into two parts, as is the expected thing to do of late, further endorses hackneyed derivations and the possibility of duplicating its own story lines. In many ways, it's as if novelist Veronica Roth enjoyed such success with her first book that she felt forced into writing further tales, even if the inspiration and substance were woefully absent.With armed conflict comes the need for tense escapes and confrontations; action and adventure are right around every corner. But every scene seems to highlight the carelessness, the recklessness, and the stupidity of trained soldiers letting their guard down to fall for the same tricks over and over again. The film builds little mysteries and oodles of unanswered questions to the point of aggravation rather than suspense, specifically as it engages in the echoing of betrayals, motives, and viewpoints. The inconsistencies in all of this are staggering, from the injuries that come and go, to the technology that can be powerful or ineffective in the exact methods necessary to advance protagonist movements, to the trustingness of characters who would never exhibit such good faith. But perhaps the most unforgivable element is the dialogue, which grows worse with each passing line. Some of the conversations are so ridiculous (and anachronistic, regardless of whatever universe or time period this is supposed to take place) that they're laugh-out-loud funny - entirely unintentionally.

		<fullReview>Allegiant picks up 3 weeks (as far as I can tell) after the event of Insurgent which saw the Factionless and Dauntless break the power of Erudite and reveal the true purpose of their society, the city and the wall.Tris hears the call of society beyond the wall and has to know. Four is by her side. The city is in barely contained order. The peace is fragile and the trials of Jeanine's accomplices only serve to break the tentative coalition of Factionless, Kandor and Amity leadership rather than solidify a new order.The city needs help and Tris is sure the answer lies just beyond the walls Evelyne (Four's mother and leader of the Factionless) has put on lockdown. Of course she, Four, Christina, Peter and Caleb escape and find out the truth. Or part of it. Intrigue and mystery pursues.The story was good but I have questions, gaps I want filled. The acting was fantastic as usual, the tension between characters palpable. It was however predictable. Only one plot point surprised me and in fact is the part I have the most questions regarding. We saw very little of Christina in this film. I don't know if she had scenes cut, or just wasn't as vital to the plot in this first half of the finale, but I hope to see more of her in Ascendant (Allegiant Part 2).Full review available at www.confessionsofastorylover.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They escaped, they were safe, they were lulled. For some the two hundred-year old experiment was hijacked by opportunists. Look, the USA is 200 years old and has returned to an oligarchic, class-conscious system that we were trying to escape in 1776. All experiments gradually move to one extreme or another.Let's see. Hunger Games divides the people by economic production going to the center. Free Trade is one product buying other products. A flow and an interaction. Instead the center provides Bread and Circuses (Panem et circenses) to lull the masses with competition between the Districts. Division and domination.Divergent. The people in Chicago are divided by dominant characteristics will no unification into a whole person (think Inside Out, one emotion helps the other).The lulling comes outside the city. No violence. Good clothes and food but strange living accommodations. The reason for the Chicago groupings comes out slowly. People don't remember how it started, but the elite knows and uses it to feather their nests outside of Chicago.The last entry in this series should ramp up. I liked the acting and the story. It couldn't be whiz bang violent because usurpers are more subtle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond the Wall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2014, we were introduced to a dystopian world and a girl who had a choice that could not only transform her, but the way she lived. In 2015, that girl who knew who she was, was in danger of losing everything she loved dearly and that choice nearly destroyed her. In 2016, that choice that transformed Tris Prior and that nearly got her destroyed has now defined who she was. Allegiant is all about the choice that has defined Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley). She was just a girl when we first met her, but now she is a woman with her own choices and decisions for her life. No one could have chosen her choice for her. With her parents dead, she and her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort), Four "Tobias" (Theo James), Peter (Miles Teller) and Christina (Zoe Kravitiz) set out to find out what's on the other side of the wall. What they find out, well, I don't want to spoil the movie for you, but I will say that Kate Winslet (Jeanine Matthews) and the wonderful talented actor Jeff Daniels (David) make incredible enemies. With Allegiant, Robert Schwentke, along with its predecessor Insurgent, the sense of drama, the sense of action, the sense of adventure, the sense of the dystopian Chicago was exceptionally well done. We hate to see you go Robert, but you are an exceptional director. With Ascendant, coming up, it is bound to be jaw-dropping riveting. So will the choice of Tris Prior come back and haunt her or will it be enough to fight the war to save the one thing that she loves and lives for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best One Yet! Allegiant is as close to perfect as Dystopian movies can get!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Me and my Sister, who is a fan of the Divergent Series, made our way into an advanced showing of Allegiant tonight at 7:00pm. I was filled with excitement to know another Divergent movie was coming out and I couldn't wait to continue the adventures of Tris and Four.The movie blew my expectations away.This is the best Divergent movie yet, it's as close to perfect as a Dystopia can get and it's right up there with The Giver. Fans will surely love it but critics will probably not enjoy it as much as they don't know much about the series. The movie has a 36 on Metacritic I think? But I wasn't bothered by the reviews. Anyways, Tris, Four, Caleb, Christina and Peter make their way out of Chicago and beyond the wall where they are found by a bureau who wants to cure damaged people (AKA The People of Chicago) by using a serum that will wipe out all their memories. Unfortunately, Four and Tris are not into that plan so it's up to them and the rest of the gang to stop David from Blinding Evelyn into using the serum on the rest of Chicago. I became a fan of Divergent when the first movie came out. Then I became more of a bigger fan when Insurgent came out. Allegiant hits all the right buttons to make a exciting and fun movie with a point about dividing races and people into groups. Allegiant uses clichés and makes them new, the predictability is there, but invisible, the story is unoriginal, but fresh. It breathes a whole new life into a film that has already been done before and it's one of it's greatest strengths. Shaliene Woodley still continues to be a better actress then Jennifer Lawrence in The Hunger Games Movies. Again as I was talking about in my Insurgent Review, she is an actress who just want to make movies for the fun of it. Not to win any sort of award, just to act, please audiences and hopefully gain a fan base. She is successful on all levels. The characters are even better than before. I love Peter (Miles Teller) He is likable, a joker, a funny-man, a confused man, a man who is lied to, who is tricked, who is selfish, it's a completely three dimensional character. Speaking of which, all the characters I found to be completely three, if not four dimensional.Allegiant is bigger than the last two films, having being set in two places, The Outside World where we have the bureau and Providence and Chicago. The designs of Providence and the Bureau are absolutely stunning, some of the sets even have some sort of symbolism. The visuals are great with Providence being the film's high point in special effects.Last but not least, the movie is very, very intelligent. The film has a great message, it has relationships that are never one sided, it has the ability to be brave, it never stops there. Allegiant right now is my favorite movie of 2016 and the definitive Spring Break Movie for Youths who want to see outstanding film- making. Director Robert Schwentke leaves us before the final film Ascendant, but he manages to make the story even better than it already was. Allegiant is a must see.93/100 A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the last</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is much better than the last one, which mind you, doesn't say much. It has a promising start, with two sides fighting for power/control and our heroes stuck in the middle trying to figure out which side to choose, A or B. Eventually they choose C: leaving. Here is where it starts to get bad. The CGI is quite terrible, B level really. And the colours feels like a scene out of a fantasy video game. The scenes in the 'waste' were so terrible, and the scenes in the 'helicopter' were even worse. You can catch a glimpse of what I mean in the trailer. But the plot, even though predictable, is still good. Not better than Divergent, but much better than Insurgent.This movie doesn't offer many answers, none actually to questions like "whose really out there", "who is left", "how did they survive", "why isn't the world united", "who controls who", "whats up with Tris mom", "whats the deal with Tris", "how are some places protected without anyones knowledge", "how did this happen", "why did this happen", "why is Fours mom doing what she's doing" .. I suppose they will answer all that in the grand finale. The action sequences, even though a few, are also good. I honestly wish there was more, because all action was just Four doing hand to hand combat. Wish there were more of the other two girls fighting. I was just mostly disappointed in Shailine Woodly's character and performance when they left Chicago but she picks up towards the end. Her performance was just dead, she barley had any emotions for most the movie, she just had one expression: flash her big beautiful eyes and her poker face. All in all, an improvement over the last one, but I was losing interest and focus in some scenes here and there. Perhaps the next instalment needs a better director and definitely better CGI and better acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This Saga Definitely Goes From Worse to Worse"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Insurgent" was witnessed the truth revealed in the dystopian city of Chicago, now "Allegiant" is divided into two parts (thanks) and this time we will finally discover who is beyond the wall, excited? Sorry but the discouragement will come very soon. After an intriguing and almost perfect start (first 10 minutes) emotion descends to an abysmal speed. "Allegiant" is the adaptation of the third and last part (except for "Four: A Story Collection") best-seller preferred by young people and adults written by the novelist Veronica Roth. The thrill of another big franchise of juvenile literature (The Hunger Games) has already disappeared, so it's time that other successful saga filled that void. Many secrets are revealed but not in the way in which the reading audience and film wanted.Tris (Shailene Woodley), Four (Theo James) and his friends (Miles Teller, Zoe Kravitz, etc) decide to discover that there are outside and after some shooting, a stupid death and nothing more, they succeed, It's... They run and find a road, after a chase and a beautiful strange rain arrive at your new home (Wink). The film can not move satisfactorily and its stagnation is inevitable, forgetting its future promising and intriguing.As usual in the previous films, its main dramatic core is the revelation of a truth or a death, this time open the scene of red Earth with a cinematically so poor and so unnecessary death that showed fatigue and exhaustion of the director for not making more adaptations and disappoint and anger the entire audience, all.After this fatal and horrible error, we see how is the abroad. I think that this is time where "Summit Entertainment" and "Lionsgate" already have reaped profit and enough money to provide us a few sequels with visual quality, unfortunately the outside seemed to be a prospect of "Jupiter Ascending" with futuristic touches, it was funny see the changing of the atmosphere of Chicago (it was quite realistic) of the abroad with radiation. Sci-fi films have a lot of work in the visual part since if they do not give credulity and eloquence with its environments the story drops off precipitously.Another one of the main attractive that had juvenile hearings for the saga was its exciting sequences of action by Tris and Four, this installment did not have nothing action, tasked raise all narrative history aside from that emotion and war that we were used. It is harassing and annoying the harmless and silly conflict internal in Chicago, after the departure of Tris and Four, sorry but I hear laughs as the film progressed.Analogically, "Allegiant" is like a famous reality American show which airs weekly, but this reality show already this very exhausted and burned so they decide to get to the end, all the chips are already in place, so spectators until next week to learn the fate of the dystopian world. It could maybe happen as "Mockingjay Part One and Two" where the first disappointed and worried fans but the second recovered what was lost and closed the franchise in the best way, we dream, is the only thing we can do.This doesn't feel like Tris, this doesn't feel like "Divergent", I think that it's necessary completion of the saga (Ascendant), more pain there can be no. Suddenly this strategy of divide it into two installments was a dirty move of the study to only make more money before the end. It was the decision of the director ( Robert Schwentke) to reject the last part since the job done just right and enough, a frightening close we don't want, we want something that is worthwhile. All these unknowns will be solved in June 2017 with "Ascendant" end. Only is expected a good outcome for our reality show because not only Chicago is destroying itself, the same movie is doing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fans of the book see the deeper concept of Allegiant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The people giving Allegiant low scores I don't think truly understand the concept of this franchise. Allegiant has definitely strayed away from the book, but I think the concept that Roth put forth in the book is still portrayed in this film- just with a different angle on the storyline. The acting is exceptional in this film, with such a strong cast portraying these characters in such an honest and conventional-breaking way. What I particularly like about this film was that Tris and Four have conflicting views once entering the Bureau, with Four seeing the gritty side of this society, and Tris experiencing the ambitions of the elite. Theo James' performance was absolutely amazing, bringing out the deeper and more sensitive side of Four whilst maintaining a strong figure head in the film. What I would however say needs improving on this film is to see more of Tris- Shailene Woodley is such a strong and influential actor, who I thought needed more screen time as she is the protagonist. However much I loved this film, I believe that the producers don't give the book justice, it seems that they make it for purely money, and not for what the book and the actors can truly portray. It is clear in interviews that the actors may also feel the same, but this film is definitely not just a 'lesser version of the Hunger Games', it's entertaining and has lots to offer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't listen to the negative reviews and critics on this film - go see it for yourself. I'm skeptical if the critics even watched the movie, because I was completely blown away from beginning to end. It was absolutely incredible. Wonderful actors, tons of action, and great plot. I'm definitely going to be seeing it again.Be prepared for a major cliffhanger at the end of Allegiant! I can't wait for the next (and unfortunately last) movie of the series that is scheduled for June of 2017! The only problem with the film is that we have to wait a whole year before the next installment!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE DIVERGENT SERIES: ALLEGIANT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The third part in 'THE DIVERGENT' film series; and the first half of an adaptation on the third (and final) book 'Allegiant' (written by Veronica Roth). This movie has Tris and Four escaping through the wall, encircling the dystopian Chicago, and finding a new advanced society of people, that have been studying them for years. The film has Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Miles Teller, Ansel Elgort, Zoe Kravitz, Maggie Q, Jonny Weston, Ocatvia Spencer and Naomi Watts all reprising their roles (from earlier films); and Jeff Daniels joins the cast. It was directed by Robert Schwentke; and scripted by Bill Collage, Adam Cooper and Noah Oppenheim. I enjoyed it quite a bit. This chapter begins with Evelyn (Watts) taking control of Chicago; after murdering Jeanine (played by Kate Winslet, in the previous movies), at the end of the last installment. Her soldiers prevent everyone from leaving the city, and begin executing Jeanine's conspirators. Tris (Woodley) and Four (James) rescue Tris's brother, Caleb (Elgort), from being killed. They then decide to break through the wall, locking them in the city, and see what's beyond it.I was a big fan of the first 'DIVERGENT' movie, and really enjoyed the second film as well (although not quite as much). I think this installment is about as good as 'INSURGENT'. I'm not sure why the reviews are so harsh (or why the Box Office has dropped off, so much), but I really like it. It's a lot of fun, the visuals are spectacular, and the action scenes are awesome (they're actually an improvement over the previous chapters). Woodley, James and Watts all give great performances (once again), and the story is involving (and mostly fast-paced). I think fans of the series should be more than pleased.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/vlqkdyuq2zY</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better than the Monotonous Insurgent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming to the third installment, the trilogy is mimicking the tones of the Twilight series except the fact that the Divergent has a much better story telling. The film rebounds from Insurgent's monotonous narrative, kicks in a lot of action sequences and further expands into a broader external universe. In this 120-minutes of adventure, it just has too much to tell compared to the first two episodes - the civil war within the city and the tactical games outside the world; the fast- pacing plot reduces a lot of usual unnecessary romantics but it does not sufficiently compensate to explain properly the politics, causing it to be slightly confusing of all the hidden intentions. The visual effects improve by a margin while the scores composed by Joseph Trapanese are strong and entertaining. The bio-science theory might be underwhelming due to diversion from its original novel, however it's still overall a solid final part one young teen adaptation compared to the successful Hunger Games series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allegiant is very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw tonight the 3rd part of Divergent. And I was bluffed by the scenario, the acting of the characters essentially. Last year, I saw the 2nd part without knowing the plot. And I just caught up this week by viewing the 1st part and re-watching "Insurgent" to have a fresh feeling. And I don't regret it. "Allegiant" is more cerebral, there's less action I think. The political and philosophical aspects of the story are better explained here. I liked to see the characters play their part independently, to see them struggle with their own issues. Even if their problems are intertwined with the others. They are a perfect team of saviors. Jeff Daniels as David is excellent. We can see that Tris and Tobias have matured a lot. They still form a great pair. The visual and FX effects were amazing. And finally, just as a joke, it was pleasant to not listen the name Jeanine pronounced so often (my name is "Jeanine").</fullReview>

Quite an intro. Love Shailene Woodley. Love Theo James. I was not their fans before this movie. I don't even know them. Though i'm a movie goer. I watch movies almost every day. Its quit surprising to see some negative reviews for this movie. I guess lately many surprising thing happened.. Like the d***pool movie can even make box office. Thats a huge shocker considering that actor swears a lot. Just cant figure out what is too see in that movie. Anyway.. Hope to see more of this franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i thought it was your horrid directing that ruined 'insurgent' but in reality it was the truly awful writing. you have redeemed yourself with 'allegiant'. A+. In 'Insurgent' there was a lot of action for the sake of action. In 'Allegiant' it makes sense for the storyline. I went to a conference for writing where I met the screenwriter for 'divergent', Evan Daugherty, and he told me that for 'Insurgent', they tried to appeal to men more My understanding is the original director, Neil burger, left the franchise because Lionsgate wanted to take the series into a more action packed direction. if this is true, that was a BIG mistake. Admittedly, as a girl, i fell in love with 'divergent' for the love story of Tris and four. In 'Insurgent', they barely act like a couple except for one scene. In 'Allegiant' they do a much better job of balancing the relationship vs. what's going on in the world around them. Also to the people comparing this to the book, while i enjoyed 'allegiant', everyone else seemed to hate it so what is everyone's problem with the changes that were made? sure there were some things i was disappointed with, like not delving into the Natalie and Andrew back story like the book does. i hope ascendant does this, but the way they left this movie I don't think that will happen. Either way, I'm glad I gave this movie a chance again after 'Insurgent'. THE DIVERGENT SERIES IS BACK ON TRACK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the first one being great and the second one being decent, I expected this to be somewhere on the same level as the second one. Now they don't have a good source material at all so I can understand if they didn't know what to do with this movie. It follows the book surprisingly well, I mean it's not really faithful but it followed the book more than I expected. This is actually Allegiant - Part 1 with Allegiant - Part 2 being named Ascendant and this one left being just Allegiant. But all they have got left for Ascendant is the ending of the book, so I guess Ascendant will mostly be an original story. But I just think they shouldn't have followed the story of Allegiant as much as they did because the plot of Allegiant is like watching Mr. Bean trying to be super smart. It's surprisingly faithful to the book in the first two acts and that's why the movie seems bad during that time. But don't give up watching because the third act is actually pretty good. The effects are mediocre but there are some cool designs. The acting is also mediocre, except for Jeff Daniels, he's excellent. Woodley is decent, but she, like many actors from the previous movies, looks tired of this franchise. Theo James is probably the only one who was in previous movies that actually seems to enjoy playing the role because he was better than ever in this one. But still, there is nothing extraordinary or remarkable in this movie.Watch this only if you're a fan of the series because it's really nothing special. It's not bad, but it's far, far away from being good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie. The reviews and ratings given by harsh critics do not do this movie justice! I really liked how they didn't leave it on too much of a cliffhanger for the second part, yet still made the last movie something to look forward to. I also really like how the movie was different from the book, giving us another look at the outside world in the form of a movie. The way that Tris' character wasn't the main focus of the movie really helped make it different from other YA series like The Hunger Games and Twilight. I also loved Peter's character. I thought splitting Tris and Tobias up for part of the movie was an interesting yet effective choice made by the directors. This movie is definitely a must-see!</fullReview>

But I guess I'm just one to stick to the books. But all together This is a wonderful movie and I would say that everyone should watch it just because of the story line and the way their lives are compared to ours.

		<fullReview>Stylistically it's a good movie, the shots, the imagery and the tech within the film make it just a tad better than the previous; and while the tension is there, baked by an amazing cast, this movie a just too long and a little on the boring side to keep the audience entertained for a two hour film.That isn't true, and there is action, but the movie slows down a lot, letting some of the built up tension slip away to have the dialogue and inconsequential scenes bore the viewer. Again, on a directional front, it is a wonderful film, they way the visual effects artistsThat isn't to say that it's a bad movie, it's not, it certainly does give the audience something to think about when it comes to segregation, because at the end of the day, this is a story about destroying those barriers that tore families apart and kept people from uniting. It was a destructive soci9ety that reflects real life history. So in that respect it was well written. But it's long. That is the biggest problem with the film, the way it tediously stretches out the story, adding in big name stars to expand the franchise. That is not always a good decision. Just look at The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, the best example of a film that was stretched out into TWO two and a half hour movies when it could have just been one film altogether. I'll leave most of my reservations until I see Ascension, but as of right now, it is not looking good.Then there is the dynamic between Shailene Woodley and Theo James. Both of them fit the parts they were given, but their chemistry sometimes lacks. It's easier to believe that these two are friends, not lovers. Which is great, yay, they have chemistry, but not the kind of chemistry needed for this film. Could it have been worked around better? Probably, but I'll give casting credit for casting two people who fit the characters. Woodley also does this thing when she acts where it's not quite overacting but her face scrunches up as if she's about to go into a panic attack. It's not appealing on both a skill lever or an aesthetic one. Their romance was more believable when they were apart than together, which is a shame.And Naomi Watts, honestly she is the biggest flaw in this movie and that's not her fault. It felt as though the writers here didn't know how to translate her motivation from the book to the film. Despite a great performance, her character felt all over the place. One moment her motivation is one thing and the next moment it's another. Honestly the writers were not clear at all about what Evelyn wanted to gain from everything. Peace? Equality? Power? It was a mess.I will say this though, Miles Teller was great, easily one of the best parts of the film. The character in the first novel wasn't appealing at all, just a coward, and Teller does bring that to the screen, three movies later, but what he does that is very incredible is the fact that he makes this self- centered and self-serving character so appealing. He's on the side that benefits him most. And the portrayal just makes the audience smile because while we may want to hate him, he's just so damn charismatic that watching him on the screen is such a delight.At the end though, the movie did make me more eager to read the novel, if only to get a clearer sense of where this film franchise is heading than anything else. Not the best sign for the film but a great sign for the novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possible a strong start to the conclusion of the Divergent Games</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course, we won't know just how well it finishes until the second part. Surprisingly, The Divergent Series: Allegiant part 1 provides fans with a good start to a well-executed conclusion. After the week sequel, it was quite unexpected that the series would begin to complete this YA series on such a high note. Unlike the disappointing conclusion of The Hunger Games, Allegiant brings back your favorite characters you love and love to hate in a very satisfying ending in the dystopian adventure to rescue a people from themselves. At the end of the day, the Divergent series will never be as successful or generate the same fandom as The Hunger Games; but simply comparing the last two films in both franchises, this is clearly the superior finish (or should be). Although Roth's socio-political themes and subtext were fairly clear, all be it still weak, in the first two films, the message is a little vague and incoherent in Allegiant. Two YA franchises down and one to go. We will just have to see what lies in store for the Maze Runner series. Just like the Divergent series has a week middle, hopefully the weak sequel in The Maze Runner will pave the way for a strong conclusion as well. One thing is for sure, Allegiant contains far more action than the previous films which almost makes the weak and still completely explained plot worth the approximate 2-hour run time.The first part of the final chapter in the Divergent Series takes us beyond the wall into a desolate wasteland. Follow Beatrice/Tris (Shailene Woodley), Four (Theo James), Caleb (Ansel Elgort), Peter (Miles Teller), and Christina (Zoe Kravitz) as they embark on a journey to seek help from the outside in order to stop the civil war in dystopian Chicago (or modern day Detroit). With newly asserted leader of the faction less system Evelyn (Naomi Watts) and Amity turned Allegiant leader Johanna (Octavia Spencer) at odds with one another, war is brewing in the streets and all hell is about to break loose. Barely escaping Evelyn's security team, Tris and her band are rescued by a team from an organization of pure bloods who oversees the "Chicago Experiment." This group of researchers and scientists led by David (Jeff Daniels) recruits Tris and her team to develop a plan to save Chicago, or so they think. When Four discovers what is really going on, he must convince Tris and the rest of her band of rebels to make right what is going incredibly wrong.For me, and I am sure other critics, analyzing this particular series, The Hunger Games, and Maze Runner gets boring. Because, for the most part, they all have the same plot, same fallacies, and similar subtext. They are all extremely socio-political methods to spread the message that only teenagers are special and are capable of saving the world from corrupt adults. Although these movies are aimed at Generation Z (anyone born after 1995), they still attract attention from Y/Millennials (~1982-1994) and Generation Xers (~1965-1981). That is important because Generation Z does not have the spending power that generations X and Y do. In order to maximize the income potential of the films, the studios have to appeal to Generation Zers in such a way that it will also bring their Millennial friends and potentially Generation X parents. Since schools are constantly preaching the message that teenagers are the future, they are special, and uncontaminated by the greed of the world, it makes since to create films based on books that carry that theme. The negative side effect to this approach is creating a generation(s) that automatically distrust adults and their respective decisions regarding the environment, politics, and society. Just as Allegiant depicts what happens when there is such great division among a people who view the approach to peace so very differently will devolve into a war-like state, it's entirely possible that reinforcing this division between Generation Z and X/Y could symbolically arrive at the same precipice.The production value and design in Allegiant definitely outshines the prior two installments. That is important due to the fact that Roth's political subtext definitely becomes a little muddled in this last chapter. Although there is definitely way too much cheesy CGI, it is far less than the previous film. And other than some of the outlandish technology used in the story, for the most part, the defense, security, and surveillance technology used by the various characters makes sense and is perfectly believable in their universe. There is even a real reference to 21st century earth's scientists experimenting with the human genome. That helps to create a sense of futuristic realism in the Divergent universe. One of the biggest problems I have with the plot is the still unexplained history of how exactly the Chicago experiment began. Perhaps the director and writers did not feel it was necessary to provide a clear history through character exposition, but I am still a little confused as to how the Pure Bloods and Damaged became so incredibly separate. Another thing, if there are thousands (if not millions) of Pure Bloods in existence, then why use the Chicago Experiment as a method to see if a Pure Blood can be born out of all of it??? I guess that is why it's not worth overly analyzing films such as this one.For what it's worth, Allegiant is an exciting start to the last chapter in the Divergent Series! Far more entertaining than the last one. If you were disappointed by Mockingjay Part 2 than rest assured that you will definitely enjoy the conclusion of this franchise. Not a bad way to spend your Spring Break or an afternoon over the weekend. But, I wouldn't bother seeing this film in IMAX or 3D. However, I can see some benefit to the experience of this film by watching it in a D- Box auditorium.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful film... I had more fun watching this then on my wedding night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I hate most of the Asylum's movies with a passion, I keep watching because there is something somewhat entertaining about their awfulness and also there's a glimmer of hope that they'd do something halfway tolerable. The Asylum oddly enough have made a few tolerable movies though the best they get is only decent. Jack the Giant Killer is not the worst from them, but it is still really bad. It looks amateurish from a starting point. Watching the costumes, sets and props I didn't and still don't have a clue about what time period the movie was supposed to be set in, and the laughable special effects(especially with some of the worst dinosaur, seemingly poor and personality-less substitutes for giants, effects I've seen for any movie) and editing that looks that someone was having a drug hallucination are no better. The music sounds weird, is not memorable in the slightest and doesn't fit at all. The dialogue is stilted and often sounded like senseless babbling with the actors clearly struggling to get their words out, it also has a lot of cheese and this is when the murky sound is not drowning it out too much. The story, aside from it having a complete lack of originality and borrowing heavily from the likes of Jurassic Park and Aliens, is a structurally thin bore that doesn't make sense or have any charm, fun, wonder, thrills or heart. In my mind, the attempt to mix a Grimms fairytale-like atmosphere with a quasi- modern twist also didn't gel. The characters are annoying and never developed, they're just there for the sake of it. The acting is poor, Jamie Atkins badly under-performs to the point that his performance is lost amidst everything else. Ben Cross and Jane March(who actually gives the movie's best performance) fare better but are severely under-used so while they try hard their characters just don't register and they don't bring much particularly new to them either. To conclude, not The Asylum's worst but has nothing to recommend it apart from perhaps Jane March's beauty. 1/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Damaged As They Are Saying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second sequel in "The Divergent Series" entitled "Allegiant" finally lets our non-conformist heroine Tris Prior and her quartet of companions escape from Chicago. The Summit Entertainment/Lionsgate franchise kept Tris and company confined to the ravaged Windy City metropolis in both "Divergent" (2014) and "Insurgent" (2015), while the five factions vying for dominance collapsed after Jeanine's conspiracy to destroy another group Abnegation. "Divergent" did a first-rate job of forging the franchise, formulating those antagonistic five factions, and furnishing us another gorgeous gal with gumption. The audacious "Insurgent" ensued and shattered the quasi-peace that existed among those five factions. Actually, one faction had been obliterated by "Insurgent" so four remained, but the cohesion of those factions was coming apart at the seams. Now, in "Allegiant," with only two groups of survivors locking horns and a civil war threatening, our heroine and her pals take it on the lam, scale the wall, and plunge beyond Chicago into an irradiated wasteland to confront the Founders control the city and its inhabitants. Although I read the novel "Divergent," I skipped both "Insurgent" and "Allegiant," so I have no idea how faithfully the filmmakers have adhered to author Veronica Roth's post-apocalyptic, young adult trilogy. Predictably, nothing happens to either Tris or Four, and this constitutes a problem with "Allegiant." After the superb "Divergent," where both of protagonist's parents perished, and then "Insurgent" eliminated two major villains, "Allegiant" struggles to maintain sufficient tension despite its plethora of action scenes. Indeed, the loss of Jeanine?an awesome adversary by any standard in "Divergent" as well as "Insurgent"--and the two lackluster substitutes for her?Evelyn and David?undermines this less above-average sequel. Moreover, neither Jeff Daniels nor Naomi Watts as David and Evelyn respectively can overshadow for Jeanine's villainous presence. Further, the loss of a second villain, Eric (Jai Courtney of "Terminator Genisys"), in "Insurgent" proves almost as irreplaceable. Strong sci-fi action scenes mustering futuristic aircraft and infantry hardware bolster the storyline, but the absence of dastardly villains diminishes the friction."Insurgent" director Robert Schwentke knows how to stage adventurous action with computer generated special effects, and he flaunts his expertise with a crackerjack opening sequence. Initially, we learn (as if we didn't know) Jeanine and her oppressive regime are dead and gone. Jeanine's lieutenants aren't alive for long. A defiant Max (Mekhi Phifer of "Dawn of the Dead") suffers the wrath of the downtrodden that he rode roughshod over for Jeanine. Chicago's new leader, Evelyn (Naomi Watts of "King Kong"), stages tribunals to punish the guilty. Evelyn's chief lieutenant, Edgar (Jonny Weston of "Taken 3"), caps Max in the back of the head after the crowd gives a thumbs-down signal for Max to bite it. Of course, we hear the explosive blast of Edgar's revolver, but Schwentke doesn't show the bloody obliteration of Max's noggin. After all, the Motion Picture Producers Association rated "Allegiant" PG-13 "for intense violence and action, thematic elements, and some partial nudity." The next candidate awaiting execution is none other than Tris' brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort of "Carrie"), and he pleads for mercy. Four (Theo James of "Underworld: Awakening") uses his position as Evelyn's son to haul a cowering Caleb out of jail, fake his death, and then spirit him out of the city. Tris (Shailene Woodley of "The Descendants"), Christina (Zoë Kravitz of "After Earth"), Tori (Maggie Q of "Priest"), and Peter (Miles Teller of "The Maze Runner") accompany them. The suspense in this scene you make you squirm. Too late, Edgar discovers Four's treachery and mobilizes manpower to pursue Tris and company. Evelyn warns Edgar to bring back her son alive.Our heroic quintet imitates Batman and Robin from the 1960s era "Batman" television show. After they fire grappling hooks at the fence atop the wall, they hoist themselves vertically up the wall by means of wires that reel them in to the top of the barricade. Unfortunately, nothing is a picnic, and Tris has to brave a barrage of gunfire from Edgar and company after she learns that Evelyn electrified the fence at the top of the wall. Indeed, Evelyn has become every bit as autocratic as Jeanine; she has sealed off Chicago so nobody can set foot outside of the city. If you missed "Insurgent," you should know Tris received a message from the Founders on the far side of the wall inviting her to visit them. Tris blows up the truck pumping electricity into the fence, and our heroic horde crosses the wall. Tragically, one of the quintet doesn't survive. Later, our weary warriors find themselves trudging through a bleak, forbidding, Martian-like landscape. As it turns out, humanity waged a nuclear war some 200 years ago. The skies shower them with toxic red rainfall, and then they encounter trigger-happy Edgar again as he careens after them in gleeful pursuit. Edgar gets the surprise of his life when the landscape in front of him magically changes, like a huge mirage, to reveal an army of infantry and aerial assault craft hovering on the other side. The soldiers welcome our heroes and transport them back to a glittering city on the site of what once was O'Hare International Airport. Tris meets the well-dressed head of the Bureau of Genetic Welfare, David (Jeff Daniels of "Gods and Generals"), who claims that he has been watching her with an elaborate surveillance systems since her birth.Mind you, "Allegiant" is another example of those novels that the studio split into two parts to boost box office receipts. Consequently, it may be presumptuous to criticize "Allegiant" for lacking the tenacity of its predecessors, since the third sequel will finalize everything. Indeed, like previous franchises, including "Harry Potter," "Twilight," and "The Hunger Games," studios were reluctant to conclude their cash cows. Unlike the second lackluster "Hunger Games," "Allegiant" propels the narrative forward, pits our protagonists against perils galore, and introduces new obstacles, without giving away entirely everything left to come in the final film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grand looking but weak story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is visually grand although the story feels weak. From the frying pan into the fire - is the main theme. Bit pointless back and forth when you think of it. Good points: Visually this movie exceeds the last 2 by far. Leaving Chicago we get to see some post apocalyptic scenes and a very modern O'Hare airport. Liked the helicopters. Naomi Watts is much more watchable than Kate Winslet. She is amazingly young looking for her age - how could she be Theo James's mother? A generally photogenic multi racial cast is easier on the eyes than the other YAF movies. Bad points: Things get a bit dull in the middle. Losing Maggie Q so early was a mistake. She is one of the more convincing actresses for this kind of movie. Ansel and Miles are a bit too lame even after 3 movies.Over all - see it for completion. Much more palatable than the silly and ridiculous Hunger Games finales.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best and Only Sci-fi Divergent Yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8 of 10. The series keeps getting better and it finally becomes science fiction as opposed to just a dystopian alternate reality.The first thing you need to do to fully enjoy this is not read the reviews and especially not the reviews of the book readers. The books may or may not be better. Harry Potter sucks no matter what. The Lord of the Rings is only good if you're a kid who hasn't read anything but a bible, Greek mythology, Dracula, or some other weak horror and fantasy.Here we have a series that seems like little more than imitation Hunger Games complete with an imitation blond girl, but as it turns out, there's more too it and, finally, actual sci-fi.The first 2 films act as a setup for what and why there is a dystopia in addition to not providing any science fiction, so this pays off the way a mystery book with a long plot does, even if the want-to-be book reviewers haven't read enough to develop the needed attention span to put this trilogy together.</fullReview>

It really almost lost me at ten minutes in. I don't think 10=15 minutes in was necessary if you knew the series and premise or not. But here's the thing it was Divergen at it's best as a movie as a whole and really modern day Sci-Fi as a whole. It's hard to awe or shock audience in the realm of Sci-Fi with the technology and evolution of Sci-Fi in general. I like the story and I want to see where it is going. I don't think that as fan of Divergent series you will get short=change as Sci-Fi buffs in general as stand alone yeah but if you know the series consider what is. I for one am really looking forward to the next installment of the Divergent series and who knows the way technology is evolving maybe just maybe we as a human race can appreciate this series underlying theme. Come on Sci-Fi fans how can you really not like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Lucas proved good CG can be done 39 years ago. So why try to build a movie today built on endless CG? The plot was barely discernible and served only to string together endless chases, twisted, lying manipulators and lots of gunfights. Hollywood morons claim to hate guns but they sure love to use them in movies, glorifying the carnage they create. The acting was two dimensional and the outcomes predictable. I actually fell asleep during this borefest. Is this series ever going to end or is it another incarnation of LOST?

		<shortDescription>Just Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be the worst film of the year so far. I haven't seen every film, mind, but I can't think of anything that could have even potentially been worse. I went to see Ride Along 2, and even that steaming turd was better (although admittedly I was black out drunk).I ain't seen the other films in the series cuz they looked like trash, but I saw this one cuz one of my friends could get us in for free. One thing I wasn't expecting was the Kirsten Stewart levels of acting. Almost all of the actors looks like they're bored and don't want to be there. Who can blame them? The script is garbage. Some people on here are talking about character development, and those people should be banned from watching films. There are no characters in this movie. The only characteristics people are given are either angry, cocky or dumb. Respectively, that's Four, Miles Teller's character and Caleb. Speaking of Four, what's up with his name? Apparently it's cuz he's only got four fears? That's dumb. Maybe he's secretly named after the amount of IQ points he has?The romance between Four and Tris would have been laughable if I wasn't so bored. I'm not the most romantic guy in the world, but if true love is hanging out with someone while you both wear bored, hate filled expressions on your weird little faces, I'll give it a pass.There were parts in the film where the people used virtual reality or something, and it made world all glitchy. The effects that were meant to look glitchy and bad were easily better than every other effect in the film.At the end of the film some lady tries to flood the city with memory erasing gas for some reason. I'm not entirely sure why the gas exists in the first place. Apparently it's to brainwash kids or something? Again, not sure. Anyway, it was around this point I wished the movie was real, and that orange gas would suddenly pour into the cinema and erase the past 2 hours of my life from my memory.There are some unintentionally funny moments but overall this film is so dumb and boring I wouldn't even recommend it so someone I hate. I give this movie a 1 out of 10, and it gets that one point from Miles Teller's charisma and some of the set design being alright.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the 2 previous parts of the divergent series and liked insurgent better than divergent. And now Allegiant is also a great addition to the previous movies it has the same rhythm as insurgent:the story's buildup takes the first 30 to 40 minutes of the movie and then you can sit tight and enjoy a good show!! The movie has good action scenes and suspense will overtake you in the last 30 minutes!! I enjoy movies where the plot is good enough to keep me focused for a whole hour waiting to see what's going to happen and enjoying every bit of it. So if you have the same taste I recommend allegiant strongly to you. And I assure you if you liked insurgent before you will not be disappointed by allegiant, it is up to the expectations. I frankly find that the divergent series has continued the right way unlike the hunger games!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright. I must say, this was quite an impressive film. I get that most are over the whole YA adaption thing since The Hunger Games, that I liked a lot, ended. However, that is not a good enough reason to not see this film. The acting displayed in this movie was great. Some say that Shailene Woodley's Face had no 'Emotion' and that there was one monotonous tone to her voice the whole time. This is not true. Her acting was on point along with that of Theo James, Jeff Daniels Naiomi Watts and Octavia Spencer's. The New Characters Nita and Matthew were good in their roles.As for special effects and action, they were top Notch in the whole series. The best action scene (Scalling the wall and escaping from Chicago) was very well helmed with good stunt work and even better editing. The special effects were just fantastic and quite colorful and gave a vivid feel to the film. However there is this one scene where this orange fluid is on her face in the shower. It was hilarious. The plot of the film, to me, was quite interesting and flowed seamlessly. The pacing got a little slow in the middle but began to pick up towards it's end.The Film was better than I thought it would be combining Good acting, special effects, awesome action and a solid enough plot together. I recommend this to be seen in theaters. You will enjoy it just as much as I did if you are a fan of the Divergent Franchise and even if you didn't liked the first two, this one is the best so far. !0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yesterday, i went to Cinema with my friend and see that allegiant is on the premiere. We make a decision to watch it because we think if we watch it later, cinema will be crowded and it's hard to grab a nice seat. I don't know if it's just me or i think that it's not as good as the previous one and it makes a simple conflict becomes messy. The plot is too dragged i think. The fight isn't very interesting and contains a lot of conversation which makes this movie kinda boring. It doesn't have a smooth ending. It looks like you watch a movie and then it's paused just like that. *spoiler Peter is still an annoying bastard and he manages to escape again which i hate the most from this movie. And if you think that Jeanine is gone, you are wrong because there is another person who has same personality like Jeanine but more powerful than Jeanine. I regret myself for watching it on premiere which costs more expensive than the normal one.</fullReview>

But if you're looking for different view of Tris and Four experience beyond the wall, you will not be disappointed. And Miles hands down to you. Dude you make a character like Peter hard to hate. This movie will have you at the edge of you seat and then laugh at the crazy one liners from Miles character Peter. You will also feel the pain of seeing Four and Tris separated for a short time. The only down side is having Tris character change from the being this fighter in the last two movies to one being out all the action. It just doesn't seem to play real to the character. I think Tris would have questioned it more. Absel character Caleb redeemed himself in this movie. Overall I loved the movie and will no doubt see it again and again.

Although stretched shots and silence in the first 30 minutes,there are good entertaining action scenes. So if you a big fan of the series,sure you will accept this part but you will feel that there is not enough perfect,or something is missing..I can blame the director in this point. I'm sure Ascendant will be the brightest part in the series due to switching to (Lee Toland Krieger) as A director. I think it will be a perfect film more than this part and the previous parts.

		<shortDescription>"The Divergent Series: Allegiant" Diverges from the "Allegiant" Novel for Better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've enjoyed the previous two movies in its franchise and read the three novels to prepare me for this film. The third novel ends miserably, and creates a storm among fans. I see that the subtitles "Allegiant - Part 1" and "Allegiant - Part 2" are replaced with "Allegiant" and "Ascendant". Major subtitle changes may lead to major film adaptation changes. "The Divergent Series: Allegiant" proves it.Tris, Four, and their friends go beyond the wall amidst the chaos in their home city Chicago. They arrive in the mysterious Bureau of Genetic Welfare, and there they discover a bigger battle to fight.I really love the action sequences, some good drama, well-done romance, great pacing, and themes. The film talks about diversity, discrimination, human nature, society, science, and genetic engineering. GE is very controversial right now, with its perks and perils. If some youth don't like historical films about prejudice because they think they're boring, tell them to watch this sci-fi action film because it's fast-paced and action-packed. The message is subtly conveyed, not slapped to your face. Watching the film's diversion is quite shocking. However, I highly like it. Splitting a final book in a series into movies meets mixed reaction. But I think it's allowed more time for the novel to unravel.It's fine with me because I enjoyed the movie.The film ends with a cliffhanger, which is very common in movies of film series. The ending feels like from a horror movie because I was shocked with it that I jerked in my seat! Haha! I can't wait for "The Divergent Series: Ascendant" to come out on June 2017!</fullReview>

All the cast give an amazing performance and the movie left me wanting more. My only complaint with the movie was the ending when Evelyn gets shot 3 times and then gets up 5 minutes later and walks around like nothing had happened. Further more everybody who saw her get shot did not seem to think it was strange when she got up and walked around. Apart from this one minor complaint I thought the movie was entertaining from start to finish.If you liked the first two movies you will love this.

Unfortunately, it happens with those critics who wrote negative reviews on this film. I strongly believe that the film, all the Divergent films, are worth seeing. Maybe they are lack of special effects and there isn't a sign of cheap humour but the plot is really exciting. Strongly I believe that the third film is more action-packed than the book. Nevertheless, the story saves its idea to sacrifice yourself to save one's life, to do your best for your homeland and family, to stand for your rights, thoughts and feelings. All these things were perfectly performed by the main actors. So, if you like the films where the idea and feelings are important, come and watch Allegiant!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm fed up of the Divergent series now...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't think much of the first two Divergent films at all, but they did have some moments of fun and/or intrigue from time to time. However, Allegiant, the third instalment, takes the series to a whole new low, by presenting a tedious and non-sensical story filled with poor performances, ugly visuals and disappointing directing.There was pretty much nothing I liked about Allegiant, and I want to talk about what I really couldn't bear most of all: the plot. Up to this point, the Divergent series has been superbly average. A rip- off of The Hunger Games it may be, but it's still managed to provide the world with a few positives, mainly in the shape of Shailene Woodley, as well as a light, simple story arc that you can enjoy if you turn your brain right off.In this film, however, everything suddenly becomes a lot more serious and unnecessarily complex. Whilst continuing the frustrating habit of using too much of its world's vocabulary (which is still pretty difficult to grasp three films in), Allegiant never seems to want you to have any fun. There are a couple of action scenes, but they're too far near the end, and pretty underwhelming anyway.Instead, it's basically two hours of trying to advance the series into something more meaningful than a simple young adult sci-fi, like The Hunger Games did very successfully, but it simply comes off as a drab, poorly-written mess. Attempting to introduce political notions about genetic modification and impoverished nations (but failing significantly), there's nothing in Allegiant to grab onto and enjoy, because it just takes itself too seriously, but doesn't provide the dramatic heft needed for that vibe to work out.There are a heap of other problems here too, namely with the performances. Kate Winslet managed to get out whilst she still could, but the remaining actors here all echo exactly what I felt like watching this film: bored out of their minds. Even Shailene Woodley, whose Hollywood career was really kicked into action by this series, looks fed up, rarely cracking a smile and mumbling her gibberish dialogue throughout.Just like Divergent and Insurgent, there are a lot of A-list actors in here, including Naomi Watts, Octavia Spencer, Jeff Daniels and Miles Teller, but none of them give a performance that looks like they care about what's going on. It's not their fault that this is such a dull story to have to act out, but I'm just pointing out that they don't do much to really improve it even one bit.Finally, I want to talk about the visuals in Allegiant. The first two films have had a very drab and boring colour palette, consisting mainly of grey backdrops, grey outfits, and grey greyness (apart from some scenes in Insurgent which deserve credit), but the third film's attempts to rectify it backfire horribly.If you're a grey fan, there's no need to worry, because there's still a lot of dull imagery here, but what's most painful to look at is the horrible reddish-purpley landscape outside the walls of Chicago. Made worse by heaps of ugly CGI, I was really turned off this film by the atrocious-looking landscape, and it made the film, which I was already not enjoying at all, that little bit more unpleasant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Divergent Series : More of the Same (but worse)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Young Adult Sci-fi genre, The Divergent Series has always been the weakest of them all, but this movie manages to reach a new low ! It seems every episode recycles the same plot, not only from this franchise but also from the more refined Hunger Games series and even from the subpar Maze Runner series. So much so that I found myself mixing all three franchises ! To be honest, all of them are interchangeable. The recipe to a successful YA series is so simple that all you need to do is to slightly change the subplots, the settings and the name of the characters and voila : you get a generic YA trilogy! And if you really want to milk the cow dry, you should make a two-part finale, because, hey, if the public has already seen three of your damned movies, they'll pay for a fourth one, right ? Anyway, I digress, back to this installment then ! To say that the plot is clear as day is an understatement : it is transparent, almost non-existent. Anyone who has seen at least one YA film could have summed up the plot in 3 sentences before seeing this movie.Usually, YA movies have top-notch visual effects, cool futuristic props and spectacular dystopian sets. Well, it seems that their budget got allocated somewhere else because the CGI is second-rate at best. Good sci-fi props and sets have to look and feel like they're real, have a history, a purpose. I would call that "practicality and physicality". Allegiant's sets are cool and beautiful but they fail completely in this regard. Especially those ships ! What about the dialogs and actor's performance then ? They are a few respected and promising actors in here, but sadly their talent is wasted. No real emotions, campy lines and superhero-like fighting sequences : that's what you'll get! This movie is shallow as a puddle, unimpressive and uninspired. Save yourself the price of admission and rewatch a half-decent YA franchise like Hunger Games for example. 3 out of 10.</fullReview>
