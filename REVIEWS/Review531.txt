		<shortDescription>An odyssey of discovery, even self-discovery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sixto Rodriguez, a little known American folk-rock singer/songwriter in the tradition of Bob Dylan and Cat Stevens, released two albums in the early 1970s, Cold Fact, and Coming From Reality but failed to achieve any popularity. Though praised by critics, his haunting songs about love and loss, drugs and politics, such as "I Wonder," "Cause," and "Sugar Man" should have been hits, but, for some reason, were not. After a minor tour in Australia that brought neither success nor recognition, he was dropped from his record label and was not publicly heard from again.Winner of the Jury Prize and the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival, Swedish filmmaker Malik Bendjelloul's moving documentary Searching for Sugar Man investigates the life of Rodriguez who grew up in a run-down working class area of Detroit, Michigan and worked mostly as a manual laborer, singing at night in small, smoke-filled bars. A friend who remembers him at the time says, "There was something mysterious about him. He looked like a drifter." The film demonstrates Rodriguez' striking presence using a mix of songs, interviews with those who knew him or knew about him, animation, and archival photos.Though no one knows exactly how, his albums somehow made their way to South Africa and circulated among white Afrikaans musicians. All of this led to a growing mystique about an artist that no one knew anything about. Rumors began to circulate that, during an unsuccessful concert, he shot himself in the head or died from a drug overdose, but no one knew for sure how he died. The film begins when Cape Town record shop owner and music fan Stephen Segerman, whose nickname "Sugar Man" mirrors one of Rodriguez' most famous songs, meets music journalist Craig Bartholomew-Strydom and the two undertake to investigate what had happened to him.We find out that his album Cold Fact was distributed on a small South African label, that one of his songs, Sugar Man, was banned on the government-run radio station for its drug references, and that the anti-establishment lyrics of his songs such as The Establishment Blues struck a responsive chord with the growing student involvement in the anti-apartheid movement, and led indirectly to the Afrikaner protest musicians of the '80s. When Segerman and Bartholomew begin their investigation to uncover the mystery of Sixto Rodriguez, they take a cue from Watergate and decide to "follow the money." As each layer is unpeeled, it only adds another mystery.Though his albums are said to have sold half a million records, speculation is rife with questions about what happened to the money and an interview with, Clarence Avant, the boss of Motown adds more heat than light. What the music detectives eventually find is not only surprising but extremely poignant, and it is best for viewers to find this out for themselves. The film is an odyssey of discovery, even self-discovery, that is a profoundly inspiring celebration of a man and his music. More than just a film about music and musicians, however, it is about the human condition. Though it reveals its secrets slowly, when it hits you, it is with an astonishing burst of power that you can feel in your bones. Searching for Sugar Man is one of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>West LA Loves Sixto Rodriguez</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Landmark Theatre in West LA is a tough crowd but they were laughing and crying and when it was over they were applauding. This is what movie magic is all about. I wandered in and was blown away. Where can I get the soundtrack?? Holy! Crap!! Sixto is what Dylan could have been. That's right he's better than Bob. Better writer, better vocalist by tenfold. Unlike The Jester this guy never sold out and walked the talk until the bitter end. I've always believed the world's best talent goes unrecognized most of the time but the story of Sixto Rodriguez puts that theory into the "true" category once and for all and I will never doubt it again. Please recognize this man's work! Hopefully his daughters will continue to work toward that end both in the USA and South Africa.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most bizarre true stories in the history of popular music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who would know that an unknown album from an unknown artist in 1970 (Rodriguez) would become a huge phenomenon in South Africa? As big as say, Paul McCartney. Rodriguez himself was never aware of his huge success, as well as most other Americans. This film traces two hardcore fans as they trace clues around the globe trying to find out what happened to this man. Did he commit a gruesome suicide as rumors say? If so, when and where? Almost nothing was known of this mystery man. The film unfolds a story that cannot be believed by any party. Not the South Africans, nor the filmmakers, or any member of the Rodriquez family. A story that you would swear would not be possible in this day and age of digital communications.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of the Best Films Of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to add my voice such as it is to the chorus of accolades for "Searching For Sugar Man". I loved it. It is indeed an incredible true story about a folk singer named Rodriquez who became a sensation in South Africa while remaining in obscurity in his native US. He's not the first person to be given the boot in his hometown (the Bible has something to say on this subject) but upon listening to the wonderful soundtrack of this film it is a sad commentary. There's plenty of humor here as well in this tale of parallel universes: one in which Rodriquez is Elvis and another where he's scarcely a blip on the radar. The film begins as an investigation by curious fans seeking to learn about the whereabouts of Rodriquez and what may have happened to him. The stories circulating about him are not promising but they are undaunted and continue to search for answers. I think everyone who sees "Searching For Sugar Man" will be thankful that they did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long lost gem. Lovely movie and a must for fans of Dylan-esque music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this movie at an advanced screening at the UN during Mandela week and I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the movie and even more enthralled to discover this long, lost gem of music. The movie revolves around an up-and-coming Rock'n'roller from the 70s who recorded two albums and then disappeared into obscurity. His music was lost in the US but by a strange coincidence becomes a cult hit in South Africa and becomes a symbol of rebellion for the underground white, anti-apartheid sub-culture. The documentary is a lovely journey of discovery of the south africans who try to find the roots of this enigma and re-discover his music. I won't spoil too much but for fans of Dylan like music, this might be a long, lost gem and music that perhaps, at least now, deserves more recognition and appreciation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary really grows on you. As the story and the search begins, you slowly but surely get caught up in the narrative. For me the amazing part of this journey is the composure and serenity of Rodriguez himself. Despite the lack of recognition in his own country, he continued to lead a rich life filled with hope and creativity. Just looking at his 3 beautiful daughters is testament to this. The sound tracks are really wonderful and take you back to the 60s and 70s. Another interesting facet of this movie is the exploration of the overthrow of Apartheid. Many who embraced the music of Rodriquez were Africaaners who were looking for change and a better life for everyone in their country. You come out of this movie believing in a better world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By far THE BEST story I have every heard!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a MUST SEE. If you are a musician or songwriter and you have ever questioned the importance of what it is that you do, you need to see this film. This was the most inspiring thing I have ever seen. Aside from the unbelievable story, the cinematography had some very great moments and not to mention a stellar sound track. I am recommending this film to everyone I know. The only drawback is that because it is an indie film, it is very hard to find. It is only playing in one theater in my area (DC), and that's West End. I really hope this films picks up and begins showing in more theaters. Until then, I will continue to promote this film via word of mouth because I believe in it so much. ...Amazing things happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was by far our favorite at the True/False Film Festival in Columbia Missouri this past spring.The delights of "Searching for Sugar Man" are revealed along the way, as the story unspools over decades and continents. I BEG YOU to cover your eyes and ears if you happen to see a trailer at your local indie theater - the art of the trailer is apparently a lost one, and most of the surprises are spoiled in the promotion prepared for this film.The director received a well-earned standing ovation at True/False, and wept - he and other directors said that T/F was the first audience of "real people" to see their respective films, apparently Sundance is peopled with "not real people"?And be prepared to have the music playing in your head for some time to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best music docs ever made! The story about Sixto Rodriguez misfortunes and fortunes is almost to good to be true. It's like a fairy tale, only that this is real life. Swedish film maker Malik Bendjelloul treats the story with great respect and construct the film in a way almost like a thriller without a dead second and the end will not leave a single eye dry. Cinematographer Camilla Skagerstrom made an excellent job in creating a beautiful movie and the music (all by Rodriguez)makes a great soundtrack and it is hard to believe that this musical treasure was forgotten for so many years. Not only is this a strong personal portrait of a grate musician but it also makes you wonder about the mechanics of fame, success and the music industry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a world full of over marketed terrible so called artists with no talent we have Rodriguez, a poet, the voice of a generation &amp; a very humble man,After wasting ?12 on the Dark Knight last night I released why I loved Indie cinema.This is such a touching tale of hope, dreams and acceptance. The tale of Rodriguez is an over whelming one, especially as he actually appears to be as mysterious as the legend says.The man is an icon in South African and became the voice of Apartheid, changing millions of peoples lives in the process, yet It's criminal that a man of his talent is unknown in his native home town of Detroit. A town that gave us Motown, Iggy Pop &amp; Ella Fitzgerald. I can only think his record label didn't promote him correctly. It actually makers me sick when I watch Xfactor c**ts selling tons of records when artists like Rodriguez get no recognition what so ever.Cynics would say it's a big marketing ploy to sell more records. But who cares, its heart warming to see his working class family talk about their up bringing and what it meant to see him perform to the people who really acre about his music.Never stop dreaming and always be true to yourself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Searching for Sixto</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. I make no apologies for my tendency to have higher expectations and be more demanding of documentaries than other films. When dealing with a real subject, event or person, there is no place for fabrication or embellishment. The truth must stand (and entertain) on its own. Filmmaker Malik Bendjelloul has no such issue given his fascinating, almost jaw-dropping story of musician Sixto Rodriguez.Described as Dylan-esque, Rodriguez was a folk singer and songwriter who put out two albums: Cold Fact (1970) and Comng from Reality (1971). Despite critical raves, the album sales were minimal and Sussex/A&amp;R dropped him. After that, the story got a bit hazy. Urban Legend had Rodriguez dousing himself with gasoline while onstage, and committing suicide by lighting himself up. Mostly he just seemed to disappear, not simply fade away.Nearly incomprehensible in today's age of internet communication, the Rodriguez songs became anthems for the anti-apartheid whites in South Africa. The music reached the country through bootleg copies and the popularity grew. We meet a Cape Town record store owner and indie music supporter names Stephen Segerman who describes Rodriguez as "bigger than Elvis" in South Africa. In the late 1990's a world wide web manhunt began.What happens after that ... I will leave it to the film. Just know that this documentary is a blend of Mystery, Intrigue, Urban Legend, Who-done-it, and Where are they now? There is a brief interview with Clarence Avant, the owner of now-defunct Sussex Records, during which he provides the only real insight into the music industry underbelly. Additionally, so much of the story goes unexplained. So many questions unanswered ... even unasked! However, the story itself, and Rodriguez the man, are so amazing, that the entertainment and intellectual value of the film remains intact.Since the vast majority (99% plus) of us have never previously heard of Rodriguez, the film does a nice job of integrating his songs in a manner that allows us to get a real understanding for the musical genius and why the critics (and South Africa) fell hard for it. This is a fascinating story and captivating film, despite lacking in "the rest of the story" department.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this film in the Hamptons, Rodriguez was the surprise special guest. He still sounded like the recordings made over 40 years ago. This astonishing documentary garnered a standing ovation from the audience. The film is put together in a crafty manner, with great visuals and interviews. If Rodriguez originally recorded in the 1990's it would be very hard to "disappear," especially with the advent of the coming Internet, but since his story starts in the 60's and ends in the 70's for about half a decade, it would be easy just to disappear. The songs on the soundtrack are brilliant. This film is a contender for best documentary at the 2012 Oscars. Keep on singing Rodriguez. **********</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow. Just. Wow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't going to make time to see "Searching For Sugar Man" when I first heard about it. I'm not a music person. I don't have a CD collection. I listen to music, but I don't love any one musician. I don't even commit to a favorite genre. So, why would I subject myself to an hour and a half documentary about a musician I've never heard of? But, the reviews I found on-line were very favorable. The presentation of the subject sounded interesting to me. And to be honest, I didn't really believe the story could be true. By the time the screening date arrived, I had to go see this "real fairy tale".Wow. Just. Wow.Thank you, Malik Bendjelloul, for giving me the opportunity to hear this amazing story. Thank you, Camilla Skagerstrom, for showing how much stunning cinematography can add to a story about a poverty stricken man from Detroit.The following does contain spoilers?.so, if you are going to see the movie?. stop reading here and go see it. But, if you are not sure you want to spend your hard earned cash to watch this documentary, please read on?.because seriously? You are missing out if you don't see it.In case you don't know the story, I'll give you just a little background. Rodriguez, a song writer/singer in the 70s was 'discovered' by a couple of white guys, in a smoke filled Detroit dive bar. (His music reminds me somewhat of Bob Dylan's) A couple of albums were produced in the U.S.?.the albums didn't make it big?.in fact, not many sold. Rodriguez went back to working his day job and that was the end of that. However, in the very isolated South Africa, Rodriguez's music became a phenomenon compared to Elvis or the Beatles. His music was a solace for so many Africans fighting the war on Apartheid. Rodriguez didn't know anything about the South Africa portion of his story. "Searching for Sugar Man" is a documentary made about two South Africans searching for information about a mysterious American songwriter, who had a huge impact on their lives, but no one seemed to know anything about.This IS a real fairy tale. One you have to see to believe. One that can restore your faith in humanity, and possibly change the way you see fame and fortune. One that will remind you that you never know how far reaching your daily actions may be.Wow. Just. Wow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feelgood true-story movie - a few bits missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early 1970s, a shy Mexican singer-songwriter in Detroit makes two albums which sell 'six copies', and is tracked down in obscurity nearly 30 years later by a journalist from South Africa, where he's become 'bigger than Elvis'. Triumphant sell-out concerts follow, while the man himself remains modest and enigmatic.What's not to like? Rodriguez himself comes across as a nice guy, still mega-cool at 70, his music is like Bill Withers' with a harder, more earnest political edge, as well as being relevant to the end of the Apartheid regime, and the whole idea that a man could become a superstar simply by word of mouth chimes nicely with the YouTube superstar dream that's around at the moment.Technically top-notch; great photography, the songs themselves are integrated really well and don't overstay their welcome, and the whole sense of story and journey is maintained right to the end.Maybe it's because it comes from a less media-savvy, less jaded country that afterwards you do get the feeling that they could have been a little more incisive. Clarence Avant, the chairman of Sussex Records who received the platinum-selling royalties from SA, scarily blusters his way out of explaining how 'the money doesn't matter'. We never get to hear about, let alone meet, Rodriguez' wives, and as one of the talking heads says, 'Rodriguez doesn't give away anything of himself'. Nor does he in this movie, which leaves you wanting more. There's also the (unmentioned) point that Rodriguez did actually tour Australia and Sweden in the 80's - so he wasn't totally off the radar.But while they're telling the story, these questions don't really matter. The story is well paced, and there's enough original footage to bring to life the triumphant comeback concert where Rodriguez spent 15 minutes just taking applause before playing a note.Somehow I kept thinking of 'Spinal Tap' - there are quite a few funny moments - and 'Searching for Sugar Man' does have its eventual happy ending. And here's a thought - without music piracy it would never have happened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rodriguez (Sugarman), is one of the greatest men I have ever known.This isn't a review, at least I don't consider it one; I don't review on IMDb, and there's a good chance I never will; but I feel compelled to leave my experience and thoughts, though briefly, here.I saw this movie today knowing nothing about the subject material or the man himself; after leaving the theatre into a dimming sunset I texted my friend "I have a new hero."That is probably&#xfeff; the greatest praise I have ever gave a film.Soulful, touching, heartrending and uplifting, this film------ you cannot write this, you cannot make this up, it is a story of true brilliance and daunting inspiration. There is so much to commend, praise, remark about this movie... but honestly I don't want to cite any one thing because it would spoil the experience of watching the story unfold and the mystery of Sugarman being shaped weakened. The bottom line is: It is a story that is too real, poignant, and far-fetched to exist anywhere on a writer's board or in a screenplay; this is why documentaries will never die, and they will always have a reserved place in the realm of cinema, films of fiction and artistry just cannot pierce the depth that this one finds. It is one of the greatest documentaries I have ever seen, possibly the greatest. I cried throughout the picture. A must-see. I write this review with the intention that I hope to encourage others to go see this movie: If you do you won't regret it and if you see it years later on television, you'll regret you didn't take the chance when you had it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful documentary about a blue collar poet and musician and his place in history of the white, anti-apartheid underground music scene of South Africa. I am intrigued by the music: it makes me think of today's world with the Occupy Movement, the Arab Spring, the Mexican drug wars, or even just middle class America. Even the local sports talk radio guys were touched by the heart wrenching/heart warming story of an obscure musician, discovered in Detroit, given two albums that flopped (financially), and who returned to obscurity.(Spoiler Alert) For myself, with 3 young kids, I am touched by the interviews with his daughters about how he raised them to be comfortable with enjoying the culture of the "elites" even though they were extremely poor. I am glad to hear the story of a person rich in spirit and heart but not in wealth. Everyone should seek stories such as this about such a man.I am intrigued by the music and would like to hear more. I am glad they included so much.The movie is a fun tale of a couple fans searching for their unknown music hero. As a history buff, though, I would love to see more: a PBS/Discovery/etc. follow-up on the historical involvement of the South African music scene, or parallels between Detroit &amp; South Africa in the '60s-80s, etc, would be a great TV and DVD pairing.The poet, father, musician, and man described in the story is an inspiration. To this end, the interviews in this documentary are wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Searching for Sugar Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A KVIFF viewing of this demystifying documentary of a miracle would never find a copycat in the digital-era, Rodriguez "The Sugar Man", an American minstrel in the 1970s who has sold a sensational figure of records in South Africa while being exclusively oblivious in USA, and when rumor says he died in a suicide attempt while performing it on stage, the story seems to reach its cul-de-sac. But two South Africans, take the onerous task to dig out the mystery behind (including the director himself), and eventually the truth has been disclosed in a quite satisfying way both on screen and off screen. First of all, Rodriguez's songs (from his albums COLD FACT 1970, COMING FROM REALITY 1971, and a piece from his never-released third album) have prevailed in the entire film's narrative, which after a first-time listening, feels more affinity with Bob Dylan's Folk Rock tunes, most of which pertain to lower-class or working-class self-inspection, definitely have their own mark of time. The poignancy has been simmered halfway through when the story has a dramatic twist and leads to the second half of the film into a different angle of revelation, an enigmatic fetish figure's condescendence into the real world. And a poetic license has to be introduced to his personal life as de-iconization is always a tough call to make. Then, about what prompted Rodriguez's case so unique? The film seems to be a bit withdrawn in unraveling the real reason behind it (a deliberate conspiracy theory is never in the picture), indeed, even there were merely 40 years before, we already have forgotten how things stand at then, and this could be a scarier discovery. By the way, the film has a very audience-friendly approach, and if you are a music enthusiast, this film will be a delectable choice to be enchanted by the pure magic of music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While "Searching for Sugar Man" is, more than anything else, unquestionably a testament to Rodriguez's craft and humility, it is frankly manipulative to suggest that he had no popularity anywhere but South Africa. I have personal memories of "Cold Fact" being an integral part of the musical soundscape in Australia during the early to mid 70's, particularly in the surfing community, and he was popular there before he caught on in South Africa. He actually toured Australia in 1979, and in 1981 he opened for Midnight Oil on their Australian tour. The message of Rodriguez's musical journey is undeniable but the filmmakers' omission of facts to make a sensational story even more sensational, is crass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A music documentary with a difference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a music biography with a bit of a difference. Normally when we settle down to watch one of these we know in advance what the artist's music is like. Even if we are not committed fans we usually at least know something. In this documentary this will simply not be the case for the vast majority of folks who decide to watch it. For this reason, Searching for Sugar Man is somewhat unusual.Its subject, the singer-songwriter Sixto Rodriguez, recorded a couple of critically praised but commercially disastrous albums in the early 70's. He was quickly dropped by his record label and then basically vanished from the public eye for over quarter of a century. Rumours of his on-stage suicide circulated as fact. Where the story becomes a little unexpected is that through word of mouth he became massive in South Africa of all places. In the apartheid years his music developed a following that rivalled bands like the Rolling Stones. His lyrics hit a note with white liberals there and his albums became anti-establishment classics. Many of the people who would make important contributions to overturning the apartheid regime were influenced by Rodriguez. But the thing is, he knew absolutely nothing of his fame and popularity there. He received no royalties at all for the 500,000 albums he sold in South Africa. When interviewed, his label boss Clarence Avant gets a little shifty when asked about this. It seems that Rodriguez had been dealt a somewhat bum hand.The second act of the story began when one of the South Africans who loved him discovered when speaking to an American friend that Rodriguez albums were impossible to buy in the States. This was something of a revelation, as up until this point it was generally assumed that he must have been a peer of Bob Dylan and just as popular. This led to a quest to discover more about the man; it led to the incredible discovery that he was still alive and living a modest life in Detroit with his daughters. The man himself was utterly unaware of his cultural impact in South Africa. The South African's subsequently organised concerts back home and so Rodriguez went there in the late 90's. A nobody at home, there he played to crowds of tens of thousands of people of all ages in the spectrum. They all seemed to know his records off by heart too. It was a revelation to witness this strange but uplifting story arc.It's difficult to really know why Rodriguez never made it at the time. Many now classic acts such as Nick Drake never made it during their recording careers either. Sometimes a combination of things just conspires against a musician and Rodriguez seems to have been a victim of this circumstance. His music certainly is good - and there are nice animated segments to go along with some of his songs here ? but it's difficult to say how good on one viewing. Certainly there were a lot of singer-songwriters in the early 70's on the back of Dylan. But what makes this documentary so interesting is not just the discovery of something hidden and good but also the realisation that a mass cultural happening could occur on another side of the world without it's figurehead knowing the slightest thing about it. It's overall a fascinating story and one for all music fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>shamelessly promotes "never let the truth get in the way of a good story"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An enjoyable film overall. However, as a self-promoted "documentary", it falls short in quite a few key areas:* it perpetuates the myth that after the release of his 2nd album in 1971 he received no recognition and effectively retired from performing. The film selectively omits the facts that he was very popular in Australia throughout the 70's and toured there in 1979 and 1981. He was equally popular in New Zealand and other African countries.* in Australia an album entitled "Alive" was released shortly after his last tour. This title suggests that many people(and I would imagine it includes the touring party) must have known South Africans believed he was dead .. and the film does not explain how such a mystery of his death could have survived for 17-odd years after the release of this album* the "documentary" fails to explain how copies of the album were actually made and distributed after Sussex folded. It takes time to describe a "follow-the-money" strategy employed by a musicologist ... but really does not properly describe the findings. Perhaps the truth would have diluted the story in the film?* the film tells us Rodriguez, after six concerts in South Africa, went back to virtual obscurity. In fact, he toured extensively abroad in the 2000's, including many returns to Australia.* we learn nothing of the mothers of his daughters, including anything of his relationship with them. For an artist who has composed many breathtakingly beautiful love songs, this omission is most remarkable for a "documentary"Despite this I still enjoyed it ... thanks mostly to the inclusion of Rodriguez's hypnotic music and voice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true life fable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary is best seen without knowing anything about it in advance because of some rather large surprises. In fact, the story arc works so cleverly that it is all the more unbelievable that this is true story rather than a work of fiction. It made me giggle; it made me cry. Beyond this information, it is best that you not read further until after you see the film."Sugar Man" points an accusatory finger at the music record industry in general, and at one greedy company in particular. It also celebrates the life of a gifted, though unknown, American musician whose music made a major impact on an isolated and oppressed culture on the other side of the world.It is a rewarding fable and an updated fairy tale that should appeal to a wide audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving documentary plays fast and loose with the cold facts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Talented Detroit troubadour could have been a star, but his 1970s albums fail to sell and he is consigned to a life of obscurity and hard labor, until rediscovered by millions of adoring fans he never knew he had. This is inspiring stuff, a moving feel-good movie with a detective plot, as a record store owner and a journalist hunt down the enigmatic Rodriguez, whose album Cold Fact made him an anonymous superstar in South Africa.This is a great piece of manipulative filmmaking, but as a documentary it asks more questions than it answers, and never lets the facts stand in the way of a good story. First up we are told Rodriguez was more famous than the Rolling Stones in South Africa, artistically his only peer was Bob Dylan, and he was a leading inspiration in the struggle against apartheid. Come on. Really? Then, based on unsubstantiated guesstimates from "half a million" to "millions" of album sales, the film asks where the royalties went, but doesn't follow through. They interview Rodriguez, who surely could have answered this question, along with many others, but we see little of the man himself, except for wistful shots of him looking out a window, while his daughters and the South Africans do most of the talking.I wanted to see Rodriguez, but this becomes more a story of the South Africans and their feeble attempts to track him down. These included putting his picture on milk cartons and spreading rumors of his self-immolation on stage, which sounded more like attempts to promote the myth ahead of his tours of South Africa. Also, the movie implies Rodriguez was unheard of outside South Africa, but Cold Fact was also popular in Australia, where Rodriguez toured in the late 70s and then with Midnight Oil. I know, I was a fan and had a copy of the album, as did most of my friends. We are also told he survived his life after music by working as a demolition man. Nice hard luck story, but an internet search reveals he was also a teacher and social worker, and the movie quickly passes over his graduation from university.Rodriguez was a unique talent, I loved his music, and this film does a great job of giving this humble man the recognition he deserves. It is a moving cinema experience and well worth seeing, but this is faction as much as fact, which is carefully excised to fit the myth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, well-told documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of those "it's so weird if this was a fiction film everyone would say it wasn't believable" stories. An extremely talented young U.S. singer songwriter in the Bob Dylan mold, calling himself simply 'Rodriguez' produced 2 LPs in the early 70s. But despite positive critical reaction (and the facts that the many songs we hear on the soundtrack are quite good) both LPs bombed, and Rodriguez lost his recording contract, never to record again. Reportedly he then killed himself on-stage. Meanwhile, somehow in the years after all this, his music caught on among the white liberal anti-apartheid youth of South Africa (where a number of Rodriguez's songs were banned for being too political), and he became an ever growing cult figure, eventually having a huge fan base. But beyond the paltry clues left by his two albums, there's little that his legion of South African fans can find out about their hero. So two South Africans with a deep love for the music start a detective hunt for the real story of what happened to Rodriguez. The film is full of energy, ups and downs, and some clever story telling techniques. Some have argued that the construction is 'manipulative', but I think it's a perfectly valid way to tell a tale. Yes, they could have given us all the answers up front, since they're now known, but by having us go on the journey with our two amateur sleuths, and finding out only what they knew at each moment makes for a much better way to experience the story with them.A unique and wonderful film.</fullReview>

Perhaps second only to "An Inconvenient Truth" which changed my life, best documentary ever. I was really taken by the recent bio-flicks on Phil Ochs/I became a huge fan, and Nilsson/became a fan, but not like this! I've already seen it twice and follow the fan website every day. I tried to clue in my friends to getting on board early/now: like seeing the Beatles in Germany or the Cavern Club. On my second viewing, I tuned into how visually beautiful, in cinematography and photography it was. Many viewers already knew about the decided story line twist which occurs part way through, and it's no great tragedy if you find out. But it's more fun if you go in blank.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary Music, An Amazing Man, and a More Remarkable Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An absolute: true art survives, but does the artist? In the case of Sixto Rodriguez the answer is a resounding yes, this in spite of the fact he was, more or less, forced out from the sphere of the art he created. Banished back to his meager existence in poverty stricken Detroit, Rodriguez neither wilted or, as legend had it, died.This is a remarkable and compelling movie about man whose talent was immense and may have walked away from his art to do what one must, survive...Except for a fluke. That fluke was while virtually as unknown to the world at large his music was more popular than Elvis in South Africa. The fact that it only grew larger from the seventies into the nineties was oblivious to the man himself until two dogged fans/researchers found Rodriguez was very much still alive. To say a real-life Cinderella story ensued is a gross understatement. That Rodriguez met the challenge with grace and serenity is an achievement of monumental proportions, really one of the most uplifting happenings I've ever become aware of.You must see this movie. In a world were terror strikes so deep we need to witness the qualities of this remarkable man as well as discover the utterly other-worldly music he created for us all. Music is one of the most powerful bridges mankind has and the fact that this is amazing gentle soul has survived and flourished in spite of receiving no approval until 1998 is one of the greatest testimonies to the enduring human spirit you are likely to find. Simply put: You must see this movie...You will be richer for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you like music with a good mystery--highly recommended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Malik Bendjelloul's engaging, cleverly structured documentary about the legendary folk singer Rodriguez is shaped like a mystery. The documentary tells the journey of two South Africans, who are dedicated to follow the footsteps of the late 70's singer, Sixto Rodriguez. A singer and composer of great talent who was virtually unknown in the United States. Hailed as the next Bob Dylan, former Motown chief Clarence Avant signed him in the late 1960s, and the Detroit based musician (full name Sixto Rodriguez) had two albums released, in 1971 and 1972. Rave reviews failed to translate into sales. However, his records sold millions as protest songs for the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. Rodriguez knew nothing about movement, including the amount of money he should have garnered from royalties there, is unheard of, and unfair-- but it's actually the smaller part of the story. The mass legend surrounding his on-stage suicide (did he light himself on fire on stage? or something even worse?) -- never corroborated -- and the investigation into how and why the musician from Detroit disappeared takes on an intensity of its own. If you like music, a good mystery or, better yet, a combination of both, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Searching for Sugar Man" is a 2012 documentary about Sixto Rodriguez, a musical artist from the late '60s and early '70s whose records never sold; he was dropped by his record label and subsequently disappeared.While Rodriguez, who hailed from Detroit, was a big nobody in the rest of the world, it turns out that his music was huge in South Africa, and even though some songs were banned, his albums Cold Fact and Coming from Reality sold in big numbers. He became the voice of Apartheid and was an influence on many musicians there.Swedish director Malik Bendjelloul tells the story of two South African fans trying to find out if Rodriguez had indeed killed himself after a concert, as was rumored, and if it wasn't, what had happened to him.Though Rodriguez is somewhat similar to Dylan, his lyrics, to me anyway, are far more spectacular, the work of a true poet. How he escaped recognition is beyond me. Also beyond me is where all the money is from those half million or so albums that were sold. Strange - no one seems to know."Searching for Sugar Man" is a wonderful story, well told in this documentary, of the search for this talented artist. It moves quickly but packs a wallop. It is well deserving of all the awards it has won. And the music and messages of Sixto Rodriguez deserve to be heard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good doc, with especially fantastic music, but perhaps slightly undone by a fact they gloss over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mysterious musician calling himself Rodriguez released two albums in the early 1970s in the United States. They never made a dent in the musician's home country, but across the sea, in South Africa, they became enormous, soundtracks to the lives of the young generation and, later on, pretty much classics. But no one in South Africa knew who this Rodriguez person was. Some of them are aware that he was unknown in the U.S. and there's even a legend that he committed suicide on stage. In the late 90s, with more freedom of information and the dawn of the internet, a few people started to seek out the truth. This is the documentary about that search. This is a strong and moving doc about the fickleness of success in the music business. If nothing else, it's a great introduction to a long-forgotten artist. Rodriguez's music, which plays throughout, really is very good and I can't wait to explore it further. After I finished the documentary, though, I quickly learned that they glossed over an important piece of information that the filmmakers surely knew about but chose to overlook: Rodriguez's success in South Africa was mirrored in Australia. In fact, by the end of the 70s, he was enormous in Australia and his popularity in South Africa most likely stems from his success there. Rodriguez actually sold five times as many records in Australia than he did in South Africa. At first, I didn't think it was the biggest lie they could have told, and that maybe the filmmakers thought that they had to focus just on their own home country, but, in the end, knowing the truth really does ruin their narrative. There was probably a bigger, more interesting story here than they really uncovered. It's still a very entertaining documentary and well worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the promotion from youtube and hulu, it really did not register me that well that it would be a great experience to come, the place I went to see the film did not accept credit card, so I was hesitant to get in, luckily just had the exact cash amount for the ticket, less than handful of audience, expected from indie movie market.Apart from the technical aspect of the film, story of the singer, Rodriguez, alone was good enough to give me genuine feeling of moving and uplifting emotions. Sure I can get spectacular visual effects and superb acting from big budget films,and even better storyline with superior presentation...etc. What really counts from this one is being documentary = true life story of great artist Rodriguez, his greatness was reflected really well from his fans, instead from his own narration. Perhanps its better that way for this particular film. Also I admit that one of reason for me to watch this movie was my own personal need for little escape from the tight real life situation I was in around that time, maybe it added personal bias to the review, still I think its worth the ticket price to get such appreciation for life and music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaw dropping subject matter, flawless direction, incredibly camera work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard about this documentary back in 2012 when released, since then, for some reason it had always just lost out by a hair to other music documentaries for my attention (just don't have enough time to watch all the music documentaries I want to watch). However, it finally worked its way to the top of the pecking order last night, and holy s**t was I glad it did.The subject matter is simply amazing, I'm sure if you have watched a trailer or read a synopsis along the way you will have a brief idea of what its about. The only way I can ever see a similar situation arising in our time is if some bootlegs of some unknown band/songwriter makes its way into North Korea. And even then, it will need to grip the nation so tightly that not even the gestapo of the young Kim will be able to quench the peoples thirst for it. (Cant see that happening)Anyway, from the initial shots of a "Gorillaz" almost animated type character walking along the streets of Detroit. You are immediately hooked to the captivating story of Sixto Rodriguez. A troubadour equaled only for the South Africans by the almost God like persona's of Dylan or Elvis. In fact "Aw he was much bigger than Elvis" notes one of the contributors to the documentary. To think an artist could be so closely linked to a revolutionary movement without even knowing it is mind boggling. In a time when international music and culture had been banned and in many cases boycotted South Africa anyway, Sixto's music became revolutionary anthems. The only other artist who I can think of who made a significant contribution to this aspect of South African culture was Paul Simon's recording of Graceland with artists like ladysmith Black Mombaza. Visible in that of the documentary "Under African Skies" (Another cracker).The camera work in this documentary and the way the whole recording of it was approached, deserves as much praise as the story itself. The canvas is ever changing, from vast sweeping landscapes of Cape Town, intimate little streets outside Cape Towns record shops with Table Mountain as a back drop, to the cold desolate streets of Detroit. While Cape Town may be regarded as one of the Worlds more dangerous cities, it pales in significance when contrasted with the derelict, ice covered, poverty stricken streets of Detroit. In fact Cape Town could be mistaken for paradise. As for the music of the man himself. This was undoubtedly the best revelation of all. Songs like "Cause" and "Crucify Your Mind" had me from the opening lyrics. They resonate with a generation lost to 70's poverty stricken Detroit as much as they do with modern day Ireland and perhaps the Western World over. To sum up, absolutely blown away by this documentary so much so that I finally set up an IMDb account just to leave a review. I've no doubt this is the start of a long and fruitful relationship me and the music of Sixto Rodrigeuz.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Searching for SugarmanThis is an extremely inspiring documentary about an American singer named Rodriguez. Rodriguez was spotted at a very early stage of his career by music producers, who saw an immense potential in him. However, for very obscure reasons, the public never took to his music. So Rodriguez went back to his former life, working on construction sites to earn a living. In the mean time, he became a huge star in South Africa and sold millions of records. As much as Rodriguez was not aware of it, South-Africans had no idea who he was, and so started the search for Sugarman... This movie is a must see not only because the story is extraordinary, but also because of the protagonist, Rodriguez, is such an inspiring individual. After discovering how famous and rich he could have been, he showed no bitterness or anger. He wasn't even sure his life would have been better if he had! In a time when, for many, being famous is an end in itself, Rodriguez the poet shows another way...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unusually powerful story of a second chance at fame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story being told in "Searching for Sugar Man" is 15 years old, yet it didn't become a documentary until 2012. Seeing as the film centers on a man who never received the fame he deserved until long after the fact, that's quite fitting.The story behind "Searching for Sugar Man" is not one of those totally unbelievable true stories, but it has that same power. Filmmaker Malik Bendjelloul reveals this story just a little bit at a time, not giving you any sense of its full scope so that learning the simple truth is most effective.The artist known as Rodriguez is presented to us as a drifter from Detroit, an elusive folk singer whose music and voice were praised by the producers of his two records, "Cold Fact" (1970) and "Coming From Reality" (1971), both of which flopped. We're then introduced to two South Africans, music enthusiast and writer Brad "Sugar" Segerman and journalist Craig Bartholomew Strydom. As it turns out, Rodriguez's music made it to South Africa during the boiling point of apartheid, and "Cold Fact" was equal to any album of any superstar artists of that same era, even though no one knew anything about him except that he supposed killed himself on stage. Segerman and Strydom both sought answers and eventually discovered each other -- and Rodriguez.Before we get into the investigation/search for Rodriguez, Bendjelloul paints this abstract, mythic portrait of the singer/songwriter and plays a number of his tracks, which indeed sound like they should've been famous in the early '70s. We become fans in our way and become intrigued with the mystery of what happened to Rodriguez. When they do track him down, it feels revelatory."Sugar Man" turns out be an unusual underdog story. The elusiveness of fame is a major component in what makes it so compelling, in that Rodgriguez was almost an absolute nothing, but the more people who hear his story, the more supporters he wins over. His humility in combination with his raw talent is enough to persuade anyone to wanting to support Rodriguez and his music.My only complaint with the film is an avoidance of the question "why didn't he become famous?" It's clear he had all the tools and some of the best in the business supporting him. Did he not get enough airplay? Did no one promote him well enough? The elephant in the documentary, so to speak, is that he went by Rodriguez, and Latin music basically didn't exist at that time. Nothing about his music would tell you he was Mexican, but is it possible he hit a lot of barriers because of prejudice toward his name? One interviewee mentions his name briefly in that context, but the film doesn't go anywhere with it.Moving, fascinating and impeccably told, "Searching for Sugar Man" is a rare feel-good human-interest documentary that stands out among even the most meaningful and difference-making doc work being done today.~Steven C Thanks for reading! visit moviemusereviews.com for more</fullReview>

Well I would stop now, but I have to write ten lines to make the point, so let's write about the music. I heard the music from my new friend Guilermo from Spain and he and his family told me that I have to watch this movie and they were playing Rodrigez songs every day while we were sailing on the boat. So in my point of view, I have made friends for live and I must say that the music that anyone listen to does effect the character very much. This music is just heavenly.

		<shortDescription>When Truth Is Stranger Than Fiction...In A Good Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Searching for Sugar Man' is proof that truth can be stranger than fiction and not necessarily in a bad way. Here is a talented artiste who's been rejected and knocked down by his compatriots. Yet, unbeknownst to him or anyone in his country, there was this whole other world where he was one of the top three most popular and most loved singers. This world called South Africa was shut out from the rest of Earth at the time when Rodriguez's music reached the country.Cleverly crafted, with a series of interviews and visuals and footages of 70s America and South Africa, director Malik Bendjelloul's admiration and passion of storytelling is evident, especially in how he unfolds the truth about Sixto. The second crucial question raised is 'Where did the money go?'. Where did Rodriguez's (who's a huge star in South Africa, whose music sold for more than millions) royalties go? This too is explored through a set of interviews raising further suspicion. Moving on to the next subject, which is the man's music. 'Searching for Sugarman' does a brilliant job of introducing his amazing music to those who are unfamiliar.On a final note, I'll say that this is unlike any other documentary film I've seen. There's a surreal feel to it and the final piece is uplifting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'A Story To Strange To Be True'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film to be jaw-dropping engrossing. There are hardly words to express how much I love this movie. The strange story of Rodriguez, a guitar-playing writer and singer of heart-felt songs, the disappointment, the surprises, is nothing short of captivating. This picture of a brilliant musician who was thought to be dead, but in actuality is still alive and living in Detroit, Michigan is breath-taking. What this man and his music unknowingly did for Apartheid in South Africa, the hope, the strength to fight against an unjust authority that it brought to millions alone is mind-blowing. To discover that he was a super hero, bigger than Elvis, larger that the Rolling Stones, more important than any music star at the time in other parts of the world and yet completely unknown here in America is more than incredible, it's astonishing. I'll tell you, I've never wanted to have been at a concert as much as I do the Rodriguez Concert of March 6, 1998 in South Africa. Not ever! The scenes from that event truly brought tears to my eyes. If you have any interest in music, in the magic what can happen if it's seriously sought, do not miss this picture. For the amazing music alone, this is a treasure not to be missed! If ever I was happy I bought a DVD, it's right now. And it's this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite documentary of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An obstacle is an inspiration.Searching for Sugar Man is by far the best documentary I've seen this year and one of my all time favorites. Swedish director, Malik Bendjelloul, who has been known for producing musical documentaries brings us a fascinating story full of mystery and reminds us how easy it is for great talents to go unrecognized at times. I was completely hooked with this gripping story from the very beginning and wondered what had happened to this 70's rocker that influenced South Africa in such a big way during the Apartheid. The documentary has some unexpected payoffs halfway through the film and some unbelievable twists. The soundtrack is also amazing and contributes even more to the mysterious factor as to how someone so talented was completely ignored in the United States. One of the producers claimed that in America he was zero, in South Africa a hero. The name of this mysterious man is Sixto Rodriguez, who in 1970 created an album that revolutionized South Africa during the oppressive regime. It was a soundtrack to their lives and millions identified with the powerful antiestablishment lyrics of his song, but no one knew anything about this man who was more famous than Elvis Presley in their country. As I listened to his songs in the soundtrack, I couldn't even believe I hadn't heard of this man before. Bendjelloul directed this wonderful film in a very gripping and mysterious way making Rodriguez even more mystical than he already was. This is one great detective story, or as they call it in the documentary musicologist detective story. The film was also beautifully shot, drifting from images of Detroit (Rodriguez's hometown) to others in Cape Town where we see the contrast of this man's fame. This documentary is worth checking out for the powerful and emotional story alone. It is better than most thrillers I've seen lately.The documentary begins with the narration of a South African named Stephen Segerman, who has been nicknamed Sugar for a well known song in the 70's known as Sugar Man. As he speaks and tells us the story of this mysterious musician who everyone in South Africa has heard about, we can hear the song playing in the background. Segerman explains the significance that his music had during the apartheid in South Africa where the government was controlling the information from the outside world. Somehow a bootleg from Rodriguez's 1970 album, Cold Fact, made its way to Cape Town and became an instant success selling over half a million copies in that country. Rodriguez became a rebel icon and his music influenced the underground movement, but no one knew anything about this man. Unlike other successful rockers, nobody knew who this man really was and an air of mystery surrounded this man. Several tragic stories were told about his grotesque suicide, some claimed he set himself on fire in a concert and others that he shot himself in the head during another presentation. Rodriguez became a legend in South Africa, but no one really knew anything else about this man. That is where Segerman comes in as he begins to search for clues and information about his past. By listening closely to the lyrics he begins discovering some clues as to where this man might have lived, and so the detective story begins with some thrilling discoveries. Segerman finally discovers and interviews some of the producers of his two albums who all seem to agree that Rodriguez should have been a star because of his great lyrics, but somehow his albums never sold. Some even claimed he was better than Bob Dylan. Segerman shows the contrast of how affecting his music was in South Africa, and how nonexistent it was in America. His investigations will lead to some surprising discoveries along the way.The way in which Segerman begins to solve the mystery of Rodriguez's life is what makes this detective story so interesting and gripping. There are some great discoveries along the way as we listen in the background to several of his songs, which I absolutely enjoyed. It made me want to buy the album. The mystery surrounding this man's grotesque death made this even more dramatic and thrilling to watch. Who would have ever thought that a musicologist detective story would be so interesting? What made this documentary even more dramatic was the fact that this man had never realized how his music impacted another country the way it did. But then what seemed to be the ending of one story ended up being the beginning of an even better one. I don't want to go into too much detail because I don't want to give anything away, but the payoff is incredible. The search and hunt for Rodriguez pays off in the end with some incredible discoveries. Searching for Sugar Man is a grandiose story and one worth seeing. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never considered giving any movie a "10" before this one.Even though its a documentary, you can actually "spoil" this film, so I will not discuss the facts.The best way I can convey the power of this film is to say that shortly before I saw "Searching for Sugar Man," I saw "Life of Pi" (Also a very good film). In "Life of Pi," a writer seeks out the main character because supposedly he has a story to tell "that will make you believe in God." Well, "Life of Pi" is a work of fiction."Searching for Sugar Man" is a TRUE story that will make you believe in God. Seriously.(By the way, lest you think the film is some kind of hoax, its not. I have a friend of the proper age from South Africa and he confirms its all true)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend told me about his documentary and told me I HAVE TO WATCH IT... now I'm telling everyone, you HAVE TO WATCH IT...it's one of those movies that makes me glad to be alive...If some script writer had submitted this story to Hollywood he would been laughed out of the town for it being too unbelievable but it just shows you that sometimes reality is even more amazing than Hollywood can dream up..You will already have read the story about becoming well known in South Africa, without giving anything away I asked my South African work colleague if he knew about an American musician called Rodriguez, he said OF COURSE1 and then he said to me Why, don't you, doesn't everybody? and I told him I'd never heard of him and he was amazed, he said he was a folk hero in SA and was shocked that no-one else in the office had heard about Rodriguez, he couldn't understand it, everyone of his generation had that album and he assumed it was famous world wide - and that Rodriguez was dead.. so I pointed him towards this video (thank you Love Film), he went home and watched it and next day was emailing and Facebooking all his London SA friends. Rodriguez is playing in London this summer, from what I can tell every single friend is going to see Rodriguez and it's no wonder, watch this documentary and you will go along too.It's easily the most amazing documentary I will watch this year... even this decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 42nd 10/10 I've awarded out of 3,084 ratings. The second documentary. The first 10 since "There Will Be Blood", "King of Kong" and "Slumdog Millionaire" from 2007.Who was this great artist, and what happened to him? The answers will teach us all life lessons. His words were heard and loved, but he lived his life thinking they fell upon deaf ears.Prejudice. Greed. Misinformation. Vindication. Appreciation. Why did it take a documentary made nearly 40 years after the fact to bring this man's music and story to the forefront?"Cause I lost my job two weeks before Christmas."His lyrics will pierce the hearts of his listeners, but his story is even more powerful.I thought that The King of Kong took benign subject matter and turned it into a powerful story. This documentary does much more than make us root for the underdog. It forces us to re-evaluate the definition of success.The pay-off is amazing. The new leader for best film of 2012. Well-made. Nice art direction. Fantastic music seemingly hidden like an ancient, priceless relic. Heartfelt. As a musician, I feel like a new artist has been opened-up to me, but as a human I may never look at life and the pursuit of happiness the way I did before.This is definitely the story of a philosopher.. a deep soulful voice sitting right next to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love a documentary that is crafted like a fanciful film and not just some series of interviews with people telling a story (though there is some of that here). Amazing cinematography of Detroit USA and Cape Town South Africa is melded with the infectious music of 70's folk-rock singer Rodriguez - an enigmatic figure who never found the fame he deserved in the States and against all odds (and thanks apparently to some piracy) became the musical voice of a generation in apartheid era South Africa.The film is about the search by some South African journalists for "the real Rodriguez" amidst rumors of his death."Searching for Sugar Man" is the best documentary since "Man on Wire" and is a beautiful story about the power of art to cross oceans and time. It proves the old adage - truth is stranger than fiction.Check out full reviews at theschleicherspin.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great what could have and should have been story, involving an early 70s folk singer named Rodriguez. A lyrically talented musician who disappeared off the face of the earth after the release of two commercially unsuccessful albums in 1971 and 1972; the records became huge sellers in apartheid South Africa, making Rodriguez a superstar there while remaining virtually unknown here in America. The film makers take us through a journey with a search taking us to Detroit with an absolutely riveting final thirty minutes. Searching for Sugar Man will fill you with wonder and amazement at its twists and turns along the way. Sixto Jesus Rodriguez is a name that you will never forget after watching this excellent documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Version I saw: UK LoveFilm Bluray release Actors: 5/10 Plot/script: 6/10 Photography/visual style: 7/10 Music/score: 7/10 Overall: 6/10 Documentaries have been around as long as film, and are arguably no less important than the more fictional stories. They have also, almost as long as they have existed, habitually bent the truth, if not actively tearing it apart and rearranging it in a shape that suits the film-maker. Searching For Sugar Man is the dramatic story of Rodriguez, an obscure folk singer who recorded two albums and then faded away, only to bizarrely become a huge superstar decades later in a South Africa cut off from the world by South Africa. It is what I like to call a 'coat hanger documentary': on the framework of the main story hangs discussions of the music industry, fame and its costs, the romance of mystique and the way rumours spread, the oppressive regime in South Africa and those who opposed it from within the white community. However, in telling this story, director Malik Bendjelloul (sadly recently deceased) chose to gloss over certain details which cast a different light on the whole story. What we see is not outright lies, but I think the way you see the latter parts of the film will be coloured by how much you know going in. The film seems intent on a certain, quite old-fashioned narrative that I am not sure fits the real facts. However, I don't think this harms the movie. If anything, it adds an extra perspective to a story already filled with interesting viewpoints. Searching For Sugar Man is also very well presented visually, despite the small budget, with several charming and inventive animated sequences. The music of Rodriguez underpins the whole drama, and the songs are good. However, I don't think they are as mind-blowing as the film (or the critical buzz) leads us to believe. I would be interested to hear anything more that appears, but I am not ready to dub him this unrecognised musical genius. Your mileage may vary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We watched this absolutely remarkable documentary in Fremantle yesterday and both of us commented as we left the theatre that this film would stay in our minds for a long time. Diane is not as great a fan of documentaries as I am so this comment coming from her says much about the emotional impact of this film.I knew nothing of the film except the film notes and the bit that interested me was the idea of there being a forgotten musical genius from the 70s. That intrigued me but the film was even more than just about a performer that time passed; it was a fascinating detective mystery about the search for this guy which was about half the film.I have read some of the negative comments from IMDb readers who say that the producers built up the story unfairly; the guy had a strong following here in Australia and not just in South Africa but I not accept this idea because I thought the producers had enough trouble tracing Rodriguez from South Africa without throwing in another distant country to boot.This film is about a guy who had: great talent, a humble background (with all that entails in terms of career boosting), an introspective personality and bad luck from so-called business supporters. Do yourself a favour and search for the film in any form; it is truly worth it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly had no idea what I was going into when I went to see this movie. I hadn't read anything about it, but had heard rumblings about how good it was. I knew it was about music (simply from the guitar logo) but, for some reason, assumed that it was about a blues legend.The story unfolded beautifully ... initially, we hear that the singer Rodriguez was dead (a couple of tragic scenarios were presented). When we find out that he is alive and well ... well, I cannot describe the overwhelmingly pleasant feeling that I had about that ... I choked up and wiped away a tear, I have to admit.My only regret about this movie is that I waited too late to see it. I went about one or two weeks after Rodriguez appeared here in Vancouver, BC. Had I seen the movie and known the beauty of his music, I might have been more aware and gone to see him in concert. (In any event, I bought his CDs and the movie soundtrack after, so I am all set.)I cannot recommend this movie enough; I cannot imagine anyone not having a heart-warming feeling after seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thirty years removed from the distribution of his last record, a small group of dedicated fans seek the truth behind the mysterious singer-songwriter known as Rodriguez. Though his career was little more than a hiccup on his native American turf, it resonated with the oppressed majority in South Africa. There he's become a legendary figure; the myth of Rodriguez is larger than life, complete with multiple urban legends which debate the nature of his untimely demise. Wonderfully produced, with gorgeous transitions and an artist's sense of composition, the material and its resolution left me underwhelmed. No matter how many times the narrators try to compare Rodriguez to the heavyweights of his era - Dylan, the Stones, Elvis - I just can't hear what they're hearing, and that makes the magnitude of his story harder to appreciate. It's an entertaining yarn, with a good twist or two up its sleeve, but too often I felt like it was belaboring a point in lieu of additional substance. Light viewing with a penetrating warmth and a catchy soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Unbelievable True Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1971, folk-rock musician Sixto Rodriguez released his second and final American album on Essex Records out of Detroit. Upon selling literally no copies of the record, Rodriguez was dropped from his label and began a short existence as a struggling artist in the bar scene, a role that didn't suit him, and subsequently led to his on-stage suicide. A complete failure on American soil, somehow Rodriguez's debut album, "Cold Fact", found its way to South Africa and became a huge sensation to a country deeply divided by the apartheid. Before long, Rodriguez's songs became an anthem of sorts for the lower class of South Africa and the middle class who supported the end of the apartheid but lacked a rallying cry. The Rodriguez albums became more and more popular, making him bigger than Elvis or The Beatles in South Africa though almost nothing was known about the man. In the late 90s, a pair of Rodriguez fans, Stephen Segerman and Craig Bartholomew-Strydom, sought to find out more about their hero and what led to his untimely demise. Through a string of strange events and many months of searching for information, the pair finally broke their story wide open when they were put in touch with Rodriguez, alive and well, making a living as a construction worker in Detroit. The story told in Searching for Sugar Man is one that would be deemed completely unrealistic if it were presented in a scripted drama. Stuff like this just doesn't happen, even if many of the events took place before the Internet boom. First of all, when you hear the songs Rodriguez penned for his two albums (spliced in continually through the course of the film), you find yourself completely shocked that the guy didn't make it here. Every record producer or former collaborator dug up by director Malik Bendjelloul goes above and beyond in praise of Rodriguez, all of them vexed as to why he never made an impact on the American charts. His songs are reminiscent of the best of Bob Dylan, a soulful bluesy brand of folk that pulls no punches in the writing and is backed by a rich, unique voice. Second, the myth of what became of Rodriguez and his on-stage death was so widely believed as to become written into the history books as fact. Everyone beyond the handful of people actually connected to the man knew him to be dead. And third, the way in which this one man, of all the bands and musicians from the era, became such an enduring sensation in a foreign country, completely unbeknownst to him or really any of his inner circle, is nearly beyond belief. Again, stuff like this just doesn't happen. The back half of the film centers on the rediscovery of Rodriguez and his return to the stage in 1998. Footage from his six night concert series in South Africa shows Rodriguez to be a proficient, comfortable performer who was in no way intimidated by the throng of adoring fans that flocked to the arenas. Even if Searching for Sugar Man was a complete miss in every department, it would still be worth the price of admission if only to see the reaction of the fans in the packed house when their hero, long believed to be dead, took the stage for the first time. It compares to Beatlemania, Bieber Fever, or any other music- related madness that has gripped a nation. Inserted in amongst the concert footage and the interviews with adoring fans and collaborators are moments with Rodriguez and his three daughters, all of whom paint the same picture of their father as a simple man who never needed the spotlight but nevertheless graciously accepts it and thrives in it. At the time of filming, Rodriguez was still working in the construction industry despite having to take occasional leaves of absence to play sold out shows across the ocean. It is an almost unbelievably surreal life that Rodriguez lives and yet it seems entirely reasonable to the man and his kin. From a filmmaking standpoint, Searching for Sugar Man isn't flawless. Much of the post-production value seems a bit dated or perhaps cheap and the built-in drama of what became of Rodriguez didn't completely work for me, though it did for others in my party. Nevertheless, the story is such an engrossing one as to make up for a multitude of sins and Bendjelloul does a masterful job of mixing the interviews with his subjects in order to make Rodriguez's tale a cohesive, multi-faceted one complete with humor, tears, and a sense of sheer wonderment. This is a triumphant film that deserves the award attention it is sure to get and one that I hope many of you will seek out.Please see my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly i felt a little abused by this Documentary. I think the story is great, it is a very nice subject with a very large panel of possible angles, directions. And what we have here is a succession of clichs, fanatics that keeps telling that everything was "the best thing of their life", that Rodriguez arrived on earth to play the best music of humanity, to save a country... Catchy screen effects, unnecessary romantic descriptions, dramatic silences in the middle of testimonials...I think it is sad, because once again i think this is a very interesting and colorful story, but completely ruined by the choice of making a superhero movie out of it. I don't think it needed that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. I was not familiar with Rodriguez before this doc. He has some interesting tunes, some with very poetic lyrics and an interesting voice -no doubt he was talented. To place him in any league with Bob Dylan is a major stretch. There's a lot of gaps in the man's history that, for some reason, the writers didn't want to cover: how he got to the States, his wives, did he have a drug problem, why did he quit performing...? Why weren't any of the S. African distributors asked if they had their canceled checks or receipts from Sussex Records? Why was the live concert footage absolutely horrific when Rodriguez performed many times after being "found"? There's also no mention of any attempt of Rodriguez to follow up the original early '70s album releases with any performances. Why not keep going? Many artists fail for many years, but they keep at it. Something happened that is not talked about. It's an interesting story, but there are too many gaps and non-disclosures for me personally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most of us, I had know idea who Rodriguez was prior to this documentary. The Music is not bad, and the man who made the music seems interesting. It's one of those docs that uses all sources of mediums to tell the story.Obviously the music of Rodriguez and his South African famous EP cold fact, was used to score the movie, and promoted heavily throughout. Mixed in with a lot of beautiful shots of Detroit, "Rodriguez natural habitat". It's folk music, yet it felt so hip hop the way it's presented. How important the streets of Detroit were to Rodriguez's music and how this connected to South Africa's love of the music.They also added in some animated bits once again mostly used to promote the album, and footage from the concert that Rodriquez gave in South Africa. It's one thing to have them tell me what happen, but what's cool about modern history is we can see and hear it as well thanks to the accessibility of recording equipment. This actually added to the story telling. The doc was laid out like a narrative as they unravel the legend that South Africa perceived him to be (the one they were searching for) and the man he actually is.Not your typical "behind the music" story, yet filled with a lot of Rock and Roll clichs, like the rumors of what happen to Rodriguez after he stop making music. The filmmakers had it right. this was a story worth telling that made a movie worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Searching for Sugar Man is a Swedish-British documentary about the Detroit singer songwriter known as Rodriguez. His records were immensely popular in South Africa. However he was completely unknown in America and he stopped after making two albums. The documentary is investigative in that the interviews seek to find out who Rodriguez really was, to find out if the rumors of his death were true, and where all of the money from the South African record sales went. It turns out that Sixto Rodriguez was alive and doing manual labor in Detroit with several daughters, and he is then invited to perform several sold out concerts in South Africa. Thought I haven't seen many documentaries, I'm finding that I prefer ones that aren't investigative like this one like Twenty Feet from Stardom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mysterious Man who wanted some Sugar !!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this documentary, I had never ever heard of Sixto Rodriguez. He was a singer-songwriter who released two albums in the early seventies namely "Cold Fact" and "Coming to Reality" which largely comprised of folk rock songs. But these albums badly flopped in the United States and he faded into obscurity. But the bootlegged versions of his albums in South Africa became a huge success and his songs inspired a whole generation of South Africans to rebel against the oppression in society even though these people didn't really know anything about Rodriguez.That's all I want to say about the documentary as I think knowing very little about the subject matter will add to the experience. The film made me cry. It is a story which shows how real artists and genuine talents can sometimes go completely unnoticed and unappreciated. The air of melancholy hangs over the film in a very overwhelming way.Listening to the songs makes me actually wonder why he couldn't get any success during the 70s. The writing and compositions remind me of Bob Dylan and the voice reminds me of John Denver. This is the story of a great artist who never knew how much he had actually affected millions of lives even though financial success never came his way.Many critics have criticised the film by calling it contrived and scripted. But they have ignored the fact that the documentary is from the point of view of the South Africans who genuinely knew nothing about Rodriguez due to their isolated existence in the world during the days of apartheid. Let the story of this enigmatic artist wrapped in a cloud of mist with his back to the audience reveal everything that is good and powerful about humanity.Rodriguez never achieved success, but he certainly made others "rich".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remarkable story retold through a cleverly visualized history of (what I believe is) four stories. We have a failed folk singer who was long on talent but short on artist luck, which many folks can relate too, but sympathy would stop shortly after that. Then we have the petty story of seeming ruthless music executives who can't be believed spliced into the third: the unearthing urban legend all the way from South Africa post-Apartheid. Add in the sad story of Detroits' blight and keep the message hopeful and the story continues to its remarkable climax. Didn't know whether to feel love or sadness, but seeing an artist at home with themselves is truly a beautiful thing. Every music fan can experience this film, not just see it. It will also make you think a little bit about the cost of electronic piracy. If nothing else, enjoy the brilliant soundtrack of Rodriguez.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Intriguing documentary about the apparent suicide of singer song-writer Rodriguez, Searching for Sugar Man is an enjoyable yarn that draws the viewer in with the promise of a mystery that is well set up by director and joint writer Malik Bendjelloul. A deeply analytical approach might lead to the viewer asking questions about the set up, but it's more pleasurable to go along for the ride, enjoy excellent cinematography, and be drawn into an effective travelogue that includes an interesting introductory portrait of Detroit. The early mythology seems almost too perfectly bohemian to be real, but suspend any disbelief that you feel, it is worth it to follow through this engagingly simple story about dreams and their realisation (or not).Given that the story has played out, there is occasionally a slightly manufactured feel in places, but that can be excused because of the rich musical fabric that holds the piece together. It may be strange not to mention the music before now, but without Rodriguez's excellent songs, this story would be an attempt to make something out of nothing. Whatever you think about the conclusion, most people would find this a rewarding and satisfying portrait of a man who was on a search of his own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fine documentary, very well filmed and edited. A touching story about Sixto Rodriguez, a fabulous guy and a very talented musician, singer and song writer, who was denied stardom in America of the early 70's probably because of his Mexican origins. Nevertheless, stardom caught up with him 30 years later when he went to South Africa to play for thousands of fans he never knew existed in that distant part of the world and who thought he had died a long time ago.What surprised me the most, along with the quality of his music, lyrics and singing, was this amazing personality, coolness, humility and sense of complete satisfaction. What an incredible energy came from that man. It was beautiful to watch. No bitterness, no regrets, always a smile.At a certain point of the documentary his song writing skills are even put above those of Bob Dylan. I personally think that Dylan is a notch higher and that the comparison was out of place, simply because Rodriguez himself would probably never think of comparing himself with Dylan or somebody else for that matter. He is unique, and that's enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zack from 'Saved by the Bell' is dead! Well he isn't, but at the time, his career probably was.If little is heard from someone in the public eye for a while, all sorts of fantasies and exaggerated stories will crop up about what may or may not have happened to them. And fans will make those stories that bit more extreme to increase the mystery around their hero. Tupac Amaru Shakur is alive and well and running a small flower shop in Droitwich; Elvis is working in every location possible; and Jesus appears burnt into people's toast.'Searching for Sugar Man' is Swedish director Malik Bendjelloul's telling of how two South African fans of little-known American singer Rodriguez sort to find out more about the life (and death). Turns out the mysterious singer/songwriter was huge in English-speaking countries in the Southern Hemisphere where they talk funny. But as he was from an English-speaking country in the Northern Hemisphere where they talk irritatingly and he wasn't at all popular, little about him and his life was documented.So, the 'Dylan-like' mystery man became the topic of various tales about his suicide at his last performance, the most popular being that he masturbated himself to death on stage while rimming a chipmunk during a rendition of his song 'Sugar Man'. Of course, none of the theories turn about to be true, and the enigmatic man shrouded in mystery isn't quite the clandestine legend that they believed.The documentary doesn't exactly break any boundaries, split into three parts: introduce this mystery musician to a new audience; have lots of South Africans talk about how he is on a par with Dylan; then the truth. There are holes in the story: trying to 'follow the money' only takes them to Sussex Records founder Clarence Avant who, having worked with many other, much larger artists, either can't or won't remember much about his record sales. This probably should have been probed further as to where the where all the money from thousands of South African record sales went; or left out entirely as it contributes little into the unearthing of the true facts.But on the whole this is a nice enough documentary about a man that few knew in his homeland, yet was heralded as a musical genius and a strong influence in speaking out over apartheid in South Africa. The music industry is difficult to predict as to who will sell and where they will sell; but if not given much information, fans will inevitably invent their own stories about the music they listen to. The fantasies will be as outrageous and exaggerated as possible until beyond belief, certainly creating disappointment when discovered to not be true. Though the truth will bring with it some surprises, and perhaps be stranger than fiction.www.politic1983.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, any English speaking kid in the 90's in South Africa will undoubtedly know Rodriquez as their parents drilled it into their ears of how amazing he is. I was SHOCKED when I saw this - I guess that's how America feels so often, thinking the world is on the same page with them when in fact no one else knows (just a little joke) - but yeah, I had no idea only SA knew about him. I always thought he was on the same level as Jimi Hendrix, great, tons of fans, even more drugs and death. Man was i disillusioned. Was it a case of misinformation or did I just fabricate a similar back story that would suite his stardom (on our shores)? I don't know. The doccie does try to paint Afrikaans people (the white guys responsible for apartheid) in a less offensive light at times. In fact I would go as far as to say Rodriguez was huge in SA because of the English speaking community (Afrikaans punk? Whats that?). Take the political history the way it's delivered, with some Sugarman sprinkled on top, but lap the story up for what it is, amazing.</fullReview>

Technically, this movie is so basic as a movie may can be but it's content is something what made my mind drifting away. And this is what music, photography, theater, paintings and all arts in general are all about....to stimulate and move your feelings and thoughts in a surprisingly way. If you can come up with something like that and it had cost just a couple of bucks, than it means there is a lot of heart in it. And this, you definitely can feel. Two more things.....I was never a Bob Dylan fan and Rodriguez should have used the name Sixto and he would have become famous :) Enjoy this film folks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Documentary! 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: This is a very emotional movie about a humble man who was loved and adored for his music in South Africa and he just never hit the big time. The director done a great job with putting this movie together, but its a shame that you don't know what really happened. To be honest, I have never heard of this artist before, but his story is amazing. It's such a shame that he never got what he was due. Anyway, its a great documentary and I hope that Rodriguez well get more publicity now that this documentary has won awards and become more popular. Great Watch!Round-Up: I didn't know what to expect from this movie, but after hearing the buzz around it, I thought that I would give it a go, and I am happy that I did. Rodriguez should be an inspiration to many artist and everyday people who aren't materialistic and who are in the music world just for the love of music. His story is shocking and some what mysterious and strange. The people that were investigating his whereabouts, really had to delve into his music to get clues about the whole Rodriguez story. It really does have something for everyone.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $4million I recommend this movie to people who like there emotional documentaries about an artist with a strange life story. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple and uplifting documentary that explains and shares pretty well (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard good things about this film and at the same time figured there must be a pretty good story here to justify making the film and for it to have done as well as it has. Perhaps I should not have come to the film with this in my head because in a way I was waiting for a dramatic twist in the telling, or something sinister to happen to make it an engaging tale, whereas in fact nothing of the sort really happens. I say this in reflection though because I wasn't thinking this so much during the film because mostly the truth is much more rewarding and engaging.The film runs to about 80 minutes long and it is well paced for this time ? not too long but not too short either. The first 30 minutes of the film introduces the music but also the conditions in South Africa at the time; I appreciated this as it helped the uninitiated to learn about both and understand why this music had such a place in the country and in the people from that time. This may not be the crux of the film but it was very important to do right because it makes you care about the search and the answers. The search is perhaps not so well presented because it seems easier than it was, although they get good contributions from people on the way. The delivery is very well done though because we find a simple man who is content within himself; he has family and seems happy and continues to do so even when he learns of his fame far from home. To me this was the main thing, that this sudden new world didn't make him demanding and the realization that he could have had this life decades ago did not seem to make him bitter either.This is the heart of the film and while it isn't the most dramatic of denouncements, it is nicely touching and satisfying. Everyone involved has passion and interest in their subject and this comes through the film really well. As a documentary is it less than perfect though and there are plenty of things that bugged me about it. For example, his journey to South Africa was some time before the film was made, but all the interviews are filmed as if all was still unknown. Likewise the whole thing about where the money went really doesn't go anywhere either.Generally though I liked the film; engaging and uplifting in one very simple tale. There are no massive twists but it is made with passion and energy and it does a very good job of sharing that with the viewer. Some little annoyances come with it, but mostly it is a satisfying little film and well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Unsung North and South Hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one could strive to be as much an unknown hero as Rodriguez, I would bow before them.This movie, this documentary, Searching for Sugar Man, is so inspiring, so original so upbeat and so great?I'm sorry I didn't see it sooner.Thanks to a dear friend of mine, I was introduced to a perfectly paced, wonderfully shot and excellent to the ear documentary about the search for the man, the genius, that no one has heard of. Including myself.And now, I'm glad I have heard of him. I loved this man's music. I loved his plight, his journey and both his humanity and humble life. This is a great film and one of the few that cast an original story with an original way telling a documentary.While most documentarians wait for the grand finale, for the ultimate surprise, this Malik Benjelloul decided, half-way through his film, to reveal the first of two wonderful shockers. I did not see that coming. In addition, once revealed, I didn't see the ending, by a long shot. Uplifting, to say the least.Searching for Sugar Man tells the tale of an unheard of musician of the late 1960s/early 1970s in Detroit, MI, USA. He performed here, there and finally got somewhat discovered. Only, the grand USA wasn't ready for him. Mercifully, seas away, South Africa got a hold of him and this, inadvertently, helped cause a much needed revolt.Sadly, this tale of a genius musician who didn't take off in America, didn't know of his own influence overseas and because of this, he gravely didn't expand as he should've.According to reports, he eventually killed himself on stage during a concert in which he was wrongfully booed.Admittedly, I've never heard of him. Most of America hasn't either. And this is a wrong. The songs played in the movie ? nicely accounted for with titles on screen ? make us all want to buy his albums. I am going to. Mark my words: I will buy his CDs.The movie is a search for this mystery man, this "Rodriguez," whom we should all hope to become someday. He's true, he's real and this well-deserving award-winning documentary shows how both the humble thrive and how a documentary director can masterfully film a story.This is an unknown story of an even more unknown man. See it. Live it. And preach it. Oh, and buy the album. When you find out where the proceeds of a humble human go, it won't make you feel guilty one bit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I'm not a big fan of folksingers. I absolutely love original folk music,(a.k.a world music) but American folksingers like Dylan is not my cup of tea. Rodriguez was mentioned to me from a very good friend of mine, who is a low key, soft spoken VERY insightful man. He played a couple of songs to me, and I got: "OOOOkeyy??, I'm not completely..." I've been down that ally more than once, so when I got back home I found his records on Wimp (Norwegian styled Spotify), and started to listen to his records. They grew up on me, and I remembered he told me about this film about searching for Rodrigues, Oscars, Sundance, etc.It hit me right between my eyes. These dokus have done a fantastic job. OK, they got one of the best stories in the history of modern music, but they did a wonderful job with this film. It's the best music doku I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of them. IMHO this is the best music documentary ever made. I hope this film will be on the term list for every documentary movie-making school in the world.</fullReview>

There's a difference between you and me, there's a difference between them and us."--Searching for Sugar Man"A Zero can be a Hero" Like Rodriguez, a musician who released his album "The Cold Fact" in the 1970s, was passed into oblivion in the US. No one has ever heard of him or has known of his existence. Yet, as his music traveled incidentally across the oceans to South Africa, it served as a pervasive influence of liberation for the people there. The South Africans were struggling through the hard times of apartheid, and Rodriguez music was like a gentle breeze that eases them from their intolerable and excruciating pains. He was more saintly worshiped by the South Africans than that of Bob Dylan or the Beatles at that time. Still, Rodriguez had no clue that he was a Hit in the other part of the world, he lived an anonymous and harsh life in Detroit, working as a construction worker. When he was uncovered through a Sherlock Holmes searching in 1998 (most South Africans thought he had died a tragic death), he was not at all resentful for what he had missed, the fame and glory that he deserved in justification of his talent. He was very humble and peaceful for what life had showered upon him, and that was what I admire him the most.</fullReview>

At first I could hold on to my belief because the 'fanboy' screamed at me with every person interviewed. I'd go as far as call it saccharine. But as the film progresses it becomes overwhelmingly clear that, well... "Holy Sh*t this is for real!?"Bam! There were the adoring masses, not just a cult following, but religious worship befitting to Pharaohs.And to top it all off it centers on the Award Winner of Most Genuinely Humble man in the Universe. Though I'm sure that if there were such an award awarded to him, he'd given it away to his downtrodden neighbor, to boost his spirit.A dark thought crosses my mind: How many other stories like these could there be told? -- PS: IMDb's "spellcheck" is a censorship tool.

		<fullReview>I think if you come away from this film feeling that it a travesty that Rodriguez didn't get the recognition in the US then I think you have missed the point of the film. I think that Rodriguez has lived his life as people should. Not using art as a tool to gain the advantages that people in banking or politics have. Rodriguez music was used how he would have wanted it to be used. As the expression of a nation living under the most appalling system. If Rodriguez had got the attention he perhaps warranted then this film wouldn't have been made and who knows maybe he would have become rich and famous. As it is the most important part of this story is the story itself. It says so much about goodness and hope and the true value of creativity and for the first time in my life represents a country, who's people are perpetually maligned, in an unusually favorable light. Rodriguez life has most definitely not been in vain and we should not have pity for what could have been. What has been has been an amazing story. A beautiful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tribute to an unrecognized talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did he set himself on fire ? Or did he shoot himself ? Not only the way the mysterious American musician Sixto Rodriguez died is poorly documented, his whole life seems to have been an enigma. The only thing we learn early on in this intriguing documentary is that he was a gifted singer and guitarist, who played in clubs in Detroit in the late 60's. His voice and his stinging lyrics remind us of Dylan, with a bit of Cat Stevens thrown in. Rodriguez recorded two unsuccessful albums in the early 70's - one of which contains the song 'Sugar Man' - and then seems to have disappeared in thin Detroit air... Swedish director Malik Bendjelloul puts in a terrific effort in trying to recreate the myth that surrounded Sixto Rodriguez, traveling all the way to South Africa. Step by step we get to know this enigmatic singer a little better - but the mystery remains. Bendjelloul does a great job, not only in recreating footage and images of the 70's, but he also succeeds in connecting his subject to the anti-Apartheid movement in South Africa and the decay of Detroit...all the while keeping us on the edge of our seats ('what did really happen to the guy, you wonder all along...). The best documentary Oscar is well deserved...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best documentaries on music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having no preconceptions of what to expect from it, I found this film an extraordinary experience.It describes the effects of the music of the early 1970s musician known simply as Rodriguez on the culture of South Africa in the era leading up to the end of Apartheid. Although Rodriguez and his music are virtually unknown outside of South Africa, until the present day, I hope, within the country his music is as well-known, and better known in many cases, as any musicians of the time - say, Paul Simon, who is certainly well known in connection with Africa and its music, or even Elvis or The Beatles.Mostly a mystery, with large helpings of homage and respect, this film is a time capsule of a time that many remember, but it feels like a forgotten time - it almost seems like a mockumentary at times, but that is more the mystery and the unbelievable nature of his life and music.I love documentary film, but this one was absolutely one of the very best in my experience. Not to miss.</fullReview>

To dust of a clich, it's certainly a bittersweet tale but one that will leave you running to tell your friends to drop what they're doing and go watch this film.

		<fullReview>Searching for Sugar Man (2012) **** (out of 4) Rather remarkable documentary telling the history of Rodriguez, a singer who released a couple albums to poor sales in America but in South Africa he was selling nearly half a million copies. A couple fans from there learn that they know nothing about the musician except that he killed himself some way on the stage so they set out to try and gather more information when they get the shock of a lifetime. SEARCHING FOR SUGAR MAN isn't just the best documentary of the year but it's also one of the greatest films of the year period. I was really knocked out by how terrific this movie is and what makes it so memorable is how much magic it contains. There's all sorts of emotions in this story but there's always a rather remarkable turn of events and one really can't help but wonder how this story is true. Had Hollywood released something like this it would have been booed off the screen because it's that wild and unbelievable. Another thing that really works is the actual mystery of the story. I really loved the way the filmmakers are able to bring you into who this musician was, what happened to him in his death and of course what follows that shocked everyone. I had never heard of the story so I was really glued to the film and I will admit that after viewing it the first thing I did was just on Amazon and order his albums. This is such a remarkable story that it really does contain everything a great film should have and here it is in a documentary. Again, something like this couldn't come from an actual movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bob Dylan the world ignored</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The saddest thing in life is wasted talent," Lorenzo told his idealistic son Calogero in Robert De Niro's A Bronx Tale, and that moral could be tweaked to read "the saddest thing in life is an unrecognized talent" for Malik Bendjelloul's Searching for Sugar Man, an astonishing documentary achievement that provides viewers with an uplifting, stranger-than-life story about a folk singer named Sixto Rodriguez. Rodriguez released two vinyls in the seventies, one called Cold Fact and a follow up record called Coming from Reality. Both albums were met with critical acclaim for being lyrically challenging and sung to perfection, yet in North America, they went highly unnoticed, leading Rodriguez to fade into absolute obscurity after being dropped by his record label.Then something strange happened. By some miraculous state of affairs, his album wound up in none other than South Africa, where it was frequently bootlegged and sold on the black market. People were playing the music, children dancing to it in the streets, and the quiet, sheltered culture of South Africa, which was kept a pariah in terms of outside media and news, was embracing the rebellious nature of Rodriguez's lyrics about anti-establishment and drug use.How the album even got to South Africa is nothing but a mystery. Rumor has it that a young woman visiting her boyfriend bought the vinyl over and played it to him and his friends, who burned copies of it for their own friends who did the same, and so on. It then became a phenomenon that spread through the age-old ways of a word-of-mouth campaign, and soon enough, Rodriguez became South Africa's Elvis Presley. Maybe bigger, we're even told.But where was Rodriguez when this was happening. One must remember that this is not only the 1970's, but this is the 1970's with no internet, and in a country that has been sheltered off from the world politically and socially, so very little information was coming in and going out. All many people had was a bootlegged vinyl, which bared the credits of those involved, and the lyrics of the songs, which were highly ambiguous. Rodriguez's most popular songs, "Sugar Man," "I Wonder," and "Crucify Your Mind," were easily accessible, easy and thought-provoking to listen to, yet difficult to define.Had it not been for the efforts of Stephen "Sugar" Segerman and Craig Bartholomew Strydom, two South African men who reside in Cape Town, that question would still be asked today. Thanks to their bravery and persistency in trying to track down the quietly famous singer, it turns out that Rodriguez was, and still is, living a very modest lifestyle in the Detroit, Michigan area, acting as a drifter-character, often playing nightclubs and seedy bars for little to no money. He is, too, unaware of all the fame and success he has achieved in South Africa, and we can almost hear the hint of shock and subtle pride in his voice as he speaks about it. When Sugar and Craig finally get in contact with Rodriguez and schedule an interview, we see how soft-spoken, elegant, and gentle he really is, as he talks about how after the failure of both his albums, he gave up a singing career and pursued the life of a hardworking laborer, scheduling many demolition, renovation, and restoration projects to keep the few amount of lights on and extra money in his pocket.Frequently throughout Searching for Sugar Man, we hear almost every, if not all, of the tracks off his debut album Cold Fact, and see how beautifully they fit the landscape of either Detroit or the South African area. Yet these frequent song pieces and shots of surrounding atmosphere never come off as one thing and that is scenic. The film is always alert, alive, and completely in-tune with its premise and overall goal, and at eighty-five minutes, it zips along at a pace that feels just right.When Rodriguez finally plays a concert in South Africa in 1998, with an upwards of 20,000 people in the audience screaming, cheering, and even crying, we get a glimpse at a different kind of American Dream. Yet it's sad when we're reminded by one of the interviewees that most of us die before achieving Rodriguez's success. Many of us go truly unsung in our talents and are never appreciated or even recognized for them, which is an unbelievably depressing fact. Even today, Rodriguez possesses the fame, but not the glamor that should come with it. It must be remembered that most of Rodriguez's music was pirated or illegally purchased, and wasn't picked up by a record company and officially distributed until recently. It's no doubt that Rodriguez made some money off of his two albums, and his concerts, but not as much as he should have. Yet when we're told at the end that he gave much of his money away to his friends and family, we feel he couldn't care less. He just wanted to be recognized and he was lucky enough to get it.Starring: Stephen "Sugar" Segerman, Craig Bartholomew Strydom, Sixto Rodriguez, Dennis Coffey, and Steve Rowland.

		<shortDescription>Came From Reality - Sixto Rodriguez - Stayed in reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of how a musician can produce two gems, two "products" in Rodriguez' own words, for them to be largely ignored by the mass markets of the USA, Japan and Europe...and yet they spark into a life, a new life, all of their own in the late 1970s in what was one of the most oppressive regimes in the World at that time. Life-enriching is this documentary, drawing you unwarily in as it weaves the myth of Rodriguez' on-stage immolation/self-inflicted gunshot wound, as the white middle-class Afrikaans hail the revolutionary words in his songs and realise that their hero can help them overcome the governmental oppression. Then as the tale depicts the discovery of their musical hero alive and well, living at home in Detroit, Michigan, unaware of how influential his words became, it truly portrays how sometimes we can live day to day oblivious to how we can influence others. I found myself itching to watch this upon release on DVD, its cinematic distribution poor in the UK last year. I was in tears as Sixto takes to the stage for his first South African concert in March 1998, the stadium erupting as their musical hero took to the stage. The soundtrack CD has played every day since......then this morning I re-watched the DVD.....and the tears flowed again as the nature of how a simple man's life can be maintained, irrespective of the monies that he could have - and should have - earned.One detracting point is the way the quest for the royalties peters out and is never really answered. Maybe Clarence Avant knows more than he lets on. Some have said that the simple graphic works and penmanship for the animation is too simplistic - yet I disagree, it enhances how simple a story this film portrays. It fits into the gentle progression of the story. But watch this documentary and feel it pull you into its story, told across near three decades. You will be tapping your foot and humming along as the film ends.....and if you think the comparison with Dylan is unfair, then please re-assess your thoughts. A truly inspiring story.I Wonder.....</fullReview>

There were rumours that he had killed himself on stage amongst others, but his music sold thousands of copies even in apartheid ruled South Africa where the feared apartheid era censors were apparently too stupid to understand the lyrics of songs such as I Wonder and Sugarman.Two people, Stephen Segerman and Craig Bartholomew Strijdom made it their mission to track down the elusive and reportedly deceased singer: they succeeded and this film is not so much their story: more the story of a supposedly failed musician who had become a legend in a nation crying for release from all the censorship and sturm und drang of apartheid ruled South Africa.Thank you, Malik Bendelljoul, thank you Steve, thank you Craig and most of all, thanks, much peace and much love to Sixto Rodriguez.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Love This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most people in the United States, I knew nothing of this performer until this movie was released. A folk singer/song writer, who deserved superstar status, released two albums decades ago and his third was never released. Instead of sharing the stage with Bob Dylan or some of the icons of his era, Rodriguez worked hard labor in Detroit, raising his family, finding a peace within himself. Unknown to him, Rodriguez had become one of the most popular artists in South Africa, when the country was under apartheid. South Africans loved Rodriguez, and he was a bigger star than Elvis. South African children could recite his lyrics word for word. Americans had never heard of him.Rodriguez wrote protest music like so many American folk artists, but his music touched the soul of South Africa, where protests, under the repressive government, was discouraged. He spoke to the soul of the anti-Aparthied protesters, without his knowing about it. Rodriguez sold millions of albums in South Africa, but was never paid for it.No one in South Africa knew much about the man's life, as it was shrouded in myth. There was a legend about him that he had committed suicide on stage. There were a couple of stories about how he had killed himself in a gruesome act of protest, which explained to the South Africans why no more records were forthcoming. In reality he was/is a working man who never earned much money, lived humbly and does so without sadness or remorse. He has lived in the same house for four decades.Promoters locate him and bring Rodriguez to South Africa in 1998 for a sold-out concert tour, where people can hardly believe he is alive. He is treated like a rockstar.He plays his gigs there and returns to his anonymous life in Detroit. His spirit radiates throughout this movie.A musicologist in South Africa began the search for him and is the Sugarman in the title. This movie is wonderful. It is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why haven't I heard of him sooner!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I saw his story and '60 Minutes' and decided to see this documentary. Rodriquez is an amazing fellow with an incredible story, even if he wasn't the voice of a generation of South Africans. This is more than a story of a singer who sold a few albums in another country, it's a story of finding inspiration and motivation and acting on those things that move us... to better ourselves and our surroundings and those around us. Rodriquez himself is inspiring. You couldn't blame him for maybe being a little disappointed (even angry) that things didn't work out artistically the way he hoped it might have in the early '70's, but he just keeps on keeping on. A man of humility, quiet grace and hard work. It seems so rare today that he seems like such an anomaly. He has a beautiful voice and his songs are well crafted. We bought the soundtrack immediately after seeing the movie. This won't be in theaters very long so rent it by means of your choosing, but do yourselves a favor and see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A glorious and true story! What a delight! The story is astounding, even more so because it is true. Amazing to see Rodriquez has grown more beautiful as he got older (in contrast to the vast majority of us!). What I think annoys people a bit about the movie is it does not conform to generally believed stereotypes. The white South Africans in it are not all racist imperialists. And the American record industry does not come out well or honourably. I remember hearing a Rodriguez song at a party and not believing that I heard: "I wonder, How many times we had sex" ... well, I knew for sure that that line would not have been allowed on the radio anyhow. So I knew I would never hear the song broadcast. I went to look for it in the shops (for my little brother). The record was definitely for sale, though, not bootlegged (ordinary middle-class people do not buy pirated versions of things). It was a proper ordinary LP, and it was available in record shops all over. It was there because of the demand for it. That song and 'Sugarman' were great, and I paid for it together with my brother who loved the entire LP and used to play it over and over again. Anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Oscar winning documentary led many people to ask the question. Who is Sugarman?The singer Rodriguez was an early 1970s Bob Dylan type folk singer who released two albums which did not sell well and promptly disappeared. There were rumours that he set himself alight in a concert but although unknown in his home country America, he was popular in South Africa (although not mentioned in the film, also Australia as well.)This was a search for the artist conducted by his South African fans to find out more about him and what happened to him, they did this by following the money.The film interviews his South African fans, what his music means to them and how they set about the search. However if you assume this search took place a few years ago then be prepared to be surprised as it happened in the 1990s and when they found Rodriguez and brought him to tour South Africa it was in the late 1990s.Some viewers might feel disappointed that they have had the rug pulled with this slight of hand storytelling. Then again documentaries are films with a factual narrative that is not necessary the whole truth.Rodriguez himself turns out to be a modest man, if he had become aware of his popularity earlier in his career I doubt that he would had ever toured Apartheid South Africa. The big plus is that his music has been rediscovered though this documentary and his first album does have some good songs.It is still an interesting and enthralling documentary even though if flawed, Rodrigues did tour Australia up to the early 1980s so he was someone involved in the music business in some form for 10 years after the release of his first album.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following 2008's enthralling Anvil! The Story of Anvil, the documentary medium seems a perfect place for a film-maker to give a forgotten musician their just deserves. While Anvil! were rockers that really should have made it in the cock-rock wave of the 1980's but didn't due to bad timing and sheer dumb luck, Searching for Sugar Man tells a different type of story, one that almost beggars belief. As well as revealing some ugly truths about the music studio system, it also disproves the theory that great art will always shine through. Sixto Rodriguez was a Detroit musician who could have been bigger than Dylan, and who possibly harboured a greater talent. He came and went with two studio albums, leaving nothing behind, not even a cult following. Yet everyone he knew and worked with never described him as anything but extraordinary.Yet, over 9000 miles away in South Africa, Sixto Rodriguez was bigger than Elvis. His first album Cold Fact, would be found in nearly every household back in the 1970's. He became a symbol for the anti-apartheid movement, and his records were feared as dangerous and influential, and certain tracks would be scratched by the government to stop them from getting airplay. Yet, the South Africans learned that Rodriguez, disappointed with his lack of success, had doused himself with petrol and set himself alight on stage. Or that he shot himself. The details were unclear, but he had committed suicide. But two music journalists, wanting to find out more about this mysterious figure, would not only uncover the story of a man that was unheard of in his native country, but discover he is alive and well.It's a beautifully shot documentary, shifting from the snowy greys of Detroit, to the sun-bleached world of South Africa. The first half shows us the exciting investigative efforts of Stephen 'Sugarman' Segerman and Craig Bartholomew Strydom, and the many obstacles in their way. One interview with former Motown Records Chairman Clarence Avant possibly uncovers a cover-up of Rodriguez's South African success, as Avant gets extremely defensive when posed questions about the money trail. Maybe Rodriguez was a victim of shady capitalism, or perhaps he was simply a voice America chose not to listen to. After all, he was a shy, awkward presence (he often sat with his back to the crowd), and was from a Mexican immigrant background, hardly the face of the U.S. at the time.In an age where the music industry is ruled by floppy-haired teens, talentless dollar-eyed wailers from the X-Factor machine, or bling- covered c***s that label themselves as 'hip-hop', it's reassuring to know there's still people out there with a thirst for real music. Sugar Man's Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature is not just for the film itself, but for the inspiration behind it. The first half shows us Segerman and Strydom's search for the elusive figure, but the second half tracks him down. We see him peering out from the window of his downtrodden home, and it's the man's humbleness that makes him so endearing. He is truly a man of the people, opposed to capitalism and material wealth, and we learn this as his past is unravelled, never ruining the air of mystique surrounding the man. It's a great story, and one the world needs at this moment in time.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Searching for Sugar Man" is an amazingly strange story--the sort of thing that seems much more like fiction than real life. Back in the early 1970s, Sixto Rodriguez (known only as 'Rodriguez') signed a record deal and life was looking good. However, despite some big fans in the record industry, this didn't equate to sales in the US and his album tanked and Rodriquez faded into obscurity...or so you would think. However, during the latter part of the apartheid era in South Africa, his music somehow evolved into an anthem of the opposition--and his anti-establishment lyrics were perfect for this. However, folks in South Africa assumed Rodriguez had died--and lots of rumors of his death abounded. It's only been in the last part of the 1990s that Rodruguez' whereabouts were discovered and he became a huge sensation when he went on tour. This film chronicles this bizarre rags to....well rags..story. What's so interesting about it is Rodriguez himself. In the film, he doesn't seem to have regrets for the way his life went and seems very humble about his new success. Overall, a wonderfully made and fascinating film--and it comes as no surprise as you watch it that it took the Oscar for Best Documentary (full-length) at this year's award ceremony. Fascinating throughout and there is certainly NOTHING like it when it comes to documentaries!</fullReview>

Malik recorded most of the documentary with an i-phone, it's one of the simplest documentaries I have ever seen and yet it perspires the Afrikaans struggle to end apartheid. Rodriguez became the fountain of inspiration to an open South African society without even knowing it and he enters the hall of fame of famous singers and writers that trough their revolutionary art open the way to human freedom.Tears of joy flowed from my eyes when I saw the documentary, an unusual thing. Sixto Rodriguez and Malik Bendjelloul forever have their place in human history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>521st Review: For every muso ever, a simply stunning love song....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in time in the 1970s and early 80s before Idol and all that the way we bonded was music - not just what you listened to, but what you listened on, and what you knew - the little known concerts, the strange facts (Supertramp's name origin, sure, but that Halliwell was reading a copy of UKs Penthouse while recording Rudy - that scored you points).Sugar Man captures that sense of music, music as wonder, as true troubadour, On The Road, riding the boxcar, bigger than all of us, wonder. It's the tale of a Nick Drake like figure from the States - Rodriguez - who made a couple of albums in the early 70s that bombed, but became huge, like Elvis huge in South Africa, without him knowing about it.He died tragically.The documentary uncovers more and more and more surprises and is without a doubt the most joyous and exhilarating documentary of the year. What we see takes us deeply into that shared memory of what musicians in this modern era have meant and done for us.It is superbly told - the story in a sense is so compelling it tells itself but it is done with a light touch and a real sense of timing and nonchalance (in the best sense) - it is first rate film making.This comes with the highest recommendation - it deserves every award that's coming to it - and more - it is essentially a film about love, not just love of music, but even, deeper, something about humanity - and that makes it a great documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just the best documentary, but one of the best of the year...period!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life's a funny thing... Recently I spoke with my fellow staff writers about the importance of sitting on a film you feel is perfect or "four-star" worthy before you officially go on record with the review. It feels acceptable to say a film grew in estimation for you over a time but it can be scathed or frowned upon to retract on a statement made if it paints the film in a perfect light. It's hard to erase what you've already said. Enter Searching for Sugar Man from Sony Pictures Classics. Director Malik Bendjelloul gives an insight into one of the most fascinating artists I've never known. Searching for Sugar Man, the story of two South Africans that set out to find out the mystery surrounding one of their favorite artists from the 1970s Rodriguez, is likely one of the great music documentaries of all-time. Huge statement? You bet it is. As someone who is and will always is in love with film, I love art universally, in all its forms from the cinematic treasures on screen, to the music gracing the ear drums, to the paintings of Michelangelo; I inhabit a respect and admiration for self- expression, no matter what form it's in. Give me a film that fuses art together into a beautiful portrait of mystery, meaning, and depth, you have me at minute one. Rodriguez, described as Bob Dylan-like, was a singer and songwriter in the 1970s who released two studio albums, "Cold Fact" and "Coming from Reality," both to critical raves from music journalists. Despite all the raves, the sales were incredibly low and his label, Sussex/A&amp;R dropped him. Following his drop from the label, an urban legend emerged in his place. Rumors circled that Rodriguez had killed himself. Did he kill himself by dousing himself with gasoline and lighting himself on fire on stage in front of disgruntled fans? Or did he play the final lyrics to one of his songs and shoot himself? What makes the story even more intriguing is due to piracy and bootleg copies of his albums, Rodriguez's music found its way to South Africa, where he is revered as the Elvis Presley of the great nation. In the 90s, a world-wide manhunt began to order to track down the sought after artist. What Director Bendjelloul does brilliantly is allow Rodriguez's music, in all its melodic chords and authenticity, to be the star of the documentary. Segment after segment, a song by the talented Rodriguez subtly lays into the frames quietly but with authority. His music is like nothing I've ever heard. In a day and age where Adele and Frank Ocean are the most meaningful artists working, Rodriguez comes as a grandfather to music. It's amazing how filmmakers, especially in the documentary genre, can identify stories that need to be told. On the surface, who cares about Rodriguez? He's a 1970s singer with a enigmatic persona and a failed music career in the United States. You can find a dozen stories like that on the corner of New York City in Times Square. But Rodriguez is proof that music is a soul of its own that occasionally can place its hand on the shoulder of an artist. What makes my feeling about this film even more amusing is I still don't know that much more about Rodriguez the person following the ending credits then I did when the film started. I'm okay with that. Bendjelloul's Searching for Sugar Man is a bridge and an entry way into a realm of musicality and significance. It's the best documentary of the year!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inspiring story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best documentaries I ever had the pleasure to watch. It tells this amazing and inspiring real story of an artist who did not get the recognition he deserved. He stepped out of the business leaving behind a couple of albums before disappearing completely in the '70s. No one knew nothing about this Rodriguez besides his name. However, he did get some fans. Lots of them. In South Africa. And then, more than a decade later, two fans start a quest to learn more about this great artist, whom rumors said committed suicide, live in stage during a poor performance concert. But what did they find?The music in this documentary is absolutely great. Of course, they are Rodriguez's songs. The image quality is also top notch, mixing HD interviews with old low quality footage.I recommend this to anyone, even if they (like me) have never heard about Rodriguez before. This story feels like a mystery movie told by interviews and narrators. But above all, it is a big inspiration for struggling artists. Who never wondered if in this world talent alone is enough? Maybe you won't get your answer, but it will give you strength to keep fighting and doing what you love - your art - no matter if it's music, painting, literature, all artists seek recognition. Truly heartwarming, it deserves at least a 9/10. Since I'm a struggling artist myself (writer wannabe), I could relate to some of it, thus I gave it a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>musical footnote with a couple of great insights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early 70s, Sixto Rodriguez became the biggest singer in the isolated conservative 5South Africa. There was very little known about him and was believed to have committed suicide on stage. His music became anthems against apartheid. Starting in 1968, Rodriguez recorded his music in Detroit. His music is reminiscent of Dylan but never caught on. His story continues to be a mystery until fans from South Africa start searching for his true story. In 1998, he walks onto a South African stage rising from the dead.Rodriguez is a small footnote in music history. A biography of him is not necessarily the most compelling except for this fascinating quirk of history. It allows for a great insight into 70s South African society that has never been explained in any movie. The interview with Clarence Avant is brilliant. The man turns from a friendly grandfather figure into a defensive crook in a blink of an eye. The family's emotional journey is beyond belief. It's a crazy true story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILER ALERT** There was a long search for the Sugar Man, and the journey was incredible in itself. "Searching for Sugar Man" won the Academy Award for best documentary, and deserved it rightfully so. If you knew nothing about the artist Sixto Rodriguez, this documentary would give you just about everything that everyone else questioned about this mysterious man. The music he played was incredible to many in South Africa but all of those fans also had no idea who he was, or if he was still even around or making music. For many years he was believed to be dead by some crazy on stage suicide such as setting himself on fire, or shooting himself after singing the last line in one of his more famous songs. Stephen Segerman, who was in search for all the answers to all the questions everyone was asking, also had heard these crazy rumors, so he decided to go on the hunt to find out what really did happen to Rodriguez. Here comes the spoiler: after many hours of research and hunting, it turns out that Rodriguez is alive and kicking. This is what makes it one of the best documentaries. For a little bit more than the first half there is this impression that the great Rodriguez is dead, and then he shows up in his own documentary to tell of his years under the radar. The past 40 years that he has been alive, his records sold over hundreds of thousands of copies in South Africa, and he had no idea of it going on. Many loved his music, few knew who he was, and the money he could have obtained from music, he gave all away to his family and friends. Rodriguez was a gift sent to us that to few got to experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To all my fellow music lovers: does the name Sixto Rodriguez ring a bell? Although I am a wide- range music lover, I had never heard of Rodriguez until I saw the film Searching for Sugar Man (2012). Although Rodriguez's music career started in Detroit, Michigan, many of his fan base came from South Africa. This documentary directed by Malik Bendejelloul explores the music history of Rodriguez throughout his career, and the abrupt end of it after his tragic death that was said to be a suicide during a performance. After two super-fans find family ties to the musical sensation, Rodriguez's story is anything but ordinary. This heartwarming documentary, Searching for Sugar Man will take you on the journey of discovering some of his greatest hits and darkest secrets, and answer the question, "is he really gone?" This documentary is enjoyable for anyone who is an avid music listener, surely for Rodriguez fans as well. You will be drawn by the cool indie-folk sounds of Rodriguez's hits from the 70's, become intrigued by the (lack of) answers about his disappearance, and find yourself Searching for Sugar Man for the answers to his whereabouts as well! Besides the musical genius, viewers will see the heart that lies inside the musician that so many others lose to fame. I would highly recommend to see the film for yourself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT This documentary tells the story of Rodriguez, a singer who did not know he was a star until years after his last album was released. The story begin in Cape town, South Africa were a record store owner begins telling the story of a singer who was bigger than Elvis in South Africa but was virtually unknown in the United States. Rodriguez who still lives in Detroit, Michigan as a construction worker recorded two albums and worked on a third that was never completed. His story is one that is interesting because it is hard to believe that he never found out for years that he was a huge sensation. He had accepted the fact that he was not going to be a star and continued to live his life the way he was accustomed too. Clarence Avant who was the Chairman at the time he was working on his albums, had nothing but praise about him. He could not believe that his unique style of music was not enough to sell. His music was something that the people in South Africa could relate to because of the activities going in their government. He was so successful that the South African government scratched songs of his records. The people that cherished his music always did and had their children listen to it. This story has a happy and humble ending to it. In the 1990's he played several sold out shows in South Africa and continued to tour afterwards. Despite all the success, he continues to live his simple life giving some of the money to his family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Academy Award Winning Documentary, Searching for Sugar Man (2012), directed by Malik Bendjelloul, tells the extraordinary story of two men, in quest to find the popular, South African singer and song writer by the name of Rodriguez. The name of the film itself leaves the audience questioning, wondering, and "searching" for answers on what exactly this film is going to be about. What is this film exactly about? In the 1970's, a man by the name of Sixto Rodriguez, began his career as a popular folk singer and song writer. Hi music often comparable to many well-known American artists. Almost three decades later, these two men seek the truth about the mysterious man and what he is doing today by filming this documentary. Is he still creating music? Is his rumored death by suicide true or is he still alive? Through the lens of a hand-held camera, the audience is able to fully experience the journey from Cape Town, South Africa to the United States of America to find what really happened to this incredible man. With most scenes using on-location shooting and real video footage of Rodriguez from concerts in South Africa, the audience is able to experience the passion that Rodriguez had for music first handedly. The film also allows for the audience not only to hear his music but allows them to see his joy for doing something that he loved. The incredible story of this man's music and its ability to be popular in one country but virtually unknown is truly interesting to understand, but is the part of this film that makes it truly remarkable. This is a documentary you cannot pass up. It's a wonderful, heart-warming and inspiring film that instills passion in all viewers. What starts off as a film with many unanswered questions, comes full-circle where the audience gets a real sense of who Rodriguez was both as a musician but more importantly, a person.</fullReview>

Malik Bendjelloul takes you on an incredible journey echoed in mystery and darkness as the story behind the Sugar Man comes to light. Rumors swirl and more questions than answers spring to the surface. A man adored by thousands in one country is barely recognizable in another. He is even more popular than Elvis but he's just a face on a record shrouded in mystery. Song after song whispers in your ears haunting you in the film's entirety as you travel to and from South America and the United States seeking any scrap of new information about this mystifying artist. Breakthroughs arouse excitement. The shocking truth discovered of what feels like Rodriguez's rise from the grave pulls you in. The edge of your seat becomes your home as the ever-alive Rodriguez finally reveals the whole truth behind the Sugar Man. Even the style of the film captures your attention and helps to add to the story and mystery. Artful editing sketches out buildings and places you into the heart of Detroit and South America. Mise-en-scenes of photos of this supposed dead man and people on the streets explaining how they "had known the man", made the rumors seem realistic and the efforts of looking for information behind the Sugar Man futile. With all the hardships and negativity Rodriguez had to face, the documentary skillfully turns from the darkness and mystery to highlight his true greatness as an artist and the bliss he caused for thousands of individuals in South America. The end awards Rodriguez the heartwarming redemption he deserved and makes you wonder why you have never heard of this innovative artist until now.</fullReview>

However, as gifted as he was, Rodriguez is not seen by the American public with such enthusiasm. That did not stop his music from influencing other parts of the world.

His music popularity was equivalent to that of the Rolling Stones, however Rodriguez was not aware of this fact. He continued to live in America as a construction worker, where fame had not yet reached him. Half way across the world, in South Africa stories where told of Rodriguez's horrible death. The documentary follows a group of journalists coming together in order to find information on the truth behind the legend. The films sound is phenomenal, it uses a wide range of songs from Rodriguez's albums. Each and every song describes how the audience should be feeling, from the terrible stories of Rodriguez's death, to his return to Africa. During Rodriguez first concert after his return, there are shots from the actual even during the concert, which continues to emphasize just how talented he was. By the end this film would have you wanting to hear more of Rodriguez amazing music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Searching for sugar man is an uplifting tale of resilience and hope that is directed by Malik Bendjelloul. This documentary is about a man named Rodriguez who during the 70's gets a record deal because of his amazing musical talent. Although he is a gifted musician, the public does not necessarily agree. After two records being recorded and not living up to the hype in America, he is dropped from the label as he cannot sell any records. Even though he is a musical genius, he never gains commercial success. Halfway across the world in South Africa though, his records are selling like hot cakes. Everyone in the country is captivated by the mysterious Rodriguez. No information is available about this musician only adding to his allure and the two records he records go on to become major hits. Being unaware of his aboveboard success in Africa, Rodriguez goes on to live a very modest life with his existence unaware to his loyal fans. This all changes when two die hard South African fans began their search for Rodriguez. Little do they know that during this epic search, what they uncover will change their lives inevitably. After watching this documentary, it is easy to see why this documentary won an Academy Award. The director does an excellent job in taking the viewer on a journey. A journey that begins with many questions and ends with a conclusive ending that leaves the viewers of the documentary thoroughly satisfied. With the beautiful city of Cape Town in the background, this documentary is must watch for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwarming, Inspirational, unforgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***This review may contain spoilers***************Malik Bendjelloul's Searching for Sugar Man is an inspirational documentary that will truly leave you in awe before the end of the film. It is to no surprise that Searching for Sugar Man won an Academy Award for being the best documentary. The story is undoubtedly one of a kind being improbable and completely heartwarming. The film did a fantastic job deviating from the norm of a typical documentary, instead taking the audience on a journey playing a detective role in a mystery that unwinds itself into a beautiful story of proletariat triumph. Searching for Sugar Man's cinematography was simple yet visually appealing, especially with their shots of Detroit where the film shows exactly how so simply Sixto Rodriguez lived. The film did a phenomenal job emphasizing Rodriguez's humility by showing his way of life even after being rediscovered. The film shows Rodriguez's long dead musical dream become resurrected due to his faithful and ever-adoring fans. The film will leave you with the question of how much more different would his life be if he had discovered his enormous popularity in South Africa at an earlier stage in his life. One thing that is for certain is that you will be glad it happened and he got to experience it in his life rather than not experience it at all with him thinking he was a failure in the music industry. The story is unforgettable and the film is a work of art. Searching for Sugar Man is one of most impactful films that I have seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful Uplifting Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Spoilers Ahead*** Searching for Sugar Man is a heartwarming documentary that leaves viewers feeling extravagant and wanting to live your life to fullest in what really matters. Being someone who really loves music and its history, I appreciate the poetry of songs and the film 's opening song by Rodriguez reels you into the story right off the bat encouraging you to know every little detail. Usually within documentaries it's very concrete and straightforward leaving little to interpretation but Searching for Sugar Man keeps you wondering through out the film of characters intentions, reasoning's for the songs of Rodriguez of being unpopular, and how unbelievable it is for this one man to not be angry, greedy, or have any envy for materials this man in every right deserves. This documentary seems to be a beautiful story of a legend or a myth. Like it was just added to the history books because it's too unbelievable to be true. It's a relief to know there are actually good hearted people out there who don't hold grudges, don't dwell in the past, and care about others more than themselves. These events of the documentary happened to the perfect man who deserved every moment of recognition. For a man who enjoyed all the riches of the lower class and stayed so grounded to earth to enjoy all the important riches of the upper class. The tale of Sixto Rodriguez is one everyone should experience for whichever background you may have, because this a true role model for everyone on this Earth to actually live life the correct, modest, and caring way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Search for a Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT!!!In the Academy Award winning documentary Searching for Sugar Man, by Malik Bendjelloul, it is hard to avoid being completely roped in. Starting off, the viewers are sent off on a search for what South African journalists consider to be a musical legend. Sixto Rodriguez, otherwise known as "Sugar Man", touched the hearts of so many people from South Africa with his music during the 70's and 80's. For years, stories and tales were told of this musician's horrible death by suicide during one of his concerts. Without any proof, contact, or validation to explain this mystery, his fans remained loyal and continued to worship his music. Despite the rumors, the search continued on for Rodriguez from the dedication of the journalists from South Africa. Continuing to be drawn into the story, the hunt for the legend takes a huge leap. A daughter of the famous mystery musician, Eva, comes forward in an online ad about the never ending search for Rodriguez. When she read the ad, she couldn't seem to grasp why so many people from a completely different place were looking for her father. She soon found out from the journalists that, even though her father had trouble making it in the United States, he was never forgotten in South Africa. With this finding, I couldn't help but sit on the edge of my seat, anticipating finally seeing this long lost legend. Living in Detroit at the time doing handy work and construction jobs, Rodriguez finds his dreams slowly coming true thanks to these determined journalists. In 1998, Rodriguez, along with his family, take the trip of a lifetime to the place where he is considered a superstar. There, he played six completely sold-out shows for his fans and was finally doing what he set out to do so many years before. The look on his face and reaction from his fans tells it all in this documentary. The cinematography in this documentary captured each moment and the beauty of its surroundings, pulling viewers in to imagine themselves at the concerts. The cheers and scenes from the crowd are heightened, sending chills down the spines of those viewing and reminding us to never give up on what we love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Search for the Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILER ALERT** Have you ever had a musician that you absolutely adored? Many people can honestly say that they had or currently do. But what if he or she just up and vanished? Would you take it upon yourself to find them? Searching for Sugar Man (2012) is a documentary by Malik Benjelloul that follows two fans searching for the famous 1970's musician known as Rodriguez. This documentary does a great job at showing the audience the beginning career of the mysterious Rodriguez all the way until the rumored suicide attempt on stage that lead to his ultimate "death". The two South African fans are on the hunt to find out the truth of whether or not Rodriguez is actually dead. Upon this mission, they uncover many secrets about the music label that signed Rodriguez. Rodriguez's daughter reveals to the fans that Rodriguez is indeed alive and living a not so lavish life-style in Detroit, Michigan. These fans take it upon themselves to bring Rodriguez and his family to South Africa. Not many of his albums sold in the US, so Rodriguez and his family were skeptical as well as surprised when they were told that in South Africa he was an idol. This documentary does an excellent job at keeping the audience interested by incorporating some of Rodriguez's songs into it. I have never heard of Rodriguez until watching this documentary, and I was impressed by how much I enjoyed his songs and genius lyrics. I think many people would agree with that statement, leading us to all wonder why he wasn't a huge hit in America and why are we not bringing his music back today?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ask anyone if they have ever listened to music from the singer Rodriguez and you will likely get a look of confusion followed by a resounding "who?" This claim leaves me with a bittersweet feeling of envy for these people because although his identity remains unknown to them it also allows for them to experience the same opportunity I had to watch the film Searching for Sugar Man and learn of the extraordinary true story of Sixto Rodriguez. Searching for Sugar Man was one of the best documentaries I have seen in a very long time and the very fact that it is a true story makes the film even more incredible. The film is about a mysterious folk singer from Detroit, Michigan known only by the name Rodriguez and how his music, although not gaining attraction in the US, became a beacon of inspiration years later for thousands of people in South Africa. Director Malik Bendjelloul captures the unbelievable journey that Rodriguez's music took through the use of heartfelt interviews with people from Detroit remembering his rare performances at local bars many years ago, to the people in South Africa recalling the messages they heard in his music. He effectively engages the audience in the enigmatic existence of Rodriguez by showing the rare yet cursory photographs of the long-haired man hiding behind dark sunglasses as well as the horrific stories of how he had killed himself on stage. Amazingly, Malik also uses Rodriguez's music in the film to effectively enhance the emotions to be felt when someone recalls an old memory of his performance or when hearing his music for the first time. It felt like I was watching a music video for his songs whenever they were accompanied by an establishing scenery shot of a Detroit street. Through the use of interviews, old photographs, and even Rodriguez's music, the documentary has you tag along with the curious fans in search of the answers to: Who is Rodriguez? Why isn't he more widely known? How did his records reach South Africa? Is he really dead?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Music Documentations Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Alert!Malik Bendjelloul's Searching for Sugar Man is a very absorbing documentary. The film starts with visual poetry, as we see an animated drifter walk the streets of Detroit in the winter time. The film paints a mythical quality of former singer Rodriguez, as two people, Stephen "Sugarman" Segerman, a record shop owner from South Africa, and Craig Bartholomew Strydom, a journalist, took on the task to find the man who unknowingly created a musical sensation that cultivated South African society in the 1970's and 80's.These two men begin on a quest to find this icon of South African rock/folk music. As the film progresses, we see them search from state to state in hopes of finding Sixto Rodriguez. This proves difficult, as there had been little information on this cult hit wonder. The search to find this man, whose whereabouts were unknown after the production of his only two produced records, Cold Fact and Coming From Reality, was a challenge. It begged the question if the rumors were true; was he really dead? After a long search, the men find more than they are looking for. One of the aspects which I love about this film is the mysticism that's formed around Rodriguez.Director Malik Benedjelloul builds on the suspense with every interview, and when we finally find Sixto Rodriguez , it is a complete ocean swell of emotions. I have never felt such shock in awe in viewing a documentary before. The film then smoothly unfolds with excitement as every new fact about Rodriguez is presented to the audience by either himself or his two daughters. When Rodriguez gets the invitation to go to South Africa, it is like a dream we finally see this hard laborer get his due and perform live to his adoring fans.Bendjelloul's Searching for Sugar Man is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. The film truly has verisimilitude, as the everyone talks to the director with sincerity. It unfolds like a mystery and unearths its colorful psychedelic music onto my generation with ease and excitement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film was a heartwarming story that started as a simple quest for answers and ended in ways no one could ever have guessed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Spoilers Ahead** ******The documentary Searching for Sugar Man was an amazing story of a hunt for a man that was incredibly influential to South African society. Having only short-lived fame, it was rumored that he had killed himself. Through some unknown reasons, his albums made their way to South Africa where he became extremely popular and influential. Despite this, almost nothing was known of him. The film leads you on what started out as a hunt for any information and ended up becoming a truly heartwarming adventure. The film is and is shot as a standard documentary. To both show what he sounded like and make you question why he is so unknown, his music is played throughout the film. The film does an amazing job in making you want to know more about this mysterious man through the commentary and music.The film gets very interesting when Rodriguez's fate is finally revealed. After all the work and effort put into tracking down information about a dead man, they get the break they need when they discover he is alive. The film teases you then, after the reveal, by not showing him. It keeps you on the edge of your seat as you continue to watch the story unfold and can fully appreciate what the filmmaker's were feeling: Optimistic and slightly doubtful. Once he is finally introduced, it is impossible to not love him. He is an amazingly humble man who deserves more praise than he ever got. Despite being essentially cheated out of his money and living in poverty, he still gave away most of the money he made after his newfound fame. Much in the same way we were surprised, when it shows him walking out on stage in front of a massive crowd (who weren't entirely sure if it was him or an imposter) was the most incredible scene of the film, in my opinion. Hopefully you're reading this after seeing the film, and if so, I hope you can agree that this scene is the biggest reason one would remember this story and encourage others to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Searching for Sugar man" Is Sweet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERTIt is no wonder "Searching for Sugar Man," by Malik Bendjelloul, won the Academy Award in 2013 for the best documentary film. "Searching for Sugar Man" fulfills and masterfully executes many of the conventions of a documentary film's style of realism. The un-manipulative mise-en-scene, open forms, use of a hand-held camera, minimal, simple, and unobtrusive editing that focuses the viewer's attention directly to the film's subject matter of Sixto Rodriquez; real footage and photographs, and on- location shooting amplify the film's authenticity. The realistic qualities of the film also allows the viewer to actively participate in and interrupt the mystery and chase to find the rebel icon. Besides the verisimilitude and captivating story in "Searching for Sugar Man," the music and establishing long shots of vast landscapes are arguably the main contributors to the film's extraordinary success. The prominent non- diegetic music from Rodriguez's "Cold Fact" album played throughout the film sets the tone of each lengthy take and further engages the audience. Similarly, the spectator naturally becomes mesmerized by the breathtaking establishing shots of the exterior scenery in Cape Town, Africa and Detroit, Michigan which are beautifully accompanied with Rodriguez's music. The audience can indirectly feel the warmth of the sun shining over the blue African waters and become blinded by the city lights in Detroit.Overall, the viewer of "Searching for Sugar Man" is marked with a lasting impact once the closing credits appear on the screen. The audience tastes victory with Stephen "Sugar" Segerman and Craig Bartholomew Strydom when the man behind the black sunglasses and hat is discovered to be still kicking. There is no doubt each moviegoer will get "Sugar Man" and Rodriquez's remarkable story stuck in their heads for days after watching "Searching for Sugar Man."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Searching for Sugar Man" Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILER ALERT**As a viewer who had no idea who Sixto Rodriguez (Sugar-Man) was, I would say that this documentary really grows on you and would truly make you a fan. From the very beginning of the film, South African music journalists explained how they were searching to find one of the most famous musicians of the 70's and 80's. Rumors spread that he might have killed himself while performing a concert, but there wasn't any concrete facts to prove that. You slowly but surely get caught up in this hunt and really want to find out where this musician was, what he was doing, and what has he been up to. With each new clue that was found, my curiosity increased and I wanted to know more about him. Rodriguez's music may not have been popular in his homeland, the United States, but in South Africa, this is a completely different story. Rodriguez's daughter, Eva, saw an ad one day that people from South Africa were looking for her father, but had no idea why. She contacted the writers who then explained how he was a very famous musician in their country. Rodriguez had been living in Detroit renovating buildings and homes before his life was about to change for the better. In 1998, he and his family took a trip to South Africa to play six sold out shows. It was incredible to see how happy Rodriguez was as he was playing for all of his fans and you could truly tell that music is what he was born to do. The cinematographer did a great job creating such beautiful scenes that make you want to get on a plane to South Africa right away along with the wonderful music by Rodriguez, whose songs will be stuck in your head for the rest of the day! "Searching for Sugar-Man" is truly a documentary that is an inspiration for all, reminding you to never stop believing and to always follow your dreams!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, moving, music documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not often that you can describe a music documentary as deeply moving, but this would be one of those times. Captures the enigma that was Rodriguez, the stark contrast between his popularity at home, where he was basically unknown, and in South Africa, where he was idolised. Most importantly, it captures Rodriguez's re- emergence into the musical spotlight. On the down side, the "searching" can feel a bit contrived and over- dramatized at times. That would be the only negative.As expected, the music is superb. Interviews are well-conducted and the interviewees generally always have something positive to add to the story. Good editing.A must-see for any Rodriguez fan, or for anyone who is into good/serious music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Reader, seek out, as I did, the tracks of Sixto Rodriguez, listen to them and let them soak into your soul. Then watch this lovingly assembled documentary and wonder at a real-life story that almost stranger than fiction. Rodriguez is the epitome of self-effacing humility. His talent, however, is massive. His songs are subtle, melodic and complex but at the start of the seventies, no-one in the US is ready to listen to them. Unknown and unrecognised in his own country, by a bizarre twist of fate his records sell in a most unexpected place, and inspire the youth of a repressed nation. After watching it, I can only say that: the songs are top-drawer; the story is wonderful and uplifting; the testimonies of the people involved are deeply moving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Thanks for keeping me alive" - Sixto Rodriguez</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fascinating documentary of a largely unsung (sorry, couldn't help it) Detroit musician who's star quickly burned and faded in the Seventies following the release of two albums that went nowhere. Like many I'd never heard of Rodriguez and only became aware of him by spotting the DVD at my local library. Very much in the Dylan anti-establishment tradition, what inspires are the songwriter's lyrics that rose to the level of anthem in South Africa after bootleg copies of his work found their mark. For balance I'd say to read some of the negative reviews on this board for those who were on the scene and can offer a different perspective. Personally, I liked his music, his sound and once again, the lyrics that come at you from an inspired source. If you're a music fan, this is worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Searching for sugar man is a really great documentary film that catches more and more of my attention as the story moves forward and onwards where it makes me want to continue watching it. Despite not being popular when he first debuted in his own country, USA he became a popular and famous icon in Africa where people listen to his (Rodriquez's) music and inspire and make people dream of having a better life and have faith and believe in changes. Searching for Sugar Man reminds us that a wise man knows lasting riches are never the result of record sales. The music from the movie is very well organized and makes me feel like I'm listening to oldies music and its very nice. The film is also filmed very well and nice having a retro feel to it, which is pretty nice. Overall, the movie is very touching and inspires me very much.

He hope American people will welcome his song but it opposite. He sold copies of virtually zero and people unknown his song. But on the other side of the world music of Sixtoros was popular in the south Africa, the content of the song have good meaning. The CD with license and non license spread to another. All of people in Africa know his song but don't who is the singer. The important point of the movie reveal his identity as a man who can come though dreams and spirit under the humble appearance, texture humility. When he free from his work he practiced composer by himself, and he love reading, he also graduate Philosophy at university. He was candidate for local politician several time, he want to make his city better. Not to be win or defeat. Rodriguez is still smiling and his eyes are shining, Bowed shoulders and walked slowly continue on his way that he choose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Searching for sugar man is feel good musical detective documentary about the true story of Rodriguez, The unrecognized talented rock star in '70s. However, even though he had no chance to succeed in America, but become a massive impact into another side of apartheid "South Africa." Honestly, I'd never heard his name before this documentary bring him to the world, but I absolutely love this man and his music after watching. The highlight of this film was started when two South African fans were set out to find out who is their hero and what happened to him and that makes the word SERCHING means a lot. On the other hand, Rodriguez' is a well-played wise person. He likely enjoyed in every moments in his life. He reminds me that all materials things even money and fame will not bring happiness. Moreover, this film also has some mystery that I wonder. Firstly, how the rumor of his songs even got to Africa in the apartheid era that they still had no internet? and How about his life through the hardship time? ..Hence, this fascinating story is probably the best documentary I have ever seen. This film reveals us that "Success occurs when opportunity meets preparation." I'M TOUCHED.</fullReview>

The looks on people's faces, the cheering, the tears of joy. It really makes you feel that artists really do live forever through music, finding a place in people's hearts throughout the globe.

		<fullReview>In Searching for Sugar Man one finds an inspiring story about a man who never knew he was, that he was a superstar in another country. As we all have dreams that have been crushed, this film inspires us to reignite our own dreams again, and maybe even hope that we're superstars somewhere other than the United States. Of course that reality is very unlikely, but it was likely for one man, that man being Sixto Rodriguez. His music is absolutely beautiful on the most passionate of levels as far as relating to his times, our times and humanity as a whole. My favorite parts of this documentary are seeing him living his dream, signing autographs, playing the concert, and watching his family talk about how blown away they were at seeing their father treated like a King, in which he was and still is in South Africa and even more so now in the United States after this documentary had been made. A very humble man Sixto is, almost in some ways the Gandhi of the music world. A great documentary to see, highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the handful of documentaries that deserve to be watched more than once.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first impressions you get from Searching for Sugar Man, a portrait of a musician entirely unknown in his American home country, but more famous than Elvis Presley in South Africa, makes it seem as if the eponymous artist was a moderately talented eccentric whose mysteriousness led Swedish director Malik Bendjelloul to dedicate a full-length documentary to his life. This is not the case though, which becomes clear once excerpts of Sugar Man's philosophical folk compositions are played and a wonderfully true and truly wonderful story begins to unfold.Sixto Rodriguez (the birth name of the spectacled singer-songwriter) can unexaggeratedly be called one of the most inspiring musical personalities to have ever existed and it poses a conundrum how such outstanding songs like "Sugar Man" (giving him his literally sweet sobriquet), "Cause", or "The Establishment Blues" have never reached any popularity outside the boundaries of the Apartheid-plagued African country. Interviewing himself, his daughters, his producers, his South African admirers, and a startlingly ignorant record company executive and thereby explaining Rodriguez' true biography, Searching for Sugar Man gives an unexpected resolution to a sheerly unbelievable affair. For me, it was the exact opposite of what I had thought to come from the visually exceptionally beautiful opening third, which is a singular thing to achieve for a documentary.The final moments of the film are heart-warming and goosebumps-inducing and make Searching for Sugar Man one of the handful of documentaries that deserve to be watched more than once.</fullReview>

Not this film. This film was a joy to watch from start to finish. You are engrossed from the moment you start watching. This was the very first documentary I have watched where I was not distracted by any outside stimulus. I found myself just as curious as the researchers were as I watched, and overjoyed at the outcome. The storyline(s) and its accompanying interviews, video footage, camera stills, and amazing soundtrack were so well put together that the journey was quite magical.

		<fullReview>As for many other people, watching this film was the first time that I had heard of Rodriguez,a genius singer/songwriter from Detroit who went to obscurity after his two albums, though well received by critics, did not sell in America. However, in a strange turn of events, the albums found their way to South Africa, where they became smash hits and, in fact, the music of a generation which fought for equality and was finally released from Apartheid.The story follows two South African fans who track down Rodriguez through the mists of rumors and ultimately find him living a low life in Detroit. I believe Rodriguez's obscurity was as much his own choice as it was fate. Rodriguez continued his simple life even after he was brought under the spotlight and played in concerts before thousands of people. The greatest joy for him was he found that his music and his talent were finally praised and received the attention that it deserved, even though it came so late in his life, about three decades after he released his albums.His incredible and heartwarming story is unfolded as we listen to his songs throughout the film. This is the story of the man finding himself as is the story of his fans finding him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Postscript from Australia ~ What Rodriguez did Next</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was desperate to get my hands, eyes and ears on this film. It was the talk of my town as a best buddy has just seen it and was RAVING ( in life he is THE toughest critic) ~ so 'Searching for Sugarman' could not come more highly recommended. I had to wait for days as it was out on DVD but the single copy was out/not yet returned over the Easter week. My friend had the soundtrack or a version on his iTunes or had the original 'Cold Fact' on constant repeat at his house and we were singing and dancing in his kitchen and back verandah. We knew every word, got goosebumps &amp; tears in the eyes just remembering our flaming youth. These songs were in our heads and we hadn't heard them in decades, just as one of the film makers remarked, these records were in the lounge rooms of all our friends back in the 1970s.The story that unfolds on the screen will tell a tale of an amazing quest from the tip of the Southern Hemisphere to the streets of Detroit and back again. Art finds a way, just as love does. " Some things are simple, some things take ages " ~ another poet, who is not looking for fame either. A seed of an idea was planted and By Golly-Miss-Molly did it take off. The brilliance of the film is that it looks fantastic, great art design and pace - it has a niggling sense of dread that it's going to turn out badly ( I was getting "worried sick" about the fate of Rodriguez), but something in me knew it was going to be alright. I can't really go on, as the film will take the viewer along for the ride of a lifetime. Words on a page can not convey the rich music and images that are offered ~ so feast up, do yourselves a favour. My thanks to the Academy for voting this one up &amp; giving it an international audience.PS: at the time of posting Rodriguez's name is 11th on a poster advertising the Byron Bay BLUESFEST over the holiday just ended ~ I saw it in a copy of Rolling Stone ( Australia ). I had seen the ad, but I hadn't really looked until now, then it sunk in, I'd read out his name, along with the other performers, to my house mate when I'd bought the magazine, but that was weeks ago &amp; we were occupied with our lives, so it was filed away, waiting for the right moment to grab my attention again. The headlining name is Paul Simon, so I guess that's the $$$MusicBiz$$$ ~ as usual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those rare amazing stories which just sticks to your heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Searching for Sugar Man is an amazing story, it is so intriguing and beautifully told. Everybody shown in the documentary where just full of life. Sixto Rodriguez turns out to be such a mysterious and a cool dude. The viewer immediately gets to like him.One of my favorite guy was Rick Emmerson, even though he was on just for a minute or so, that guy was fun and he stood out. The fairy tale quality of the story and the clever artistic way the director has presented the documentary has made it such a delightful and wonderful piece of work. There were so many instances that I felt I had a grin on me while watching the it.It is so refreshing to know that truly beautiful things can happen in this world. Music has so much power to reach out and bond people together. Hats off to the fans who worked so hard and finally made all this possible. And best of luck to Rodriguez, my sincerest well wishes to you and your family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This sugar is fattening with excellence!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pour some Sugarman on me!!" is what many South Africans have said throughout the last four decades about folk musician Rodriguez who hails from Detroit. South Africans have adored his sweet sugar music throughout that time, and he has become a musical national folk hero in that country. However, the same thing could not be said here in the United States. Let's just say that Pepito Rodriguez who runs a neighboring grocery store close to where I live is as famous as Rodriguez here in the States, that is until now. "Searching for Sugarman" is a fascinating documentary that tells Rodriguez' unbelievable story. Rodriguez made two albums in the early 70's in Detroit that unfortunately flopped in the U.S. "I wonder" why because the tunes were mesmerizing. Years later, one of his records ended up in South Africa (which the doc explains), and suddenly the people of South Africa fell in love with Rodriguez's music. However, they all thought Rodriguez was dead by suicide on stage, which was really a folk story. Director Marc Benjelloul's documentary is sweet music to our ears in his powerful orchestration of "Searching for Sugarman". Benjelloul himself has demonstrated excellent artistic skills that many might not have heard of before. Benjelloul interviews South African record producers &amp; journalists that marveled at Rodriguez's talent, a South African record store owner who was instrumental in bringing Rodriguez to South Africa, Rodriguez's Detroit construction co-workers, and more significantly Rodriguez's three adult daughters. "Searching for Sugarman" just recently won the Best Documentary Oscar, and that was very well- deserved. See "Searching for Sugarman" please please please with sugar on top. ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of documentary movie or the other which comes from real story, they always mentioned 'This story comes from real' or something. You know what, it might be helpful their movie promotion. However, there is no sign of this kind of stuff. In fact, I think most of people, who watch this movie now, already knew something about Rodriguez, or at least this movie is about one person who is singer. It seems like too real, so it might be too weak to touch heart in deep. But, I think the editing made this movie a lot better, because most of music were so matched by situation, I even thought 'Wow, it seems like one of MV!'. (Btw, still too smooth I think) Except the limitation of documentary movie, I think it is really good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspirational tale of 70s musician who fails to make it in US, but finds unexpected redemption in South Africa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Searching for Sugarman' is a documentary about a one-of-a-kind story that will never happen again. It's both bizarre and unusual as well as inspirational and uplifting.Back in the early 70s, a young folk-rock artist named Rodriguez (aka Sixto Rodriguez), put out two record albums which went nowhere on the U.S. charts. Faced with the prospect of supporting his family, Rodriguez gave up his musical career and became a construction worker, settling down in Detroit.Unbeknownst to him, those two albums made their way to South Africa, where he became a sensation amongst opponents of the Apartheid regime. In South Africa, through the 70s and 80s, Rodriguez was considered "bigger than Elvis". Somehow, no one in South Africa learned anything about Rodriguez and a rumor that he had killed himself on stage, became accepted as fact.In the late 90s, a couple of musicologists in South Africa began making inquiries out of curiosity, as to Rodriguez's history. After a long, frustrating search with no concrete results, one of those searching for their unknown idol, came upon a reference to Dearborn (Michigan) in the errant troubadour's lyrics. One clue led to another and before you knew it, the South African investigator was able to locate Rodriguez's first producer.To his amazement, the producer shocked his inquisitor by informing him that Rodriguez was still alive. Soon Rodriguez's daughter got in contact with the South African researchers, and filled them in as to her father's history.The great part of the film is that Rodriguez was invited to play live concerts in South Africa. His daughter commented that they expected a small group to show up but were completely flabbergasted when a sold-out crowd of thousands, showed up for her father's concert. Rodriguez himself, was amazed at the reverential reception that was given to him, but wasn't at all nervous, playing before all these adoring fans.How this unknown musician in the US, could have been such a sensation in South Africa, without anyone here in the US knowing about it, seems bizarre, in the age of the internet. But of course, all this happened before the internet was introduced.Most of those in the music business who had tried to make Rodriguez into a household name, were mystified as to why he never took off in the US. My opinion is that despite a great, unusual voice (in the spirit of Cat Stevens) and some catchy tunes and thoughtful lyrics, his arrangements seem a bit dated and corny (even back then). With what sound like synthesized strings, most of the songs hark back to the early 60s, with Rodriguez trying to meld a Dylanesque sensibility with Motown. It comes off as a bit old-fashioned and did not appeal to an audience who were more enthralled with the unencumbered folk or pop rock, that was popular at the time.We learn at the end of the documentary that Rodriguez went back to South Africa three more times, for more live concerts. We also learn that Rodriguez was extremely generous, giving most of the proceeds of those concerts to his friends and family. Rodriguez never received any royalties for all the sales of his music in South Africa, and it appears both bootleggers and a few unscrupulous music producers back in the US were to blame.I was a little disappointed that Rodriguez never really found his muse later on, and hasn't taken up composing again. His inspiration was squarely grounded in his youth. The love for his music in South Africa remains, as the denizens of that country feel a great nostalgia for their own youth, where they recall their exciting days of protest, against an oppressive political and social system.This is a real 'feel-good' story which will make you smile as an extraordinary man is given his due, later in life, when he least expects it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unbelievable, yet true, story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All I can say about this film is WOW. Usually documentaries are not my thing, but this one has so much heart, and is so powerful, that it literally brought tears to my eyes. As all the other reviews state, it tells the story of a little known rock/folk musician (at least, little known to Americans)who was truly an icon and never knew it. Who influenced an entire nation and culture, and probably played a major role in the ending of apartheid in South Africa and the subsequent consequences of that, thinking he was a complete failure. I will not disclose any more plot, I would hate to ruin this masterpiece for anyone else. But trust me: watch it. The first 3/4 of the film will mesmerize you, and have you searching your itunes account to find music of this unknown genius. And the ending will blow you away. Guaranteed. As someone in the film said, its a story too unlikely and beautiful to be true... but it is. Watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Searching for Sugar Man tells a story almost like a miracle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The film tells the story of how one musician can be famous completely unknown and dead in one nation to being one of the most famous musicians in another nation, and it tells this story quite well"Nowadays if the world wants to find out about any unknown people we have the internet to help us find out who this person is. This documentary tells the nearly impossible sounding story of an artist named Rodriguez who back in the 1970's released two albums in the states which when put out onto the market were big failures which killed his career instantly. However in South Africa his two albums were released and unlike in the States were massive success's. The documentary is then a search for this man who most people thought was dead by suicide however it turns out they were wrong and Rodriguez lived in Detroit.The film did the good job of being surprising especially when telling this tale that started off as us watching the biopic about Rodriguez until his death but we then saw that the film was about the story of how this famous man in Africa actually lives such a normal life in the States. The interviews were great in the film because these people who were interviewed truly were fans of him and that worked well because they had a connection to him unlike in other documentaries where strange people are asked about the artist in the film. I have never heard of the artist Rodriguez before so watching the fact that he somehow become so famous in South Africa was great to watch. I was surprised that he was still alive especially how the film had directed me into believing he was dead only to find out that the rumours of this artist who had committed suicide was false. The film had a better beginning because of the surprise factor but once we find out the mystery the film took some time to gain back it's interest until the end when we see the video of Rodriguez performing in South Africa with all the fans he had watching him closely.The film was fun to watch throughout especially watching a story that really was mysterious unlike most stories that do not contain much mystery nowadays.MOVIE GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reality often beats fantasy, that's true. Here more than in most cases. Sisto Rodriguez makes to albums in USA in the early 70s, but there are many men with guitars making records, so because of lacking promotion, he doesn't sell, is kicked out of the record company and starts as a construction worker.What he doesn't know, is that he through the years gets bigger and bigger in South Africa and becomes an icon for anti-apartheid. In South Africa, they think he's dead. But in the middle of the 90s, some people find out that he isn't and his concerts in Johannesburg are big triumphs.But where is Rodriguez' royalty money? In the wrong pockets obviously. Another interesting question we can put to ourselves is why we haven't cared about an artist getting so big in another part of the world. USA and Europe didn't know and wouldn't have cared, if it wasn't for this great documentary. What's wrong with us?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On a search for the once famous musician, Rodriguez. This film follows two men on their journey to find more about Rodriguez.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rodriguez. Rodriguez is a musician that was discovered in Detroit, Michigan. He is a well-known name in South Africa, selling millions of copies of his record. He then suddenly disappears and two men go on a very long search to find out what happened to him. The audience follows these two men in Searching for Sugar Man (2012) on their journey to Rodriguez. This documentary is thought to be a very good documentary and I could not agree more. There are many aspects of this film that makes it a very good documentary. The film technique does not involve the usual hand-held camera that is used for most documentary films. The film is shot with a camera that is stabilized on some sort of tripod or stand so it appears more professional and it does not appear to be a documentary. The monologue from the two men keep the story moving and the audience can tell that they are true dedicated fans of Rodriguez. There is also a lot of music that is played throughout the film. The film provided samples of Rodriguez's music between change of scenes and in the corner of the screen would be the song title with the year it was made. I thought this was a very good way to incorporate his music throughout the film so the audience can get a feel for his music and see that he is a very talented musician. I do not think the producer of the film was trying to get the audience fall in love with Rodriguez, but just to introduce Rodriguez's music to others since he did not really sell well in any other part of the world but South Africa. The editing in this film was also very interesting. One specific example is when it would show a flashback of what the setting looked like back in Rodriguez's time that would then slowly dissolve into the present day setting. There are many cuts made throughout the film, switching between the two men searching and old pictures of Rodriguez. Overall, a very good documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>** SPOILER ALERT***Have you ever experienced the sounds of something that feels so real? So real that you can feel your own hair blowing in the wind as you're driving a car, or hearing the cars passing by as in traffic. What about hearing rain so surreal that you double check to make sure your clothes are not sopping wet, dripping as you carry on with your life? Then suddenly, you come back to reality and realize you are only watching a film so good that you can feel yourself in it, as if you were a character. You see someone lurking around your town preforming music that moves the souls of many, including yourself, but you are never able to see who his identity is. Maybe because he wants to be judged on his music, not his homely, holey, beat up and dirty clothing, raggedy hair that could use a clipping, skin that could use a nice scrub but never mind the reasoning why we never meet his identity. What if this person preformed music that was realistic, whole, and moving, would you be intrigued as to who the author it, what their past is like? You are confused as to who this masterpiece writer is, yet people know his name but nothing else about him. No information on his image, as he is sitting down with sunglasses on for his album cover, but yet, somehow you still feel as if you know him, from his music. What if, one day What is someone told you that they killed themselves? Think about their death being so gruesome that you can feel the stickiness of the leftover blood, you can feel the pain of the people who are going to be impacted that you actually felt tears trickle down your cheeks and as they are telling you, you're in disbelief-rightfully being. And not because you will miss their influence, but because you could feel that they were in such pain and no one had any idea because the music was so beautiful. And you feel pain because you know that he did not kill himself, but, in essence, society killed him as a whole, and you are part of society. In "Searching for Sugar Man" directed by Malik Bendjelloul, beautiful music is created by a man in a (figurative) mask and portrays happiness yet rumors are filled that he feels enough pain to gruesomely take his own life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A documentary about two dedicated fans seeking the truth about influential musician, Rodriguez</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never has there been a truer expression of fan appreciation than in Searching for Sugar Man. Watching this 85 minute documentary is sure to be an unforgettable experience and will remind you just how powerful and influential music can be. Sixto Rodriguez, better known simply as just "Rodriguez" is a 1970' rock singer who had been discovered in Detroit Michigan, extremely well known for his soulful music. After a disastrous album release in America, his album obtained great praise in South Africa where his music touched the hearts of millions of people. Curious about Rodriquez's rumored suicide, two dedicated fans take it upon themselves to figure out what really happened to the infamous Rodriguez. What makes this documentary so remarkable is the way that it flawlessly displays how much music can change lives, and the blessing of second chances. The persistence of Stephan Segerman and Craig Bartholomew-Strydom is a phenomenal example of exactly how much emotionally moving music can be. These two have dedicated great amounts of time and effort into discovering the truth about Rodriguez and recognize his achievements, and it is because of his music that they are been persuaded to be so dedicated. They resurrect an unjustifiably forgotten artist, and provide him with the spotlight that he truly deserves. Through unique animation, clever reenactments and snippets of Rodriguez's beautifully written melodies, Bendjelloul is able to turn a simple documentary into a thought-provoking story incorporating feelings of mystery, sadness and joy. Rodriquez may not be a platinum selling artist or a multi Grammy Award winning writer, but he sure has the ability to fill hearts. Searching for Sugarman is a work of art that is sure to leave lovers of film and lovers of music truly satisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An appealing human interest story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Searching for Sugar Man" tells the story of Sixto Rodriguez, one of the greatest rock stars who never was. Although discovered by some big names in the music business who gave him a contract, the resulting albums bombed in America. However, Rodriguez's tunes somehow made their way to South Africa in the 1970s and became a phenomenal success. In fact, they were used as the voice of a generation who desperately desired to speak out against their government and the existence of Apartheid. In the 1990s, two fans, Stephen 'Sugar' Segerman and Craig Bartholomew Strydom, finally tracked down Mr. Rodriguez, and made him aware that, half a world away, his music had touched a chord with a responsive audience.Director / co-writer Malik Bendjelloul does his best to make this more than a "talking head" affair, making his documentary visually interesting throughout, but it's really the story itself, more than the filmmaking, that make this so compelling. Many people are interviewed, including those in America who have always known Rodriguez and those in South Africa who found meaning in his words and music. Best of all, while the man himself is clearly touched, and appreciative of this previously unknown audience, he remains a steadfastly humble man, living an ordinary life with no bells or whistles. Most of the money he earned from his South African tours in the 1990s was given to family and friends.While watching, one is conscious of the whole randomness of fate: Rodriguez's songs really are pretty good, so it's just too bad that there was no response in America back when it was needed the most.This is emotionally affecting without ever feeling overly sappy or manipulative. It's well worth seeing.Of course, the very sad postscript is that Bendjelloul committed suicide a few years after the release of the film, having suffered from depression.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've gotten into this movie without having witness any Poster nor Trailer beforehand so I could get a fresh impression of the whole experience. This whole review is wholly my opinion and nothing official. I've been expecting an American Romantic drama flick but to my surprise, Searching for Sugar Man is a Swedish?British documentary film based on rumored death of American musician "Sixto Rodriguez." I'd never heard of Rodriguez and was completely engrossed. A really fascinating story from beginning to end. This is a terrific documentary about a remarkably talented man and the hurtful reality of the music business. And Indeed, the hurtful reality of life.Uniquely enjoyable in the way it stirs incredulity, outrage, discovery and admiration. Rodriguez's message is so heartfelt and his voice so haunting. His life is almost looks like something out of fictionWhen Rodriguez finally plays a concert in South Africa in 1998, with an upwards of numerous people in the audience screaming, cheering, and even crying, we get a glimpse at a different kind of American Dream. Yet it's sad when we're reminded by one of the interviewees that most of us die before achieving Rodriguez's success. Many of us go truly unsung in our talents and are never appreciated or even recognized for them, which is an unbelievably depressing fact. Even today, Rodriguez possesses the fame, but not the glamor that should come with it."the saddest thing in life is an unrecognized talent" This one liner gives a swift arrow to my knees as I can related to it somehow. I can continue forever about how this movie fascinated me so much but I'll sum it up to save pages.This review comments on this movie mostly story-wise, but I finds it hard to criticize a Documentary for a story because it's not something written. So production wise: this movie delivers almost perfectly, terrific in fact because how much I can be related to something that is not designed to be emotionally drawing like most drama movie. but that might be just me. The pacing and editing is average for most documentary film, Despite fantastic Rodriguez's story, Some part can be a bit tad boring for me or at least my taste.So to conclude it, Watch this movie with heart open for education and not entertainment. It's not something to be watching on Friday night with a beer.</fullReview>

Sugar man is the name of the song and writer of this song is Sixto Diaz Rodriguez, the American singer song writer in early 70's. He was not successful in music industry in US, so he just released only 2 albums and disappeared. One day, the album named "Cold Fact" was popular in South Africa, and people want to who is the singer, so they started to search for him.This one is all about searching for Rodriguez and finally found him. I like the way to shoot. Lots of beautiful shots. But honestly, I watched it and I did not understand even though I watched it with subtitle.

This film is an inspiring film that shows the role of what musicians do. Also, this film contains great visual, meaningful interviews, and songs that come from the real dimension. Brief the plot: "Searching for Sugar Man" is the true story of Rodriguez who was supposed to be the greatest '70s rock icon but never was. It was because his album only bombed in South Africa but not in his country. Next, two South African fans set out to find out where he was and what happened to him. After that, they found him and take him on a tour concert. After tour end, he went back to live his normal life. Highlight of this movie is whatever happened to him, he is always live his life simply. And the way he failed with his music career but he never let his ability to sing go away. His voice is still exceptional as he always was. In conclusion, this movie is so inspiring that I almost cried watching it. It is not as exciting as I expected, but I was so impressed when the movie ended. Another great movie to be seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first documentary film that I have ever watched and it was not my type at all. I heard that this movie was very good and the film won the BAFTA Award for Best Documentary at the 66th British Academy Film Awards in London. So, this is kind of interesting.Searching for sugar man is a movie about a Mexican-American man named "Rodriguez", a no name singer in Detroit bar, whom the music producers asked to sign a recording deal. When his album was out. no one recognized him or the songs. So he had to go back to his normal life. Unexpectedly, his song was instantly boomed in South Africa so his two South African fans tried to find out of where and what happened to their hero.I think this movie is a valuable documentary. Rodriguez is very talented person which he is a singer and song writer. Moreover, I have learned something from this movie that is "you only live once, so do best in what you love even no one will understand but one day someone will."</fullReview>

Rodriguez from Detroit, he is an American singer who never knows he is famous in South Africa. They want to find out the true about this man.I really impress with the way of they try to find the true about the man who change people in other side of the world.

		<fullReview>This is an extremely inspiring documentary about an American singer named Rodriguez.Such a touching tale of hope, dreams and acceptance. The tale of Rodriguez is an over whelming one, especially as he actually appears to be as mysterious as the legend says.When Rodriguez finally plays a concert in South Africa in 1998, with an upwards of 20,000 people in the audience screaming, cheering, and even crying, we get a glimpse at a different kind of American Dream. A talented man didn't become a star and has been turned into one by rediscovery. But he seems to have had a fulfilling life in one of America's least welcoming rust-belt cities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was reading in the New York Times this morning that The winner 2013 Oscar for best documentary, "Searching for Sugar Man," was first seen at the Sundance Film Festival. Ten of the 15 documentaries on the 2014 Oscar shortlist made their debut in the Sundance snow.I though I should at least see what all the hullabaloo is about since this film also won a BAFTA and 28 other awards. Must be worth me time.Sugar Man was Sixto Rodriguez, billed as the next Bob Dylan. The sad fact is that his two albums did not sell, and there were rumors that he shot himself on stage.The reality is so far from the rumor. Rodriguez was a superstar in South Africa. He was bigger than Elvis; bigger than the Rolling Stones. How he influenced South Africa's battle against Apartheid, and how he influenced South African musicians is amazing in itself.However, there is so much more to the story.If you like a good mystery, then this will enthrall you. It is a great mystery story with incredible music that should be known to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching....yet Simple. (May contain a spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two things which a man always keeps close to his heart, in every stage of his life which are his music and his favorite sports. Right from childhood to the old age, there is an integral link in our lives which is sacred to all of us. This documentary has such a simple premise that it dawns on us that that man whom we see everyday sitting on the pavement or selling newspapers could easily be the him, could be a talented guy but.....he isn't. Not because he does not deserve to but because of the strange ways of this world.Dreams are precious, we all have them but everybody is not able to live them. Talent exists in so many ways in so many of us, it may or may not get appreciated. The greatness of Rodriguez lies in the fact that in spite of not getting his dues, not getting the much deserved appreciation there was no bitterness in him. Loved this documentary, left me misty-eyed.</fullReview>

This is the sort of story that should feature in more films - heartwarming, astounding, entertaining, funny, captivating, etc. etc. and a true story of social change at the same time.I knew a bit about Rodriguez before watching the film but after watching it I truly appreciate the magnitude of his greatness. One of the truly special artists and people of the 20th century, and the most down-to-earth person you could ever imagine.Everyone should see this movie and give Rodriguez the attention he should have been given the first time round.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes you come across a film of great importance as well as one that allows you to feel good and be very entertained. Searching For Sugar Man is that type of movie. Amazing what one man with a voice can do for a whole nation not his own.For those of you who do not know the story of Sixto Rodriguez, I will not spoil much except to tell you that in the 70's, he was a folk singer on the mean streets of Detroit. He did 2 albums and kinda faded out of site, with little to no fanfare here in the States. Needless to say, in another part of the world, his fame was a much different story. He was as big perhaps as Elvis or even The Beatles! He disappeared off the map literally. Some people wanted to find out whatever happened to him. Rumor had it he was dead. Some people said he may have been arrested.What became of The Sugar Man Sixto Rodriguez? Watch this revealing documentary and find out! Includes a great soundtrack of his music (that I would recommend you invest in) through the movie as well. Never heard of him? Trust me, you will wanna see how this one turns out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very well put together and affectionate documentary that ends as a cathartic celebration of a man we just get to know here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never heard of Rodriguez, the artist in question of this documentary. But that's not surprising, as it appears only people in South Africa have heard of him. Prior knowledge of Rodriguez is irrelevant, although the film is devoted to finding an idol, it's also designed to be an introduction to the man too. Ever since I got into Bruce Springsteen in early 2009, I've been fascinated with my favourite musicians. The first third of Searching For Sugar Man puts how the people in the documentary feel about Rodriguez into personal perspective and it's fascinating to discover someone with a rich yet isolated history, especially as Rodriguez' music is pretty good too. I can only imagine how it'd feel to rediscover a childhood idol and I can only imagine the burning mystery of a disappearance. The film captures the essence of those feelings very well and although it lasts for a short time, there's a very compelling sequence in the middle for the actual search itself. Afterwards it becomes a cathartic celebration that the audience can now join in on. It's a very well put together and affectionate documentary, even if it doesn't try and do anything particularly special. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delayed stardom for a zen-like singer thanks to his fans' persistence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not have any expectations when I entered the theatre to watch "Searching for Sugar Man" but I came out feeling hopeful and peaceful. Like Pi said, above all, never lose hope. Or like Forest Gump said, "Life is like a box of chocolate. You never know what you are gonna get." This is a documentary of how two passionate fans in South Africa searched for their inspirational and talented music hero, an American singer songwriter who went unnoticed for decades in his homeland. Dramatic rumors had it that the guy killed himself in front of his audience.The film started off like a suspense story ? and we are hooked from the beginning ? as soon as Rodriguez's song started playing as background. I have never heard of Rodriguez or his songs. But his steady, assertive yet sentimental voice, similar to that of Neil Diamond or Don McLean, was very attractive and soothing. The lyrics were filled with real life experience as the underdog who marches with different drums. Like the producers at the time, we wonder why his albums flopped. We know who we are looking for but we do not have many clues.Then the story unfolded with a thriving chapter in South Africa and described how Rodriguez became the inspiration for musicians there to act against apartheid and how well his records were sold there ? and the singer himself did not even realize it. I would love to tell you more details in this well-made and structured documentary but it would spoil the fun.Let's just say I have great admiration for the people involved in making this heartwarming movie possible: Rodriguez the singer himself, his fans Stephen "Sugar" Segerman and Craig Bartholomew Strydom, who persisted in searching for Rodriguez for decades, and Swedish director Malik Bendjelloul who told us this fascinating story of search. Just go to see this feel good documentary. Highly recommended.Then come back to read this part after you have watched the movie: I can help but feeling fascinated by this Rodriguez character. You could probably say this is a classic split personality case: he is a construction worker but he also writes songs and performs at clubs, with his back to the audience. With his legendary and mysterious past, his colleagues found it hard to believe he sings while his fans, even upon seeing him alive, doubted it was really him.His recognition was long overdue. Hence the dramatic revival of his acceptance made it all the more touching. He is a living example of how amazing life can be: perhaps because of years of hard labor which boosted up his circulation, he still sings and goes on tours way into his 70s! All through the years, he leads a humble, even Spartan, life but he feels rich because he does not look for fame or monetary rewards. He believes we are all equal and dignified regardless of our income or status. He takes his daughters to the museum and library and introduces them to art and beautiful things in life, telling them they are as good as others. He even ran for mayor! Even when this documentary won the Oscar this modest man did not show up for fear of stealing the lights from the director. What a down-to-earth portrayal of ultimate humility, and a genuine example of "just keep working and one day your efforts will pay off."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and somewhat inspiring but there's definitely flaws in the filmmaker's narrative.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'SEARCHING FOR SUGAR MAN': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Documentary about a Detroit singer/songwriter from the early 1970s who never found the success many thought he deserved here in the states but became a huge musical icon in South Africa unbeknownst to him until decades later. The film was directed by first time feature film director Malik Bendjelloul and revolves around musician Rodriguez. The soundtrack is made up of music from the artist's only two albums. I found the film amusing, interesting and somewhat inspiring but there's definitely flaws in the filmmaker's narrative. The film revolves around two of Rodriguez's biggest fans (Stephen 'Seger' Segerman and Craig Bartholomew Strydom) from Cape Town, South Africa who made it their mission to find out what happened to their favorite musical artist. They explain that the Detroit folksinger's two albums (from the early 70s) were immensely popular in South Africa and an inspiration of revolt against the establishment (Therefore some of his songs were banned from the radio there). They were shocked to learn that he was almost unheard of in America and set out to find out why (with a film crew watching them). They also believed stories, like many others, that he had long ago committed suicide on stage at one of his concerts. What they discover definitely makes for great cinema. Prior to this film I had never heard of Rodriguez but now having heard a lot of his music (thanks to the film) I can definitely understand why he was so beloved (by some at least). So the film is definitely educational (to many). It's also very inspirational and as it's told makes for great cinema. The problem is that many scenes (when you think about them) don't make coherent sense. Like reality TV documentaries have definitely been known for manipulating facts to the viewers. It's not that anything is definitely an outright lie but the way it's put together is misleading. When you get to the third act of this film, as entertaining and uplifting as it is, a lot of it doesn't really jive. After doing a little research on the internet I found out why it doesn't jive so well. Still it makes for a great film and I definitely want to hear more of Rodriguez's music. Maybe it doesn't deserve it's Oscar nomination but it's definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad, But Don't Get All the Fuss About This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look, I like a good documentary. But this movie didn't blow me away, like it seemed to for most others. I kept hearing all these reviews incredible reviews, so I was expecting to get knocked off my butt. The story is certainly inspiring. A guy from Detroit in the early 1970s is this produced singer. Some people in the record business think he's very talented, but his music goes nowhere in the United States. he also goes nowhere in the United States, fading into some kind of blue collar life. Somehow, his music not only catches on in South Africa, but he becomes a major folk hero there. His records sell millions of copies, and are part of the artistic attack on Apartheid in the 70s. The problem is that no one in South Africa really knows who this artist is, and they don't realize that he's not popular or even known in the U.S. or really anywhere else in the world. Sugar Man, the artist, also doesn't know that he's this famous folk hero in Soouth Africa, and he never gets paid any money for all of his records sold there! The documentary exposes all of this, tells a good story in it. But Academy Award? I don't think so. The story, yes riveting. It would be a great 60 Minutes piece. But, as a movie, it was a little boring. And, sorry, I really didn't think Sugar Man's music was all that inspiring. It was just kind of flat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was forced to watch this movie due to one of my course assignment at the university. I have never heard about this movie before but at first i saw its poster from the projector in my class and i was thinking about meat on a guitar? Well it kind of looked like b.b.q. at the time. Then I bought a DVD, sat down and watch it. I realized "oh yeah it's actually a shadow of a guy in a guitar" on the poster then I laugh at myself a little before I got more interested in how the movie is going to be like. After watching for 20 minutes I started to fall asleep. Not that the movie is bad but I guess I'm not so much into the dead of this guy I barely know and yeah I'm not kinda investigate movie fans anyway so i kept on watching till the end. I think the story telling was good. It is easy to understand but still lack of excitement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is recommended.I never heard of the musician, Sixto Rodriguez, the main subject of the musical documentary, Searching for Sugar Man. Without this documentary, I doubt that I would have ever heard of him at all. Which seems a shame since his music is rich and memorable. The filmmakers involved decided that Rodriguez's localized fame and the rumors of his demise would make for an interesting subject and began researching this man and his musical legacy. Well directed by Malik Bandjellou, Searching for Sugar Man delves into the strange disappearance of this music icon and his short-lived career. This Detroit-based folk musician only recorded two albums before turning his back on the music industry and never achieved any fame stateside.Remarkably, back in the early seventies his folk tunes and political activist lyrics helped fight apartheid in South Africa, In that country, Rodriguez's popularity bypassed Dylan and Hendricks and he became a pop legend. In fact, Rodriguez's one song, Sugar Man, became a national anthem for the movement against racism there, so much so that the government banned the recording from being played. The film is an exceptionally well-made film incorporating nicely hand-drawn graphics, highly entertaining musical footage, and candid interviews about this musician. Bandjellou's love for this folk singer and his work is apparent throughout the film. He succeeds at building a loving portrait and heartfelt testimonial to the singer.However, while Searching for Sugar Man searches for answers to this involving mystery, it leaves many questions unanswered, primarily the issue of royalties and possible corruption within the recording industry and Rodriguez's decision to end his musical career. Those two factors are glossed over in this documentary. What could have been a hard-hitting expose about greed and the cost of fame instead becomes a showcase for the man's musical accomplishments. The film seems to be slickly edited packaging to promote the resurrection of his music and future concert gigs. At times, some of the footage appeared to be professionally staged candid shots and short music videos to enhance the film's story. (How many scenes of him walking throughout the neighborhood and accompanied by his music do we need to see?)Still, the story remains compelling and the music is wonderful. His autobiographical lyrics have an honest and raw emotion, a poetic edge and realness that I hoped this documentary had in which to celebrate this artist. I may be in the minority here but I found Searching for Sugar Man to be a very fine film about a great and almost forgotten musician, even if it is a bit dishonest in its investigative research. Searching for Sugar Man honors the myth more than the man behind it. GRADE: BVisit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.comNOTE: There is now a soundtrack available of Rodriguez's music from this documentary. It's well worth investigating yourself, if you don't mind slick packaging.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a work of fiction this movie is. Rodriquez was well known in Australia in mid seventies, due to exposure by DJ Holger Brockman on Sydney's 2JJ. Rodriguez had gained a strong foothold in Australia - a phenomenon that was mirrored in South Africa's apartheid a little later. with 4 LPs published by Blue Goose.In 1979 his hidden fame was finally revealed to him.He was invited to tour Australia and, to his great surprise, he played to packed houses.As he told ABC Radio 702 Breakfast this week: "Australia was the first one to pick me up ... I came and I did fifteen shows.""Australia was the highpoint in my career," he said."We did the Regent Theatre (Sydney), a 2,000-seater.""We sold out four nights and it was half full for the fifth ... and that was my first time in Sydney."The 'Rodriquez Alive' LP was put out.He was never 'lost'. He simply gave up on the music industry and went to university to do a business degree and got involved in local politics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a 42 year old white afrikaans speaking male who grew up in the apartheid era, i went to see this movie. Wow, what a lot of rubbish. If the movie was purely about Sixto Rodrigues and his life, then i think a good movie could have been made. But unfortunately two "anti establishment" fans decided to make a movie while still high from the joints they smoked the previous night. To claim that Rodrigues was a superstar here in South Africa during the apartheid years is just ridiculous. And to claim that Rodrigues was more popular than Elvis, Beattles, and Rolling Stones is absurd. Something that can only be believed by the 23 liberal and anti establishment white south africans who lived in south Africa at the time. Even today, almost 18 years after apartheid the local radio stations still does not play Rodrigues' music. There is also a reason why this movie was not released on the main movie circuit here in south Africa, but only in the cinema nouveau, which has an average movie attendance of about 13 people per show. In fact there was about 8 people in the movie when i went to see the main show (20:00 show) on a Friday night at one of the most liberal suburbs in town (Rosebank). There is also a reason why local movie producers did not produce this movie. Even they knew the movie is not based on facts but on very subjective opinions of two dope heads.This movie reminded me a lot about the movie, Invictus, where 15 years after the actual event Hollywood decided to bring nelson mandela into the scene and turn it into a Disney fairy tale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The whole Liberal/apartheid struggle as quoted by mister Segerman in the movie is a fallacy. Perhaps him and his liberal and Jewish buddies think the world starts and ends with them and they can lay claim to Rodriques, but the fact is we all listened to Sixto, and many of us had a copy of Cold Fact regardless of political leaning. Perhaps in their little freedom struggle they were involved in they held the believe that Rodriques wrote this music specifically for them, but the truth be told it was music we all listened to and it could be heard at any party (English or Afrikaans speaking) across the country. To make blatant statements like most world news were suppressed during the sanction is just plain lies, we were in an almighty bush war as big as Vietnam fighting off the communist onslaught by Russians, Cubans and Chinese for over 20 years, so the news had to be "filtered" for security reasons. We had the likes of Mandela orchestrating attacks car bombs on innocent civilians, but I guess Mr Segerman has selective memory and forgot about all these 100s of innocent victims.But in all fairness I am glad they went to the effort to tract Sixto down, he was an enigma for all of us. Perhaps that mystic is what made his music a hit in SA, who knows? I would have given a higher rating if it wasn't for the fact the liberals once again had to loudly drag their beliefs into the story and ruin what would have been a 10 out of 10 feel-good movie for me.</fullReview>
