		<shortDescription>Nobody laughed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm serious, literally no one in the theater laughed. There were a very few chuckles but not a single laugh. The movie was like torture because they kept using the same joke over and over and over again. A joke that wasn't funny the first time it was used was delivered multiple times. The first Neighbors movie was funny, not the funniest movie made or anything like that but pretty funny. This movie is beyond lame. Remember when I told you they kept using the same jokes over and over again? There was literally a 10 minute timeframe in which the movie used the same joke about 5 times. Around that time I looked at my watch and saw that I was only 20 MINUTES INTO THE STUPID MOVIE! Basically, the problem with this movie is that it isn't funny and kept reusing the same jokes. They even use jokes from the original movie multiple times. It was just plain sad. Another thing, I think SETH ROGEN HAS BECOME THE NEW ADAM SANDLER. He keeps playing the same character in very single movie, and he has finally and completely wore out his welcome. This will be the final time I pay money to see a Seth Rogen movie. Another thing I learned is that Chloë Grace Moretz is officially an awful actress. Everyone loved her as Hit-Girl and ever since KickAss she has gotten a free pass from everyone (including myself) but in this movie we get to see a ton of her acting and it is like watching rejected scenes from a TWILIGHT MOVIE. You get sick of her after about 40 minutes. Man, I know everyone involved in this movie did it for a paycheck but I think it is ultimately going to hurt more than a few careers. I WARN YOU, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT PAY A PENNY TO WATCH THIS MOVIE. IT SUCKS. You've been warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's more like torture porn than comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not long after resolving their issues with the Delta Psi Beta fraternity and its devious leader Teddy (Zac Efron), Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly Radner (Rose Byrne) agree to move to a bigger house in anticipation of their new baby girl. But after they enter into a thirty-day escrow on the sale of their old house, the Kappa Nu sorority takes up residence next door. Afraid that the rowdy group will scare off their buyers, the couple initially tries to reason with leaders Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz), Beth (Kiersey Clemons), and Nora (Beanie Feldstein), before soon realizing that their problems explicitly echo the previous conflict. As Mac and Kelly attempt to get the girls evicted, and Kappa Nu fights back to stay put, both sides engage in a free-for-all of lying, cheating, and stealing that quickly forces everyone involved to decide just how far they're willing to go to win.It all begins with awkward intercourse and queasy stomachs, wielding the exact same bodily-fluid humor found in the previous picture. It's even more extreme, however, as sex toys, marijuana paraphernalia, colorful cursing, and the exclamation "black cock!" is paraded about in front of the Radner's toddler. Since "Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising" is aiming for laughs through shock value alone, it's not surprising that nearly every scene is cringe-inducing, like a moment from a torture-porn horror movie. This feature dares audiences not to look away from the repulsiveness on screen, hoping that they'll find the gross-out gags to be enough of a bombshell to distract from the utter lack of genuine humor.And if the graphic male nudity, tampon prank, and bedbug caper aren't enough to provoke people into covering their eyes in fear, the depiction of friendless, uncool college girls might just do the trick. Essentially blending preteen, juvenile, sleepover party frolicking (showcasing the sincerity of a Barbie movie) with the hard R-rating of a raunchy adult comedy, this movie never really knows in what age group its target audience ought to reside. With a major sexism motif circulating around all the race jokes (the role reversal of prejudicial black cops violently apprehending white crooks before taking it easy on black drug dealers is the funniest routine in the entire project), the religion jabs, and the Holocaust riffs, it's difficult to peg whether or not the movie is even aware of the messages being delivered. Young versus old and the naive versus the experienced seem like worthwhile contrasts, but the script never focuses on one idea long enough to land a memorable line. It does, however, repeat the same slapstick gimmicks over and over again, completely uninterested in their effectiveness the first time around.It may have been a novel idea to switch from a fraternity to a sorority for this sequel, enabling the filmmakers to repeat nearly everything witnessed in the original but from a slightly different perspective; but the basic concept is never fleshed out to the point that it develops into a significant plot. In fact, the funniest moments are the unrelated, extraneous conversations that fill up space between physical actions. Just like the previous endeavor, returning director Nicholas Stoller is more concerned with making viewers momentarily uncomfortable than in crafting a movie that can be remembered beyond the start of the closing credits.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst comedies ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when you thought they couldn't top the mindless nonsense in Neighbors along comes Neighbors 2, which seems to have been written by a 12 year old on weed in about four minutes. There is basically no plot other than the couple from the first movie is selling their house and by some means becomes enemies of the fledgling girls sorority next door. The rest is just them trying to hurt each other with even more implausible scenarios. The acting is robotic and the lines they have to say some of the worst ever written.At one point the girls are openly selling illegal pot from a booth at a school event and instead of calling the cops the "adults" decide to steal it from them which then turns into some sort of scavenger hunt for this giant bag of weed.As in the first movie the sorority breaks about 25 laws including robbery, breaking and entering, sexual assault, theft, etc that the adults could have called the cops on and had them arrested. But that would have ended the movie 20 mins in.At one point the girls steal all the belongings out of the adults house and start selling it at a garage sale. The adults say they can't call the cops because they stole the girls weed. Which makes no sense.Avoid this unfunny disaster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me tell you something about me first: my target in life is to know everything about everything. Well, I know it's impossible but, I'm trying, very hard. That's why I like to watch all the movies(I have seen even a few Vietnamese films, when I was younger in communist Romania). However, there are movies worth seeing and movies you should get paid to see them. This Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising (2016) is part of the 2nd category. Luckily, from 3 months, I'm working in a movie theater and I can see movies for free. Those who will want to go to see the film, leave your brain at home, you do not need it, your eyes will be enough. But you'll be sorry for the money spend on the tickets when you'll put your brain back in place...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FYI, This movie is getting good reviews because it has a political agenda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just so you know. Buyer beware.The movie is objectively not good even as stoners comedy, it looks like an inconsistent patchwork. Even if you liked the first one, this is unquestionable worse. Political invested people gives good reviews and high scores because of the feminist and new-progressive propaganda in it, without evaluating the actual merit. A sad trend that you may have noticed in the last couple of years. The problem is that the jokes are not funny and it misrepresent the issues, where they are not completely made up.So if you are millennial and think jokes like "I'm a black cop... I can't shoot myself" is going to save the planet, go see this movie while drunk, otherwise it's terrible.</fullReview>

No plot at all the same situation as the first one, the same rehashed jokes that were somehow done worse. Pushing the feminist agenda and trying to send a ''message'' about our ''patriarchic'' society. I was fine with the gay- bromance thing but god it got really tiring when every scene pushed misandric sh!t in your throat.I'm fukk!ng beyond surprised it has a 6+ score.

		<shortDescription>Truly Dreadfully Awful--92 Minutes of Your Life You Can't Get Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of those movies where you put your Iphone on it's darkest setting and examine the features you'll never use just to help pass time. The acting was fine, there was just a lack of anything resembling a story-line to breathe life into. It just limped along painfully to an unremarkable conclusion that can't get there soon enough. The actors did their part and there were maybe 3 or 4 amusing scenes. In between was a lot of painfully long spells that weren't funny and didn't serve to build a viable story line. I'm assuming that the teenage viewer was the target audience but my teens and their friends weren't entertained. The main plot was kind of a vague and anemic attempt at some type of hodgepodge of double standards for female college students fused with a generic anti-adult (past usual college age) rebelliousness. It all lacked the continuity of a plausible story by movie standards. Not only does this movie require a willing suspension of disbelief, it requires a total suspension of expectation. It just sucked. That's as elegant a review as the content deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How this has a 6.5 out of 10 is beyond me, this second installment of "Bad Neighbours" was just awful from start to finish. Like a previous review stated, there was a few chuckles here and there, but no proper laughs at all.I could not wait for this movie to end and if they ever make a third installment then I hope it goes straight to DVD.When the person who authorized this movie dies and stands at the white pearly gates of St Peter open the trap door to hell and they fall straight into the burning pits of despair.And just in case you haven't got what I am saying by now then save 1hr 32mins of your life by reading the next sentence carefully. THIS MOVIE SUCKS! Now go use that time you just saved and go rescue a kitten from a tree or something more worth while than watching this garbage of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS... I'll admit, I didn't even make it through the first movie. I lasted 45 minutes waiting to see something funny happen and I lasted even less time on this P.O.S. You know a movie is bad when you'd rather go mop the floors. And I did! Spewing on someone's face to announce pregnancy, blood engorged tampons thrown into someone's face and a toddler running around with a dildo. All sounds like a good time but in this, it all falls flat. Maybe you just need to be drunk to get a laugh. I think you need to get so drunk that you blackout, wake up the next day and have forgotten that you wasted an hour and a half of your good drinking time watching this garbage... Seth Rogan plays yet another typecast role. The female lead, meh. I'm not even going to bother wasting my time with anyone else other than saying that Zac Effron is the only reason girls would watch this crap or it would be labelled a gross film for guys to watch. Not even chicks in bikinis could keep me watching. Please, Almighty God, don't let there be a trilogy!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is nicholas stoller so obsessed with gay porn?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't a movie, just another disappointment with a good trailer and cast that nicholas stoller spent a lot of money on so that he could tell a bunch of guys to show him their penises while he records them and then forces a theater full of people to watch a mini soft core gay porn when they thought they were going to be watching a comedy. - What im getting at is, If you see that nicholas stoller is the director of Any movie, you should know not to watch it because all of his movies are the same: a very poorly assembled group of bad skits to make a low grade movie as an excuse to show penises, testicles, man ass, and all around excessive male nudity and homosexual soft core porn in movie theaters. Here's a question, if the MPAA restricts all female skin with harsher age ratings and strictly forbids female genitals in rated movies altogether (full female nudity can only be "implied" as in a vagina must never be seen and must be covered with a merkin (fake pubic wig), or must be digitally pixelated out or covered with a rubber vagina so a real one isn't seen and even then it is not allowed to be shown for more that two frames/ fraction of a second) why is such an excess of full graphic male nudity so prevalent with the mpaa's blessing in nearly every R movie since 2000 and many pg13 movies? why is most male nudity not even mentioned in mpaa ratings unless they show a guys genitals when the mpaa puts a nudity warning for ANY female skin in a pg13 or R movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605; - nice characters, not comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picking up the story a couple of years after the events in the first movie, Mac and Kelly are trying to impress potential house buyers. However this clashes with the plans of a new partying sorority who move in next door. And that's more or less the entirety of the plot. Things follow quite plainly along the same beaten track as the first movie, the same sorts of jokes and set pieces, all presented in the same style and manner. Consistent, or unimaginative?There are two differences though. Firstly, although for the first half of the movie Rogen and Byrne are locking horns with Efron, we know from the trailers that they end up working together. It was actually a nice change of pace to see Efron and Rogen's good chemistry, almost believably becoming friends.Secondly, the more interesting element is that the sorority are trying to bring equality to college girls, who according to law, are not allowed to host parties. But this doesn't make it a feminist piece. It feels like the equality argument was shoe-horned into the script so they can keep making sexist jokes with a guiltless conscience.On the subject of jokes, they are few and far between. The screening I was in, the audience was mostly silent (in spite of the hilarious opening vomit-face moment). The script needed winding tighter - some great jokes were made, and then the they continued for another three or four lines, which ruined the moment. Sharper editing could've made for sharper comedy.Although Rogen and Byrne are enjoyable screen presences, they do themselves no favours in this dry and dull comedy. Of course it's funny in places, but not in comparison to its funnier predecessor.2/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More misandry and pandering that's doomed to fail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clearly another cuck movie pandering to (and in it's own words!) stupid girls and beta males, and by constantly repeating "guys are idiots / girls are smart" in just the trailer, it's pretty obvious that this movie will be on par with other b.s. sellout show/movies that pander to the lowest common denominator - unattractive / repulsive females (again - judging by all the misandry in just the trailer).A new low for Seth Rogan, whom earlier I thought was a pretty cool guy but it turns out he's just out there to drive a beta narrative and pander to women just as low as spineless shows like Two and Half Men did, if not worse.I don't see how anyone with an IQ above that of a french fry will go out and pay to watch a movie that massively insults men and portrays women as repulsive, disgusting and stupid (and will no doubt proudly imprint this narrative to all the young girls and guys watching it, while pretending it's "empowering" of course, because apparently portraying women acting like cliché men is "empowering").As usual this misandry formula will only please a bunch of fat feminists and horny betas who just wanna look at semi-attractive girls but don't wanna pay for porn.In conclusion, this movie's message is simple: The movie industry is a sad one and selling out is way more important than dignity and having a spine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cringy and Waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't normally dislike many films and can usually laugh at anything but this film really disappointed me and I found myself laughing more because I was embarrassed from the awful jokes. I really enjoyed the first installment so thought I'd give this one a go but the minute the film started I already had bad vibes. Yes the opening scene was quite funny but after that it seemed to go downhill. Don't get me wrong there was some relatively funny parts but nothing massive enough to save the entire film. The whole thing just felt very awkward and what did it for me was the Cringy sorority girls. Everything they did was so false and their relationships with each other seemed really forced and not genuine in anyway. And Chloe Moretz acting was truly dreadful, I mean she hasn't been in many films as an adult but it seems that her acting skills have gone down as she's got older. Seth Rogan was his usual self and to be fair I don't always tend to watch films with him in as he has done some truly dreadful ones, such as Green Hornet for instance. Knocked Up was probably the best film he's done in my opinion and even the first Bad Neighbors was quite good, but this film just bored me. Not to mention the audience was completely Silent the whole way through, even young teenagers weren't laughing. I would strongly advise not to pay for this film, maybe wait until it is on Sky or hire it for cheap but it's really not worth cinema prices.</fullReview>

We sat through maybe 45 minutes of this trash, hoping that it would get better. It never did. It got worse and worse and worse.I literally walked out of the theater in disbelief of such a horrible waste of time. I am amazed that anyone with a sense of reality would find such a horrible movie even remotely amusing. I guess if I was 12 years old and curious about adult sexual extreme nonsense,this would have been an ideal one for me.

How a fine actor like Chloë Grace Moretz got in this movie I don't know. An example of the humor-level of this endeavour is a little girl holding her mothers dildo in her hand... This movie tries to be sth like American Pie but in no way it achieves the "quality" of American Pie. So be warned: If u r older than 13 years this movie will kill a lot of your brain-cells. Only recommended for ppl who still think armpit farts are funny. Bad Neighbors 2 belongs easy to the category of flicks I would drop into the paper bin marked 100% superfluous-proved.

		<shortDescription>six minutes was enough for me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched six minutes of this! Let's review what I saw in six minutes. The movie opens up with a couple having sex ( isn't that the way the original Neighbors opened up?). Female upchucks on the male lead. Rather then getting a Kleenex, he leaves it on his face, and continues to talk. Baby plays with a sex toy. Baby carries the sex toy in living room for everyone to watch. Currently, this movie is ranking above six stars, and I can clearly tell you it is not worth even half of those stars. I quit watching this because I just knew, deep in my heart, that the film was not going to improve. Seth Rogan thinks this stuff is funny, while others with an average intelligence thinks it is not. What I was expecting was some improvement over the original, something different. I miss when comedy movies were funny, the 60's, 70's. 80's....even some of the 90's comedies were just drop dead funny! I don't know where the car took a wrong turn, but I assure you, it took a wrong turn somewhere up the turnpike, and it's time to swing the Honda back around, and get everything back on track. I don't think the writers, directors, or producers get it, people are working HARDER then ever in their lives, some even have two jobs to pay a mortgage, and they need to take some stress out of their lives, so they depend on a silly, humorous movie that are made to...lighten their spirits a bit, make everything seem worthwhile, right? Instead, what they are delighted with, is a piece of worthless mess like this, and it just isn't right. Maybe an eight year old would find this funny, which renders the movie totally useless, because I wouldn't allow anyone to watch this, much less and eight year old. Bottom line: This film is a bust, and the other reviews back my opinion up. Two Chinese stars straight in the gut, Nicholos Stroller...I'll never trust you with my cash again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed maybe 5% of this movie. The jokes simply weren't funny. They made light of things that we shouldn't joke about like police brutality and the holocaust. The majority of the film was propaganda indiscreetly pushing left-winged political views. The first "Neighbors" was an incredible gut-busting film. I was really excited to see this one, thinking it would be just the same, from the other side. Sadly it fell short. I also can't get past toddlers (2-3 years old) being the object of some of the obscenity. It's totally fine when an adult is swearing at another adult but to swear at a baby and make predictions about their future sexual experiences...I don't see how that is funny. I only paid 5 dollars to see this movie because of the college discount and I want 3 bucks back. The actors and actresses did a fine job. It's the writers who are at fault here. But I'm sure they had a list of things they were mandated to include in the movie so you can't really blame them either. I'm done with the "Neighbors" franchise, let the original rest in peace please.</fullReview>

Even halfway through the movie, I was looking forward to it ending.

		<fullReview>Haven't seen that many movies as bad as this one. And to the people defending the movie saying haters simply are against the political message is utter BS. Every single scene from start to almost finish (1st time I stopped halfway and when I reprized I couldn't even bring myself to finish the last 15 minutes) is an awkwardly, forced, unfunny chain of events and the acting is just bad as can be. I liked the first one and I am a fan of all the actors in this movie and most of their work (esp. Rogen), but it baffles me that you can mess up this big. The Hangover also used the same formula for their sequel and it was obviously not as good as the first one, but still a decent comedy worth watching. But this one, ah man, no words can really express my dismay. I've never written a review, but I felt compelled to pen down my thoughts about the torture I've gone through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neighbors truly Rises!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know about you, but I agree with one of the critics calling this film one of the best sequels (putting into the mind how bad a lot of sequels usually are).I'm going to keep it short.The thing about this film is that you have to put aside a lot of factors, like looking into it too deeply because it's not a deep film. it's a film that wants to send a message without losing it's comedic side. And honestly I think it did just that. The only negative thing about this film is that it's style is a total rehash of its predecessor (but then again it's a sequel so what do you expect?), plus it's too predictable. You probably know what every character's decision will be by the middle of the film, but nevertheless it doesn't lose its funny side in the process.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It's 30 days, then we won't be escrow, then we'll be out of your hair." Mac (Rogen) and his wife are finally getting things together. Their daughter is getting older and they have decided to move into a nicer neighborhood. Due to a misunderstanding their house is in escrow. What seems like a minor inconvenience soon becomes so much more when a sorority takes over the house next door. Mac and his wife must do everything they can to stop the sorority and get their house sold, and for help they are forced to turn to an old enemy. The first movie was very funny, but I thought the funniest parts were in the preview. Going off of that I tried to avoid the previews for this and went in with lower expectations. That's where the movie gets difficult to review. On one hand most of the movie is just repeating what happened in the first one. The jokes and gags are pretty much the same thing. That said, the movie isn't as funny as the original, but it is a better movie overall I thought. I compare this to the Hot Tub Time Machine series. They both basically have the same plot in the 1st and 2nd one, the first one is funnier but the sequels are better depth and content wise. Overall, this is a better movie than the first one, but not as funny. Just a rehash of the things that made people laugh the first time. I give this a B-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're a fan of Neighbors, it's a pretty hilarious sequel. The film is almost identical to the original, however they did do a bit more gross out humor. There is a bit more on feminism / date rape campus culture too, but it really adds to the plot.Plot is virtually identical, Mac and Kelly are selling their house and they are in escrow and a sorority moves in next door. They need to get rid of the sorority to sell off their house. Exactly story line, however Teddy is back and hilarity happens.There are some big laughs and a few of them were in the trailer, but it was still very funny. The ending was weak, but everything else is almost as good as the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the few (if any) films where the sequel is actually better than the original. In saying this I didn't actually like the original, so it really wasn't much of a stretch. Although the majority of the film is mediocre cliché, there are some witty and genuinely amusing remarks. Also the movie never sets out to be anything other than a cliché, comedy, anyway. It's a good relax and be entertained, without having to think too much kind of film. This time around, hence the title, instead of chauvinistic fraternity bros, there are feminist sorority sisters who are attempting to redress a sexist rule that outlines party conditions for fraternities and sororities. Cue almost hilarity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly strong comedy with obvious but respectable social commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "Neighbors" was a bit of a pleasant surprise for me. It revealed Zac Efron's natural comedic talents (under-utilized in his straightforward "leading man" roles), and featured a surprisingly strong female role for Rose Byrne. Despite ostensibly being a "frat bro" comedy (especially given its subject matter), it actually had a lot to say about arrested development, maturity, and the male id. It was a nice, agreeable R-rated comedy that was sold on its novel premise but ultimately was not in any way screaming for a sequel.But it was a hit, and hit comedies always spawn sequels, primarily because they're able to be produced on such low budgets. Sequels, more than any other genre of film, tend to see huge critical and attendance drops, but because they're so cheap, the studios can still generate profit even if they only recoup half of the original film's intake.And that's why "Neighbors 2" exists, two years after the original, and indeed, it opened to roughly half of the dollar amount of the original film in its opening weekend. It would be standard to accept that it's an inferior piece of filmmaking, most likely regurgitating its predecessor's plot points. Most comedy sequels do this -- just look at the Hangover movies, or Ted 2 -- but Neighbors 2 deserves some credit for actually managing to spin the sequel concept on its head.At first, things seem to be headed for a repeat: Efron's character is back in his frat (now a sorority), he's once again helping to create chaos for his ex-next-door-neighbors (Rogen and Byrne). But then the movie takes a surprising detour, by turning into something of a feminist piece, and the second half really has fun by dissecting the first film's steps while still managing to pay homage and toy with them (as such, when the airbag gag is recycled, it seems playful and refreshing rather than repetitious and predictable).Nicholas Stoller has made a couple duds (he wrote Zoolander 2, which was one of the worst comedies of this or any recent year), but he's often very, very good at writing or presenting female characters (as seen in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Five Year Engagement, etc.). At first glance you can roll your eyes at a woman like Byrne being married to a shlub like Rogen, but as in the original film, there's a lot of time devoted to exploring their relationship and convincing you that there's more to it than just the leading man having an attractive wife -- she's just as fleshed-out a character as he is, and that's pretty rare to see in mainstream American comedies, especially those that are seemingly targeted towards guys.To be fair, there's still tons of genital jokes and crude humor, and there's a couple stretches in the film that become just a bit ridiculous (like the whole subplot where they try to steal the sorority's drug supply at a tailgate), but overall, I was totally refreshed by how strong a sequel this was -- especially relative to other comedy sequels. The characters are well-written and well-acted, and as such, there's a sense of justification when certain things happen -- unlike Brothers Grimsby (a film I saw close to this one) where the characters seem to exist solely for disgusting bodily fluid jokes, the characters in Neighbors 2 are likable and three-dimensional and it makes a lot of the gross gags land much better when they involve characters we believe in and can relate to.I'm not saying this is a high water mark of American cinema or anything, but at the end of the day it's way better than it had any right to be, and its commentary on feminism and sexist double- standards was way under-represented in the ad material (which may well explain why so many people who went to see it opening weekend gave it mixed reviews - I can't imagine the average male American college student going to see this and enjoying the experience of basically having their id subverted).I'm not sure I want a Neighbors 3, but at this point I wouldn't kneejerk disregard it, if it's half as funny or intelligent as the first two films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly inferior, yet hilarious sequel full of gut-busting laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a blue moon comes a sequel that not only succeeds but manages to surpass its predecessor fair and square. Even less frequently is there a sequel to a comedy that surpasses or even lives up to par of the original, think of in terms of '22 Jump Street'. This comedy directed by Nicholas Stoller reunites the cast of Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne, Zac Efron, and Dave Franco along with some new cast members in a sequel to the 2014 hit comedy 'Neighbors', a film that demonstrated Rogen at arguably his best in years. In this film, we meet again with Mac (played by Seth Rogen) and Kelly (played by Rose Byrne) who were last seen taking on the Delta Psi fraternity next door. Two years later, Mac and Kelly are fixing to have their second child and decide they must move somewhere nicer. But before they can sell their house, they can put on escrow for thirty days and must keep the house nice and maintained by the end of the period. Meanwhile, college freshman Shelby (played by Chloe Grace Moretz) rushes to join a sorority but is disappointed by the rule outlawing sororities from party, deeming it as sexist. Shelby and her two new friends decide to raise their own sorority. They rent out a house which just so happens to be the same house next door of Mac and Kelly. With Shelby and the sorority partying like animals and threatening Mac and Kelly's chance of selling the house, they acquire the help of Teddy (played by Zac Efron) who is forced to move out of his house when his fraternity brother Pete (played by Dave Franco) gets engaged, to face off against the sorority. And this proves to be an even tougher battle than their dispute with the previous fraternity.The first film was astoundingly funny and to this day, stands as one of the best comedies starring the ever-hilarious Seth Rogen. This one, thought slightly inferior to the first film, succeeds at not only delivering loads of laughter and fun but conveys a smart conservative message about sexism. This all kicks off to Chloe Grace Moretz's character discovering the shocking truth that only fraternities are allowed to throw parties while sororities are prohibited from doing so. Furthermore, her and her friends grow disgusted by girls always being called "hoes" for humor. Their idea is to raise a sorority where girls are treated equally and not bound to a sexist law that dictates girls from partying. From there, viewers are offered a plot with a thoughtful , self-aware direction and at the same, giving plenty of vulgar, yet hilarious humor. While the level of vulgarity is slightly tamer than in the first film, there is plenty of raunchy R-rated humor and four-letter words can go around. Now are also some jokes that simply don't land as well as some dialogue that unexpectedly falls flat. But when the jokes land, they are funny. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne are funny as eve, the same can be addressed for Zac Efron who's made a fine comeback following some mediocre comedies in recent years. Chloe Grace Moretz is also given her time to shine in what is probably her major raunchy role since 'Kick-Ass' and its sequel. In the end, the cast doesn't fail to satisfy.Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising doesn't quite surpass its original but it certainly stands at the par of the first film and surprises us with some good laughs and a cohesive direction. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg to take an unnecessary idea and turn into something decent. This film has a fair chance of pleasing those who enjoyed the first film but disgusting others who do not sit well with raunchy humor and profanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nowhere near as good as the first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really like the actors, but overall the movie was just awful. I wanted to leave after 20 minutes or so, and I have never ever left a movie theater in my life. I absolutely loved the first movie, so I was expecting the second one to be at least fairly good, but it wasn't. The two people I went with fell asleep by the end (one did literally). I wouldn't recommend seeing it sadly, as much as I love Seth Rogan. The main reason would just be due to how far fetched everything was, and the story and character bonds just seemed so rushed and stupid. It was every stereotype of a teenage girl thrown into a tacky cash in.In the movie's defense I did laugh once or twice, hence why the rating I've given it is a 3 rather than a 1 or 2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, i am on the fence here, well a bit more to the good side of it. I'm gonna split this review in two parts, the good and the bad, first starting with the bad.Like i said in the summary, it pales in comparison to the first movie, which i think, was amazing. There is a quite bigger pile of problems with this movie, first and foremost its obviously not as funny as the first, sure i did laugh a few times but not as much as the first. And second, it feels really short. Like, i think 10 minutes have passed and then i check the time, A WHOLE 30 HAVE PASSED!?. Note: This movie has the same runtime as the first movie. That means, something is amiss, but i cant quite put my finger on it.There are also a lot of things i liked about this film. Things like, the switching of sides, poking at the faults of feminism, and above all, made me laugh. Making me laugh is important, and takes quite a bit to get me, even though i didn't laugh as much as the first, some laughter is better than no laughter. It may look as if i don't like this movie very much, but i quite liked it, much to my surprise.Do i think you should watch it? I guess if you've watched the first one, why not watch the second, see how it turns out. Look, maybe you would like it more than others, maybe not? Its definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another prime example of Hollywood trying to bring back a dead horse. This movie had potential, with the original cast and some young fresh faces introduced into the film, but it turned out to be a disaster. The first Neighbor movie was fine. It had funny scenes and some original jokes. The new film is full of political agenda. From the BLM "Black cop can't shoot himself" to the feminism "gender equality" and "sexism" and gay marriage. This all would have been fine if the movie was funny. But it wasn't. I, or anybody else I watched this movie with didn't laugh, at all. This is just another failure of a movie with cheap and bad script writing to make some extra bucks for the film company.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two years after feuding with a rowdy frat that moved next door to them, young parents Mac and Kelly are about to have their second child and move to a new house. Unfortunately, their attempts to sell their current home runs into trouble when a sorority led by a rebellious college student become their new neighbours. Desperate to get rid of the hard-partying girls, the couple form an alliance with Teddy, the former frat-boy who tormented them in the first, slightly better film..I didn't mind the first film, the random set pieces like the Robert De Niro party were funny and made it slightly above average to other, standard toilet humour movies. But what put me off the first time was the fact that the UK distributors had to put the word 'bad' into the title.This was done in case people thought it was a cinematic version of the seasoned Aussie soap. We are not stupid, but to do it a second time is just plain offensive. We know what the sequel is to, so just take the bad away.And that goes for the contents of the film also.It's nothing more than a carbon copy of the first film, but with girls, and added homophobia, courtesy of a sub plot featuring cameos from the first films crew.It begins like the first, with an awkward intimate moment between Rogen and Byrne, and then it's business as usual.The jokes are flat, Efron looks desperate now, he should be A-list, but his choice of movies Are becoming more and more bewildering, perhaps he should stay away from comedies where he has to take his shirt of, and work with people whom appreciate the medium of cinema.These days, if a film is a success, especially a comedy, it's bound to get a quick cash in sequel, it's been happening for years now, but the makers always seem to take the popular parts of the first film, make them more obscure, and hope for the best.Again, all the best bits are in the trailer, and if like me, you found the trailer a little tepid, imagine the rest of the film.Disappointing stuff....</fullReview>

It's been awhile since I have watched this movie and I cannot state what might have been able to make this movie better, but I have this feeling that it could've been better. This movie is already funny and just overall good, don't get me wrong. All I can say is that I feel like this movie was missing something, maybe could've added more to the plot. The same goes for the first Neighbors movie. I don't know, I just think the plot was a little twisted, like at some points it didn't even exist. Overall good movie.

		<shortDescription>Comedy sequel that is on repeat mode</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really like the first Neighbors movie. It had a simple premise, but it had enough comedy and chemistry between the actors that it made it a fun time. Now we have a sequel only this time a sorority is the one creating all the problems. Comedy sequels have a really bad reputation when it comes to quality and laughs and this one sadly continues this trend as Neighbors 2 is a sub-par sequel.Good: The actors do try and get a lot of laughs from the script being all in especially Efron who is proving that comedy is his strong suit. There are some good laughs in here brought by Efron and Rogen.Bad: The movie lacks any true punch. Chloe Moretz did not leave any impression in the film or provide much in laughs. The other jokes were just retreads of the first movie which made them feel old immediately. The other issue I had with the movie is the constant hammering of the "sororities can't party" plot and women can party as hard as guys. I appreciate it, but instead of letting it grow naturally, the movie felt to literally talk about it every time. Let the actresses present that message instead of just talking about it in every conversation because it doesn't work that way.Overall, it wasn't a terrible movie, but it definitely felt lacking in the laughs department. I liked the girl power edge, but they didn't do much of anything with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A typical unimaginative comedy sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Typically, promotions for movie sequels will boast, "if you liked the original, you'll love this second one!" In this instance, I'll go a little bit different route: "you loved Neighbors, you'll probably at least like Neighbors 2." This movie is essentially exactly what you expect it to be. It's a typical, unimaginative comedy sequel that's awkwardly crossed with a half-hearted attempt at feminist empowerment. In other words, it's a less funny version of the first movie with a sprinkle of girl power. The feminism angle falls flat due in large part to the way the girls in the movie are portrayed. They fall into two basic categories: good girls or drug dealing, party hungry rebels. Every female character fits either one of those descriptions exactly or an exaggerated version of one of them. Neither prototype is something to young girls to strive for. Impressionable girls cannot look up to characters that constantly let them down. As far as the movie's chops as a pure comedy with no message to send, once again it underwhelms and once the blame falls the on the female characters. There are plenty of hilarious women currently active in our entertainment, but sadly none of them are in this movie. These girls just weren't very funny. They had enough to work with since the material hardly changed from the first movie (they basically just replaced some dicks jokes with vagina jokes and then added more dick jokes). The biggest change between the two movies was the characters. Neighbors 2 probably would have worked if the same funny frat guys were still prominently featured. But they weren't. So instead we were left with a slightly less than mediocre raunchy comedy. If you still want to see it, I recommend going with a group of people who laughed hysterically at the first movie. That's your best chance to enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the first seconds of Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising, the character Kelly accidentally throws up into her husband's mouth... and from there on, the "humor" only gets worse, until leading to the result we had all expected: a sequel which is even worse than the horrible original film. Besides of displaying one stupid joke after the other (seriously, the vomiting routine is the maximum creative expression of this movie), Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising attempts to show a bit of "social conscience" through vague feminist themes which are never well combined with the frivolity of the screenplay. The girls from Kappa Nu complain against the inequality in the rules governing the male and female fraternities (the female ones can't organize parties, while the male ones live on a continuous miasma of drugs, alcohol and sexism). That means that the noisy parties and irresponsible attitudes from the girls are justified... after all, the only thing they want is gender equality! Girl power! But, one moment... since they are women, they know nothing about finance or understand the most basic administration concepts to pay the rent of their house, so they need the help of a man to guide them and explain them that the selling of drugs is the best way to earn money. I guess that feminism only works under male supervision. Girl power! By the way, the man advising the girls is Teddy Sanders, the old nemesis of the main characters, something which presents new opportunities to makes their lives impossible and keep the potential buyers of the house away. Drama! And, yes... Zac Efron's performance in Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising is somehow even more unfunny and irritating than the one he brought in Dirty Grandpa, while Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne display apathy in their roles. One of the actresses playing the "sisters" in Kappa Nu is Kiersey Clemons, who also appeared in the magnificent film Dope, which is hugely more recommended than Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising. Both films don't have much in common (with the exception of selling drugs), but any excuse is good to avoid as many people as possible from wasting their time with the execrable Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mac Radner (Seth Rogen) and Kelly Radner (Rose Byrne) are about to move out of their house and leave it to another couple, yet they forgot they had signed a special contract by which the incoming couple has a 30 day inspection period before they decide to buy the house and when Shelby (Chole Grace Moretz) and her friends, with the help of Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron), move in next door and settle with their newly founded sorority, Mac and Kelly have to find a way to have the girls move out. "Neighbors 2" is directed and co-written by Nicholas Stoller, a great director in the comedy genre, and written by Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Andrew Jay Coen and Brendan O'Brien."Neighbors" came out in 2014 and was kind of a surprise hit of the year, the film delivered on comedy and even some good character work. Whilst, "Neighbors 2" definitely breaks the stigma of comedy sequels almost always sucking by bringing in some great laughs throughout the film, yet Rogen, Goldberg and Stoller fail to bring the kind of heart and joy that makes some of their other films comedy classics.It could have been very easy for this film to be a beat by beat rehash of its predecessor with such a simple premise, yet if there is one thing that the filmmakers can be commended for is for not making such mistake by bringing in a whole new spin on almost every possible aspect, I personally never felt we were treading on old ground and whilst there are some gags that are brought back from the first one they are integrated in the film in a way that makes them feel fresh, see the airbag scene for an example.As always we can expect from these guys all types of comedy and as usual they deliver on all of them: there's raunchy humor, slapstick, banter, pop culture and even some greatly irreverent humor on stereotypes that I found to be played greatly, in particular the moment when Rogen and Byrne have to convince their buyers that a Jew couple is living next door and out come Ike Barinholtz and Carla Gallo pretending to be so, it was comedy gold and it was all played visually in a way that unfortunately the rest of the film didn't quite commit to for the most part.Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne keep having great chemistry together and delivering laughs even if their characters don't really have that much to do. Overall all of the characterizations result kind of weak even if all of the performers manage to take the best out of them and deliver funny, if one note people, Moretz has always had great comedic timing and she brings another good performance to her catalogue showing her great range. The one exception for me might be Zac Efron: his character actually had a very interesting dynamic and whilst I could have done with a little less shirt-off humor, he had a nice arch and had some moments to really shine as a comedic performer.Where the film fails is, as I said, in its heart, there isn't an overflowing sense of joy form the comedy, it has alternated moments of greatness and short periods where stuff is just happening and other than rarely ever making any kind of sense, which doesn't really matter in the end, it just becomes a little too much of visual noise and whilst the filmmakers are never banal in their editing choices and find funny moments everywhere, there is just not enough empathy with these people to actually care, moreover the thematic overtones the film tries to get into play have their moments of fun, but in their resolution they result somewhat forced at times and other times slightly inappropriate.I laughed a lot and had the joy to experience some very glorious moments of comedy with "Neighbours 2", I would recommend it for a good funny time, but unfortunately I didn't have the sense of exhilaration and adrenaline I want from a comedy, admittedly having being spoiled by these guys and their amazing work over the years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Bad As You Might Think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The dreaded sequel. Over the years, it has trained us to recoil in disgust at the mere thought of it. We conjure up the image of studio executives huddled around a table and after hours of deliberation have a eureka moment? "Let's take a previously successful film and create a continuation of it. We're bound to be rolling in the big bucks!" After an exchange of pats on the back, they call it a day and go home to their mansions where they sleep soundly on their thousand thread count sheets.Cut to the release of said sequel and there is a unanimous groan let out by movie-lovers around the world. As much as I enjoyed the film Bad Neighbours (or just Neighbors to my American friends out there), I wasn't too sure how a second film would fare. Having said all of this, you can surely sense that I had extremely low expectations for Bad Neighbours 2: Sorority Rising (if you can't sense that, then you really need a lesson in reading sub-text).Setting the bar low actually gave the second film a boost in my eyes (or maybe it was just a decent film!) but I found it just as funny as the first one. Granted, I still don't think either film is necessarily the funniest in the world but they deliver on what they promise. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne are back but this time they team up with their previous enemy, frat-boy-turned-Abercrombie-greeter Zac Efron (and ladies, prepare yourselves? we are presented with several shirtless scenes with both himself AND Seth Rogen? I know, too much sexiness to deal with). This time around, the couple have to deal with an even more raucous group who have moved in next door ? Chloe Grace Moretz and her newly- created posse of sorority sisters.With as much ridiculousness of the previous film in the franchise, this is a good no-brainer comedy that's an easy watch ? a film that you can switch on if you want to actually 'switch off'.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising (2016): Dir: Nicholas Stoller / Cast: Seth Rogen, Zac Efron, Rose Byrne, Chloe Grace Moretz, Dave Franco: Amusing sequel to the 2014 hit only this one is the female side. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne return as the harassed couple who are expecting their second child. They are preparing to sell their house until a sorority moves in next door. Zac Efron returns when his best friend gets engaged to his boyfriend and requested that he move out. Hurt, Efron attempts to connect with the sorority sisters until they detach themselves from him. With this he joins forces with Rogen and Byrne in an attempt to sabotage the sorority. This is pretty much a repeat plot with an ending that surprisingly works. Rogen and Byrne fare well in familiar territory but there is two performances that stand out. Efron shows real vulnerability as he struggles to make a connection. The real scene stealer is Chloe Grace Moretz as the rebellious student who starts this sorority in order to connect with others and rebel against the so-called clean cut sororities. Dave Franco's character goes through a complete transformation since the previous film. We learn that this guy is now gay and is engaged to his boyfriend. Directed by Nicholas Stoller who made the first film as well as Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek. The humour is crude particularly with images of a baby toying with a vibrator. This is not as good as the first film but it contains its share of laughs. The subtitle suggests the gender rise and the promise of greater things out of one lovely Chloe Moretz. Score: 6 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was absolutely hilarious!! Don't listen to all the haters. I couldn't stop laughing during the whole movie. I liked the first one really much, but expected less from the sequel. Well I was wrong. I guess haters are a bunch of grown-ups who like stupid cliché comedies and bullshit like this. I'm 16 and in order to appreciate a comedy, it MUST have some sex jokes, OK? And the movie is not about political propaganda or something. It's making fun of all those feminists who always get offended for bullshit. Anyway,those kind of movies (and most of Rogen's comedies) are best appreciated by teenagers. So screw the haters and go laugh your ass off!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising" (2016 release; 92 min.) brings the return of Mac and Kelly and their daughter Stella. As the movie opens, we see Mac and Kelly making love until Kelly she throws up on him. "I think I may be pregnant!" she cries out. We then move "4 Months Later", as Mac and Kelly have found a potential buyer for the house but now must go through the 30 days escrow period. In a parallel story line, we get to know Shelby, a freshman. She is rushing Phi Lambda. When she learns that the sorority cannot throw parties but instead must attend parties at the frats, Shelby and 2 new friends decide to start their own sorority, Kappa Nu, outside of the existing sorority system so they can do whatever they want. When looking for a sorority house, they end up next to Mac and Kelly (of course). At this point we're not even 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: most of the crew and cast from the first movie have returned for the sequel, and hence we get Seth Rogan (Mac) and Rose Byrne (Kelly), but of course also Zac Efron as Teddy, doing the same old 'dumb jock' stud as in the first movie (with the required striptease of course). But the sequel benefits most from the addition of Chloë Grace Moretz in the role of Shelby, Moretz, the erstwhile 'child actress' (in Kick-Ass) is all frown up now, and has transformed herself into a leading actress, see also earlier this year's "The 5th Wave". As Shelby, she and her gals are all about grrrl power and equal rights, but in a fun and non-preachy way, and that helps the movie greatly. Yes, there is a lot of partying in the movie, but rarely in a way that is degrading for women. Keep an eye out for Lisa Kudrow as the university dean (she plays in exactly one scene) and Kelsey Grammar as Shelby's dad (also in all of one scene). Other than that, this movie doesn't intend to be anything other than a mindless entertaining sequel to the first one, and at that it succeeds. So enjoy it for what it is, nothing more, nothing less."Neighbors 2" is now in its second week of release, and the Memorial Day early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great. Probably the picture-perfect weather was a factor, but the truth also is that the sequel hasn't done nearly as well at the box office as expected. It's a bit of a surprise to me as this movie surely is truth-in-advertising: you wanted more of what you saw in the first movie? Well here it is. If you have seen the first movie and wonder whether the sequel is worth checking out, by all means give this once a chance, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, I think you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of money. Was straight up boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, being "boring" is not always a bad thing. But for a comedy movie, boring is the worst possible thing. And thats exactly what this was. The beginning was alright, with a couple funny jokes spread around, followed by a rash misrepresentation of parties and college which was expected. The movie tried to push the feminist/equality agenda which is totally fine with me, except it totally did not work. This was bad. Jokes were hardly funny. Was looking at my phone multiple times to see how much time was left in this movie, and kept expecting it to get better for some reason. In my opinion, save your money. Don't buy tickets for this lousy movie. Go see Nice Guys or Xmen instead. I didn't love the first one, but it was a hell of a lot better than this. At this point, it should just be a rule of thumb to not make sequels to comedy movies, as besides 22 jump street, there hasn't ever been a good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even funnier than the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising is a comedy film directed by Nicholas Stoller and written by five different writers. It is the sequel to the surprisingly good and successful Neighbors that came out in 2014. This one has old and new faces on the casting side, with returning names like Seth Rogen, Zac Efron and Rose Byrne, plus new cast members such as the amazingly talented Chloë Grace Moretz on the sorority side, with her new "sisters" that are played by Kiersey Clemons and Beanie Feldstein. Overall I quiet enjoyed this movie, and in my opinion it is even funnier and better than the first one. The overall casting choices are perfect, and while the old cast is still incredibly funny and likable, Chloë Grace Moretz totally steals the show in my opinion. She's so darn likable and definitely delivers the perfect one-liners that are super funny. Her character is also likable and interesting at the same time. Zac Efron is also a casting choice that really impressed me on the first Neighbors, and while he was funny on that movie, in this one he just takes it to a whole new level. I pretty much have liked this guy in every movie he's been in so far in his career. He certainly has comedic talent and I hope he keeps on doing what he's doing. Sure some of the jokes and story-lines of this movie feel like a deja- vu from the first movie, but I think that this is just a trend for comedy sequels now. Repeating the same things from the first movie is something that many other comedy sequels have done recently, like Ted 2 and 22 Jump Street. But it worked for both of them and it works for this one too. I really liked this movie, and while it is not comedic gold or a classic, it isn't trying to be either. It is a fun and enjoyable summer movie with some great messages about friendship and family thrown in there to make the perfect balance, and in my opinion, a good comedy movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A rare comedy sequel indeed. Plot-wise it does what most comedy sequels do, which is recycle the original's plot pretty much exactly. It mostly doesn't just recycle the gags, though, and somehow the whole thing turns out a bit funnier than the original. It's also a dumb comedy with a surprisingly progressive outlook, but without seeming even the least bit preachy about it. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne return as homeowning parents. They're selling the home from the first one to move to a better one, but they're in escrow for 30 days. In next door moves a new sorority (led by Chloe Grace Moretz, Kiersey Clemons and Beanie Feldstein - the latter vying to replace Rebel Wilson) who are determined to be the first sorority able to throw their own parties - they find the frat parties a tad too rapey. Zach Efron, the frat boy rival from the first movie, factors into the plot in a major way, but it's pretty clever and I'd rather not spoil it. Efron is probably the funniest member of the cast, but everyone gets their moment. It's well worth seeing if you need a laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first had some laughs. This one has more. The timing is better in the editing. It's more crisp, snappy, and I didn't feel at times like there should be crickets chirping like I did in the other with comedy that just didn't work. Jokes that slightly worked (not many here) didn't go on painfully for too long like a bad SNL skit. While the sorority characters aren't developed as well as the fraternity characters in the first, and that harms it slightly, it does well enough integrating them into a new, larger character base. The writing is smarter. The jokes are funnier. You need to see the first to fully appreciate this one, but you are in for a treat in the sequel. Trust me. If this level of raunchiness is not usually your thing and you can get through the first, this one will be a breeze. Yes, it's not for kids or the puritanical, obviously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'NEIGHBORS 2: SORORITY ROW': Four Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2014 hit comedy flick 'NEIGHBORS', once again directed by Nicholas Stollar. Seth Rogen, Zac Efron and Rose Byrne all return, to their starring roles; and they're joined this time by Chloe Grace Moretz (in the new antagonistic neighbor role). The twist, of this sequel, is that married couple Mac and Kelly (Rogen and Byrne) now have to deal with a rowdy sorority, living next door to them, instead of a fraternity. It was written by Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O'Brien (who also co-wrote the original); as well as Stoller, Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Ike Barinholtz, Carla Gallo and Dave Franco (as well as others) also reprise their roles from the first film. It's received good reviews from critics, but it hasn't done nearly as well at the Box Office (as the original movie). I enjoyed it, but it's definitely not as good as the first one (or most other Seth Rogen movies).Mac and Kelly (Rogen and Byrne) are now expecting their second child, and planning to relocate to a new house (they just purchased). There's another couple that's also planning to buy their current home, but Mac and Kelly have to wait out 30 days of escrow, to make sure the sale is completed. To complicate things, immensely, a sorority has just moved into the old fraternity house next door to them. They're led by the rebellious Shelby (Moretz); who's trying to fight sexism there, by running the first sorority house that's allowed to party. Mac and Kelly's old nemesis, Teddy Sanders (Efron), joins the sorority girls; as their mentor.The movie has a pretty clever twist, for a routine (and very unnecessary) sequel; but it still feels like just a redo of the original. There are a few new witty jokes, and some fresh comic scenarios, and there's also a little bit extra character development. The performances are decent, as well, and the female nemesis storyline definitely deserves some credit; but a lot of the movie also just feels like a rerun (with a lot more forced humor, than the original). It's still a lot better than most other comedy flicks out there though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuGIEoCGrtw</fullReview>

No originality. It was just a jumbled mess of one liners and gags. It reminded me of the Hangover sequels. First one was funny. The next 2 sucked. I feel like I wasted $10. Thankfully the movie is only 90 minutes or else I might have had to leave. The least they could have done is include the gag reel. That was probably funnier than the movie.Also, how can parts of the trailer not appear in the movie itself? Isn't that false advertising?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>New neighbors, gender-swap, bigger stakes, less characterization. Someone took the script for the first one, went Search and Replace, set to bold every gag, deleted the riffing, added feminism which it occasionally forgets its position on albeit it remains a vocal advocate, and this is what we got. Far funnier and more consistently hilarious. Not as good of a film, but that was never the goal with these two...soon to be three...? This makes a call that greatly benefits it: the setting is simply no longer the real world. Consequences are a thing of the past. Bones don't break, cops don't show, and so on. This allows them to be as crazy as the trailers suggest, in spite of about half of the footage in there not being in the final cut.The girls get to dish it out, now even more so. Stupidity has grown rapidly. Teddy(Ephron, who remains one of the best parts) is in the middle. You know how he was pretty psychopathic before? Well, this time, he has the full meltdown. It practically opens the film. He just wants to be valued! And he totally knows stuff! Not much, but some, and it's remarkably specific! This does suffer from the writers, all 5 of them, clearly not quite knowing, well, women. Why they didn't have them grab a pen... well, there's that sexism again. Thus, there's a lot of stereotyping going on there, and not a lot of depth. The climax is genuinely a fizzling out. Resolution is forced, albeit it is at least there...that's one of the first things this admits.There is constant strong language, some sexuality, and a little violence in this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys raunchy comedies. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't believe I am saying this but Zac Efron made this movie work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First it was the couples against the fraternity and now it's against the sorority. Now, it deals more with sexism, feminism and what is deem politically correct. Zac Efron could have just tried to go in a cool teenage heartthrob direction or continued to try to play the super charismatic ladies man. I think it's cool that he chose the comedy direction, because he is fearless when it comes to entertaining the audiences and isn't too focused on his image. I especially liked his team ups and scenarios when it comes to those team ups. He actually fit in with the narrative pretty well, when it comes to a guy trying to find his place. This however sometimes seemed like a straight to DVD or Netflix comedy and most of the budget seems to have gone to the cast. Also this happens to to a lot of movies, but the trailer is just much better than the actual movie. It seemed like half the stuff in the trailer wasn't even in the movie. Chloe Moretz who plays the complete opposing side trying to throw a sorority party, did a fine job of pulling off a naive and rebellious teen. However the way she played it came off more adorable than annoying. Overall this is a alright watch despite it not bringing anything all that new to the party comedy genre. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Believe me: I'm a huge Airplane! fan. Favorite comedy of all time. More of my top ten comedies include: The Naked Gun!, Scary Movie and The Hangover. All part ones work. You know what usually doesn't work? Their follow-ups.9 times out of 10, the sequel is something no one really asked for and 10 out of 10 times, it's cutting room floor crap that barely can fill the running time of a feature length film. Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising at least was consistent with the rest.But, I will give it this: it wasn't entirely phoned in and some of it worked. I could see they were trying and at least having a little fun. That said, it was a step too far. I really had a blast with the first one. Saw it twice so far and even though I was worried I wouldn't laugh as hard the second time around, I certainly did. This part 2, however, I only had a few chuckles and most certainly don't wanna see again.Once again, our "heroes" or "the old people," must fight their neighboring party house. Only real difference, it's a sorority vs. a frat. Pretty much the rest of the movie is the same as the first.It's certainly not perfect, has some annoying way-too-young-&amp;-bratty characters and absolutely nowhere near as funny or clever as the first, but it's an "acceptable" closure to our old-couple's journey of getting the hell out of dodge. And of all the comedy sequels that should never have been, it's one of the better ones. But, only by a little bit.***Final thoughts: Is it just me or does everyone wanna pop in Kick-Ass whenever they see Chloë Grace Moretz on screen? Seriously, she was so much younger back then, but just her presence draws me back to one of my favorite comic-book/super-hero movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was what I expected from the first film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you read my reviews you would expect me to complain about this type of comedy. Normally I can't stand Seth Rogen and his brand of unfunny "shock" comedy and toilet humour. And then once in awhile he does something semi-redeemable. The first Neighbors film was redeemable. It wasn't amazing but I did laugh and Efron, Rogen and Byrne had great chemistry as foes. It also had some really ridiculous physical comedy that somehow worked. It was a one off success in my books. However, it was good enough that I was willing to give them a second chance. Even the trailers looked promising and I think Chloe Grace Moretz is fantastic. Neighbors 2 is everything terrible I thought the first film would be. It's not a complete loss but it's really freaking close. The story is very weak, none of the nemesis-feud fun of the first is there. It just feels like they forced their way into this. I actually saw an interview with Rogen where it sounded like he put some work into this but the movie doesn't reflect that at all. The gags are stale, the story is dumb and the new cast is underused and completely flat.Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne return as the stoner parents that seem to lack certain brain cells. They were adorable and worked shockingly well together and they're good again but they don't add anything to them as a couple or as characters. Byrne seems to be underused and doesn't get nearly as many great scenes as she did in the first. Zac Efron also returns as the "hot" neighbor and former frat boy who ends up on their side when the new sorority turns against him. Same as Rogen and Byrne, in a sequel you need something new and different to add to the character and none of the original cast is given anything new to deal with leaving them feeling stale and empty. Chloe Grace Moretz is a terrific young actress, certainly one of my favourites but this role is just a disgrace to her talent. It isn't even a fun role. It just feels so clichéd and such a dumb role. She doesn't even give them a run for their money, her and the other sorority girls aren't even close to what Efron and his group were and they weren't smart either. It feels as though no thought when into creating the girls from the sorority. The supporting cast are familiar faces from the first one but everyone is background this go around.Director Nicholas Stroller has mostly a good solid career behind him as a gross out director. He's had some genuinely stupid but funny films but he had to have known the script on this was just bad. I think Rogen and the other writers really struggled to come up with some substance here and I don't know why because the idea is not a bad one but the delivery is poor at best. Neighbors 2 is almost a complete miss and besides a few redeemable moments and seeing the wacky cast back together, this is one sequel that doesn't even come near the original. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne and Zac Efron all reprise their roles in the second installment of the Neighbors series, this time taking on a rowdy sorority next door. While I have to admit, I thought the first Neighbors was hilarious, and trailers had me thinking this would be a fantastic follow up, I was let down. But only a little. While sometimes raunchy for no apparent reason (it is a Seth Rogen film so you have to expect that), Neighbors 2 had enough laughs to keep me reasonably entertained, but never rolling on the floor like I was while watching the first one. As the movie went on, I began to question more and more why a sequel was necessary, and it began to feel like a cookie cutter film based off of the first one's success. Those who enjoyed the first one will probably find something to laugh about with this sequel, but nothing to talk about the next day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606; out of 5) THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A gross-out comedy that needed a better script to make the laughs consistently work. GRADE: C+SYNOPSIS: A turf war begins between a family and the sorority girls-next-door.JIM'S REVIEW: Once again, the generation gap widens to become a continental divide between a middle class family and a group of loud and raunchy college students in Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising, a diverting sequel that takes its former scenario and places it firmly into the hands of the female gender this time around. Apparently, girls just wanna have fun and can as sexually explicit and gross as the guys.This equal opportunity offender employs much of the same set-up as its 2014 film, but with less success. The gags have still no boundaries, incorporating dildos, air bags, and drug paraphernalia to new comic highs as a happily married couple, Mac and Kelly Radner (Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne) take on a neighboring sorority, Kappa Nu, led by naughty Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz) and her privileged harem of hedonistic warriors. Adding to the fun is Mac's side- kick, Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron) a perfectly-chiseled but fading Adonis who cannot come to terms with his post-graduate situation. Teddy remains in arrested development as his former frat brothers have moved on with their lives but he remains a boy-child in a man's body...and what a body it is! Nevertheless, this clash of suburban titans escalates into an all-out war. Slapstick and pratfalls prevail with varying results.The screenplay-by-committee, written by five writers (Andrew J. Cohen, Brendan O'Brien Evan Goldberg, the director Nicholas Stoller, and lead actor Seth Rogen) mines some comic possibilities but sacrifices its characters to inane sitcom humor. The script never really gel. The plot seems frenzied and choppy, in need of a few re-writes. Many of the jokes fall flat and cross that demarcation line of gross-out humor, relying too much upon bodily fluids, vomit, and drugs to serve as the punchlines. But some of the comedy is funny and hits the mark more often than not. The visual gags and a few wisecracks work due to the actors' comic timing with their well- worn characters and their recognizable foibles. Mr. Efron and Mr. Rogen play off each other very well once again, although there is less screen time together here as adversaries. Ms. Moretz and her sisterhood gang (Kiersey Simmons and Beanie Feldstein) are the Radner's latest opponents who provide the conflict, but, as written, they aren't up to snuff and just not as much fun. Except for solid support by Ike Barinholtz and Carla Gallo, Ted's fraternity family (Dave Franco, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and Jerrod Carmichael) is mostly MIA in this installment and their presence is noticeable.The hostilities between the warring clans makes for purer (or should I say, impure) entertainment. Yet all of the scheming and one-upmanship in Neighbor 2: Sorority Rising feels strained and rambling, with an ending that seems all too unconvincing. Still, this Greek crass war between the two quarreling tribes is fitfully amusing but really not in the same league as its more cleverer original source. Like many of the drunken party-goers at the Kappa Nu reveries, the film wears out its own welcome as well.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

The story was much stronger in my opinion than the first and the comedy was there as well. I really enjoyed how they cleaned up their messes with how the first movie ended. The scene where Efron and Rogen are outside the American Eagle store was so out of place. This guy just got him arrested and the fraternity shut down. Why would they be anything other than enemies. In this movie they show the anger there and that is what should be expected. They also did a great job wrapping up the story. I was glad to see that the girls did what they intended and made a safe place for all women to be together and support each other. All in all the minor flaws that I had with this film were trumped buy the story and comedy. I would definitely watch again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a decent sequel-just don't come in with too high hopes and expecting to see an Oscar-worthy movie;also try to make it past the scene with Chloe Grace Moretz smoking weed at the start and assume that's not the movie! Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne have to hold onto their house for 30 days before "officially" selling it. Of course the new sorority moves in next door (just like the fraternity in the first one), and an all-out war breaks out. They want to break the rule that "sororities can't party." It follows the formula of the first one, and it actually produces some decent laughs and funny scenes. It was pretty good with the cast clicking. Moretrz was good in her role.** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good fun comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the first bad neighbours film and even though I wasn't excited for this sequel I have seen it and actually this is a good comedy. The premise sees mac and Kelly decide to sell there house after it is revealed that they are going to have a second child. They have 30 days till the house is sold when a sorority moves in next door and they need to stop the chaos. Seth rogen pretty much plays the same character in every comedy he does and this film is absolutely no different but I find him funny so I think he did a good job in this film. His chemistry especially with zac efron is probably even better in this film then the previous. Zac efron has really revitalised his career with these films and he is really funny in this film. The guy seems made for comedy and I think at the moment it is the right films for him to be in. His character also has a pretty good arc throughout the film that follows from the previous film. Rose byrne is back and once again she is funny in this film, the trio work really well in this film and you feel the comedic energy between them. Chloe grace moretz plays the antagonist and she is funny in this film too and also her character has a pretty good arc in the film as well. The story of this film has some decent character arcs as some of the characters do truly develop as the film progresses. However, it does feel like a bit of a copy of the first film and just an excuse for over the top pranks. The script has some really funny moments in it especially with some great one line jokes. I just didn't find it as funny as the first one and some of the more dramatic scenes didn't work. The style is fun and over the top but you have seen most of it before in other films like this. Overall I thought this was a decent sequel that if your a fan of these movies you should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Squanders its energy on trying to be politically correct and inclusive rather than funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Neighbors 2" squanders so much of its time and effort on being diverse, inclusive and presenting a politically correct theme and message that it loses sight of being funny. But look at the diverse cast with blacks, Asians, homosexuals and Jews, even a gay couple kissing and an interracial couple! Reflect deeply on the sophomoric themes. Sororities should have the same right to party as fraternities. Males can be ecdysiasts. Blacks can be middle-class homeowners. Seth Rogen's Mac can get stoned every day and still afford to move into a much larger home without ever showing up at the office. Chloë Grace Moretz is a very attractive and talented actress who has tackled somewhat edgy roles in films like "The Equalizer," "Movie 43" and "Kick-Ass" with the raw sensuality and lack of inhibitions of stars like Sandra Dee and Annette Funicello. Her presence as the principal antagonist in a raunchy comedy about college students who spend all their time getting stoned, never go to class or do homework, pelt houses with soiled tampons, lounge around in skimpy bikinis, attend parties in slutty dresses and produce sexy videos for YouTube, gives the movie a sort of 1960s vibe. One wonders when Frankie Avalon will wander in with a ukulele. The movie has a few funny moments. The scene where Mac attempts to give Teddy a cooking lesson, a similar scene where Teddy displays his math skills and a scene where the girls ignore an impassioned speech to engage in spontaneous democracy are hilarious. Most of the successful scenes revolve around Zac Efron. But much of the humor seems forced and the characters spend so much time espousing incoherent but politically correct ultra liberal ideologies that there is little screen time left for raucous humor. The original earned 15x its budget at the box office. The sequel had a budget twice as large, which probably went largely to salaries rather than other production elements, but generated only 3x its budget in revenues. While it was modestly successful, it presents another compelling argument against the @OscarsSoWhite contention that audiences want more diversity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Neighbours 2: Sorority Rising review (spoiler free)**1/2 (2.5 out of 5) Distributor: Universal Director: Nicholas Stoller Cast: Seth Rogen, Zac Efron, Rose Byrne, Chloe Garce-Moretz, Ike Barinholtz with Kiersey Clemons and Dave Franco.Plot overview: When their new next-door neighbors turn out to be a sorority even more debaucherous than the fraternity previously living there, Mac (Rogen) and Kelly (Byrne) team with their former enemy, Teddy (Efron), to bring the girls down.Bad Neighbours (2014) when it came out it was hilarious and original this is not that it's not original and it is most definitely not funny. Sequels to comedies are never as good as the first which is a real shame because the things that can be done show potential.Some of the jokes in this movie are over used and quite frankly a little pathetic and tiring when I was watching this I wasn't laughing in the slightest. When the first one ended so well it didn't really need a sequel especially a badly one.Mac (Rogen) and Kelly (Byrne) are trying to sell their house when a bunch of teenagers move next door lead by the obnoxious Shelby (Grace-Moretz), it's pretty much the same story as the first one and quite frankly didn't need to be done.Here are two reasons why this is a sequel that is to be missed: Bad jokes: Some of the jokes are the same as the first movie especially with the airbags gag which is the same as the first except this time more stupid. The fact that most of the jokes are weirdly about gay porn they're ridiculous and lame.Bad acting: Nearly all of the cast that is used in this movie are list comedy and drama actors for example Seth Rogen and Chloe Grace-Moretz are mainly known for comedies. Normally these actors are quite good at what they do but with this it's basically wasted talent, especially with Zac Efron who was firstly known for High School Musical but lately he's taken the step into adult comedy and really his acting in this is bad.Quite frankly this movie is pointless and very tiring to watch there aren't any good bits and this is a sequel that I would like to forget. If you want originality this movie is not it stick with the first.Verdict: Sadly a disappointing sequel, with overused jokes and a stupid plot that is basically a copycat of the first. 5/10 forget this exists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising was a pretty enjoyable raunchy sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I decided to watch with my movie theatre-working friend this sequel to Neighbors that starred Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne. It has many of the same raunchy humor that is either hilarious or cringe-worthy, depending on what certain things are shown or said. This time, the married couple have to deal with both another pregnancy (Ms. Byrne was actually expecting this time around) and a sorority that moves next door in the same house that had a fraternity in the previous one which spells trouble for them because their house is in escrow. I think I and my friend liked this one a little better. Oh, and Zac Efron is back as the former frat leader who does a little of changing sides so that's something to look forward to. So on that note, Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising is worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Neighbors 2" Surpasses Its Predecessor!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Forgetting Sarah Marshall" director Nicholas Stoller has defied probability and made a sequel, "Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising," that surpasses its above-average predecessor. Nevertheless, the second "Neighbors" movie serves up some rather risqué humor. Seth Rogen delivers the best example. When he introduces a Semitic couple to an American couple, Rogen points out that the pregnant Hebrew woman has "a Jew in the oven." This qualifies as the most controversial line in an otherwise empowering comedy of errors. The lead couple's young daughter forms an attachment to her mother's vibrator and goes everywhere with it. The parents are as imbecilic as the Greeks. At one point, the sorority launches an artillery barrage of bloody tampons at the house inhabited by the thirtysomething married couple. A couple of days ago before I saw "Neighbors 2," I watched "Neighbors" on DVD for the first time. I split my sides laughing at all its subversive shenanigans. The "Neighbors" movies revived memories of "National Lampoon's Animal House." Fans of the first "Neighbors" should relish the sequel, but the producers have broadened the demographics with the sequel to empower women. Furthermore, Stoller's riotous sequel succeeds because he has made few changes to the surefire farcical formula that coined "Neighbors" $270 million globally back in 2014. Some things, however, have changed in "Neighbors 2," but most of the original cast return for cameos, including Officer Watkins (Hannibal Buress) the traffic cop. Aside from the "Neighbors'" alums, Selena Gomez and Kelsey Grammar appear in bit cameos. Gomez plays a sorority president, while Grammar is the father of the heroine. Like the original movie, the plot is simple, shallow, and swiftly paced, but with a better ending. Although all six scenarists are guys, they have made the women appear more sympathetic than slutty. The estrogen-driven plot positions these female-friendly characters in the forefront of the action, something that "Neighbors" never had. Basically, the loutish Delta Psi fraternity constituted the bad guys in "Neighbors," while the Kappa Nu girls appear far less antagonistic. Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz of "Carrie"), Beth (Kiersey Clemons of "Dope"), and Nora (Beanie Feldstein of "Fan Girl") are college freshmen. They attend a sorority rush party. Audacious Shelby fires up a joint. Phi Lambda President Madison (Selena Gomez of "Spring Breakers") reprimands our heroine and stipulates that their sorority tolerates neither alcohol nor drugs. Worse, Shelby learns the Greek sisters aren't allowed to throw parties. The trio make tracks and form their own off-campus sorority so they can party as they please. Predictably, since it is the sequel, they buy the house that the Delta Psi brothers once occupied, much to Mac and Kelly's chagrin.Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne encore as the foolish, parenting-impaired, married couple. Miraculously, Mac Radner (Seth Rogen of "Knocked Up") and his wife Kelly (Rose Byrne of "Bridesmaids"), survived the escapades of the Delta Psi fraternity. They have a second child on the way, and they plan to leave the neighborhood. Just when everything appears promising for the sale of their house, the Kappa Nu sorority shows up. Mac and Kelly have sold their starter home to an interracial couple with an infant child. However, the Radners' real estate agent, Wendy (Liz Cackowski of "The Watch"), reminds them that the buyers have a 30-day escrow period to ponder their purchase. When Mac and Kelly discover that Shelby and company have bought the house next door, they cringe at the prospect of what will occur if the new buyers drop by at a bad time. Worse, they encounter an old adversary.Adonis-chiseled Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron) returns along with some of his former Delta Psi Beta brothers, but things have changed with them, too. You may recall from watching "Neighbors" that Teddy Sanders was the Delta Psi president and his closest friend Pete (Dave Franco of "Superbad") was vice-president. After the debacle in "Neighbors," Pete graduated and got a good job, while poor Teddy became a bare-chested model for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. Unfortunately, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch has decided they no longer need a shirtless model. Not long afterward, Teddy learns that Pete plans to marry, but Pete isn't going to wed a woman. Instead, he decides to marry another ex-frat, Darren (John Early), and they ask Teddy to vacate the premises! Teddy goes to the place of last refuge--the house next door to the Radners. He happens to be around when shady Kappa Nu real estate agent Oliver Studebaker (Billy Eichner of "What Happens in Vegas") sells Shelby and her friends the house. These gals don't have a clue about how to finance the house, much less recruit sorority members, but Teddy has all the answers. Moreover, Teddy sees this as a way to pay back the Radners. When Mac and Kelly meet him again with Shelby and company, they know that their dreams are swirling the drain. If you remember anything about "Neighbors," you may recall it opened with Mac and Kelly getting intimate in a chair. Mac got flustered because their infant daughter Stella was eyeballed them innocently during the sex act. Similarly, "Neighbors 2" begins with Mac and Kelly at it again, but Kelly has a bout of morning sickness and barfs on Mac. Remember, "Neighbors" and "Neighbors 2" qualify as lowest common denominator comedies that thrive on offensive, gross-out gags galore. Not-surprisingly, Zac Efron has a difficult time wearing his shirt. Stoller and his writers exploit Teddy's bare-chested antics to propel the plot forward, especially during a zany marijuana heist scene. As improbable as the "Neighbors" movies are, I find the premise credible. One of my close friends experienced a similar predicament. They went through what the thirtysomething married couple dealt with in "Neighbors" after a bawdy college fraternity brought the house next door and complicated their lives. Apart from its outrageous humor, "Neighbors 2" not only serves to empower women, but it also refuses to ridicule gays. Anybody who loved the original "Neighbors" will laugh their butts off at the randy sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expected good but disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a huge success of Neighbors, it was very exciting for its sequel and the good thing was that the starcast returned to their original cast alongwith Chloe Grace Moretz. However my hopes got vanished after watching the movie. The movie was full of mediocre craps and jokes were not so laughable as we enjoyed in the first one. The plot was unlikely insane. Ut was like watching a porn comedy. The first half was though decent and then the movie losses its way through the 2nd half. The story was same as the predecessor however it didn't live upto the expectations. There were moments of good laugh but few good lines couldn't save 92 minutes comedy. I rate it 5/10 as more was expected from the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, but forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Bad Neighbours was a fantastic comedy film, with great moments of laughter, with a memorable plot and story, Bad Neighbours 2 however falls flat on this. This is a good film, with some good moments of laughter, and the chemistry between Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne if very believable, making them the most real couple I have seen in a comedy film in years. But this does not save the film from the predictable plot line, and the film's message.My biggest complaints about this film, is that unlike the first one, this seems directed towards teens. It feels like a high-school movie, while the first felt like an adult comedy film. This film is also a feminist feast, the main female leads in this film, almost constantly bash the male ones, it is quite sexist.There are also high profile celebrities in this film, and they are given less than a couple minuets of screen-time. There are wasted potential here, and the film is also very fast paced.Other than those, this film is not bad. It is funny and a good sequel, and Zac Efron continues surprise me with his acting. Chloe Mortez is also good here, but shies from her other performances. Even though the film has its bad points, it is still good entertainment, but don't expect to have your belly ache with laughter as much as the first one, but it is one of the better comedy sequels that have come out in the recent years.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Bad I Could Hardly Wait Until it was Over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neighbors 2 is nothing more than a remake of Neighbors, set in a middle class residential area where only one family is disturbed by a wild sorority locating next door, where there are no zoning and noise laws, no cops to keep the peace, allowing vandalism, mayhem and open drug use. Poetic license and suspending disbelief goes to absurd extremes in this flick.While I loved films such as Pineapple Express for the wacky adult humor,this turkey might appeal the a pre teen's mentality if it wasn't loaded with profanities and sexual crudeness.I find it hard to fathom why a guy like Seth Rogen, who helped write the script, as well as starring, couldn't come up with something that had a tiny bit of believability. Admittedly there were a few laughs,but far between. Old time slapstick was funny. This was just stupid and inane. I guess next we may possibly see Neighbors 3...LGBT Rising.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Neighbours 2: Sorority Rising is a good movie with a well written storyline and a terrific comedic cast. As a sequel it manages to stand on its own, telling a fun story that's jam packed with laughs and also having some surprising heart. It continues developing the story of the characters we met in the first movie, such as Mac and Kelly's relationship and Teddy's lack of concern about his future, it wraps up characters arch's which is something you rarely see in comedy sequels that I really appreciated. As for the plot, it does wear thin at times, suffering from being far too similar to its predecessor, as we see Mac and Kelly once again going up against their new neighbours that are troublesome and loud, it hits similar notes far too often and can feel a bit repetitive. Some of the humour is also a lot cruder than the first movie, such as a scene where the sorority throws tampons at the house and a constant obsession to show a baby holding on to a sex toy, which did not make me chuckle, merely recycling a joke that worked once before. While it certainly is not as original as the first, Bad Neighbours 2: Sorority Rising is still a lot of fun and brings in the laughs, worth the watch if you are looking for a good, mindless comedy. Mac and Kelly must once again face off against a group of college students moving in next door as they struggle to sell their home before the arrival of their second child. Best Performance: Chloë Grace Moretz</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first movie, fails to capitalize on the premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I could recommend the movie if you can overlook the political narrative being spun in the story, which I will discuss towards the end. I thought personally that it was a part of the story and parodying the modern notion of feminism, but it seems like it ran with it rather than making fun of it. But it ends up that instead of utilizing all it was working with (especially that the movie builds up the girls to be way worse than the boys in the previous movie), the movie fails to capitalize on this, which sours the ending. I strongly recommend it only if you have a second movie to watch right after it to get the taste of a failed comedic execution of the movie's climax out of your mouth. I will not spoil it though. All I will say is the movie feels like it was rewritten at the last moment to appease the politically correct crowd rather than going for the comedic jugular. It has its funny moments, but I likely would not watch it again. If it wasn't busy shoving a message down my throat, it could have been just as vicious comedically as the first one, which made it a lot more humorous. It went way too soft.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sequel That Shouldn't Have Existed--But I'm Glad It Does</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even Zoolander 2 made more sense than this. No one was asking for a sequel for either film, but at least the Ben Stiller movie was something of a cultural touchpoint; it had more of a chance of giving us a reason to revisit its world. Neighbors, by comparison, didn't even spawn a single catchphrase. In the end, I'm glad they decided to return to the suburb where the first showdown took place between the frat and the "old people." Although this movie doesn't quite match the highs of the first, there were plenty of laugh out loud moments. And most of the rest of the time, I was on the verge. Zac Efron's character is somewhat less important to the narrative this time--you could almost write him out and have pretty much the same story--but I'm glad they used him. His needy, directionless ex-frat king provided a sweetness that balanced well with the more outrageous moments. Dave Franco, as standout in the original, is pushed aside, only showing up for a handful of short scenes. Seth Rogan and Rose Byrne are still a fun couple, but they don't work as hard this time around either. There are less schemes, which has the effect of making the movie feel like it doesn', it quite build to the climax as effectively as the first one did. So what makes up for reductions? Three letters: CGM. ChloGray brings it big time as the female Teddy: halfway shaping her own destiny and halfway clueless. That dichotomy of going from being in control to not knowing what to do made Teddy a more interesting "bro," and it works for her as well. A couple other side characters return for some fun callbacks, as do some airbags--still funny to see people get tossed by airbags. This might be a film that is funnier when you're on the Seth Rogan end of things--i.e., old--but I was totally satisfied. Not only was it not a garbage fire, it was actually fun. For an unnecessary sequel to a lowbrow comedy, that's a nice surprise. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland Sorority Stinker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another weekend, another day in the movies. My assignment this time is a sequel to a movie that brought joy to many and disgust to many others. I'm talking about Neighbors 2, a movie I never expected to be made this soon, if at all. What does this film have to offer? As always I'm happy to offer my opinions and guide your movie choices. Let's get started. The Good ? The movie is what it is ? For women Zac Effron has his shirt off a lot ? For guys, a few shots of sorority babesNeighbors 2 is exactly what you expect from the trailers and doesn't even try to be something else. It's a stoner comedy that plays on the simplistic, superficial jokes that seem to be in every comedy these days. Drug humor, sexual humor, and party humor are jammed into this film like the N word in Django and scarcely deviates from this path. Can't say I was the most entertained by this, but if this is your cup of tea then you will surely enjoy it like my fellow audience members. But if routine comedic gestures are not your cup of tea than the superficial qualities are sure to rope your attention in. Zac Effron leads the charge in this department, once more playing to his limited strengths of body acting. Girls will swoon over the six pack abs, firm butt, and tight shirts that hug him like leotard on a ballet dancer. They banked on this card enough to even give him his own dance scene to help give the females a little more of what they want. Don't worry though guys, there are some scarce shots of gorgeous female characters in their lingerie to get your own salute on. Unfortunately, most of these cute girls are scarce in the film with one or two getting adequate screen time. The Bad ? Lazy writing ? Incredibly Stupid ? Annoying characters ? Some disturbing moments ? Little character growth ? StaleWhile Neighbors 2 doesn't try to be something its not, it doesn't mean it is necessarily good. For one thing the writing is a lazy piece of work with stripped down dialogue and banter that lacks cleverness, wit, and good delivery. Most of the time our characters are spewing expletives intertwined with aggressive sexual comments. Some lines do cross over into the funny zone, but a lot of the rambling is stupid, repetitive and goes nowhere for minutes on end. Maybe the delivery could have saved it, but even this failed as all the actors overacted to a horrible, horrible degree. It wasn't fun for me and as they continued to beat the dead horse the tactic only grew more stale. The only thing that this movie managed to push the envelope on was the disgusting factor. A few moments were a bit too graphic for me, things that won't be leaving my mind anytime soon. I won't ruin the "surprise", but let's just say it has to do with female anatomy. Also the censorship of the trailer was lost in this movie and dropped into curse laden rants that again were too much for me. In terms of the story, I appreciate the continuation and attempt to have our characters grow in the short 90 minute run time. However, they failed to achieve their goals on multiple levels. Remember in the first one how the two main frat boys managed to evolve a little into semi adult guys? Well in this film nothing like that is seen. The girls are all annoying brats who try to talk tough, party hard, and whine about the same stuff repetitively. You would think that Rogan and Byrne's characters would experience some maturing moments to make up the sorority's failure. Wrong again! The "old" couple manages to make some slight strides, but they are rushed, underdeveloped messes that added nothing to the roles. Truth be told? only Zac's character had any development at all and was the only story to semi latch onto. The VerdictNeighbors 2 is okay and certainly fills the role of lackluster summer comedy. Unfortunately the lazy writing, lack of originality, one-dimensional annoying characters, and stale comedy left me bored more than anything. Chances are that die hard fans of the series will flock to the theaters to see this, or maybe those who want someone good looking to fill your vision you might choose this film. However, this reviewer recommends skipping this film and waiting for it to spring into DVD collections. My scores are:Comedy: 6.0 Movie Overall: 4.5-5.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average fare best for the small screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't see the first one until last night, being a recent addition on Netflix so it's still fairly fresh in my mind. It's the same crew as before having the same feel as the first. It's a true continuation from Delta Psi with little cameos from the comedy circuit. Nicholas Stoller has certainly established himself as quite a daring director possibly flashing off more than what's necessary, like Jason Segel's dong in Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Rose's lactating boobs in the first. This one doesn't pull any punches with tampons and nutsacks flying around. The previous cast is a little watered down to introduce Hit-Girl Chloë Grace Moretz who creates her own controversial sororititty (typo intended.) right next door which jeopardises the family moving plans. Things escalate pretty quickly and the antics just get sillier and sillier losing some of the comedy on the way. Can you really set up a stall and sell weed at a festival? Let alone stitching up neighbouring dealers without repercussions. The new girl gang offer a different angle trying to challenge the stereotypical sorority and fraternity parties which are quite degrading. Keirsey Clemons and Beanie Feldstein make good replacements for Franco and Co. Even though they're still in this film. It's a similar premise from the previous with jokes relating to the first. It has those same outrageous scenes where both parties battle it out and try to get one up on each other. Rogan and Bryne provide plenty of comedy and Efron returns, jumping sides whilst having an identity quarter life crisis. There does seem to be a couple of underlining messages underneath all the unbelievable scams and pranks. Parenting and feminism which I think gives the film purpose but kinda grinds out the comedy. Enjoyable for fans of the first but can't see this gaining a new fan base. It's no way as funny as the first or as much as it should be. The poster deserves a mention, being a parody of Civil War. #rushkappanuRunning Time: 6 The Cast: 6 Performance: 5 Direction: 5 Story: 5 Script: 5 Creativity: 6 Soundtrack: 7 Job Description: 4 The Extra Bonus Points: 6 for the awesome twin toddlers that were babies from the first playing Stella, Elise and Zoey Vargas. 49% 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildly entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the first Bad Neighbours made a whopping $250m at the worldwide box office working from a measly $18m budget, this sequel, despite being completely unnecessary, was a deadest certainty. We should be thankful then, especially considering it was rushed into production, that it's not a complete mess. In fact, it's possibly better than the original, for what that faint praise is worth. This time around new(ish) parents Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne want to sell their house, but wouldn't you know, a party-loving sorority moves in next door just as they're trying to impress buyers. Delete fraternity, insert sorority, leave the rest. The large screen writing team (including frequent collaborators Rogen and Evan Goldberg) cobble together a swathe of gags in their pursuit of quantity over quality, but for every giggle-worthy joke there's a forehead-slapping dud. A garage escape sequence and a weed stealing set piece offer cheap laughs whilst Rogen's and Byrne's foul-mouthed interplay is largely amusing, but virtually all of the humour stemming from the sorority side of the house is yawn-inducing. The inconsistent tone proves to be another side effect of the hastily constructed script, with multiple half-baked themes ? sexism, feminine independence, parenting, growing up ? all strangely undercut in one way or another. Rogen and Byrne share a solid enough chemistry and Zac Efron proves yet again he's game to mock his own real-life celebrity status for laughs, however Chloe Grace Moretz is embarrassingly bad as the sorority's leader. A lazy, gender-swapped carbon copy of its predecessor, Bad Neighbours 2 is entirely unmemorable yet somehow manages to scrape together enough funny moments to be a mildly entertaining diversion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hypocritically sexist and #preachy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>a heaping pile of misandrous sh*t. completely sjw and liberal feminism strong throughout ruins the movie and any comedic value. The characters crack jokes at men and continually act derogatory (which is fine in some cases) but whilst preaching feminism and equality for women destroys any comedic value into a movie which is about man hating and emphasising liberal rhetoric rather than a movie that should be about fun, parties and pranks. The male characters are either stupid or hot, the women, attempt empowerment in dressing sexy is supposed to be satirical feminist humour whilst zac efron dancing topless is supposed to be a distraction to the feminist members of the sorority. Its a joke, i don't care if you hate on men, but hate on everyone. Thats what satire is all about! By simply shoving criticism on the male characters whilst preaching about equality simply irritates me, and im sure other viewers who would rather enjoy the film than be preached about stupid feminist propaganda.</fullReview>

And then let's re-use that joke over and over.? You need a few main characters. The black one, the fat one and the rebellious one. Then proceed to re-use a joke where they fat one or the black one are excluded.? Make your film seem up to date. Make sure you have ample homosexuality. I'm not against this but it annoys me when media just has way more homosexual themes then you'd see in real life.? Did I mention drugs and sex? ? Good lawd! The acting was so bad. I felt uncomfortable because you could feel how awkward the acting was for the girls esp. the scenes at the start with Moretz. ? The scene where they steal the weed was very badly edited. They had created all the sound in post production and it was blindingly obvious. The footsteps weren't even in sync. Amateur short movies on YouTube had better editing.? Drugs. I'm not overstating this. This film is about drugs.There is a scene where a group of 50 girls strip Seth Rogan's clothes of him until he's almost naked. They then proceed to surround the car. I wondered how this would be received if the gender roles were reversed.Save your sanity. Don't watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising proves that not matter what gender you are, you have an equal chance to feel repeated and tired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a guy who didn't join a fraternity, my knowledge of rules for the Greek system is not that good. So while I don't know if the issues presented in Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising are totally sound, I can understand wanting something unfair to change. A lot of these issues, along with some questionable ideals from history and religion, may be put on paper to enforce a current standing, but they never consider what time will bring. The group in question is women.I'm not the type to go out and protest an ideal I believe in, but I can say that I'm in full support of women's rights and that their fully capable of being in the same position men are in. I had no idea that gender gap pay was still going on. Worse is when you hear about harassment, something that I've never seen. A lot of that stems from my upbringing, which kept in line that women are just as equal to men. All my jobs have paid women the same as men and with the way the election is turning out, we may have a woman president in the White House. Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising attempts a feminist standing that women can be as party crazy as fraternities are. A couple of years after the original Neighbors, Mac (played by Seth Rogen) and Kelly (played by Rose Byrne) Radnar are about to have their second child and are trying to sell their house so that they can move to a more family friendly neighborhood. Things seem to be going well as they get another couple interested in buying, but the house is under escrow for thirty days. What could go wrong.Coincidentally, college freshman Shelby (played by Chloe Grace Moretz) is trying to join a sorority, but is told from several people that smoking pot is not allowed and that sororities are not allowed to have parties (supposedly, only fraternities can). The parties that Shelby attends are disgustingly sexist and only seem to serve to objectify women. When she meets two other stressed freshmen Beth and Nora, they decide to start their own sorority to defy the current rules. They manage to rent a house, which turns out to be next door to the Radnars. Startled that they could lose the sell, the Radnars call for help from Teddy Sanders (played by Zac Efron) who is struggling to find work due to his actions from the previous movie. Will the women get what their standing for?The original Neighbors wasn't perfect, but it was a fun little comedy that did most things well with their setup. The second time around recycles the same premise with an attempt to be more progressive and even poke fun at how this could happen again. The problem is that they ARE doing the same thing again. We get the prank jokes, old people jokes, college people jokes that we already saw in the original. To be fair, they do update how current college students behave (I did laugh at a joke involving a text meeting), but the overall subtext doesn't really lead anywhere.What I mean by this is that the majority of the story feels lazy. They address plenty of issues (the girls right to party, the Radners being bad parents, Teddy's broken record), but their resolved with too quickly or are even barley finished. It felt like that the movie was being written as it was being made. My other problem is that rather then genuinely caring about women's rights, the movie merely says so without giving us much reason to back them. Is it really so hard for girls to party that they can't take their antics outside the college?I'll give this four sorority Greek letters out of five. Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising had a few funny moments (most of them coming from Zac Efron whose on a comedic high), but it can't save itself from a lazy hangover of recycled jokes and a premise that's merely on repeat. You can change the gender, race, and anything, but the movie has an equal chance to not be funny. I'll stick with the original Neighbors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bit Repetitive, But No Shortage of Gut Busting Laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Neighbors film was a pleasant surprise. It was a prototypical Seth Rogen film with gut punching laughs but ultimately a forgettable story. But I welcomed a sequel with a gender switch on the antagonists, and for the most part, it works well. Neighbors 2 has more laugh out loud moments than the original, all while underlining the comedy with a more relatable and grounded story amidst the craziness.There's something about Seth Rogen's comedy that always sits with me well. I honestly don't remember the last film he did that I flat out didn't like. Heck the guy even proved his dramatic chops with a brilliant turn in Steve Jobs last fall. The Neighbors series is right up his alley as it gives him an opportunity to play with all of his over-the-top humor he's a force with, while playing a relatively grounded character with real issues; a husband to Rose Byrne and a soon to be father to two daughters.Rogen and Byrne proved to have great chemistry the first time around, and Neighbors 2 is no different. A lot of the same character beats from the first film occur here, but the two of them do a good job at keeping the jokes fresh this go-around. Joining them once again was Zac Efron, who gets a bit more drama than comedy this time, but he certainly has some memorable comedic moments as well. It's hard to find a comedy duo that works well enough that warrants more sequels or repeated viewings, but Efron and Rogen have proved themselves to be a team to be reckoned with. Although, who isn't Rogen great with?As a whole, I never felt as engrossed into the sorority girls of Kappa Nu as I was the frat bros of Delta Psi. Perhaps it was the outrageousness of the ladder that appealed to me in the original film. With that said, the writers approached the sorority appropriately in that they implanted some feminist themes into the story without it overbearing the gross out and over-the-top comedy. I got the message without it being forced down my throat, so I can appreciate that.Sure, the story is a bit derivative, but it certainly doesn't an overwhelmingly feeling of being repetitive. It wasn't a necessary sequel, but the Neighbors series is one that you can just enjoy for what it is, a raunchy comedy with smart writing and well-placed ideas amidst plenty of insane moments.+Rogen and Byrne+Nice place to take the side characters+Outrageous comedy with some nice dramatic beats trickled in-Never felt that attached to Kappa Nu7.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seth Rogan and Zac Efron are so hilarious together! They compliment each other's comedy so well. Zac Efron went from being the pretty boy from High School musical, to a truly funny actor who is enjoyable to watch. His character in the movie is of course arrogant about his own body but somehow caring and genuine at the same time so it's easy to connect to the character. The move was a ton of fun to watch, though I will say that I did enjoy the first movie more than this one. I thought the first one was hilarious in every single scene. This one was hilarious in most of the scenes. Go see it you'll love watching this funny movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An energetic sequel with sisterhood &amp; bromance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad Neighbours 2 is directed by Nicholas Stoller and stars Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne, Zac Efron &amp; Chloë Grace Moretz. Following on from the events in the first movie, Mac and Kelly are now in the midst of having another baby. All is well, the house is up for sale and the buyers seem very interested. After confusion, Mac &amp; Kelly realise that their house is now in an escrow payment period. Meaning the buyers are liable to drop in anytime to inspect the house for any problems or issues with the neighbourhood. This seems easy for now, until they meet their new neighbours...First of all, I love Seth Rogen. I think he's a very funny and talented man. I can always be sure to have a good time watching his movies, and this is no different. Bad Neighbours 2 (or Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising) is a fun sequel which will most likely live up to your expectations. That is, as long as you are not too hopeful in this being better than the first. It's no better nor worse, just a steady continuation of a pretty simple story with a few laugh-out-loud moments, with other sections of underwhelming delivery. Seth is just as great as he is in all of his other movies. Chloë Moretz is pretty decent here, though I felt she never really got many chances to shine in terms of comedy. I love Moretz, she's rising fast, nabbing many roles and I believe she's only going to become bigger as her experience in film thickens. Zac Efron is brilliant alongside Seth, they have really great chemistry which is something we didn't get to see in the first movie. Rose Byrne is the one in the spotlight here. Just like the first movie, she delivers lines with absolute ease and definitely had me laughing louder than the rest. Perfect.There were a few moments where I thought the lines could have been delivered better by some of the cast members, but this is purely because I love fast-paced, back-and-forth humour. However, the script needed some tightening to round off the overkill and sharpen the comedy. In terms of the story, it's essentially the same as the predecessor (new neighbours, they cause problems, now they must fight for peace) but it seems the writers wanted to add some meaning or 'moral' to this instalment. You can definitely notice this when you're watching but it's nothing too distracting or cheesy. Of course there are parties, airbags, a creepy clown, and a whole lot of craziness crammed into this sequel, but it's ultimately just as good as the first.If you're expecting too much, you probably won't find this to be much fun. But if you're familiar with Seth and the kind of humour he delivers then you'll be pleased nonetheless.My verdict; Bad Neighbours 2 isn't a classic comedy hit, but it's also nowhere near as unworthy of the 'comedy' genre like some of the movies that have released in the past couple years. If you have nothing else to do, go out and see this movie. The least you'll do is chuckle, which is better than nothing. Seth, Rose and Zac are worth the admission price alone. Bad Neighbours 2, 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hashtagFeminism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising (the latter part sounds like an unintentional Kenneth Anger reference maybe, but nevermind), we get the "girl" version that sounds like a cynical cash grab when you first see the trailer: now that Efron and Franco are out of the house, now it's time for the girls, right? It's more complicated than that, believe it or not, as this movie has a somewhat (not totally, just somewhat) serious context underneath: feminism, sexism, and equality between those who like to PARTY! (in caps) So you get Chloe Grace Moretz as the perennial just-wanna-smoke-weed-and-dance-et-al party girl who won't be in a regular sorority since it's against the rules to be partying down - there's the *fraternities* for that for the sorority girls, and they're populated by all the terrible (but probably true mostly) stereotypes of misogynistic party animals. So she and a few girls on the outside of things make up their own sorority - Kappa Nu - at the same house right next door to Rogen and Byrne as they're trying to sell their house. Good luck with all of that! In some ways this is very similar to the last Neighbors but not at the same time. In this movie what makes it stand out a little is that it's a combination of feminist message movie - which gets obscured, and for this kind of movie not unexpectedly so, by the rampant partying and revenge-hijinks that ensue between Kappa Nu and the Rogen/Byrne/etc group of "old people - and the Man-Child-Has-to-Grow-Up dynamic. That's not exactly new when looking at Rogen and companies films, but I liked that this time by having it focus on a guy who was on top before and that we've seen be in control of his party-animal element (Efron's character), it adds some resonance to what it means to have to move on from that while still being true to oneself. Efron sells it all the way too in a performance that's a winning combination of comedy and, dare I say, pathos. Party on, existential quandaries! The key question to get to is this: is it *better* than the 1st film? No, not quite, and it starts to get a little exhausting in the last 15 minutes (you can only take so much of the machine-gun-fire improv everyone does). But the laughs you do get are so big, and the messages about equal rights for women (even if it IS about partying), and the usual but always potent and fun message for the guys about growing up, here Zac Efron is really the central character here, if there is one, make it a very fun ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A so-so comedy sequel that fails to bring the big laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2014's Bad Neighbors was a pleasant enough comedic diversion that won extra credits thanks to its winning cast and fair share of laugh out loud jokes and while its wasn't exactly a film that screamed out for a sequel here in 2016 here we are with Bad Neighbors 2 aka Sorority Rising.Returning with his cast is director Nicholas Stoller and along with his actors it's safe to say his a filmmaker on autopilot, going through the motions in a familiar set up of parents Mac and Kelly Radner (once again played by Seth Rogen and Aussie Rose Byrne) versing a group of rowdy college kids next door, except this time it's not a bunch of women hungry dudes led by Zac Efron and Dave Franco, but rather a bunch of money hungry girls led by Chloe Grace Moretz's Shelby who just wants to be in a sisterhood that will last a life time.In many ways subverting what we've come to expect from these type of films, Stoller is clearly trying to fit in today's climate and say to us all that hey "women want to have fun to" and it's an interesting ploy but one that doesn't feel overly authentic and as these sisters go about their business of selling weed to pay for rent and stealing peoples furniture you can't help but feel a little awkward and the agenda pushing by this comedy; whilst a nice change of pace in some ways, is also not enough to save a film that's biggest problem is the fact it just doesn't have enough big laughs to sustain its almost play by play repeat of the first film.Sorority Rising actually has a large portion of out and out stinkers when it comes to the jokes department, running gags about minions and a particular "toy" Mac and Kelly's child Stella keeps playing with are continually brought up but never eventuate into laughs and the banter between Rogen and Byrne isn't as good as the first film. The film finds some redemption though in its side players like the returning Zac Efron once more playing the same comedy role we've come to expect from the "jock" persona he does and The Mindy Project's Ike Barinholtz steals many of the films best moments with role as the thankless Jimmy.A totally throwaway comedy that won't win many new fans from those that disliked the original, Sorority Rising try's its best to do something different with its 'sisterhood' infused play on the partying college kids staple but overall this is a tale that doesn't need any political or feminist messages and gets by on a few mildly amusing gags that will be quickly forgotten about once the cinema lights turn back on and those doors swing open.2 ? chunks of meat out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie surprised me because I went in expecting a comedy and came out with much more. The movie focused more on telling a good story than making us laugh. The story was excellent and the character development is great. You grow very attached to the characters and it's really fun to see them evolve. This isn't called a comedy for no reason though. There are a lot of jokes and most of them succeed. There are many funny jokes and it's not like Grown Ups 2 (a dumbed down sequel). Some scenes are rather intense which is also a refreshing change for a comedy. The way the comedy, intensity and story are woven together is great. Unfortunately a few jokes fall flat and at the beginning you don't care much for the sorority. The ending was rather surprising because contrary to what I was expecting it ended well. Everything was well in the end which was very surprising. The movie passes many messages like: finding out who you are, being yourself and feminism. All these messages are tied in with the character development very well. The acting is quite good for the most part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neighbors 2 was sadly disappointing. Instead of being a funny, creative, and enjoyable film like the first, Neighbors 2 aimed at pushing the liberal agenda down America's throats. I would like to preface this review, by stating that I obviously support and encourage women equality in our society and am very open to the gay community and inclusion for any minority. In fact, I really think most American citizens are. But not everything has to be about that. What happened to just watching normal funny movies without a steam lined political agenda. (Spoiler Alert) Dave Franco in Neighbors 2 is gay and gets married to his lover. Garfield is Bicurious. Why?? They are so clearly straight in neighbors, why did they have to totally twist the characters just to push a political message. The entire film is about how men and adults are controlling and are sexual pigs, and how women need to empower themselves and stick together. I am all for woman respecting themselves and feeling empowered but it is not a battle against men and its not a battle against adults. Men aren't pigs. Sure the movie still had its humorous moments, but for me the movie was just a political push from the liberal left, and it it honestly really ruined it for me. Seth Rogen, I expected better from you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll give this a 6/10 because it's still a solid high budget comedy starring some great talent. The issue was too many jokes fell flat. The sorority sisters did not say or do anything I can remember laughing at. The material was really weak. I love absurd random humor (Family Guy or basically any other Seth Rogen film), but some of the randomness in this film just lacked anything I found funny. Even worse, is that some of the randomness used in plot points really made you disconnected from the entire film and not care. As I watched this film, I remembered how despite the shallow plot of Neighbors, I still loved it and it pulled me in. The fraternity was interesting and funny. In contrast, the sorority of Neighbors 2 lacked any good jokes. The sorority sisters actually managed to pull off something that no actors have ever done in all of history. They were so unfunny, they almost made Seth Rogen not funny. On the plus side, It's only 90 minutes and I don't remember ever feeling bored or sleepy during the movie or wanting to walk out early. So for that this movie has earned a solid 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some funny moments, but nowhere near as good as the first film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the success of Bad Neighbours, which grossed $270 million worldwide on just an $18 million budget, a sequel was something of an inevitability. When a film performs so well at the box office and is also as entertaining as Bad Neighbours managed to be the only question would be could the cast and crew create a sequel of superior or equal quality?We re-join Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne), pregnant with their second child, a couple of years after the events of the first film. They have just agreed a deal to sell their house, under the obligation that the new buyers have a 30 day period to back out of the purchase should anything go array. At the same time Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz) and a group of her friends move into the house next door to form a hard-partying sorority, Kappa Nu. Things are complicated further when Teddy (Zac Efron), leader of the fraternity from the first film, returns to assist Shelby in forming a successful sorority as retribution for his past grievances with Mac and Kelly.Whilst it is pleasant to see a film attempt to challenge the male- centric domination of certain establishments across the educational system, it is repeatedly brought up that fraternities are allowed to host parties whilst sororities cannot, the attempts to highlight sexism and prejudices within the collegial system are undermined by the limited scope of the movie. Bad Neighbours 2 can't help but feel like a re-tread of the first film, only this time attempting to highlight certain unfair and unwarranted treatment that women can still face. This isn't a negative but there isn't enough new material to keep the action fresh. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne are a pair of the most charming actors working today and I wish Byrne had been given more content with which to showcase her talents. As much as I enjoy Rogen's energetic displays one of my favourite aspects of the first film was Byrne's performance and I felt that with so many different characters now in the sequel she was given the short end of the stick whilst others got a more prominent focus. Zac Efron had something of a breakout role with the first film, establishing himself as a talented comedic actor, this time round having seen what he can do his performance is a little bit underwhelming though it may be that the material he is working with is somewhat limited. Whist the previous film felt very fluid this sequel feels like a series of sequences that were written first, with a connecting line constructed as an afterthought. The two writers from the previous feature (Andrew J. Cohen &amp; Brendan O'Brien) are again credited, but with three other writers also receiving credit (Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg &amp; director Nicholas Stoller) which may explain the sense of in-coordination the movie has at times. The newcomers of the sorority are somewhat of a mixed bag humour wise. Moretz doesn't really get much comedic material with her actions carrying the drama of the film, her constant battle to maintain a sorority without having to resort to conforming to male expectancy of what a sorority should be is admirable, but It would have been nice for her to have a few more comic moments that maybe defined her character a little more beyond her battle for individualism. After all is said Bad Neighbours 2 has a few funny gags, and some charming characters, but is not as entertaining or prolific as its predecessor. As a passable 90 minute romp you could do worse, or if you haven't seen the first Bad Neighbours just watch that instead as it's a lot funnier.

Mr. Rogen, like me, looks too young to have first hand memories of the Holocaust (which he thinks is a joking matter). But apparently Seth attended some Rich People school where any History taught was all Sweetness and Light. Here's a Holocaust 101 Primer for Mr. Rogen and all the young SORORITY viewers in the same boat as him. In the mid-1900s, a failed artist named Adolph Hitler trumped up something called World War Two in order to implement his Final Solution of killing ALL the World's Jews, because he felt that one of them had wronged his family decades earlier. (For an analogous situation closer to home, an American dude named Marion Mitchell Morrison deemed himself abused by a smarter-than-average Gay Liberal Union guy, so he renamed himself "John Wayne," recruited some fellow bullied boys including Ronnie Reagan, and began the systematic liquidation of ALL Americans who are Smart OR Gay OR Liberal OR Union, which will culminate with the election of Fuhrer Trump this Fall.) Hitler only managed to burn HALF the World's Jews in ovens before American Heroes forced him to shoot himself in the mouth. Many of the Jewish survivors from Hitler's Death Camps are starving Today in Israel, since the Government there faults them for surviving but not preventing their fellow Jews from being killed. I've seen no indication to date that Holocaust Jokemaster Rogen has contributed as much as ONE DIME of his Great Wealth toward the butt of his "humor's" relief in Israel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadness Overlaying The Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this a bit more than I anticipated I would. I"m not a fan of Rogen doper movies but this was a bit different. It's another war movie played to a female theme of slyness and trickery as a family led by Rogen and Byrne try to chase a newly formed sorority from the house next door. If they fail to, then they'll not be able to sell their house which is now a crisis since they bought another house already. The overall Laurel and Hardy sort of hit and be hit routines are fairly clever. There are a few laugh evoking visuals and also a few good one liners, but most of the movie is made up of this feminine sort of warfare between the main factions and they allies. I suppose this is a movie created for the under 20's, but I"m over 30 and as such I mourned the lack of masculinity in any character. They are all for calling each other 'bros', hugging each other and anxious for other men's emotional support. There isn't a milligram of testosterone among any of them. Two of the women have babies and I wondered who the dads could be. They surely weren't any of the cast members. So for me and maybe other over 30's, it's a bitter movie. Funny superficially but with a good deal of underlying sadness at how miserable a society we've become.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Neighbors (is this becoming the next 20-movie franchise?) caught me by surprise as a genuinely funny, goofy, and irreverent stick in the eye of bro culture. The sequel promised to be a feminist jab at the good-life-decision-making Burberry Buffys and Prada Princesses, even pro-gay, but all we get is a lukewarm slapstick that forgets the slap and the stick.Who can blame our female heroes for hating on the group mentality in the Greek system that often emphasizes booze, drugs, and treating women as nothing more than a sexual conquest. But with Girl Power, you can start a thoughtful sorority and stick it to The Man. Girl Power consists of: the the Cute Sincere Blonde with Leadership Moxie Yet Self-Doubting; the Pudgy One with a Heart of Gold; the Sassy Crazy Asian; and the Non-threatening, Non-thuggish Pretty Black Woman. They learn quickly, though, that bucking the system means money, five buckets of money, each month, forever and forever, until you get kicked out or die.Maybe that's the real lesson here, because this is surely no great feminist screed, no great pro-gay challenge to macho bros. No, the real lesson is that poor people eat dirt and they better play the game by the rules.Comedies should be funny. Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising wants to send a message so badly it hurts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minor Twist On The First Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Neighbors 2:Sorority Rising", starring Seth Rogen-Steve Jobs, Donnie Darko; Rose Byrne-the Insidious movies, 28 Weeks Later; Zac Efron-Dirty Grandpa, The Paperboy and Chloe Grace Moretz-The 5th Wave, The Amityville Horror_2005.This is the sequel to the 2014 movie in which Seth and Rose play a married couple that had a fraternity move in next door to them and cause havoc. This one is about Seth and Rose having a sorority move in next door to them and causing havoc. I know, not too original but I guess if you liked the first one, then you will probably like this one. It's not a bad movie, just not much new. Seth and Rose are about to have their second child so they need to sell their house and get a bigger one. They get a buyer lined up but they are told that there is an escrow that gives the buyers 30 days to change their minds. That is when Chloe and her friends move in next door and start throwing the aforementioned havoc. Zac returns and starts working with Chloe at first but is soon fired-he is a guy, of course, and the girls want to be independent-and he switches to Seth and Rose's team. Not much else new here but like I said, if you liked the first one.... It's rated "R" for language, drug use and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 32 minutes. I don't think I would buy this one on DVD-the first one covered the bases, pretty much-but it would be alright, as a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've read most of my reviews, you'll know that I set the bar very high for comedies. That's why I pan most of them. Also, if you've read most of my write-ups you'll know that I'm not a huge fan of sequels. Again that's why I pan them as well. With Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising, I was hoping all of this would change. Fat chance on that. "Rising's" just not as funny as the original Neighbors. In fact, the only way you could find it funny is if you've never seen the first film, never viewed "Rising's" red band trailer (which includes all the humorous scenes and other guffawed sequences that were left on the cutting room floor), or never took in a gross-out flick in your entire lifetime (I'd say that's a pretty low demographic). What Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising does is make you feel nostalgic for the first Neighbors installment and that was only two years ago. What a pity.Now in "Rising's" defense, it does bring back all of its likable cast members (Seth Rogen, Zac Efron, Rose Byrne, Dave Franco, etc.). It also creates a decent segway from what transpired in 2014. Lastly, there are in jest, a couple of real laugh-out-loud moments. Bottom line though: Director Nicholas Stoller's execution is not as thought-out this time around, the character development in "Rising" is a little weaker, the actors saddled with a thinner script, don't really bringing their A game (especially Ike Barinholtz as the goofy Jimmy), and the whole feel of the flick is less than over the top (despite some truly vulgar moments). Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising huh. "Neighbors 2: Sorority Dipping" is more like it.Filmed almost entirely in Atlanta, GA (of course), containing a cameo featuring Kelsey Grammar (really?), referencing 420 (a mainstay), rehashing the in-joke of airbags, and giving a ton of screen time to Zac Efron's abs (was there ever any doubt it would happen?), Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising kinda picks up where the original left off (2-3 years later I'm thinking). The house that the Radner's (played by Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne) so vehemently wanted to keep is now up for sale. They want to move to the suburbs but need to wait thirty days because said house is being subjected to a 30-day escrow. Here's the problem: A sorority headed by Kappa Nu leader Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz), has moved in next door. They party hard and make a sh*t ton of noise. Plus, they are more boisterous and stubbornly than the dudes from the Delta Psi fraternity circa '14. Regardless, what we have here is the same premise as the original only now it's gender-reversed. With the help of lost boy Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron), the Radner's are hellbent on getting rid of Kappa Nu. This way they can close the deal on their old home and move on to greener pastures (Byrne's character is having another child so they need larger digs).In "Rising", the ending does provide a patronizing, moral center. But hey, look for a scene where the young college girls throw their bloody tampons at Rogen's character's window (and even at his face, yuk). Also, look for sequences involving visible, fake testicles hanging out (double yuk), a baby's hand sticking out of a woman's womb (triple yuk), and Rose Byrne's Kelly vomiting towards her husband's face (during sex, quadruple yuk). It's all showy and gaudy but not totally funny and way too familiar.In conclusion, I saw 2014's Neighbors twice at the theater. I still laughed three times as much the first time compared to viewing Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising just 4 hours ago. That's all that needs to be said. Rating: A mixed two stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Could someone please take the dildos away from those children. Yes that is how I am going to start this review. Bad Neighbours 2 is the not so good sequel to, what I thought was a great comedy, Bad Neighbours.As this is a comedy the number one thing to expect is laughs. Bad Neighbours 2 has a couple smiles and exhale-out-the-nose laughs but nothing really laugh-out-loud hilarious. Its more entertainingly amusing then funny.In classic bash out sequel fashion this film sticks with the same premise but tweaks aspects as to not be completely unoriginal. Instead of Zac Efron (who does start off against Seth Rogan and Rose Byrne), this time its Chloe Grace Moretz leading the party hard YA's therefore tweaking the frat-next-door issue into a sorority-next-door story line. Throw in a second pregnancy and we are good to go.Although clearly originating from a writers google search, the change from boys to girls does open up the door to discussion about the confused understanding and reality of sexism, to which was represented fairly well, but I felt it wasn't used to its full potential, as both comedic satire and a coming-of-age message.Overall, Bad Neighbours 2 is an OK bash out sequel that will have you smiling and exhaling out the nose. Its not the best movie to feature the minions but it is by no means the worst... *shudder* the Minions movie *shudder*.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the original, goofy and decent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the first Neighbors was just a decent comedy film with some good one-liners as Zac Efron and Seth Rogen riffed in clear improv while they battled each other over property. Rose Byrne was the shining star of the original. The sequel puts an interesting twist on the situation adding Chloe Grace Moretz, Kiersey Clemons, and Beanie Feldstein as three young women who set out to set their own sorority that can party next door to the parents.Neighbors 2 is full of funny one-liners and really goofy physical comedy but it never really amounts to much. It only vaguely references the awful state of "greek life" and growing culture of sexism on campus. The movie focuses on making audiences laugh with immature jokes and scenes of characters hurting themselves comically.Rogen and Byrne have just discovered they are going to have their second child and decide to move away from their house in the first movie. Their house gets put in escrow for thirty days and right at the start of that, the girls movie. Moretz doesn't put her best foot forward but has some amusing parts as the wild, pot-smoking freshman who takes charge.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Society is slowly ruining the film industry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was honestly pretty hilarious. The comedy was awesome and the acting was pretty good. I could say this movie had nothing wrong except...APPARENTLY EVERYTHING IS SEXIST. The entire plot is about these girls who think everything is sexist and that's it. I'm so sick and tired of this. People need to actually have a brain and do some research because we don't even live in a sexist society like many others so. This movie could've been a 10/10 for me with comedy but because of the BS in this I'd give it barely a 5. To me it jus completely ruined the entire movie and just...I felt like walking out halfways because of all that. It ruined a perfectly good movie and I just wish the writer or director had a brain to do something about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been years since the first "Bad Neighbours" movie. Question is did they really need a sequel? The plot is pretty simple, after a sorority (lead by Shelly (Chloë Grace Moretz)moves in next door, they decide to get help from their previous enemy Teddy Sanders! I'll get down to the negatives first, because I do like to always leave on a good note. This movie was filled with "sexist" and "double standards" and it's repeated over and over again. For example, there are loads of scene where you hear things like "We better not do that, because they're females. We only do that to men." There's comments like that throughout the entire film. It got old fairly quickly. The film is done exactly like the first one. They use the same jokes, the same ideas as before. I guess, for some it isn't a bad thing, but I personally wanted something new. Shelly (Chloë Grace Moretz's) character was all over the place. One minute she seemed liked this nice, beautiful, well respected girl who just wanted to start a party to feel good, then all of a sudden she turns into this evil, selfish, know it all person who just does not give a damn about anybody. They needed to decide who her character was from the start, not change her around halfway through just for the sake of being a bad neighbour!There are jokes in there that do work as 2 examples of Seth Rogen making a trip to the Sydney Opera House in Australia or Jimmy's clown laugh. Rose Byrne gets into character really well yet again. She provides a few laugh out loud jokes. Zac Efron returns to help the neighbours and, of course to show off his body once again! All in all, there are a lot of good jokes in this movie, but there's also a lot that didn't work and could have been done better! All in all, it's a decent film, but I wouldn't pay to watch it again. 5/10 2/5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary and Manipulative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2014 Judd Apatow and his army of acolytes produced a mid-budget, mid-grade, mid-comedic College Humor sketch, stretched it out to an hour and a half and gave the reins to perennial likable shlub Seth Rogen. The result was Neighbors (2014) an amalgam of low-brow pranks and gags mixed with Gen-X suburban ennui. And guess what, it worked. The film was a mid-level success held together by some tried and true comedic situations and Zac Efron's "look I can be one of the guys too" self-effacement. Then came the sequel; an unnecessary little runt of a movie that would have been forgetful if not for its frustratingly cynical clasping of progressive politics.The film is book-ended by several viral videos meant to prime the audience for this or that. The first such video shows the white veiled ladies of Phi Lambda welcoming their pledges with open arms to their sorority house. Incoming freshman Shelby (Moretz) lights up a joint, apparently comfortable enough around women dressed like their at a cult meeting to do so. She's promptly informed that not only can she not smoke weed in the house but sororities are not allowed to throw parties only frats can. Due to this revelation, Shelby along with new friends Beth (Clemons) and Nora (Feldstein) decide to start their own off-campus sorority and guess what house they move into. That's right the house next door to the Radners (Rogen and Byrne) who just happen to be trying to sell their home.If this movie followed the recipe of the first movie it could have been enjoyed and forgotten like the increasingly meager Revenge of the Nerds (1984-1994) sequels. Yet instead of coming up with contrived but enjoyable comic set-pieces, a gaggle of six writers and probably an entire marketing department decided to add a generous amount of social justice tomfoolery for the sake of haphazardly appealing to the youth. Shelby's Kappa Nu sorority is entirely based on a feminist ideal whose sisterhood not only attracts college girls tired of the college's skivvy frat culture but even attracts wayward graduate Teddy Sanders (Efron).There's no inherent problem with appealing to the new generation's pluralistic attitude towards race, feminism, homosexuality, et al. but if we're really going to go that route you should back it up with...something. Instead what we get are a series of lectures largely coming from Shelby's run-ins with Teddy whose privilege checks stop the humor and the plot dead in its tracks. Are we supposed to laugh at Teddy for never realizing that his old fraternity parties were sexist or are we supposed to laugh at their supposedly clever theme names? What about his relationship with best friend Pete (Franco) and his boyfriend? How about Mac Radner's friend Jimmy (Barinholtz) casually referencing men's rights? With the level of asides explaining what characters should and shouldn't joke about is it any wonder the audience manages a chuckle?It's ironic to think that the first Neighbors had a more progressive tone by comparison. A tone that accepted Rose Byrne's character as more than just the nagging wife but a partner in the original's game of oneupsmanship. In this film however she's relegated to the background due to pregnancy. Thus the only supposedly strong female characters are the sorority girls who dress pledges in Minion costumes, control their finances via buckets of cash and have no idea what a phone cord is.Cloaked in a progressive politics, drenched in social justice buzzwords and completely lacking narrative coherence, Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising is precisely the kind of movie that Hollywood needed to stop making yesterday. It's the kind of movie that not only sucks, it fuels the fire of anti-feminist trolls who see any movie with a purportedly female agenda as inferior. These a**hats need to be proved wrong which can't be done when you attach bold, intelligent themes onto a smoldering trash fire whose only point in its favor is it passed the Bechdel Test.www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So the major problem I saw with the movie, along with some of the dryer scenes, was the plot hole which would pretty much make the entire movie irrelevant. The whole point of the movie was because some girls wanted to party so they started a sorority next to the house of the previous movie. Okay, that seems alright. They did this because apparently it is illegal for sororities to throw parties or something like that. This would be fine to put in the movie if they literally didn't contridict themselves near the middle of the movie with one of the characters saying that it wasn't even illegal for sororities to throw parties. What was the point then? The family could've told the sorority girls that it wasn't illegal and to go back to the other sorority. It doesn't make sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I laughed out loud! It's a sequel that's the exact equal of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never thought I would see a sequel to Neighbors. Let's be honest, most Seth Rogen movies are so similar they all might as well be sequels.But Sorority Rising was a pretty good idea. The first movie was about a frat house moving in next store and to be fair to the new Feminist movement, A Sorority becomes the throne in Seth Rogen's side. Apparently, sororities cannot have parties, so Chloë Grace Moretz (who I love) starts a new one, Kappa Nu that changes that, and out of revenge for the people who he feels ruin his life Teddy (Zac Efron's character) makes sure that the girls get the house right next to Mac and Kelly who are trying to sell it, but when Teddy realizes he's too old to hang out with the young women he switches sides and help Mac and Kelly get these kids out.Though I'm a huge fan of Chloë Grace Moretz, and would love to say that her addiction, as well as the serious message of women being equal to men made this movie better, it did not, but it's not worse than the original movie at least. I sat in the theater and I got a good chuckle cause I like Seth Rogen and I do think Zac Efron is funny (I find it strange too). If you felt the same way about Neighbors than Neighbors 2 will entertain you equally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first but it's alright</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to my viewing of this film, I received a lot of mixed criticisms about 'Neighbors 2'. A lot of which were either "Do not go see it" or "Eh, it was OK" or lame, corny, stupid, etc etc. I prepped myself to be very disappointed in the sequel but after finally seeing it, it was not that bad. I will say that I still enjoy the first one much more over this installment but this one was still funny enough with similar elements of the first. It is the same stupid humor (Not in a negative way) that Seth Rogan delivers with most of his movies and the same drug heavy, over-the-top style. However, 'Neighbors 2' did seem a bit stretched out in regards to the plot to make this one happen. The ladies of Kappa Nu in 'Neighbors 2' did not throw the hilarious blows like Teddy and Delta Psi did in 'Neighbors'. There seemed to be way more one-liners for audiences to love in the first rather than the second. All in all, the sequel brought enough laughs and crazy antics to entertain but just not to a level that the first one did. If you were a fan of the first, I would definitely recommend to check out the sequel just to see our favorite characters of the Radner family and Teddy back again and ultimately see what wild situations they get themselves into for the second go-around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising" raises the stock of the franchise, but sometimes overplays its hand.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Too often when Movie Fans watch a sequel, the best they can hope for is something that equals the enjoyment of seeing the original. This is especially true for comedy sequels, but it isn't always this way. In fact, although they often don't live up to it, comedy sequels may have an even greater potential than sequels in other genres to surpass the quality of their predecessors. When a returning team of writers, producers/director(s) and actors truly understand what made the first film work well ? and have a few new ideas, they can build upon their original work and make an even better movie the second (or third) time around. In this decade alone, I would suggest that is exactly what happened with the "Pitch Perfect", "Dumb and Dumber", "Anchorman", "Grown Ups", and (especially) the "Harold &amp; Kumar" franchises. Then, along comes "Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising" (R, 1:32) to accomplish the same feat.Returning from 2014's "Neighbors" are director Nicholas Stoller, writers Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan O'Brien and stars Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne, Zac Efron, Dave Franco, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Jerrod Carmichael, Ike Barinholtz, Carla Gallo, Hannibal Buress, Brian Huskey, Lisa Kudrow and even the adorable Zoey Vargas and Elise Vargas (but, sadly, no appearance by "The Lonely Island"). For the sequel, the writing team is joined by Stoller, Rogen and Evan Goldberg, while Chloë Grace Moretz, Kiersey Clemons, Beanie Feldstein expand the cast ? and the comic possibilities for the new plot which is just similar enough to the original to be familiar and just original enough to be fresh and entertaining.Picking up a couple years after the original left off, "Neighbors 2" sees Mac and Kelly Radner (Rogen and Byrne) and their daughter, Stella (the Vargas girls) selling their house so they can upgrade, in anticipation or expanding their little family. Having made a deal with another young couple (Sam Richardson and Abbi Jacobson) to buy their home, they enter their 30-day escrow period? even though the Radners don't realize what escrow means. While using the word as a noun, verb, adjective and adverb and with various prefixes/suffixes, Mac and Kelly come to understand that their buyers can pull out of the deal if they discover a problem with the home (or the neighbors) within the next month.Unfortunately for the Radners, a college sorority has just moved in to the house that was occupied by the fraternity Delta Psi Beta in the first film. The sorority is called Kappa Nu and has just been started by three freshmen named Shelby (Moretz), Beth (Clemons) and Nora (Feldstein). This trio of new friends met at a rush orientation for another sorority that didn't suit their awkward, free-spirited personalities. They also have a big problem with the rule against sororities throwing parties and they find fraternity parties demeaning to women, so they decide to do it their way. The sorority is all about big, loud parties, which causes a great deal of alarm for the escrowing folks on the other side of Kappa Nu's driveway.Fortunately for the Radners, they have help as they scheme to get rid of the sorority before Kappa Nu can de-escrow the hell out of Mac and Kelly's house. Terry Sanders (Efron), the former President of Delta Psi Beta and former arch-nemesis of insecure, quiet-appreciating young parents, is going through a bit of a crisis of his own. After a surprising development causes him to move out of the apartment that he was sharing with frat brother and former co-conspirator, Pete Ragazolli (Franco), Terry is kind of adrift in a scary sea of adultness. After a chance meeting, Terry is basically hired by Shelby, Beth and Nora to help them build their new sorority, but after they tire of his presence and reject him for being no fun (!) ? and old (!!), Terry goes next door and offers to help Mac and Terry undo what he done did. With Terry's skills and intense need for purpose and appreciation, plus the help of their friends, Jimmy and Paula (Barinholtz and Gallo), who are now expecting a baby of their own, the Radners and company are all set to go to war with the Kappa Nus. The ensuing shenanigans are wild, funny and entertaining."Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising" improves upon its predecessor, but overplays its hand. One thing that always bothered me about "Neighbors" is that its tit-for-frat schemes came across as more mean-spirited than funny. This time around, the plots and pranks on both sides of the driveway are just as over-the-top, but more humorous. The dialog and the one-upwomanship are clever and often laugh-out-loud funny. The characters are mostly colorful and amusing, but some of the characterizations are overplayed. The girls of Kappa Nu show no signs of the insecurity that they keep complaining has plagued them for years, Efron's character is uncharacteristically insecure and needy, and all of the returning characters seem even dumber than in the original. Some of the jokes involving the Radners' toddler might make even the most open-minded comedy-loving parents in the audience uncomfortable and a couple of the sight gags may make an even higher percentage of Movie Fans want to? gag. In the end, however, the story brings its various conflicts to satisfying resolutions. In spite of its excesses, this sequel has raised the stock of the franchise and many will find these neighbors well worth visiting. "B"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Similar To The First Neighbors But It's Still Really Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked Neighbors, it wasn't my favourite movie that year but I got a lot of laughs out of it and it did some things well. I think the most surprising thing about it was how funny Zac Efron was as Teddy. So when they announced the sequel was about how a sorority was moving in next door, I rolled my eyes. But then after watching the trailers, I came back around and decided to see it as a double feature with The Nice Guys. I don't really have a lot of insightful things to say about it because it is a lot like that first movie but I did like it and it was worth a trip to the theatre to get a chance to see it.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Neighbors 2 starts just like Neighbors did with Mac Radner (Seth Rogen) and Kelly Radner (Rose Byrne) having sex while trying to stay quiet enough not to disturb their daughter. It's not very romantic though and midway through Kelly pukes on Mac and tells him that she might be pregnant.We then see a sorority at the nearby college rushing pledges. Among them is Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz) who looks uncomfortable and decides to spark up a joint in the middle of the introduction speech. She's immediately told to stop and she becomes even less enthusiastic when they explain that sororities aren't allowed to throw parties and that they have to partner with frats. They go to the frat party and see how sexist it is and how it's not so much fun when you're not there just to bang the guys. She meets a couple of girls with similar mindsets Beth (Kiersey Clemons) and Nora (Beanie Feldstein). Instead of just bowing to the system, they decide to form their own sorority where they can make their own rules and appreciate each other instead of just looking to sleep with the frat boys.We then catch up with Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron) who is living with his best friend Pete (Dave Franco). The frat group have gotten together for a poker night and it seems like everyone is doing well minus Teddy, who isn't progressing from his college days. That night Pete's partner proposes to him and he accepts. With them now being engaged, they try to politely ask Teddy to move out. Teddy breaks down and runs away.The next day, the girls are looking at the house beside Mac and Kelly's place but are unable to see how they can come up with the rent. Teddy has been hiding out in the house overnight and interrupts them saying if they can get some pledges, they can get them to pay dues which will help them to come up with the rent. He gets to live with them as their sorority father of sorts. This is a big problem for Mac and Kelly, their house is in escrow (essentially its sold but there's a 30 day period where the new owners can drop in and change their minds) and with their new neighbors, they sale is in jeopardy.The thing that Neighbors 2 does differently from Neighbors is that it tries to drive home a positive message. Neighbors did have a moral of the story in growing up but this movie points out how it can be harder for girls to go through the college experience and with the growing movement for equality among the sexes, it's only fair that women should have the same opportunities as men to party and make bad decisions. I wouldn't call this movie revolutionary but it does try to show it from the other perspective and it deserves points for that.So, while there is that important message, if you're expecting a completely different plot from Neighbors 2, you're going to be disappointed. Both movies are not the same beat for beat but the overall arc of the plot is pretty much the same. It's going to turn some people off but if you can deal with that, the jokes and the dialogue are pretty funny to compensate. Another small negative is that there are many small moments that strain plausibility. Shelby is still too old to not know what a corded phone is. Why is it 5 buckets of money for the rent instead of a set number? The biggest one which is the same thing from the first Neighbors why won't they call the cops? If you're going to enjoy this movie though, you have to set that stuff aside.The first Neighbors was the launching pad for Zac Efron as a comedic performer, the intention seems to be to do something similar for Chloe Grace Moretz. She's a good actress and she's occasionally funny here but instead of being more of a solo showcase, most of the laughs she generates are playing off of Kiersey and Beanie. Seth is his typically funny self, his humour isn't for everyone but he consistently delivers. Rose Byrne is pretty funny in her own right and Zac Efron again shows how funny he can be if he's got the right material. The actual jokes are more of the same, you have the gross out stuff but it works and you have some experienced people here who know how to make it funny.I liked this movie as much as I liked the first Neighbors. They put some more effort in certain parts like having a good message and finding some ways to work in the characters from the original movie. But otherwise, it's a lot of the same, there's funny jokes and some good comedic performances. I wouldn't hold it up against my favourite Seth Rogen movies (This is the End, Zac and Miri, Pineapple Express to name a few) but it was definitely worth seeing and if you liked the first one, I can pretty much guarantee you'll find things to like in Neighbors 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never thought there would be a sequel to Neighbors(2014), like I never thought there would be sequels to The Hangover. The first Neighbors was not high art, and it never tried to be, but it was an entertaining comedy, full of zany hilarious slapstick. All the actors played off each other and seemed like they are having a blast making it.The premise here is basically the same, except this time it's coeds led by Chloe Grace Moretz. And returning cast members like Seth Rogan, Rose Byrne, and Zac Efron are just has memorable has they where in the first. Never for a second it takes itself seriously, and Zac Efron seems to be rite at home, and looks like he was having more fun here than he did in Dirty Grandpa. Seth Rogan and Rose Byrne really own the film every time there on camera. Chloe Grace Moretz and the other females here are also memorable.If you where not a fan of the first film, then you should probably avoid this. But if you where a fan, and looking for a funny, raunchy slapstick film, then give Neighbors 2 a look.</fullReview>

Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne and Zac Efron are brilliant! Chloë Grace Moretz was absolutely awesome in it! It isn't her the best role, but she did an amazing job for this film. If you wonder about Selena Gomez and want to watch it because of her, she had no a big parts in it. She's was good, but nothing all that special.I don't know why so many people hated this movie, even the original.. Sure, it's not a masterpiece of comedy, but it's definitely one of the best comedy sequels I've seen. Definitely worth to watch if you are a fan of the first! 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedy of this time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neighbors 2 is the most progressive comedy I've ever seen. Like who knew sororities couldn't throw parties while frats could? I sure as hell didn't, and it's messed up when you think about it! Of course, being progressive does not a good movie make (see: John Q.), but Neighbors 2 also happens to be very funny...because of its progressiveness. In fact, some of the best jokes here are ones in which the film highlights the ridiculous sexism in our society. Sure, there are moments where the film is a little too on the nose or moments where it gets a little too real (surprisingly) - but it's mostly an entertaining comedy...with something to say.On top of that, the film gets brownie points for featuring a diverse array of supporting characters - gay, fat, black, Asian - i.e. characters the filmmakers could have easily given to another white man or woman. But the fact that the diversity isn't pointed out or made into a big deal makes it even better. Does that make any sense? Anyways, I digress. Overall, Neighbors 2 is a good sequel because it's actually a really funny movie with a great cast. However, its desire to tackle modern issues is like the cherry on top. Let me make this clear: The film didn't need to be progressive to be good...but it certainly does separate itself from every other comedy ever made, and that's never a bad thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost as Fun as First Neighbors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two years later, audiences will get to catch-up on married couple Kelly and Mac Radner (played by Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen) along with infant daughter Stella (Elise &amp; Zoey Vargas) now a toddler. After clearing- out an extremely disruptive fraternity house next door in "Neighbors", "Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising" presents the couple with the same problem, only with all female protagonists who are a college Sorority.Neighbors 2 opens with the couple now living quietly with an empty house next door (once inhabited by Delta Psi Beta). The Radners are in the process of closing the final sell on their home as the buyers enter a 30-day escrow. That means, the buyers may pull-out of finalizing the sell if they should find something wrong with the house (you can probably already see where this is going). Neighbors 2&#x2032; updates us with characters Teddy who is finding it difficult to move beyond working at Abrecombie &amp; Fitch due to his criminal record gained from harassing the Radners, Scoonie, now a successful inventor, and Pete who has some unexpected news of his own. The alignment of various unfortunate events that include a sorority rule that prohibits them from partying, three disgruntled pledges who set out to start their own sorority calling it "Kappa Nu" bypassing the anti-sorority party law, and their encounter with Delta Psi's Teddy (Zac Efron) combined with the available house for sell next to the Radners all lead to the upheaval that threatens the successful completion of their escrow. Feeling down on his luck with a new whirlwind of events in his life, Teddy is compelled to start-up war again with the Radners and lends himself to Kappa Nu as a mentor, until their ungrateful behavior moves him to join the Radners in the war. There were some very funny moments in Neighbors 2&#x2032;. However, what was missing was the creative and slew of unexpected pranks that the characters were constantly one-uping each other with in the first one. The meat of the story in Neighbors 2&#x2032; is focused on a battle of not only the neighbors, but also, a battle of the sexes. By the last act, everyone comes to the conclusion of what the bigger picture is and the importance of doing the right thing no matter what the Radner's undesirable consequences may be.Full Review at: HollywoodJunketdotcom</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Neighbors movie really surprised me, instead of following the 'Seth Rogen drug based comedy movie' showed me that Zac Effron had some decent acting chops if he wasn't type cast as the summer party guy. It was also hilarious and a well written and well directed story. Now has Neighbors 2 followed Zoolander 2 into the realm of mediocre sequel territory. Like always lets go with the good and the bad.The Good - Overall the story is very well written and makes sense for these parents to be at war with this sorority and the way that Zac Effron was brought back into this film, worked for his character. The acting from Zac Effron, Rose Byrne and new to the story Chloë Grace Moretz were all well done with lots of humorous moments and an equal amount of touching heartfelt moments. The humor throughout this movie was well done, with not all jokes relying on weed and dicks, with the introduction of a sorority this gave the writers a chance to not only make jokes about periods which is at the equivalent to a dick joke, but it gave them a chance to do topical humor and allow for them to make fun of the technology obsessed society. This movie even talks about how women are over sexualised and makes fun of the people who do that.The Bad - Seth Rogen at times reverts back to his old "I'm a fat guy who smokes weed and does a lot of physical humor" state at times and some of the jokes fall flat. Characters that people may have loved from the first film could have been changed simple cameos. And yes their are a lot of jokes that revolve around dicks and weed.Overall if you like Seth Rogen comedies or you liked the first Neighbors movie than you should give this movie a chance but if you aren't particularly a fan of Seth Rogen comedies, just go see Civil War again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following the unprecedented success of 2014's Neighbours, here we have Neighbours 2! Comedy sequels have a 'great' track record as well producing gems such as The Hangover 2, Little Fockers and the absolute gem Big Momma's House 3. I'm joking if you can't see through my sarcasm. General speaking, comedy sequels are garbage and fail to capture the magic of the original.However, this is an exception. Not only does Neighbours 2 capture the humour of the original, but greatly improves upon it. I personally did not find the original Neighbours terrifically entertaining - I thought it was quite bland and the gaps between the jokes were too large.Neighbours 2 is incredibly funny from start to finish - producing wall to wall jokes that hit more often than not. That being said - there are some jokes that don't fly, but this would be applicable to most modern comedies. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne are as brilliant and convincing as ever as Mother and Father duo - and produce some truly gut busting laughs along the way. Zac Efron is his usual charismatic self, and his on screen demeanor is impressive. It seems as though he will not be leaving the adult comedy scene for a while. The other cast member including new addition Chloe Grace Moretz are brilliant - and add a lot more to the film than the male cast members from the original.The film also has a very interesting sociological agenda - primarily criticizing the sexist and derogatory structure of the frat system in the USA. It sports a little more concern and brains than most modern comedies, and it really is welcome return to form.In the end, Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising will make you laugh, cry, and cringe consistently all at the same time, and I can guarantee you'll leave the theater with an ear to ear smile on your face.</fullReview>

Although it was a great movie I would definitely not recommend it to anyone that might be offended by the odd racist or sexist joke, and it should definitely not be viewed by anyone under 15!On the other hand if you enjoy a bit of satire and a good laugh it is for you. Bad Neighbors 2 was an enjoyable movie, it was not too long or short and although at the beginning it made me wonder how all the characters were going to in some way relate to each other, eventually they all perfectly connected like pieces in a puzzle.Good movie, would definitely recommend it to anyone up for a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neighbors 2 : Sorority Rising Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some spoilers here and there but not to much I think I'm in love; with Zac Efron that is. This guy really impressed me with his talent in this movie. He really showed that he has grown as a comedic actor and I as never a Zac Efron fan but just stole my heart in this movie. Seth Rogan continues to be hilarious as usual in every way. There is something about his movie editing is that is like a combination of armature and professional at the same time If that makes sense. The editing is done in such a way that is funny but its not lazy. There is still a level of professionally in Seth Rogan's filmmaking, the movies are quite well made. Rose Byrne was cute in the movie I really like her too especially in a specific scene in the movie towards the middle when she couldn't find her husband. The Person I really like seeing again is the Jimmy character he is just simply hilarious. I've only seen this guy in the neighbors movies but he's actually a really funny dude. As I expected the first half of the movie wasn't as good as the second half. The movie especially the humor really picks up when Zac Efron's character switches sides which is pretty much my favorite thing about this movie. A few months back when I saw the trailer for this movie I told my sister the second half of this movie when Zac Efron shows up will be better than the first half and I was right. But the trailer really threw me off its not consistent with the actual movie. I'm not sure it they changed the movie after the trailer came out or if they just did that to throw you off with the trailer. Honestly, the chemistry between Zac Efron's character and Seth Rogan's character when they teamed up was absolutely incredible, they were hilarious together. The humor in the movie was a combination of physical comedy and verbal comedy. Some of the verbal comedy was a little over the top and so was the physical comedy but I enjoy physical comedy so I loved it. Some of the jokes really hit whether it was because of the way they were delivered by Seth Rogan quickly with his funny voice or because they were relatable and you just can't help but laugh because you agree. And the physical comedy you just can't laugh at because it's so freaking funny. It was a little inappropriate at times but the movie is rated R so it's expected. It wasn't as inappropriate as I thought which I liked but this is no kids movie. I feel like this movie isn't for everyone. Some people are saying this that the movie isn't good because of how raunchy it is but thats because only people who are fans of the actors or like these kind of comedies will enjoy the movie so you shouldn't say bad things about the film if it's not your kind of film because that doesn't make it a bad movie. I really enjoyed the movie and was impressed with how they did the plot and the pranks were more convoluted and more interesting this time than in the first movie. Also, once again I was really impressed by Zac Efron's character. After "17 again" I thought his movies had gone down hill and I just saw him as kind of an unlikable guy who just wants to show off his body but in this film he showed that he is more than that because he was actually given something to do rather than just look hot. Well part of it was him looking hot but it was for a good reason not just to show off well it is to show off but if you saw the film you know what I mean. I feel like he's really grown as a comedic actor and I laughed more at him than at Seth Rogan believe it or not. He just proved that he's just a nice guy and I think I may have misunderstood him. Now I actually like him.Overall I had low expectations going into the movie but I was quite impressed overall. The movie was very funny and the script was fine for the most part. The acting was pretty good and unlike the first movie, there the characters were actually acting and not talking which was good. The first movie had too much dialogue which kind of made it feel like it was dragging on forever. Also, the overall plot although it was similar to that of the first movie, it was surprisingly interesting. The movie was not too long which was nice because comedies over 90 minutes start to repeat the jokes which isn't good. The movie did repeat some aspects from the film but it worked and wasn't repetitive. Lastly, I really like the messages that the movies was giving. It gave messages about sexism, racial issues, and parenting which I thought gave the move heart. The movie showed how the parents were parents of not only their children but also the girls and in a way Zac Efron's character too when they took him in their house when he was lost and helped him get get though tough times. And they helped the girls understand the importance of friendship which was really sweet. Overall the movie was really funny and that's how comedies are supposed to be and its hard to make a funny comedy these days so this movie succeeded on that level and overall I walked out with a smile on my face so I think that I'm happy, the people were happy walking out which means more people will see the movie so the actors will be happy as well and hopefully we'll get a neighbors 3 !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though it dabbles in some recycled material, Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising delivers more genuine laughs, some heartfelt moments and some enjoyable performances from a talented cast-- Seth Rogen, Zac Efron, Rose Byrne and Chloe Grace Moretz--that arguably makes this quite possibly unnecessary sequel just as good as, if not better than, its predecessor. May contain spoilers. This 2016 comedy sequel follows a couple (Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne) with another child on the way who are selling their house with a potential buyer and are under a 30-day escrow, but soon learn a sorority has moved in next door and must reunite with their former neighbor (Zac Efron) to help take the down the sisters and their leader (Chloe Grace Moretz) to prevent the buyer from backing out of the sale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"We've got to do what all adults do: stop young people from having fun." Mac Radner (Seth Rogen) Having watched Neighbors, about a frat house moving next to a youngish couple, I feel fully versed in male gross-out antics, bountiful bongs, and weed found not just in an overgrown lawn. What I was not prepared for in Neighbors 2 was partying sorority girls moving in where the boys used to be and playing rougher.Their partying seems to eclipse the boys' if you consider bloody tampons as weapons against the "old people' next door (Rogen and Rose Byrne as his wife, Kelly). Then again, I can't think of much more than that, so the story must be more about strategy than egregious incivility. The Radners have an escrow sale of their house with thirty days for the buyers to buy, contingent in the end on the girls being good for the prospective buyer. That's not going to happen! Most of the comedy is low, as you would expect, with slapstick, pratfalls, and base visuals such as the Radner toddler playing with a dildo. However, after the usual silly stuff (and much of that is witty enough to make even me laugh), some questions are posed about women's rights and equality, for instance, that girls are not allowed to party in sorority houses but men are in their own.Additionally, Zac Efron as the dimwitted mid-twenties hunk has room to show his acting chops. His line, "There's no I in sorority," is a perfect illustration of his character.The issue of fairness becomes a motif, even as the girls are forced for their survival to imitate the activities of the sexist frats in order to keep their house. Shelby (Chloe Grace Moritz) rallies the sorority girls with talk of solidarity, not just against fraternity dictatorship, but also against authorities and old people, who seem to forget that girls are young and good at heart.Yet in the end, Neighbors 2 is more of the same base humor dotted with social issues. That humor had me smirking and laughing out loud?that's the best recommendation I can give: It's funny."I'm a human woman. I need to watch this." Beth (Kiersey Clemons) "This" is Zac Efron dancing without a shirt?nothing gross about that reaction?it's human.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film to which this is a sequel saw new parents Mac and Kelly at war with the fraternity in the house next door who insisted on having raucous parties all night long. This film starts with next door empty, Mac and Kelly about to sell, having already bought another house, when a freshly founded sorority moves in next door, just in time to foul the 30-day period of escrow, during which the purchasers of Mac and Kell's house can withdraw from the sale.There are two elements to this film, both of equal strength. One is that it is often very funny. There is some good knockabout slapstick humour, some funny lines, some lovely reactions, especially from Rose Byrne, and some comical but really silly stuff (the clown mask). I didn't mind the constant foul language ? I was expecting it from the first one, and there were moments when it was really funny ? or the drugs.But the other element, which concerned me in the first one, and which continues to concern me here, is the underlying presumption that it is actually OK to adopt a lifestyle which intrudes so totally on someone else's right to a quiet life. Of course, one has to also bear in mind that the movie is somewhat divorced from reality (there don't appear to be any other neighbours, and both the police and the college are completely unconcerned at what is going on) so I guess I can manage to ignore my worries for the duration of the film.Much of the cast of the first film return, and have fun. I did, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising is the sequel to the surprisingly good comedy: Neighbors.I enjoyed the first film. I thought it was a good movie with great acting Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne and Zac Efron.In this film, the story is identical to the first: the girls move to Teddy's home (Efron) and make parties and immense noise. But surprisingly, it is not so bad ... on the contrary.I enjoyed myself a lot with this film for a while. Some of the jokes result, especially when they want to steal the drug bags, and a chase happens .. it's very funny. Chloë Grace Moretz is reasonable in this film. It is not bad, but I think her character might be a little more realistic. She claims to have 18, but the attitudes that it takes in the film did not convince me.And there are times in the film where they do things the couple that do not make much sense as stealing their stuff and so. But there are some messages about friendship, adulthood and gender.Selena Gomez is pretty well in small interpretation does. I love the chemistry between the girls and also the part of Mac, Kelly and Teddy.In the end, I think Neighbors 2 is a decent comedy. Typically, comedy sequels do not result; But if you are fans of the first film, I think they will be satisfied.My rating is 7.1</fullReview>

Having bad neighbours is bad, but they make the whole situation super hilarious. I laughed out loud so many times, especially the garage scene involving air bags. The jokes about bad parenting are really funny too. That child's toy is so funny. And the scene about stealing from the sorority during the fiar is just riotous.I think people will just put this off as a comedy, but it is actually very clever and has even got thought provoking moments.

		<shortDescription>As hilarious as the first, if not even more so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently wrote a review of Zac Efron's film 'Dirty Grandpa', where I criticised him for not having the acting chops or comedic talent to carry a film. I stand by my statement, but every time a 'Bad Neighbors' film comes out I have to reconsider my opinion, because he's very good in this series. In fact every one is. It's almost an anomaly, but everyone who appears in these films, whether it be a cameo or a starring role, seem to be very funny and just hit the mark perfectly. Credit for that has to go to director Nicholas Stoller. Stoller has a stellar (sorry) record in his five directing appearances to date. He's starting to mark himself as a real powerhouse of the comedy genre and I can't wait to see what he comes out with next.The film just works. As with many comedy sequels it has an almost identical premise to the original, simply swapping boys for girls in this case. In the past, films have been criticised for this ('Home Alone' and 'The Hangover' come to mind) but I see no problem with it. It's the characters we come to see (as opposed to action/thrillers where we are there for the story) and as long as things get resolved in a unique way to the original, I know I'm still going to be having a good time. And I certainly did in this case. I can't think of a singly dud scene where the humour didn't work. Seth Rogen is as brilliant as always, but because (as previously mentioned) everyone is such fine form, he almost just blends into the mix, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I really enjoyed this one and will have no issue whatsoever if they decide to return for a third venture (although that may indeed be pushing the premise a touch far).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty solid follow-up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last Bad Neighbours movie was a good laugh. Juvenile it may have been, but enjoyable nonetheless, and that's exactly what you get the second time round. Despite a slow start and some awkward moments, Bad Neighbours 2 is a very entertaining, funny and silly watch, which, if you liked the first one, you'll be perfectly satisfied with the sequel.The best thing about this film is the way that it does emulate its predecessor. It may be very similar, but the fact that it retains its manic and juvenile vibe is what makes it as enjoyable as it is. Once again, we get a fight between an out-of-control group of teenagers and the homeowners next door, but with a combination of new and similar jokes, all of which are just as off-the-chain as you'd hope, there's undoubtedly a lot to laugh at.The other thing that I really enjoyed here was the performances. The first movie really proved how good a comedic actor Zac Efron is, and I'm delighted to say that he's just as funny in the sequel. His character may not have as much to do, but when he gets the chance to really go mad, it's hilarious to watch.Alongside Efron, Seth Rogen is just as fun as always, Rose Byrne and Ike Barinholtz shine again, and Chloë Grace Moretz, in the newest starring role, is fantastic; possibly the funniest she's been since Kick-Ass, which was great to see.Bad Neighbours 2 was an undoubtedly enjoyable watch, full of laughs and manic parties that live up to the first film. However, there are times when it really doesn't match up to its predecessor.For instance, the first twenty minutes of this film are pretty poor. There aren't many laughs, it's edited like a mediocre YouTube sketch show, and it definitely doesn't have the sense of mania that the rest of the film manages to retain from the first movie, which means that, although it did eventually turn out as a fun film, it starts very cagily, and doesn't inspire confidence in the first act.Finally, the film also tries to introduce a message into the plot in the end. Although the front of it is about sexism, what the film really tries to show is a very cheesy message about being who you should be, and not giving into what others want for any reason. It's a nice message in theory, but in reality, it feels forced, cheesy, and very unfitting with the no-holds-barred juvenile comedy of the rest of the film.Overall, Bad Neighbours 2 is a very entertaining film, with some great laughs and performances throughout. It has a few problems, and a few very awkward and unfunny moments, but it's on the whole a solid follow- up to the hugely funny first film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As gross and low-brow as its predecessor, this sequel tops the original with better character work and a surprisingly pointed message on female empowerment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sequels often seem too eager to reprise the (winning) formula of their predecessor, without realising that the same jokes ain't quite so funny the second time around; and yet those who try to reinvent the wheel also risk falling out of favour with fans of the original, who are ultimately expect a fresh, yet familiar, helping of the same. Accomplishing that balance isn't quite so easy, which is just one reason why 'Neighbours 2' is a surprising achievement. While reprising the template of the original in having middle-aged Seth Rogen and Rose Bryne's homeowners/ newfound parents take on loud, obnoxious teenagers right next door, this sequel that manages to be just as, if not more, raucous and outrageous is even funnier, more poignant and we dare say, even better than the original.Instead of Zac Efron's perfectly ripped Teddy Sanders and his other Delta Psi frat-boys, Mac (Rogen) and Kelly (Bryne) find themselves up against a sorority led by Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz) and her similarly non-conformist new friends Beth (Kiersey Clemons) and Nora (Beanie Feldstein). Irked by the rule that sororities on campus are not allowed to host parties and appalled by the 'rape culture' at misogynistic frat parties, Shelby decides to search for a house outside of the university grounds to start a new sorority she eventually names 'Kappa Nu', a search that brings her to the very house where Delta Psi used to reside. Their timing however couldn't be more unfortunate ? in anticipation of their second child, Mac and Kelly have just sold their house to a mixed-race couple, who have a 30-day escrow period to make sure the place is in order before confirming their purchase.Shelby finds an unexpected ally in Teddy, whom we learn has been struggling to adjust to life after college. Not only does he find that his abs have become no longer relevant at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch where he works, his best friend and roommate Pete (Dave Franco) wants him to move out after coming out of the closet by announcing that he is about to get married to a man. Teddy's still sore about the previous confrontation with Mac and Kelly ? not least because it left him with a criminal record that has made it difficult for him to find employment ? and finds purpose assisting Shelby work out the sums to pay rent by showing them how to run a party to also attract more like-minded females to join Kappa Nu. It is also Teddy who coaxes Shelby not to acquiesce to a 30-day truce which Mac proposes.And so just like that, the battle lines have been drawn between the two houses yet again, though Teddy will switch sides halfway when the Kappa Nus hold an executive meeting over Instant Messaging (IM) and oust him for being "an old person". Somewhat surprisingly, the gags you probably already know about ? including that of the Kappa Nus dressed in bikinis throwing themselves on top of Mac's car ? are as brief as they have been glimpsed in the trailers. Indeed, there is more up the sleeves of returning director Nicholas Stoller and his team of screenwriters (including original scribes Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan O'Brien, and Rogen and Evan Goldberg) than you would expect, ranging from a marijuana heist at a tailgate party to an iPhone sabotage that leads to a series of misplaced texts and false alarms.Just as amusing as these high-farce set pieces are the high-profile cameos by Lisa Kudrow and Kelsey Grammar, the former as a hard-assed college principal whom Kelly makes the mistake of trying to bribe with a couple of dollars and coins and the latter as Shelby's dad whom Mac and Kelly call in to rein in his 'wayward' daughter. That 'Neighbours 2' turns out more engaging than the sum of these parts is credit to the attention and detail that Stoller pays to each one of the key characters ? namely, Mac, Kelly, Teddy and Shelby ? none of whom he conveniently fits into the mould of hero or villain. In fact, you'll be pleasantly amazed at how your sympathies shift during the course of the movie, so much so that you'd wish that they could all just put aside their differences and get along with each other at the end of the day.Amidst the laughs, there is also a thoughtful and sometimes thought- provoking lesson on sexism. On the surface, the very establishment of Kappa Nu seems like a modern-day feminist movement, its genesis rooted in the rebellion against the archaic rules of the Greek system that persist till today. And yet, along the way, Stoller and his eminently male screen writing team call out the hypocritical pitfalls of such empowerments, especially as Kudrow's college dean points out to Mac that 'there is no such thing as reverse sexism'. The subtext here is a little less straightforward, but those looking for a more forthright comedy of low-brow pleasure will find much to laugh and holler at in this authentically ribald sequel. Oh yes, fans of the original will be glad to know that even though the gender is different, the gross-out sensibilities remain intact, and this is as perfect a sequel as you would expect.</fullReview>
