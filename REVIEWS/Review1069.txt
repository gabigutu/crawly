		<shortDescription>509th Review: Oscar Contending Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jiro is not an easy celebration of sushi - it is certainly not simply stunning shots of food on plates - it is rather a more difficult and even challenging film about the complex nature of obsession, perfection, and the discipline and almost OCD behavior that it takes to become the world's best.Jiro is acknowledged as the world's best - his restaurant in a pass in an underground station in Tokyo sits 9 people at a time, has to be booked at least a month in advance, and costs the best part of a week's wages. Yet no-one would hesitate - this is, as Michelin recognizes, worth a trip to Japan just to go and eat there.The film succeeds as it is itself a near perfect reflection of the same ethos - it becomes apparent very quickly that this is not sentimental romantic filming - it chooses to avoid rich color, and in the editing and, in particular, the composition of the shots is singularly well-thought through. Many shots are based on the golden mean, and placed exactly two-thirds to the right of frame - and there is throughout a sense of real thought and balance. The Peter Greenaway-like score add to the general sense of rhythm and balance here. The documentary itself is particular and peculiar - it is not in itself a documentary that embellishes - it focuses on Jiro, his sons, their suppliers, the apprentices, the produce, and the product - but we always feel that there are more stories untold than told here - Jiro is not, in the main, likable - but he is totally and utterly committed and passionate to the point of coldness about his process - in a way that few are anymore - and in this sense the film is also more an elegy than a eulogy - Jiro's work ethic is gone forever even now - who wants to work 16 hours a day for 75 years anymore?We are watching the recording of extinction, and it is still beautiful. So we end up with a stark yet beautiful film that both records the passing of greatness and questions it. It is certainly one of the best documentaries of 2012.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was thoroughly charmed by the film. When I read the synopsis, I thought I would be bored to tears. But it's a lovely, poignant, challenging documentary about excellence, discipline, vocational call, tenacity. The film challenged me to think about my own persistence, an ongoing striving to improve and grow, doing work for the love of it and much less so for the financial gain. the documentary highlights the ability to succeed after incredible hardship, and some would say, cruelty. The cinematography was elegant, the music varied and interesting, the precision of the art of making sushi, the rigor and discipline to do it well, the requirement to be surrounded by others who always want to excel. A wonderful film and I'll see it again...and again. It even made me want to eat sushi...which I never do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lessons for life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I got the invitation to go to this film, I was extremely hesitant and worried as to what I was going to be viewing. Even to go so far as to accept the impending nap I was about to have. I was sorely mistaken about getting a nap. From the very beginning the story and life lessons presented were gripping. True respect for the dedication, hard work and absolute presence of mind to clear away all the minutiae that many of us get caught up in to focus on the details that are so very important. I have actually seen action films with more lulls and uninteresting parts then what I watched in this film. It's a great story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Both fascinating and inspirational, this portrait of a man in pursuit of perfection is a humbling and life-changing experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a sad but true fact that modern-day society has tended to place too much emphasis on the pursuit of success defined in tangible and even grandiose forms but not so much on the far more meaningful pursuit of perfection. No wonder then that 'Jiro Dreams of Sushi', a thoughtful and absolutely inspiring portrait of the 85-year-old sushi chef Jiro Ono, comes like a breath of fresh air, demonstrating the superior fulfilment one gets by putting perfection ahead of success- since it is with the former that the latter will inevitably follow.As is with most of our readers, we had not heard of Jiro Ono before this documentary, but here's just a few facts about him to tantalise you. Jiro is the owner of a 10-seater basement-level restaurant Sukiyabashi Jiro accessible via underpass en route to the Ginza subway station. Yet despite the fact that the restaurant has a fixed-menu, serves only sushi, and will set you back a whopping ?30,000 (or $$480), you have to make reservations at least one month in advance in order to secure a seat. And here's the most amazing thing- that humble restaurant has been awarded three Michelin stars, with both celebrity chefs Anthony Bourdain and Joel Robuchon proclaiming that their best sushi experience was at that very establishment. It's a fascinating subject for a documentary, and debut feature helmer David Gelb more than does his subject justice with a thoroughly intriguing look at Jiro's recipe for perfection as well as the dynamic between Jiro and his eldest son cum future heir to the business Yoshikazu. It's no secret to reveal that dedication, hard work and perseverance are the ingredients to Jiro's success today- and Gelb demonstrates this through interviews with a prominent Japanese food critic Yamamoto Masuhiro, current and former apprentices, and of course Jiro himself. Each of these are informative and insightful, yielding different perspectives on the master ? or as the Japanese would call him, 'shokunin', which means artisan ? and among the ones you won't forget are his exacting ten-year training regime for staff and his constant and consistent pursuit for betterment. Yet any portrayal of Jiro cannot be complete without his two sons - the elder Yoshikazu mentioned earlier and his younger son Takashi, who runs the restaurant's only other branch in the upscale Roppongi Hills neighbourhood in Tokyo. Instead of a college education, both sons were trained by their father from young as sushi chefs, and as Jiro himself admits, their tutelage could not have been any much easier than the other kitchen workers who spend hours fanning sheets of nori seaweed over a coal fire or practise making sweet omelette 200 times. Throughout the movie, Gelb deliberately teases the question of whether the younger Ono, Yoshikazu, is indeed worthy enough to take over the reins from Jiro. It's not easy trying to live up to the expectations of a perfectionist father ("Jiro's ghost will always be there watching," he says with resignation at one point) but the answer as to whether Yoshikazu is good enough, is absolutely gratifying when it comes. Compared to Yoshikazu, less emphasis is paid on Takashi, except to imply that Takashi's methods will never be the same as that of Jiro's. Interesting to note too that Jiro isn't the only one so passionate about his work- in fact, as Yoshikazu brings us on a tour of the teeming Tsujiki market where the restaurant, like most if not all other sushi joints in Tokyo, gets its catch, it becomes clear that Jiro has been able to keep up such high standards in his food precisely because his suppliers share the same demanding standards over the catch they sell. It's almost a code of practice between the two parties, and even Jiro's rice supplier refuses to sell the same rice he does to Jiro to the folks at the Grand Hyatt because he thinks he might as well not let them have it if they don't know how to cook it. The attitude displayed by these individuals, including of course Jiro, is truly admirable ? and like the people in the film, Gelb's documentary while multi-faceted in its subjects, remains as its titular character singular of purpose in reminding its audiences the reason for Jiro's extraordinary success thus far. Of course, there are the requisite mouth-watering shots of freshly made sushi to tantalise your tastebuds, but what ultimately rings loud and true is the very qualities that has gotten Jiro recognised by the Japanese government as a 'national treasure'. And as far-fetched as the title may sound, it is actually meant to be taken literally ? "in dreams I have grand visions of sushi," says Jiro, the pursuit of which forms the very essence of his being. We dare go as far as to say that watching 'Jiro Dreams of Sushi' is a life-changing experience, one that forces you to reflect and re-evaluate your priorities, to place perfection over success, and to recognise that the pursuit of one's dreams can truly be fulfilling. - www.moviexclusive.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'll dream of Jiro.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sushi lovers will be hypnotized by the 85 year old subject of the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi. Jiro has spent his life seeking perfection in sushi preparation, and Michelin agrees that he has come close by awarding him three stars, unprecedented for an octogenarian.Jiro's restaurant Sukiyabashi Jiro in a Tokyo office building basement has reservations available a month away. He and his heir, Yoshikazu labor all day to buy the best raw fish at the market and sell the best sushi. Nothing less.The film does a good job tracking the preparation, from picking one out of ten fish at any time to delicately shaping tuna around rice or massaging octopi for 20 minutes before preparation. Buying the best rice is another ritual that has its own rules, and Jiro rules.Although the documentary can be repetitious, moments of beauty accompany the process such as likening serving sushi to a concert with different moods and tempos.It might be best to see this film on a full stomach. Otherwise you'll be racing to the nearest Asian bistro. Not a bad thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Jiro Dreams of Sushi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never am quite the foodie, and never cared too much about Michelin Guide rated restaurants around the world. But Jiro Dreams of Sushi has made me think twice, that in my lifetime I just might afford that 30000 Yen meal prepared by one of the best, if not THE best sushi master around, and his team comprising of his eldest son and apprentices who relentlessly work at perfecting and continuously improving upon their skills and gastronomical offering in the humble looking food blessed with delicious flavours. And there's not much of a secret to their success, other than using nothing but the finest and freshest of ingredients, backed by an uncompromising philosophy of hard work and consistency.Jiro Dreams of Sushi is like a biographical film, and more. It chronicles the humble beginnings of chef Jiro Ono, recognized as a national treasure in Japan for his bringing of honor to Japanese cuisine, and peers into his professional work ethics that defines a perfectionist. And these lessons learnt apply to more than just sushi preparation and presentation, but are sound lessons not only about wanting to do well, but to excel in what one does. It boils down to pride in one's work, and reminds of how one should be chasing excellence and not success, since the latter is something that will automatically follow once the former is achieved.And success is something that Jiro's Sukiyabashi Jiro restaurant in Ginza, Tokyo has garnered with its Michelin Guide Three Stars rating, but the chef is hardly stopping at being satisfied with that. There are plenty of interview segments that has the master providing anecdotes that nullifies the usually stern looking demeanour he has when wanting to do the best for his diners. With only ten seats in his shop, it's little wonder about the attention that's being paid to the idiosyncrasies of each diner, with little unsaid touches that make the experience unique and unforgettable, though some may say it's kinda stressful to be eating there.But make no mistake, the experience is something one should be looking at, and David Gelb's film is like a walking menu of some of the best on offer at the restaurant. The cinematography here is simply astounding and beautiful, adding a dimension to the individual, intricately prepared sushi pieces up close, that you can almost smell and taste what it may have smelled and tasted like. And that's not all, with Gelb being very conscious at painting a very romantic, rhythmic pace for the restaurant interior, and the chefs and apprentices in slow motion was pure poetry, akin to the need to slow down when dining at Sukiyabashi Jiro in order to savour the food, and to take in the experience completely. Watching the film on an empty stomach, is like playing with fire and seeking to be gastronomically tempted.To balance what would be talking heads, Gelb's documentary ventures out to catch glimpses of Jiro Ono outside of the restaurant in his rare days off, with celebration and recognition of those who had made him successful. The almost still shot of his entire team flanking him, brought nothing less than the majestic, clockwork effort everyone chips in, with screen time also devoted to key suppliers (and reason enough to venture into the auctions at the famed Tsukiji Fish Market), whom Jiro has to trust to make decisions on purchasing, pricing, stocking and delivering nothing but the best, from the fish, right down to the rice. Experts in their own field, you cannot help but to feel a sense of professional politeness amongst their interaction, and think it's a Japanese thing, but it's true that one should not forget those who had helped in any way in one's ascension to success. Yet another lesson learnt with some subtlety.The best though, came out of the blue. Jiro Dreams of Sushi is really an exercise into continuity, and the leaving behind of a legacy with the hopes in an Asian context that one's descendants continue with the good work and goodwill already established, to see something so painstakingly created, and sustained, having a life of its own. Gelb's film dedicates a good portion of the film to Jiro Ono's two sons, one who's running the branch at Roppongi Hills (and a Michelin Guide Two Stars, no less), and the elder one at the Ginza outlet, according to tradition, who will inherit the main venue when the inevitable happens. Talk about pressure, and the long shadow that would be cast for one to try and get out of. And there's a surprise installed that provided something of a sucker punch, that affirms Sukiyabashi Jiro, is under fine hands indeed.It takes more than a decade to learn the ropes, and many more years of hard work and dedication, which to Jiro Ono is a never ending journey of improvement, to become a sushi master, and Gelb's film masterfully captures key aspects of this profession of dedication, with lessons in life never sounding preachy at any point. With good food and well placed humour, Jiro Dreams of Sushi more than deserves a five star film rating, and is definitely one of the best I've seen this year. Now to put some money aside so that the next trip to Tokyo can bring me either to the Roppongi or Ginza outlets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Respectful Tribute to a Sushi Master's Unwavering Quest for Perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Located in a downtown Tokyo subway station, Sukiyabashi Jiro is an inconspicuous subterranean restaurant with just ten counter seats, yet it has the distinction of being the only sushi restaurant with a three-star Michelin rating. David Gelb's meticulously produced 2012 documentary tells the story of Jiro Ono, an octogenarian perfectionist whose constant striving for culinary transcendence has made him legendary among epicureans in the know. He loves his job, as he readily admits upfront, and while a model of stoic diligence and invariable routine, Ono does show his adoration in unexpected ways that manifest themselves through the unassuming pride he takes in his work. He even imagines new sushi creations in his sleep, thus the title. Such an unwavering quest does take its toll on his two sons who must find their way out of his shadow.His younger son Takashi managed to escape the constant glare of his father by running his own premium sushi restaurant in the Roppongi Hills area of Tokyo, one that doesn't bother to compete with his father's. His older son Yoshikazu, however, bears the burden of the family legacy as the one to carry on his father's standards after he retires. Over fifty and still an apprentice, Yoshikazu patiently waits for his turn at running the flagship restaurant foregoing earlier dreams of becoming a race car driver. Since his father suffered a heart attack at seventy, he has taken over the critical task of getting the best fish possible at the world-renowned Tsukiji fish market. Gelb does a particularly nice job of showing the hurly-burly atmosphere of the pre-dawn tuna auctions and the lives of the men running the tiny stalls selling fresh seafood of all kinds. Perhaps by design, the film is comparatively more opaque in having us understand the genesis of the elder Ono's drive toward perfection.While one contributing factor was the absence of Ono's father's absence, it is unclear who actually did influence him to become a sushi chef. There is also hardly a mention of the chef's wife, even though there is an extended passage of a reunion with his childhood pals who characterize him as something of a bully. Interviews with former co-workers shed some light onto the chef's stoicism. In fact, one of Japan's better known food critics admits to being intimidated by patronizing Ono's sushi bar due to the master's overwhelming artistry and attention to detail. Toward that end, I would have liked to have seen more scenes focused on the actual preparation of the sushi rather than simply admiring them on the counter once they are finished. Still, this is a unique look into a man who has not gone gentle into the good night in his quest for the perfect piece of sushi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very simple film about a very simple man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are no spoilers in this review simply because there is nothing in "Jiro Dreams of Sushi" to spoil. There is no plot as such. It is strictly a portrait of Jiro Ono, the world's greatest sushi-maker. He has no hobbies or interests other than sushi. The only major change in his life in the last 40 years is that he quit smoking. He groomed both his now middle-aged sons (somewhat against their will) to be sushi chefs.The point of the film seems to be two-fold. The main purpose seems to be to assure Jiro's legions of fans that his elder son Yoshikazu will follow his father's recipes exactingly and will make no changes to the restaurant once Jiro dies. And the secondary purpose is to show the importance of sustainable fishing.If you're looking for a narrative plot-driven film, you'll be disappointed. But if you are a foodie who likes seeing behind the scenes at a fine restaurant, this is the movie for you. Be warned though: You have to see this in a theater near a sushi restaurant or you'll be disappointed in whatever meal you eat following the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about food, with a story that would inspire all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie about food, but it's much deeper in its story and content. I was truly inspired by a man's pursuit of perfection, the dedications of the understudies, the family dynamic between father and son, and the cultural beauty of Japanese crafts. Yes there are shots of "food porn" woven in, but the movie is charming and much deeper than slow-motion food shots (not that I'm complaining, some shots are stunning).The young director has good command of the camera, and drives the movie through interviews. People in the theater were applauding at the end. I can't wait to get the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lingering, sentimental look at the mentality and habits of Jiro Ono, legendary sushi chef and Japanese national treasure. The long, personal chats with Jiro and sons, plus an exhaustive investigation into every aspect of his business, are balanced by an overly generous dose of shallow focal-range, slow-motion food porn. Like many stereotypical wise men of his age and nationality, the old master also has plenty of sharp, stirring wisdom to impart. Though he doesn't come right out and say it, it's easy to see the parallels he hopes you'll draw between his dedication to the kitchen and the nuances of a rewarding life, and my breath caught in my throat on more than one occasion. A great vehicle for deep immersion into a very traditional Japanese culture, this is far deeper and more rewarding than it initially lets on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but a lot of unanswered questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a 10-seat sushi restaurant, which has earned a top-level 3-star Michelin rating. And it's about the 85-year-old master chef, and his two sons.I tend to write negatively, and I think I may simply be incapable of writing a glowing review, so take my score of 8, and imagine I wrote something 8-ish here.First, the sushi. Yes, the film does deliver some food porn. The sushi appears to be mainly nigiri (hand-formed, fish on top of rice). The best example of this is when the three phases of Jiro's meals are described. Lots of pretty sushi are presented. But not as much as you'd think. This documentary isn't really about the sushi, so you don't really learn any sushi secrets.There's also the fish market, and sushi preparation. There are some unpleasant scenes of living creatures becoming food, so be warned. They do briefly discuss the vanishing quantities and varieties of fish, but don't spend much time on that.Mainly, the film is about Jiro's obsession with sushi. I don't say "improving sushi" because although they try to give you the impression that Jiro is always improving, the few improvements they talk about are: using fresher ingredients rather than refrigerated, massaging the octopus for a longer time, hoarding a particular kind of rice, serving women smaller sizes, and serving left-handed people from the other side of the plate. Those aren't very satisfying improvements to learn about, nor do we learn of the process of improvement.The film is more about Jiro and his two sons in the sushi business. One works with him, and will inherit his place. The other is already operating a mirror-image shop in a different location. We learn a lot about their working relationships, but not really much at all about the rest of their lives.As presented in the film, Jiro seems to live a very shallow and small existence, and yet somehow he reproduced twice. How did that even happen? While he seemed to care for his sons, in a fashion, I didn't get a sense he formed any meaningful connections with other people, or even with them, outside of business. Yet, he seems quite happy with it that way. At the same time, he puts so much effort into what is basically a frivolous enterprise.Is it good business planning, or the result of crazy obsession? Is it even perfectionism, or are we being trolled? Do you need to have the nose of a master chef to appreciate how good the sushi is? Should the rest of us care? We are told cleanliness is one of the five essential characteristics of a master chef, yet the chefs seemed to be touching their itchy, runny noses a lot. I think one chef wiped his nose on his arm. Since all the food is touched by hand immediately before going to someone's mouth, if I saw anyone looking sick, I'd walk out. Do they just talk a good game? I compare it to art that is worth millions of dollars. Of course, no canvas is worth that. People just talk it up, and up it goes, until people realize it's just paint and canvas, and down it comes again.Despite the omissions and seeming inconsistencies, it is still a moving film. I think viewers will relate to the ideas of craftsmanship, quality, dedication, hard work, and family business, and will enjoy knowing that the real star of the family may not actually be Jiro anymore. Anyhow, this is a guy who remains very successful near the end of his life, and his routine seems to satisfy him thoroughly, leaving the viewer with a smile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No doubt a great sushi master, but seemed completely one sided</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film showed that with talent and great amounts of hard work, success can be achieved, but more than anything I felt like I was being told that "giro is the greatest and don't bother thinking anything other than that".I found it rather interesting looking into the art of sushi more than I have ever before but, not being a massive eater of sushi, after a while the interest faded to boredom. Repeatedly seeing different fish cut and served, rolled and served.. it went on for some time. Throughout the film you got the sense that Jiro wasn't the friendliest person in the world, however the film only focused on his success and technique, I think it would have been interesting to see his wife's point of view.All in all, interesting to see high quality sushi but not enough of a background story for me to love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculously Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie popped up many times in my Netflix stream and I ignored it because it didn't really sound interesting. Eventually, I decided to give it a shot; something so highly rated on IMDb is worth it. I watched the movie with my family at home, who are not an easy crowd and I often defend my choices against their harsh opinions.However, this time, what a bore! This movie has no conflict. You've got a man whose story was that he was poor and became a sushi master (this is maybe 5 minutes of the movie). There is no critique of the chef, just endless praise.A couple things are interesting, such as the fish shopping and the difficulties the workers experience due to the perfectionism of Jiro. The other good aspect is the cinematography. Beautiful shots of sushi placed on plates. There is a little more information about Jiro's philosophy of food.The rest of the movie I can't even recall. It's slow, uninformative, and completely biased. There is nothing to keep your attention in this film. I find nothing interesting about a chef who is good at his specialty and maintains an unopposed mastery of it.If they wanted to make this a good movie and Jiro is really "perfect," at least show critics of his food being berated for not liking the food. Another thing that would have made this interesting is to learn more about the fish market or spend more than just a few minutes on the history of sushi or his upbringing. These things feel like footnotes to a long standing ovation to someone who has mastered sushi.I just can't believe the almost unanimous positive reaction the film gets. I was so disappointed, I had to give my two cents. I have defended many movies to my family but besides what I mentioned above as positives, I couldn't find anything to outweigh the dragging pace and conflict-less story of Jiro Dreams of Sushi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple man contributing to the world through his food.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jiro Dreams of Sushi is a movie about a senior citizen who is teaching his one son about sushi in Japan. This movie has a universal theme. It is about love versus money. In a sense it is a very refreshing film to watch. The story does not have much depth to it. In contrast it is a very simple and straight-forward story of triumph and happiness. Perhaps living the simple life is key. Perhaps each and every one of us should look on to life as finding a passion and following it to the end. But what happens when one finds ones passion and loses it again? What happens if an individual does not know what the meaning of their life is and has no one to guide them into understanding it? What happens when the odds are against the individual making it so challenging to reaping any kinds of forward rewards? Is this movie superficial? Did it leave out the trial and tribulations, or was this movie about the exception rather then the rule? Existentialism is a positive and a negative emotion. Existentialism is about risk, which includes a possible success and a possible failure. Jiro Dreams of Sushi did show that the main character could not fail. He needed to succeed no matter how high the cost - and this one factor led the main character to succeed and to reach a level of absolute perfection. This level of perfection made the lead character feel very good about himself. In a sense this is a utopia. A utopia - one of complete balance and harmony with man and his relationship to nature.Written by Annuska Canada</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jiro Dreams of Sushi (2011) *** (out of 4) Informative documentary taking a look at Jiro, a sushi maker who owns a small restaurant in a subway that seats ten people with each plate going for $300. That might seem like a lot of money but Jiro has reservations that need to be put in a month ahead and his work is considered the greatest sushi on the planet. JIRO DREAMS OF SUSHI is a pretty impressive documentary for a number of reasons but the biggest is the fact that it tells Jiro's interesting life story and it also makes you feel as if you're an expert on sushi. I will admit that I've never tasted sushi and I never will. There's not a single part of me that wishes to eat it and I must admit that the thought of doing so makes my stomach rumble. With that said, even though I'm not interested in the food, I couldn't help but be drawn into Jiro's world and I found it to be incredible interesting for several reasons. Jiro's work ethic is something that anyone could admire. The way he expects perfection in his food is something else admirable and not to mention that he's never happy and constantly wants to do better each time he prepares a meal. The documentary also goes into detail about him passing his business down to his son and the pressure that is on him to live up to his father's standards. Another fun aspect of the film deals with how Jiro selects his rice and various fish sources. We see them travel to various fish markets and they explain what they look for and there's even some talk about the lowering quality of fish. JIRO DREAMS OF SUSHI is a pretty fun film and at just 82-minutes it never wears out its welcome. I'm sure fans of sushi will enjoy it even more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhere in a Tokyo street, there is a sushi restaurant with ten seats. And at this restaurant, a very old "shokunin" named Jiro serves the world's finest sushi to his customers. He stands over them as they swallow, within seconds, something that has taken hours to prepare from a technique that has been cultivated over decades.And how does Jiro run a sushi restaurant that has three Michelin Stars? In his own words, by doing "the same thing over and over, improving bit by bit." Jiro Dreams of Sushi gives us people ? from rice dealers to tuna vendors ? who are the best at what they do. These people move in worlds invisible to us: we are shown a tuna vendor with an inordinate amount of knowledge who inspects pieces of fish, seeing what we cannot, and our inexperienced eyes likewise prevent us from seeing the years of labor behind the simple sushi pieces that are put in front of the camera.Our blindness is what Jiro Dreams of Sushi seeks to rectify. It unrelentingly displays the hours of work and crowds of world-class professionals (and apprentices) that are behind each piece of sushi. Shots of restaurant labor permeate the entire film, making us aware of the almost immeasurable effort behind a flavor, a technique, or a dish.The film also dotes on the almost anticlimactic culmination of that effort: the camera captures, over and over again, the placing of a single, small, unelaborate piece of sushi on a flat plate. All of the lives shown to us in the film ? with their achievements, crises, and memories ? are completely subordinate to the craft, enthralled by the cube of rice and tuna that appears in front of customers who have waited months to taste it.The score accompanies these displays perfectly: pieces from composers like Tchaikovsky and Philip Glass match the repetitive frenzy of the film's subjects and contributes to the sense that, to paraphrase Oscar Wilde, the lives of these craftsmen are almost forms of art themselves. Even Jiro's unconscious is obsessed with his craft ? ideas about new dishes constantly throw him out of sleep. "Just when you think you know it all," says a fish vendor, "you realize that you're just fooling yourself." And that realization is the film's central paradox: Jiro "climbs to reach the top," but doesn't "know where that top is" ? he struggles for perfection while recognizing the impossibility of that endeavor. And while this struggle may seem almost tragic, Jiro affirms that he is "ecstatic all day," never once hating his work after having given his life to it. These men are their craft, forever chasing that "ideal moment of deliciousness." Jiro's oldest son Yoshikazu faces a similar impossibility: the inevitability of his succession over his father. Yoshikazu wishes for his father's immortality only so he can "make sushi forever," relieving Yoshikazu of the burden of having to replace him. To many of those underneath Jiro, it seems that he is a form of perfection unto himself, equally unattainable. Jiro remains the ideal 'shokunin' ? a craftsman who is almost transcendent in his skill and dedication, an artisan who does not understand the concept of retirement.According to Jiro, shokunin get the highest quality of fish and apply their technique, caring only about improving their sushi. Money seems to be of no concern. And with all courses (created daily around market availability) starting at a price of 30 000 yen (around 377 Canadian dollars), there seems to be a lot money to not care about. But when a restaurant employs apprentices that have to labor exhaustively for at least ten years before they're allowed to cook the eggs, the prices start to seem less egregious. The one egg-cooker interviewed had cooked over 200 batches of egg sushi, over a period of months, before he made one that was acceptable to Jiro. When he finally had Jiro's approval, he cried. The title of shokunin would be earned years later, a title these chefs labor after for decades.This is where there seems to be an odd irony to Jiro Dreams of Sushi, in that the immense weight of the labor behind each dish comes to rest upon the customer ? Jiro places the sushi in front of you and watches you eat, and all of the customers (even prominent food critics) describe their nervousness about eating at "Sukiyabashi Jiro." An apprentice tells us that "all that matters is Jiro's approval," and the eating process seems to be as rigid and ritualistic as the culinary preparation itself.Takashi, Jiro's younger son, runs a replica of his father's restaurant and claims that his customers appreciate his more relaxed atmosphere. Yet nervousness seems almost impossible to avoid ? I'd be terrified of grossly offending Jiro by insisting for a fork or miso soup. The eating is almost too much of a performance, where the customer must actively participate in the "three movements" of Jiro's courses. Customers book months in advance, the seating arrangements are memorized, and Jiro even adjusts portion sizes according to his customers to maintain the pace of the meal.Jiro Dreams of Sushi finds its strength in allowing its subjects to tell their own stories, and it is their narrations that accompany the movie's beautiful shots of sushi preparation. Jiro not only lends us insight into how these deceptively simple dishes are made, but allows us to meet and come to know a man who has worked for seventy-five years to perfect a food.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a more accurate title, it seems.I made it through the first 48:00 minutes and though it is a nice story of dedication to be the best at something, about Japanese culture, the length of the movie exceeded the point of it still being interesting for more than perhaps 30 minutes. A great story that could have been told in thirty minutes or so, was drawn out and made into a movie. There were certainly many interesting parts of the film, such as the focus on the succession of the eldest son, the restaurant winning awards like the Michelin award for excellence despite the restaurant only having ten seating units and no bathroom--no other restaurant has won this award with those conditions. I hope this review isn't drawn out too far, I was mandated to have ten lines despite only needing 6. Awesome work Jiro and staff!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a documentary about food. If you love anything about food, you will probably love the documentary, but even if you have no interest in cooking, you will still probably love this. Even if you hate sushi, I am sure you will take pleasure in this fantastical portrait.All you need to know going in is that this documentary is about Jiro and his two sons. Their lives happen to be mostly concerned running sushi places, but even if Jiro had picked a completely different occupation, it would probably be a great documentary. Jiro has an all-encompassing working mentality, that leads to him being in constant competition with himself. His end goal does not seem to be anything material, but instead it is to be the best he can be at what he does. And what he does is to make sushi, more than it is being a father, or a celebrity. This seems like a typical set up for conflict between he and his sons, and while the documentary does hint at it, it's also obvious that it is just a part of the culture. The best moments are when they are all laughing of statements about their situation that are brutally honest.As a side note, this is also a neat introduction to Japanese culture. By no means does it cover all aspects of it, but in a nonchalant way it highlights parts of Japanese culture that are (literally) foreign to many.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Tokyo, 85 year old sushi master Jiro Ono runs his famous restaurant in the basement of an office complex. His obsession leads him to dream of sushi. He doesn't stop working except for national holidays and funerals. He refuses to retire even after being hospitalized. His 50 year old elder son Yoshikazu has been working for him since 19. The younger son Takashi opened his own restaurant.There are surprisingly many aspects to this documentary. Obviously, there is the man and his obsession. There is also the son forever in his shadow and their relationship. There is also the lesser son getting out from under his shadow. There are the apprentices working away. There are the vendors, the fish traders and a side trip down conservation road. There is also the food porn aspect. It looks hypnotic and delicious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A simple 10 seat restaurant without restroom. If you want to eat there book a month in advance cost at least 30,000 yen no appetizers only the finest sushi. Michelin Guide awarded Sukiyabashi Jiro three stars meaning worth the trip to Japan. The first sushi restaurant to have the honor. Its all achieve behind the scenes by the preparations by his apprentices and his same attitude supplier/handlers. His apprentices goes through 10 year training if you can make it that long you can consider to be a first class sushi chef. First they hot hand towel the guest after that they can prepare the fish and after 10 years learn to cook the egg sushi. His quality of food is achieve by his trusted vendors specialize with their area of expertise. His tuna vendors only deals with tuna his shrimp vendors only deals with shrimps. Even he has a certain method of cooking rice , his rice vendor only sells certain rice to Jiro saying he wont sell his rice because only Jiro knows how to cook it properly.He admits that relationship with his sons when they were children wasn't the best.It is a tradition for the oldest to take over the family business so older son have to live up to the expectation. It will hard to follow a great mans footstep. The younger son open up his own sushi restaurant, a similar restaurant the interior is just reverse to the interior of his father and since he feels his sushi is not as good as his father his prices are cheaper. The film only capture the aspects of the restaurant but not much of his personal life. A couple mentions of his parents. Not sure if there is a wife because there no mentioning.The way David Gelb directed itself work of art. The sequence of scenes classical music playing in the background while they preparing the ingredients combined with the narration and close up of the finish sushi. The close up on the hands making the sushi. Yamamoto is says Jiro is maestro of an orchestra. Jiro have a keen eye for details from the seat arrangements making the sushi smaller for the ladies so it doesn't interrupt the flow noticing if the guest are left handed. describe Jiro sushi course like sonata his course in 3 movements : first classic fish like tuna and halibut the second an improvisation on the fresh catch of the day. the Final movement close with eel and egg.If you enjoy sushi you will enjoy this documentary. At 85 Jiro Ono still working hard to hone his craft. No tricks or shortcuts just hard work and dedication. David Gelb gives a behind the scene on Sukiyabashi Jiro a three star Michelin restaurant giving insight on his methods of madness. Mentioning to the camera you shouldn't complain about your work always improve your skill. As a sushi master he makes sure that everything is up to his standard.From his supplier to his apprentices preparing the ingredients so he can make high quality sushi. Simply a perfectionist he is truly a man with passionate a master in the art of sushi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beauty is in the craftsmanship but the characters are interesting too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has had plenty of positive praise and it is part of the reason that it came to a wider audience however this also poses the problem that perhaps the casual viewer expects more of it than the film ever proposes to deliver. For me I wasn't sure what to expect but being a fan of sushi (although I do not think I have ever eaten "amazing", but at least good and very good) and also having recently visited Japan, I figured that it would interest me on at least some level. Many people have said what they took from the film ? whether it is the story of the pursuit of perfection or the loving shots which they call "food porn" but for me the main thing was the work.The film is about the beauty of craftsmanship. The sushi is prepared with pride, with a technique and with an expertise that is great to watch. It isn't that you are watching cooking as you would see on a Sunday morning with a celebrity chef, but rather you are watching a craft ? not unlike someone doing painstaking mechanical work on a priceless watch or something like this. It helps of course to like sushi and seafood but even without this I imagine many will find this side fascinating. The film covers this element into the selection process in the markets as well and I found it very interesting even if by itself it doesn't quite fill 90 minutes.The film makes up the difference thanks to the characters involved in the film. Jiro is driven but warm and indeed his sons are too. I liked that, although the work culture and mindset of Japanese people was not expressly laid out, there was certainly a lot here which captured it and was of interest. It doesn't ever go deep enough to become a character piece, which in some ways is a limiting factor in the film but mostly is for the best as this isn't what it is trying to do, but mostly it stays at a level which engages and compliments the focus on the craft.It isn't an amazing film but it does have a certain beauty to it and I think for many people the core will be this sense of perfection and of creating something very precise with a skill that is honed. The camera captures that very well and, while many of the images look delicious, it was the precision of them that really appealed to me. Don't expect to be blown away by it, but there is a certain amount of beauty to this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The film shows us the life of this famous sushi chef but we also get to see how sushi is made from buying the fish to the actual training people go through for sushi making as their paying jobs" I am not the biggest fan of eating sushi because I do not like to eat it that much so watching this film did not make me want to eat it still. Jiro Ono is the main chef that we follow as we see him when he is 85 years old. We see him working at that age with a small staff but we also get to hear about how he came to the present time that the film is being filmed. The film also lets us see what Jiro's staff say about him which include they saying he is one of the best chef's cooking the food.The documentary does a good job of showing us the lifestyle of this man Jiro showing us how he can be critical of his workers but also how his age has affected his working. Using interviews from the workers and people who know Jiro well as they call him one of the best chef's they have ever eaten from. I enjoyed seeing the different types of sushi being placed on the plates as the people talk about the right ways this restaurant cooks their sushi. Showing the context to how the fish is supplied was great to see because we moved through many images of the people who cut up this fish whether alive or dead which was hard to watch at times but I understood why these people were doing it.Jiro Ono was great to listen to because of the way he talked about his passion. Jiro was great when talking about his past especially when he talked about his father and how the two did not get along so well. The rest of the staff that worked for Jiro were also great to listen to because they did not seem afraid to tell the truth about Jiro even when he was hanging around with them listening to what they were saying. The fact people outside of the restaurant were included was also good but I did feel as if everyone was too polite to Jiro not criticizing him much.The film was boring at times but showing us the culture in Japan was great to watch. Iliked Jiro and respect him but I did not like watching sushi being made for most of the film.MOVIE GRADE: C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who ever thought sushi could be so interesting? Whether you like sliced raw fish or not, you got to hand it to the Japanese for how they prepare their meals. And Jiro Ono is the pinnacle of that precise perfection. The oldest 3 star Michelin chef in the world (at 85), his sushi restaurant starts its courses at $300 bucks a head (starts!). With some slick photography and some great tunes, Gelb does justice to Ono's work. But this intricate documentation of Ono's life, family and his passion shows more than just how that fish gets on to your table. It shows how a man, his past, and his passion can drive him to be the best at what he does. A very interesting documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A magazine I was reading recommended this movie out of couple of other movies. Which peaked my interest to see this movie. I thought it was going to be a deep and invigorating movie about a guy obsessed with sushi perfection. But there really isn't anything deep when it comes to the story and doesn't add anything new to the documentary style movies. In fact this movie doesn't really have a story. It seemed more like a advertisement movie and a flick to show out great Jiro is at making sushi. Like it's a movie to boost Jiro's status cause all he does is brag about himself and others around him praise his methods constantly throughout this movie. If it was something groundbreaking or life changing I would probably go with it. But it's about sushi...Don't get me wrong I like sushi. It's one of my favorite food. It's well documented but it didn't stick with me or think differently about sushi when it was over. It also shows how they get top notch ingredients from experts of those ingredients to make the best sushi possible. Which was cool since it gives credit where credit is due. Or maybe it's too lengthen the running time. Most of the run time is taken up showing how a lot of effort is put into making the sushi. But you never know for sure since things might be different when the camera is on. The main aspect that drives this documentary is the music, it just makes everything seem epic and mysterious. Despite some slow motion scenes that try to add to the epicness of it all. Most of the people in this movie that show there occupation constantly mention they are not in it for the money but there passion. Which might be partly true, but I have this feeling that money takes up most of the percentage of it all by the direction it goes. The main part about this documentary that stood out for me is the part where it shows how too much fishing can lead to extinction of certain fishes. And how fishing should be done moderately without killing off the younger ones to make profit. But most of the way through it just seemed like a giant advertisement and I am pretty sure this movie will increase their sales and reputation.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way more than just a documentary about sushi and sushi-making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching documentaries isn't really being my thing but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate watching a good one, from time to time. I can still easily get grabbed by certain subject matters and the subject for this documentary was being quite intriguing as well, though I have never eaten sushi in my life.I didn't necessarily saw this documentary as one about sushi but more one about striving for perfection, day in day out and devote yourself entirely to just one thing in life. Striving for perfection is the best motivation and something that can keep you going. Thing about it is that you just never can be sure when you have reached your top, so every day is a new challenge to surpass the previous one.It perhaps sounds like a very serious documentary but in fact it's being a perfectly light and pleasant one to watch. This also has a downside though, since this actually means that the movie never really goes deep enough into certain aspects. I for instance still don't know what Jiro Ono's initial motivation was to become a sushi chef and how he ended up being so big and respected in his line of business eventually. After finishing watching this documentary I also had the feeling I still knew very little about his personality and personal life. But this probably also has some to do with the Japanese culture, in which people just aren't all that open and hardly ever show their true thoughts and emotions, at least not on camera. There isn't being any 'conflict' in this documentary. Everybody is saying nothing but good and positive things, while you feel that there are much more underlying going on between Jiro and his sons but the documentary really doesn't elaborate or go deeper into any of this.It didn't prevented this documentary from being a good and interesting one though. It was still fascinating to see all the work and preparations that goes into making sushi and how Ono and his apprentices, including his oldest son, constantly keep maintaining the same high standards of quality and constantly are eager looking for ways to improve their products and their own skills.Thing that also definitely make this a good watch is its visual style. It's an extremely well shot documentary, with some great camera-work as well as editing in it. It makes this perhaps feel more like a movie, rather than a documentary but in this case I say that as a good thing.I definitely had a good time watching this documentary but at the same time by the end of it, I didn't really feel that I got enough out of it.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jiro Ono is proprietor and master chef of a tiny, 10 seat sushi restaurant which just happens to have garnered 3 stars in Michelin's debut guide to Tokyo. This film explores Jiro's obsession with providing his customers with the closest approximation sushi can achieve to perfection. At turns moving and risible, this film at times feels like a missing segment to Juzo Itami's masterful TAMPOPO, absurdly extended. The filming of the sushi is so consistently gorgeous that I found myself becoming increasingly hungry as the film went on, but then I have always been a sucker for food movies; included on my all-time roster would be EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN, BIG NIGHT, and the aforementioned TAMPOPO, any of which are guaranteed to get me thinking fond thoughts of some of my favorite eateries. So, on leaving the Embarcadero Cinema, did I immediately seek out the nearest sushi joint to satisfy my craving? Did I, hell: I went straight to Mario's Bohemian Cigar Store. There's umami, and there's umami: the umami engendered by Mario's breaded eggplant focaccia sandwich, peperoncini, and a pint of Anchor Steam will stand up to any.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jiro Dreams of Sushi" is a documentary about Jiro, an 85-year old sushi master, who runs his restaurant in the subways of Tokyo.Jiro is a real shokunin, a craftsman who lives his craft fully. He leaves home at 5AM and comes home at 10PM. In between, his careful attention goes only to making the most rich and tasteful sushi there can be. The documentary is an ode to this dedication. It does not try to approach the subject with an intellectual attitude, but rather shows us the world how it must look from the eyes of the master. The whole movie is accompanied by classical music and half of the movie is comprised of shots of the art. Fish being sliced, octopus being massaged, rice being cooked and the sushi being formed. Of course Jiro's sushi is not only the result of his skill and dedication, as nothing in this world is separable from it's environment. The movie investigates the different artisans Jiro buys his ingredients and why exactly they deliver the most sublime ingredients. THe movie investigates the hard and long path that Jiro's apprentices have to take before they can even form their first sushi. And the movie investigates the paths of Jiro's two sons, both following in his fathers footsteps.If you have appreciation for beauty, dedication and the strive for perfection, watch this documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You might be skeptical about seeing "Jiro Dreams of Sushi", a Japanese documentary about an 85 year-old sushi chef, but this is an inspirational and fascinating story. It's not every day that you are invited to witness a true master at work and throughout the film you really get to know the man. You don't necessarily find out what his "secret" is (if there is one) but you get to know what drives him to such levels of excellence. Seeing someone as passionate and as skilled as Jiro made me look at myself and think that maybe I could some day get to that level of reverence as well. That made me feel good, even though I realize that the effort required will be extensive. If you're a chef, a cook or any other kind of crafts person, this is really inspiring and moving. It's also a very well shot film that speaks on levels that go beyond just food and this is miles above those a 15 minute slow news day highlight segments you can sometimes find on TV, it really is a movie, a small story that impacts you in a big way. Even if you don't like sushi, you'll be starving by the end of the credits. (Theatrical cut, July 12, 2012)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A glimpse in the life of a true craftsman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shokujin, they call them, people who are not only good at what they do, but they gladly do it out of passion and continue to feel the need to improve at any time. Jiro is such a craftsman, an 85 sushi master who started working in the field when he was 10. That makes his continuing career last for 75 years.Obsessed with his work, he leaves at 6 and comes back at 22, working for 16 hours and never complaining. His two sons are helping him with the business. The youngest already has his own restaurant branch; that's because the elder brother is traditionally supposed to continue his father's work. At 85, Jiro doesn't show signs he ever wants to retire, though.It is a very impressive glimpse in the Japanese culture, the family, sushi, and very inspiring, as well. I am good at what I do and most of the time I love doing it, but some times I just bitch about it and give less than my all. Improving myself is not always my first priority. This film shows you what a man is like that does that religiously every day. A very interesting documentary, I recommend it to all, no matter your own opinion about sushi.There are some slipups in the film, though. Focused on Jiro's brilliant persona, no one even considers criticizing his faults. The documentary presents him as a living god, only giving some hints on what his childhood was like and how that translated into his own children's education. But what I thought was a glaring omission was the wife. You only see her smiling in one scene - one! - in the entire movie. She is the one that probably stays at home the entire day and has waking contact with her husband for one or two hours at most.While he boasts at actually dreaming of how to improve sushi when he sleeps, I've only noticed traditional methods of cooking in his restaurant, which I suspect has been having the same kitchen protocol for decades. I understand that he is a hard working genius, an uncompromising cook that deals only with the best product vendors and prepares and cooks sushi in the best possible way he could devise, but that shouldn't have made the documentary creators ignore his personal life, or lack thereof, and how it affects the people closest to him. There were enough hints in the film to not feel that this was intentional.Bottom line: almost one hour and a half of watching and listening to people talking about the perfect sushi taste made me ravenously crave fish. I would probably appreciate it better by eating it Penguin style, but still. I thought the film would bore me, but I actually followed it from start to finish without fast forwarding once and I felt inspired while watching it. While it is easy to appreciate the consummate craftsman who dedicates all to his passion and work, I can't see myself enjoying the life of a shokujin. Jiro is totally happy with it, though. There is something to be learned from that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jiro and his noble, epic sushi stand in Ginza, Tokyo, get a loving and persuasive exposition in this handsome documentary. While the camera work could be much better, the stream-of-consciousness narrative is fetching and wooing, as both simple and overpowering as one takes Jiro's vaunted sushi to be. The food critic who seems to have discovered and propounded Jiro is a lovely man of nuance and a welcome character in the storyline. Jiro's austerity, vague asperity and fixity of purpose charm and endear even as he becomes his own most difficult act to follow. Even the food- literate will come away with fresh insight into and reverence for sushi. The story, the details, the personalities and their human considerations are as lambent, vital and tart as one imagines fresh ahi tuna chosen specially by Jiro and Jiro's esoteric sushi rice and prized wasabi to taste. With films such as this, one fears not being able to see the mountain for the mists. You come away, however, with a deep sense of conviction that Jiro is everything he is cracked up to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jiro Dreams of Sushi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the UK, if you're a half decent chef the pattern to follow is: get a bit good at cooking, open your own restaurant, get your own TV show, open your own range of Sainsbury's couscous, get caught shop lifting. It's all become a bit boring and predictable now, with famous chefs becoming bigger television personalities and businessmen rather than ding what their supposed skill is: making bloody good beans on toast.This is not the case with Ono Jiro, a sushi chef working out of a small bar in Ginza, Tokyo. As with many restaurants in Tokyo, that sit in the basements of building complexes or Metro stations, Jiro's restaurant, Sukiyabashi Jiro, looks small and underwhelming from the outside. But with three Michelin stars to its name and worldwide fame among the world's top chefs, this is an exclusive restaurant where only the most fat and/or annoying can dine.David Gelb's documentary is one without narrative or particular linear structure. The focus is more on interviews with the man himself and his wider team about their relationship and the fine details that go into the set up. After 75 years in the sushi game, the mentality comes across as keep it simple and stay on top of each and every fine detail. So far, only one other restaurant has been opened: by his younger son in another Tokyo district.Staying in control is Jiro's main aim, wanting to still be able to determine what happens in his restaurant each day, rather than relying on others to take charge. Indeed, the most interesting part of the documentary is his relationship with his elder son, Yoshikazu, who by tradition will take over the restaurant when his father is no longer able.With his father 85 at the time of the filming, Yoshikazu is starting to take greater responsibility for the restaurant under the watchful eye of his father; an eye that makes both chefs and diners nervous.With his age and masterful nature, Jiro is able to spout various words of wisdom, showing a man that, as Craig Charles will slightly offensively put, is a a 'happy, slappy, Jappy chappy.' Complete with various money-shots of freshly prepared sushi throughout, the film, much like the eating experience at Sukiyabashi Jiro is made out to be, is a short but enlightening one.politic1983.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great feel-good documentary. The film succeeds in bringing forward an inspiring story of success. It's a good thing the film also focuses on Jiro's succession, but some deeper personal digging into the mystery Jiro still is after watching instead of focusing almost solely on his weighty philosophy, could justify the title some more.I had the feeling that the director didn't really have a very cohesive and logic narrative in mind throughout the whole mid part of the film, and that the reorganization of some scenes could have provided a more intricate and seamless narrative structure.What I thought was particularly great about seeing this movie from a European perspective was that it made me genuinely inquisitive and interested in this unknown Japanese culture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sushi-themed documentary about Jiro Ono, an 85-year-old sushi master and owner of Sukiyabashi Jiro, a Michelin three-star restaurant located in Ginza, Ch&#x16b;&#x14d;, Tokyo, Japan. The film touches on the lives of Ono's two sons (particularly his older son), the art of sushi, the operation of the market and the behind-the-scenes preparation; but perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the film is Ono's continuing quest to perfect sushi and his life-long dedication to it. If you like sushi, you'll like this film. For an 81 minute documentary, the pace is terrifically smooth, with no memorable road-bumps to ruin the flow. Ono emits a curiously sweet inspiration of never being too old to learn new things; and his dedication seems to be reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's obsessiveness of filmmaking or a grandmaster's ever-evolving understanding of chess.***?

		<fullReview>Even if you really like sushi - like I do - David Gelb's "Jiro Dreams of Sushi" will still give you a real appreciation of the various dishes. Elderly chef Jiro Ono has spent his life trying to prepare the perfect sushi in his Tokyo restaurant, and he shows how it's done. The viewer comes to realize that each piece of sushi is a real work of art, and the main character is very particular about everything (even where people sit). Another thing that Jiro Ono reminds us is that irresponsible fishing methods could wipe out the fish stocks.The documentary is a fine look at the work that goes into these masterful dishes. You just gotta respect the people who put the effort into this, especially considering that Jiro Ono has kept at it for so long. There can be no doubt that these great-tasting (not to mention very healthy) foods are part of the reason why the Japanese tend to live so long. But more than anything, this is a documentary that you're sure to love. I recommend it.I gotta go to Japan one of these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't even like fish. I hate the very thought of sushi. This documentary film should really have been consigned to the 'do not watch, like ever' list but I found myself reluctantly immersed in Jiro's fabulous world of sushi the other night and I quite liked it. In fact I really loved it.I had NO idea. No idea at all about sushi, thought it was just a bunch of cold, raw fish, in fact it is essentially just a bunch of cold, raw fish but we'll leave that thought there for now. This film hooks you from the off, that's all you need to know.Jiro Ono is an 85 year old sushi master who runs a tiny sushi restaurant in Tokyo that has three Michelin stars. Sukiyabashi Jiro is a really tiny establishment, seating just 11 people, the toilet is outside the restaurant and they don't serve appetisers or fanny around with pomp and ceremony. If you are lucky enough to go there, it has a one month waiting list for bookings, you will be served a taster menu of twenty or so different sushi dishes and if you know your sushi then I expect you will be glad to be there because you will be in heaven.Jiro has an amazing philosophy on life, he believes you should decide your occupation and then immerse yourself in your work. This, in true zen master style, is Jiro's key to an honourable life. He should know, he's been living it for the past seventy something years and is still going strong. Apart from the Queen, he is the best preserved octogenarian I've ever seen.Jiro dreams about sushi, he repeats the same dish over and over again until he is satisfied with it and you are swept along in this fabulous tale of one man's life work and what it takes to become a genius. He would have you believe that his brilliance is just down to hard work and repetition but I would hazard a guess that Jiro is one of those rare treasures in this world, someone who is doing exactly what he was born to do. He is a sushi genius.This film is a rare and simple pleasure. Elegantly shot, it offers us not just a glimpse into the world of a Japanese sushi restaurant but a glimpse into the world of someone prepared to do what it takes to be outstanding. The themes of discipline, patience, hard work and passion are hard to swallow is our fast, fast world of instant gratification but satisfying to watch. All children should be made to watch this film before they start thinking about their future careers. I wish I had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few months ago, I saw a French film with a very similar plot to "Jiro Dreams of Sushi"....and it was amazingly dull. So, I was hesitant to watch this Japanese film. Thankfully, I gave it a chance and enjoyed this documentary very much.The film is about an amazingly talented and VERY compulsive sushi master, Jiro Ono. Now in his mid-80s, he is so in love with his work that he STILL works full-time at his small sushi restaurant. Not surprisingly, since his life is his work, his place has managed to receive three Michelin stars--the stop award for dining excellence. The film consists mostly of Jiro and his two sons discussing their work and lives and also includes several others discussing them. The narrator is only heard once--briefly. While all of this sounds pretty dull, it isn't. The filmmakers deserve kudos here--managing to infuse a lot of interest in the subject, using great camera-work (making the food look amazing) as well as terrific classical music to create a wonderful portrait of Jiro--one you can't help but enjoy.By the way, although Jiro has two sons, the film oddly never once mentions their mother (or mothers).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary about sushi master chef Jiro Ono fascinates in many ways. It portrays Jiro's love for food, nicely accompanied by many lovely shots of food that makes your mouth water, but it also says a lot about Japanese society.The film lacks a plot in the traditional sense, instead focusing on the characters. Jiro, going strong at 85, constantly seeks to improve his sushi and even dreams about it. He also strongly feels that repetition is the mother of knowledge, and his chefs (including his sons) can only master the art of sushi by constantly making it, one chef says he spent 10 years cooking omelets before getting master Jiro's approval.The film is beautifully shot and it is a pleasure getting to know the characters behind Jiro's price-winning sushi restaurant, especially the legendary Jiro himself. Strongly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent - a little repetitive, but otherwise excellent.It's probably necessary to enjoy sushi to get the most from the film, but, if you do, it's quite a revelation. I found it fascinating - I think I understand 'umami' is better ('[? Japanese umami deliciousness (1721 or earlier) ? uma-, stem of umai delicious + -mi, suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives (but commonly written as if from -mi taste).] ' {OED}). It is not just the taste of MSG, or the taste receptors for MSG, but more like the Japanese equivalent of the Gestalt, well, the Gestalt as applied to food.They could have called it 'Zen and the art of Sushi'. I hadn't known that there was a Michelin 3- star sushi restaurant, but it's not that difficult to see why Jiro's is.It's interesting how widely applicable the keys to excellence are - dedication, continual improvement and passion. The best ingredients, of course, and cultivating relationships with the best suppliers. The same in sushi as with anything else.Environmentally sound too...</fullReview>

I firmly believe that is what keeps him going. I know some people that are in their fifties that look older than this man! I have always been interested in Japanese culture and manners. Very interesting to see in a different light. Watching him with his sons is really intriguing also.

		<fullReview>Jiro Ono is considered to be one of the best sushi chefs, if not THE best sushi chef in the world. Awarded with three stars in the Michelin guide, he and his son and their co-workers, suppliers try to create a food experience at highest level.This documentary portrays Jiri, his philosophy behind the food that he creates, and all the people he relay on to make that happen.All the way from the fishmarket, prepping the food, to the final result where its served in front of the customer in the most eye catching manner. Jiro and his employees are trying to make their customers senses feel a deeper, almost musical, approach to sushi where Jiro is composing his food symphonies.But what is like to work for a demanding perfectionist like Jiro? And will his son be able to carry on his fathers legacy? These and many other questions is discussed during this films progress and director David Gelb truly does a great job on covering as many aspects as possible in the world of sushi.Gelb has understood Jiros philosophy to food making and also tries to make the viewer understand the outmost perfection that Jiro and his employees require in order to get one meal done.This is not just a documentary about Jiro, sushi, but also a feast for the senses.The biggest flaw of this documentary, however is that it ended to soon, I wanted to know more about Jiro, and people around him.But it is a minor flaw, in an otherwise perfect documentary depicting man who is passionated about sushi. So viewers who liked Kings of Pastry (2009)and thought El Bulli: Cooking in Progress (2011)was, dry and impersonal but still wants to see a great documentary about cooking should see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people would categorize this as a "foodie" movie. Yes the main character is a sushi chef, and the food scenes are beautifully shot, but I felt that the film dealt with a topic much deeper than food, but of the purpose of life itself. One obviously has to respect Jiro and what he has accomplished in his life, but it seemed there were some thing missing for a life lived at that high of a level. His wife never appears in the movie, apart from a b/w picture. You rarely see Jiro smile. And the most telling part is that many of his customers felt intimidated dining in the presence of such a great master.I see this film highlighting a basic structural cornerstone in Japanese society, the concept of respect. From what I can see and have experienced, respect is the highest honor that can be paid in Japanese society, and Jiro has achieved it. Respect from his customers, his peers, his family. I saw the love of perfection Jiro had for the art of creating sushi. I'm not sure if there was love shown for his family and sons who were carrying on the tradition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never eaten sushi in my life, but would throw all pending assumptions and thoughts out the window if I was offered sushi made by the great Jiro Ono, the main subject of the documentary, Jiro Dreams of Sushi. He tells us early on in the film that the key to success is immersing yourself in your work and what you do, and being a dedicated and sophisticated employee, never complaining or expressing disdain for your job.Ono has been running a three-star (the highest rating) sushi shop in Tokyo for decades and never misses a beat. His shop is the go-to place for unmatchable sushi, luxurious decor, and elegant atmosphere, yet the month-in-advance reservations (probably have gone up to six month reservations after the release of this documentary) and the expensive dining may turn off customers in the area. This isn't some place you could just decide to eat at one night for dinner on impulse for reasons other than the long wait. You must prepare yourself in stomach and spirit to eat here.The film shows the man himself at eighty-six years old, still rising at dawn everyday to go and work for his sushi establishment in a tireless fashion. He hates holidays the most, because that means he has to stay home and be bored. He left home at seven, has never reconnected with his parents, but has kept his sons close by for his entire life. His eldest, Yoshikazu, fifty, has been working beside him since he was nineteen years old. He hated it back then, but now sees the job as meaningful and honorary. One day, Jiro emphasizes, Yoshikazu will have to man the shop by himself, and that is a day he fears will come too soon.While Yoshikazu is obviously skilled, it is noted that he is not the painstaking perfectionist that his father his. When Jiro rises at dawn, he goes into the shop and eyes every little detail, such as the arrangement of the plates, silverware, and even what hand the customers eat with so he knows where to place the sushi on their marble pallets. It is difficult to find a man so dedicated and intricate about his seemingly simple line of work, and one man in the documentary claims that even if Yoshikazu's sushi doesn't measure up to his fathers' when he dies by the slightest thing, people will likely not return to the restaurant. And even if his sushi is twice as good, it will only be viewed as "just as good." Jiro's younger son, Takashi, runs a two-star restaurant in Tokyo for many years, but he boasts a more casual atmosphere for his customers, rather than the mature and stern one his father has created. Both Jiro and Takashi have one thing in common and that is they boast a rather minimalist slice of fish as their course, yet they meticulously pack so much flavor and craft into that little piece that the taste and impact is never forgotten. There is even a full segment in the film where Jiro explains the difference between fatty, medium, and lean tuna, explaining that while fatty tuna has a predictable taste to it, lean tuna boasts a more subtle concoction of elegance.One questionable omission from the documentary is why we never hear or see Jiro's wife. Assuming she's even still alive, she must've had a grand opinion on her husband line of work and her sons who relentlessly try and model off of him. Unfortunately, her absence leaves somewhat of hole in an otherwise perfect film.A food critic who makes many appearances at Jiro's restaurant is quoted in saying there are five attributes that should make up every chef. They are consistency, the hunger for improvement, cleanliness, impatience, and are all tied together by unbreakable passion for their work. The critic explains how he believes that Jiro soars in all of these characteristics, stating that he has never seen a restaurant leader employ so much seriousness in his work, nor has he ever seen one so harsh and critical of it even after countless years of success.Walking into Jiro Dreams of Sushi blind, much like seeing Bill Cunningham: New York, a documentary on The New York Times fashion photographer, I went in interested but questioning the purpose for profiling a character who does something so simple that there must be more to his personality, creativity, motivation, and charm, and sure enough, I was on the right track. Much like the people I found in Mark Wexler's extraordinary documentary, How To Live Forever on centenarians, we see an aging man who is quicker and smarter than most of the people found on reality Television and is doing something of sheer simplicity and meaning, yet he can not get broader, more mainstream recognition. Jiro Dreams of Sushi is the reason why documentaries are and should be made, and that reason is to showcase talents, uniqueness, and memorable quirks that would otherwise go tragically unnoticed in a society dominated by "the next big laugh." Starring: Jiro Ono, Yoshikazi Ono, and Takashi Ono. Directed by: David Gelb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An absolutely outstanding film. Japanese culture is full of honor and respect. This is a film in which Jiro would be proud of, one which carries on his legacy for future generations. As the world economy becomes more dependent on machines, it is awe inspiring to see a craft based art form such as cooking portrayed in such a masterful documentary. Frequently you are slack jawed at the cinematography, classical soundscape, and the intoxicating atmosphere of industrialized Japan. Sushi in itself is a simple dish, (only fish and rice) but throughout the documentary you are further acquainted as to how Jiro is able to make the best Sushi in the world.As a designer and creative individual, I can relate to many of the messages in this film. There is no end to perfection. Jiro has been making sushi for 75 years, but he still believes that he can improve and that there is more to the art form. A lot of creative people in western culture would do well with a dose of modesty from time to time, especially in modern technological landscape. This film inspires myself to keep pursuing the perfect combination, the sublime art which manifests itself as the ultimate form of power. An ability to be immortal. To live on through your craft and inspire people to become a better version of themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's More Than an Old Man Talking about Making Sushi; It's a Zen Master Dispensing Wisdom about Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, this documentary is about an old Japanese man running a small sushi restaurant being respected by his sons and vendors and raved by critics and customers; but this is really about a human being with a single-minded purpose and dedication to achieve a sense of balance, content, and near perfection in his life. That's why this documentary is much more delicious than the unique sushi that Jiro San made before his customers. It's a lot more than about food. In the film, it compares Jiro San's serving sushi with conducting a symphony. You can say that to hear Jiro talking about his humble past and his laser-beam precision and dedication to make the best sushi he could is like to listen to a Zen master dispensing his wisdom about finding one's purpose and achieving an ultimate enlightenment and content in life.And his wisdom is particularly timely and invaluable now, when the prevailing practice is that you should do as many things as you can, in as the shortest possible period of time, for a maximum possible financial reward and name recognition. In short, life is too short, you must run really fast to get what you want.Life is indeed too short. But Jiro's unique story shows that you can enjoy this short journey by slowing down and focusing on one particular thing dear to your heart and giving your best to make it shine. It can be as mundane as making sushi. Find yours, and start living, not chasing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fully satisfying documentary that had a special, aesthetic resonance for me that transcended its (very interesting!) subject.The film concerns the family dynasty of the world's most celebrated sushi chef, an 85 year old who has turned his work into a kind of religion, one he imparts to his two sons. One starts to worry about his older son, the one Japanese custom demands take over his father's hallowed establishment. But by the end (this is a very "dramativized" doc) one realizes the son has inherited his father's genius, and perhaps surpassed it, without even wholly wanting to do so. The film uses its portrait of one extraordinary family to convey the reality of an authentic subculture and an entire culinary world. As you would guess, it functions very effectively as Food-Porn. For me, though, by far the most impressive thing about this film is the camera-work, and I don't mean that in the usual sense. The director/ DOP does a fine job. But at the end of the day, we have the camera to thank for this film's unique grandeur. I watched this with my filmmaker friend Nani Walker and she informed me that this is amongst the first features to be shot with the "Red Camera," a new digital invention. I feel it to be an extraordinary new motion picture medium. It is a moving image with the light reflexivity of still photography. As with a static lens, it moves in and out of soft and deep focus, almost as if with a mind of its own. When I was young I dreamed of being a filmmaker. My fantasized "signature look" was exactly this marriage of aesthetics. Now it can be a reality. I have followed the works of particular film directors, writers, DOPs, perhaps now I will follow the "career" of the Red Camera technology. Perhaps this camera, this automaton tool, will now become my favorite auteur.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jiro Dreams Of Sushi" is an absolutely wonderful documentary about 85 year old Jiro Ono, a man renown as being the world's greatest sushi chef. And not only is director David Gelb's film a portrait of a man who has found what he loves doing and has literally made it his life but, an in-depth look at the traditions and ways of the making of sushi from the picking out of the best fish to all the precise preparations. All this is told through the eyes of Jiro and his oldest son and heir to his restaurant, Yoshikazu. We learn about a Jiro, a perfectionist and traditionalist who rarely is away from his 10 seat restaurant situated in a Tokyo subway station, as he prepares his sushi and teaches his son and apprentices an art he has crafted to perfection. It's hard not to admire and be inspired by a man who truly loves what he does and works tirelessly making sure everything is perfect every day. Despite being an intensely demanding man he remains a very happy and charming one and it's hard not to like Jiro and why would you not want to? And if the heartwarming story of the energetic master Jiro and his world famous sushi restaurant is not enough, this may be the most loving ode to sushi itself ever committed to film. A truly fascinating documentary about a truly fascinating and admirable man. I can't recommend this documentary enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Allow me to start out by saying this. Whether or not you like sushi or are revolted by it is not at all relevant. This movie categorizes itself as a documentary but that is not an accurate representation. It ought to be categorized as a life lesson, and a way of life. Jiro, the protagonist and celebrity of Japan is anything but ordinary. From the age of seven Jiro has understood the world could not care less who you are or where you came from and will leave you for dead regardless of what potential you may have.His father disappeared from his life and unlike most sad stories Jiro did not have a single mother to live with. He had no-one but himself and Japan and began a life of hard labor before he could properly spell. Jiro did not pity himself, nor did he question why life was this way to him. At the age of ten he discovered the art of sushi and never looked back. Some of you skeptics may be saying, okay whatever he had a rough upbringing with no family and was on the streets, whoopie, and that is understandable because a heartwarming story of success alone does not make a film great.What separates this film is the in depth, seldom seen characterization, that is presented with little to no effort. Within a few minutes the viewer has an understanding that Jiro is humble, yet confident, bold, yet insightful, strong, yet understanding. Jiro almost never takes days off because he has found his passion in life and sees life as meaningless without sushi. The most amazing thing however is his superhuman ability to have unprecedented self awareness. He understands that despite the fact that he is widely considered the greatest sushi chef ever known to modern man, contemporary or otherwise, he is constantly striving to improve, not because he wants more accolades (which he has plenty of) but because he honestly believes there is no such thing as good enough. Jiro could not care less that he has three Michelin stars, or is in the guiness book of world records, yes this is spoken about in the film but not by him, he is constantly training aspiring chefs and ensuring that his two sons are prepared to flourish when he inevitably passes on.Jiro is one of the most meticulous, systematic people you will ever see and he is the epitome of modest. He does not praise himself, only those who provide him with what he needs such as his rice dealer or fish dealers. These people do not work for Jiro directly but they care solely about his opinion, and making sure that Jiro gets what he wants because they understand this cult of personality is a once in a generation type of individual.I could go on and on but I will let you watch this magnificent film as the director seems to be nearly as humble as Jiro as he let his work do the talking. If you see one film the rest of your existence on earth see this one. I kid you not you will come close to tears at the end despite the fact that no one dies, or anything catastrophic happens, but because for 82 minutes you can forget about all the perils of the human condition and bask in the glory that is the aura of Jiro.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A loving ode to a true master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jiro Dreams of Sushi" is the portrait of a man who has dedicated his life to improving and perfecting his craft. Sukiyabashi Jiro is one of the most well-known and highest-rated sushi restaurants in Tokyo. Unassuming as they come, it is a hole-in-the-wall beneath street-level; yet a reservation requires at least a month in advance, and a meal will run you 30,000 yen (just about 400 dollars). It only seats ten, and there are no appetizers or casual environment for drinking and chatting. You're there for the best sushi in Tokyo, and that's it. And the reputation speaks for itself. Recipient of the coveted 3-Star rating in the Michelin Guide, the restaurant (as well as its eponymous owner) is considered the best of the best.Such an enterprise requires a man who thinks of little else but his work, and that is the essence of Jiro. He exists to go to work each day, and he never takes a day off. He has taken his two sons into apprenticeship, and intends to one day hand off the reins to them. And they have it even harder, living under the shadow of the true maestro of the art form.But what makes this movie so fascinating (besides the gorgeous sushi, which only made my mouth water) is seeing what makes this man tick; his incredible sense of honor (he goes to great lengths to find the freshest, best fish), the rigorous adherence to his work, and the need to create something special for his customers. He is never satisfied, he is always laboring, and he stands as the quintessential consummate craftsman. I greeted the end credits with a huge smile on my face. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total Sushi Porn. And much more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost entirely free of any cinematic ornamentation, clean and graceful as the confections that Sukiyabashi Jiro Ono and his team (including his 50 year-old son laboring in his shadow) craft. It is a portrait of perfection and of an artist giving everything he has to his medium. Giving us the sense that even his definition of family has been compromised by his search for continued refinement (where is his wife in all of this?) But the artist remains buried beneath the weight of his art. And his art turns out to be staggeringly cinematic. It's truly amazing how exciting the whole endeavor seems. And when, after spending time with some of the most discerning fish and rice dealers on the planet, after watching the meticulous preparation and presentation, after being exposed to the elegant philosophies of life and work that have governed Jiro's existence, just when you're not entirely sure how the narrative can find a course towards a satisfying conclusion, it all ends in a nod to the chefs that serve the master, acknowledging that no man is an artist alone, and that one day the art of pure sushi preparation will pass into more than capable hands. David Gelb is a filmmaker who has kept his eyes and his heart wide open, only to return with a beautiful, humanist and even, in a sly way, tragic film (Jiro's art has not just eclipsed his family but also comes off as a kind of sublimation for dealing with early childhood trauma), all about making and eating raw fish... and living an all consuming creative life. Gorgeous. My only real complaint, I could have done without the Phillip Glass score. Glass has become a documentary clich at this point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horrible insight into the mass murder of our sea creatures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** CONTAINS SPOILERS **** I'm wondering why there are no other Reviewers who have commented on this film's disgusting display of mass slaughter of our sea creatures by the Japanese. I had to turn this movie off half way through. It was so horrible to get a glimpse into those seafood markets where there are massive amounts of beautiful sea creatures captured and held in plastic bags and nets only to be auctioned away for slaughter. This reminded me of a animal rights documentary showcasing how the Japanese are destroying our oceans and the creatures that swim within them. I'm so sad that such pressure is put on Japanese sushi chefs to find the absolute best meat and to serve it at the highest price. This has produced a culture that lives and breathes off the mass slaughter of our ocean's inhabitants, and quite frankly I think it needs to be stopped.Really disgusted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tucked away in a busy Tokyo subway is Sukiyabashi Jiro, a humble-looking sushi restaurant that only seats ten people. But this unassuming place is actually quite famous and has that rare distinction of having received a three star rating from the internationally respected Michelin guide. People come from all over the world to sample the culinary creations of the restaurant's head chef, 85 year old Jiro Ono. Patrons can wait months for a reservation. Meals here cost $300 for a 20 course meal consisting of different sushi recipes, all hand crafted, and the experience last for about 30 minutes. Quite expensive, but, by all accounts, well worth it. "For a fast eater, a meal there might last only 15 minutes, making it the most expensive meal in the world,'' comments Tokyo restaurant critic Yamamoto. In his first feature-length film, David Gelb gives us a glimpse behind the scenes of the restaurant and its legendary founder. There are some mouth-watering scenes of the painstaking food preparation, which will appeal to those people currently hooked on the raft of television cooking shows. Jiro himself has been working since he was nine, and he shows no sign of slowing down. He has a wonderful philosophy on working, parenting, and life itself. A workaholic from a young age, it's clear that Jiro has made numerous sacrifices along the way. He even acknowledges at one point that he wasn't much of a father to his children. We also get to meet his two sons Yoshikazu and Takashi. Yoshikazu is the elder son and faces the pressures of stepping into his father's shoes and taking over the legendary restaurant. The real tensions between father and son are subtly yet perceptively hinted at, although we get a hint of the pride he feels for his sons. Takashi, the younger son, has opened his own sushi restaurant in a shopping mall in Roppongi Hills, a suburb outside Tokyo. Gelb also includes some interviews with former sushi chefs who have worked with Jiro, and they talk about the high standards maintained by the perfectionist. We also hear from Tokyo restaurant critic Yamamoto, who hardly seems impartial in his glowing reviews of the restaurant, and the fish dealer who supplies Jiro. Gelb also takes us on a journey through Tokyo's massive and teeming Tsukiji fish market, but he only pays lip service to the problems concerning the environmental impacts of over fishing and the reliance on seafood. The film borders on hagiography at times, and there are scant biographical details that give us more insight into Jiro. There is some archival footage and a little bit of history, but Jiro remains essentially an enigma. Like the recent documentary El Bulli: Cooking In Progress this film has limited appeal. It is far too long for its thin subject matter, and the numerous scenes of food preparation eventually become repetitive. However, the film has been beautifully photographed by Gelb himself, using the Red Camera. The minimalist music score from Phillip Glass and Max Richter adds little to the overall film itself. Jiro Dreams Of Sushi would be better suited as a 50 minute documentary for television. While Jiro may dream of sushi, I dream only of getting back these 80 minutes of my life.</fullReview>
