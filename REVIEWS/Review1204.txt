		<shortDescription>Really liked this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a really good movie, I don't understand all the critic's pans. Yes, there is a sci-fi element, so what? Jericho is a man who suffered a brain injury as a child that took away the use of his frontal lobe. This left him with the animal instincts of survival with basically no other human emotional traits as well as leaving that portion of his brain as virtually a blank canvas. The movie was action-packed, there were no slow points, the acting was spot on, the photography was great, the characters well defined. Jericho is a human experiment that the government forced to happen. The results are what one might expect from government interference in such a situation. If the world every goes full on crazy, I want Jericho on my team! I would go to see this movie again with a friend and I will certainly buy the DVD when it comes out. Costner is such a well developed actor and does a great job with the part. Make no mistake, that Jericho dude is one bad...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie to see. Costner does a good job in his portrayal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very good movie I am so glad I went to see it in spite of the spoilers people have been saying about it. Kevin Costner did a great job of transitioning from a bad guy to a guy that was just learning to have emotions love the ending of the movie. You should go see this movie in spite of the critics. I don't want to give too much detail about the movie but I really enjoyed it. In the beginning he didn't do what everyone wanted him to do and I think that is what made the movie good because it wasn't straight up predictable. Some parts you may guess on but not totally. When the bad guys make progress you enjoy seeing g them get what's coming to them. Go see this movie. Great cast too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr Costner.... WOW</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first ever review of a movie and boy what movie.The cast is perfect, the setting is brilliant. The story flawless (if you let yourself go with it)First of all let me say that Mr Costner has proved beyond a shadow of a doubt he is one of the greatest actors of this or any generation. His performance is powerful, stirring and just plain amazing. I would never of thought he could portray a character like this. This is not the man from Robin Hood.. far from a Field of Dreams and so much more than a Waterworld. The pace never lets up and you will find yourself shocked, stunned , cheering, laughing and wincing in equal measure. All parts are played by cast brilliantly and with conviction. The action sequences do not feel like set pieces but more like a fluid progression of the plight of the main character. Gal Godot is beautiful in this movie, frail and torn and you can see it, I mean really see it. Ms Gabot is proving to be far more than a pretty face (not that I only thought that) Ryan Renolds is on key as usual in a familiar kind of role. At one point (i'll let you figure which part I mean) my heart breaks for the man. Gary Oldman is frantic and who can blame him , also brilliantly done. I'm not going to dissect the movie as I'm sure many will but only say be prepared for a movie that will draw you in and keep you hooked until the very end and then have you begging for the movie to be longer. Down to direction, location, stunts, sfx BRAVO !! I'm not sure if this is a movie that will be looked upon as Oscar worthy (it should be) but for the sake of common sense and justice to a great performance, Mr Kevin Costner take a bow and I hope beyond hope that you get the recognition you deserve for this movie... Outstanding !!!!! P.S sorry if my grammar offends (or amuses) :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through, and I thought I could figure it all out, but I was never able to see the twists and turns ahead of time. The thing I like best about it is that the movie - despite all the action, and gory action at that - is really all about people. People and personalities and knowing good vs evil and wrong from right...and how a person can know wrong from right, and then cherish that knowledge once one sees it. If it was a book it would be a page turner.I was disappointed that few people were in the theater, and I can only speculate that most of the main actors are...what, too old to draw in the crowd? If so, that's sad, because this one is really worth seeing. Even buying a copy to keep.And Kevin Costner deserves an Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Criminal" (2016) is kinda "been there saw that" type of flick - nothing original, nothing super exciting, but as a one evening guilty pleasure it does it's job, at least partly.The cast is superb, and everyone did their OK jobs for the material, except for Tommy Lee Jones - this is "you got to be kidding me" type of performance - he goes with one facial expression during whole flick, expression that says "what am i doing here? what is this thing?".Overall, nice execution and OK story with some fun acting makes this flick work for one boring evening. There is even some descent music in it, the one in the van and the one at very end - closing song was great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>everything is wrong with this movie. the plot makes no sense. with the exception of Costner, the acting is pretty bad. especially gary oldman. (sorry). snippets are borrowed from almost every movie ever made. including a scene where the hero sews himelf up surgically (see Harrison ford), which itself was stolen from a 40's noir. nothing makes any sense. no one acts in a logical way, although I don't know how one would act under these circumstances. they put ryan Reynold's brain in kevin Costner. ryan has a secret which a lot of folks want. something about blowing up the world, I think. and off we go from there. that's it. and yet, and yet I had a good time. maybe I wasn't on the edge of my seat, but I was having fun with all this. the whole thing moves right along at a fast pace and there is a totally illogical happy ending. it's a perfectly wonderful Saturday afternoon at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed but very watchable thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No spoilers if you've seen the trailer (oh and the trailer really is one of those where if you've seen it, then you've seen all the best bits).Criminal on paper looks like a safe bet, it's produced by super 'B' movie producer Avi Lerner (Olympus/London has fallen, Expendables) has an A list cast and a much worn premise, along the lines of Face Off or Ryan Reynolds lukewarm thriller from 2015 Self/less, involving body/mind swap sci-fi, while being set in a present day surrounding.The premise, Reynolds young spy has his memory's implanted into Kevin Costners gruff, violent criminal by Dr Tommy Lee Jones, overseen by mostly shouty Spy boss Gary Oldman, to stop some bad men doing bad things with hacking and missiles. Costner's criminal escapes and goes on a bit of a rampage through London whilst also wrestling his own violent nature against Reynolds softer character traits seeping through (so basically he's got a bit of a split personality going on).In other words it's a silly high concept plot line to effectively have Costner run around a city, beat up some bad guys, get into shoot outs, chases and save the day.He also along the way tracks down Gal Gadot who is Reynolds wife, and by far the best at delivering anything near a believable character, followed by Tommy Lee Jones (in a very restrained role) in a very mixed bag of a movie.The film was made for around 30 million dollars, so don't expect much big blockbuster action, although the few car chases and explosions there are, are done decently, the film still at times feels quite cheap. The pace is a little off as well as its a bit of a slog and feels longer than it should at times.In terms of tone it's violent, full of bad language, and seems to think both of those pass as humour, they don't in the context they are used in this film and are frankly pretty misjudged.The performances vary, by far the worst being Gary Oldman who whilst normally excellent simply feels like he's in another film altogether at times, he literally shouts his scenes of dialogue at times when it seems a quieter authority would have been better suited.As for leading man Costner, he's playing a pretty unlikeable fella here, so you would expect the filmmakers to try and inject some charm for an audience to sympathize or grow some kind of emotional attachment, but no Costner simply grunts and swears through most scenes in a gruff lazy drool, he's watchable as always but doesn't have much to work with here, though they do try to have him form a Bond with mother and child later on its quite late in proceedings.There's some good touches, Gal Gadot brings out a softer side of Costner's character, there's a decent mix of Electro music and the film score used is atmospheric, some of the visuals are decent, shots of London for example and the action scenes whilst only short bursts are clear to see and not confusing and finally there's the thriller plot aspect of the story that plays like a standard spy/action thriller as our (anti) hero must set out to stop the villains and save the girl.In closing, mixed performances, misplaced serious tone with violent outbursts of humour, some decent action but a bit of misguided film, watchable, not terrible but quite frustrating given the fact there's a better movie in there that could of got out.3 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has been saved by its stars: Ryan Reynolds first and Kevin Costner few minutes later will make you forget most of plot's unbelievable logical holes, awful editing (what's Alice Eve's end?), repetitive scenes and complete lack of bad guy's motive (Jordi Moll?).And Tommy Lee Jones, Gal Gadot, Gary Oldman and Michael Pitt (Alice Eve here is little more than an extra) strive to fill with workmanship and dignity their otherwise gaunt supporting roles.They all succeed in saving the day and in the end you won't fall asleep or leave theater in contempt. But on your way home you could probably comment that this is one of the most useless (or unconvincing) films you ever watched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twenty years ago, a similar film called Face Off debuted, and while the story seemed ridiculous, somehow it worked. Criminal is in the same boat, as audiences have been kept away by the complicated plot, which also seems to work quite well. The film starts with the brutal murder of a CIA agent, who has a secret vital to national security in his head. Out of desperation, the CIA turns to a doctor and an experimental procedure, which will allow the agents memories to be transferred into someone else's mind. The only problem is that the procedure requires a certain type of mind, the mind of a psychopath. Against his will, Jericho Stewart (Kevin Costner) is transferred to CIA headwaters and given the agents memories, but will he become the good agent and help save the world, or will he return to his murderous ways? Kevin Costner stars and reminds us all of what a terrific actor he truly is. It's hard to remember, considering that for the passed two decades he's done mostly romantic garbage, that you couldn't pay me to sit through. Costner returns to action as if he'd never been gone and does an amazing job playing this deeply conflicted, flawed man. Paired with an all-star cast, that features a ton of cameos, Criminal never slows down and will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time. It's not really the CIA crisis or the science fiction that keeps your interest throughout, it's the conflict growing in Jericho Stewart's brain, as he has essential turned into a person that is both good and evil. Yes, the story is a bit complicated, but it is fairly easy to follow, and Kevin Costner gives his best performance in at least a decade, making Criminal well worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant from start to finish! (contains possible spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I'm sure a lot of people are going to see it as an action film and nothing more. But really, it's so much deeper than that. "Criminal" is brilliant. Everything about it, the setup, the cinematography, the music, the story, all of it is this intricate dance that teases us with bits and pieces before it's finally laid out before us. The directing, how beautifully choreographed everything is, the quick scene shots that build the tension, are truly masterful. Gal Gadot, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Ryan Reynolds all perfect in their parts. Ariel Vromen has crafted an amazing work.But Kevin Costner was just amazing. If you think you know him from his movies, well, you find that you really don't know him at all. Watching the transition from somewhere between a child and an animal, thinking only of survival, to a thinking, feeling human being is really beyond words to describe. And the way he plays Jericho, like how he holds his hands as if they're in shackles, even when he's free to let you know that he's been in the system more than he's been out. You could see him as simply a brutal thug, but he is so much more. On one level, he's an animal, doing what it takes to survive. People don't really exist to him, except to take things from. He doesn't really relate to them at all. At the same time, he's a child, never being able to grow past a certain point, stuck at the time of the accident, acting out as a child would. The short time that Ryan Reynolds' character has on screen is crucial to the way the story plays out for Jericho. And, as the movie progresses, we see flashes of Bill Pope, not just the memories, but the mannerisms, the gestures, even the facial expressions and tone of voice. Kevin Costner has done this so perfectly, so subtly, that it might slip past the most casual of viewers, but it's a critical piece of the story. It's fascinating to watch the flashes of the other personality, Jericho's confusion at the whole idea of feelings, something utterly foreign to him. He has these feelings, and isn't even sure what to call them at first. His sudden familiarity with language, pass codes, computers, stand out to us because they're so very NOT Jericho. But the easy facility with all of them IS Bill Pope, and they're played as if Bill is operating inside Jericho's body, which he is. But not all the time, which makes it even more interesting to watch, the flip back and forth between this near animal and the family man/agent/very civilized human being.The anarchist, Xavier Heimdahl, and the CIA head, Quaker Wells, look very similar to each other. I don't think this is an accident. They are both driven men, not averse to violence, doing anything to achieve their ends. Xavier is trying to use one man's knowledge to destroy everything, Quaker is using one man's knowledge to stop him. Two sides of the same coin. Everyone is expendable to them. They are both zealots.I love the extra touches, the homage to "Flowers For Algernon" (if you read the book, you'll know), for example.Yes, it's a violent movie, but the violence is a necessary part if you're going to understand what's going on, the nature of memory, the difficult and unlikely hero's journey that our main character takes. If you want a movie that delivers far more than mere action, this is it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a movie with a storyline.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie yesterday and was glad to see a movie with a storyline. After several weeks of searching for a decent movie to go see, I came across this one. Thank goodness it was not a movie with nothing but CGI to hold it together. Before I decided to write my review, I looked over some of the reviews. Obviously the norm nowadays when reviewing a movie is to nit pick it to death. First of all, I enjoyed this movie. It started right off the bat involving you in the movie and making you think. The story was different and interesting. Using a really, really bad guy and turning him into a hero took some doing, but I think it came off very well. Just when you thought you had it figured out, there came another twist to the plot. Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones and Ryan Reynolds were excellent in their roles. Overall, a good movie. I would recommend this movie. If you enjoy a movie with a good storyline, then this is for you. I would add this one to my DVD collection. Forgo any reviews and critics' reviews and make up your own mind. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really got my attention. I wasn't expecting much. Had saw the trailer and also saw the grades here and it all made me expect just a regular movie. The true is the movie story and actions worked pretty good and I just loved it. Was a pretty nice movie to watch and see time passing fast. I do recommend it. Kevin Costner did a great job on that movie, probably one of his best action movies from the last years. They did some aggressive scenes witch easily made my day. They did mixed all this free violence with a impressive love story and it actually worked nice. The main character and his craziness made me get different ideas from the begin until the end. It's funny how you just hate this guy and then how you became to change your mind during the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What a F***ING MESS" (dialog, Gary Oldman, 1:09 timestamp)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well first of all any movie that puts Costner, Lee Jones and Oldman back in front of the camera deserves our attention. Also fun to see Adkins in a purely supporting role that does not involve him breaking buildings with his elbows.Second, any movie that literally kills off Ryan Reynolds in the first five minutes you know is going to be .... interesting.Well, to skip ahead to the verdict, this movie is strangely fun and engrossing in spite of its many plot holes and script errors.What plot holes you ask? Well, not to give too much away (because I am recommending the movie) you need to remember that the entire story is about an attempt to save the world by "transplanting" memories from a dead man to a live one, that this is done for the first time on a human, and that time is of the essence.OK, with that firmly in mind, you will watch the movie and notice that, in spite of the above, on NOT ONE BUT TWO OCCASIONS the character played by Oldman decides the whole thing is simply not working and essentially throws Costner's character away the way a fisherman throws a fish back into the ocean.Following which mayhem ensues and he regrets it.Yes this is indeed a plot device to move things along (in real life people are not that stupid) but the writers use the device not once but TWICE. By the second time, the viewer is going whhaaaa ... didn't we learn anything from the last time??? If you can dig deep within yourself and find the grace to forgive these small failings, not a bad film.</fullReview>

The basic thing that intrigued me was the concept and premise but as I write this review I should say that they just averaged across where the acting especially of Costner sir was worth praising. Others like gal, Gary, Tommy just stood as ever bringing nothing more new to their characters or actions. I should say that you should definitely give this one a look to let the judgement come from yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One-Sided 'Face/Off'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Criminal", starring Kevin Costner-3 Days To Kill, Man of Steel; Gary Oldman-Robocop, The Dark Knight movies; Tommy Lee Jones-Captain America:The First Avenger; Gal Gadot-Batman v Superman:Dawn of Justice and Ryan Reynolds-Deadpool, Adventureland.This is a sci-fi/spy movie about a mind transplant. Remember the 1997 'Face/Off', with Nicolas Cage &amp; John Travolta? It's kind of like that, but one-sided, what with one of them being dead, both minds go into one body. Ryan is a CIA operative that is on the run in London, after putting a sought after hacker called 'The Dutchman' into a safe house. Problems arise when Ryan gets caught and killed by the bad guys-without giving up the safe house, of course. Gary is head of the CIA branch in London and comes up with a plan to transfer Ryan's memories into someone, so they can find the hacker. He just happens to track down a doctor, Tommy, that has been experimenting with this exact brain transferal, but only on rats, so far. The only available human subject available, on such short notice, is Kevin, a condemned sociopath on death row. The surgery is done but does not seem to work, so Kevin is escorted back to prison. Guess what? He escapes and the memories start ebbing into his mind. Gal plays Ryan's wife. Kevin goes back and forth between having no feelings and not caring between right and wrong to remembering Gal and other key bits of information. Now, the bad guys and the good guys want him and the chase is on. It's rated "R" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 53 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that contradicts to its own title.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a movie named Criminal, it shows us not much of a real criminal, but a bunch of simple-minded people. The complex plot that entangles itself is absolutely to blame for ruining a cast of great actors, including one of my favorite Gary Oldman. Yet, it gets worse with its messed up emotions. For a movie like this, there is no need for almost two hours to play it.The first twenty minutes tricks us into believing this is a movie involving a intelligent agent. But no, he died shortly after, and there we can only admire our great Ryan Reynolds from all kinds of retrospect. Is there really a need to use Ryan Reynolds to play a background story that can be briefed in two sentences briefing? "An agent was sent to engage with a renegade of a terrorist group. The mission failed with the death of the agent, and now the subject who owns control to mass destructive weapons is lost."Somehow, every character in this film is stupid. The composed commissioner Gordon is being reckless that he actually let an important asset go twice and then regrets his decision, twice. The devastated widow of Bill is amazing, as well. She is so touched by a guy who claims to have his deceased husband's memory that she forgot this guy broke into his house and tied her up. I guess this is the power of memory? I really don't know what to say except good for you Jerico. Getting out of jail and get yourself a free family. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that you will be the new Bill in the CIA just because you have the memory of a former agent.As for a convict who claims, once again, having the set of skills and intelligence of a CIA agent, Jerico does not really utilize much of his "skill". How do you not know you will immediately expose yourself when you try to pretend a guy who's already dead? How? Furthermore, I guess when you know there will be people looking after you, the last thing you want to do is punching a lot of people to expose your whereabouts.Finally, the only watchable thing might be the emotion links in Bill's family. A family reunites with its father through memory. However, I was not convinced at all. With so many memory clips, the ones with every member of the family are scarce. What we have is a bunch of useless ones involving the Dutchman and erotic scene with Jill. If you want to build emotion about family that can get the audience to sympathize, a simple scene of the parents pushing a swing will be enough. Don't show us no damn silver brush. You don't convince anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mixing medical technology with espionage may not be a novel idea but in the hands of writers Douglas Cook and David Weisberg and director Ariel Vromen the marriage produces a nonstop action film that ranks up there with the best of them to appeal to the audience need for grit. The very solid cast makes it happen and keeps our attention from square one. Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds) is a CIA agent on a mission in London tracking down a shadowy hacker nicknamed "The Dutchman" (Michael Pitt). When he gets mysteriously ambushed and killed, an experimental procedure performed by Dr. Franks (Tommy Lee Jones) is used to transfer his memories into dangerous ex-convict Jericho Stewart (Kevin Costner). When he wakes up with the CIA agent's memories, Jericho's mission is to find The Dutchman and eliminate him before the hacker launches ICBM's and starts World War III. But complications soon arise and the mission turns personal. Gary Oldman plays Quaker Wells, the man obsessed by his own manipulations to save the world from the enemy ? including a mastermind Xavier Heimdahl (Jordi Moll?) ? with the help of Jill Pope (Bill's widow) played by newcomer Gal Gadot, and Marta Lynch (Alice Eve) et al. This is a noisy but very fast paced action film with a brain ? the script makes sense (memory transplantation as a means of saving the experience of a deceased CIA operative). One of the aspects of the memory transplantation is the fact that it gives the 'man without feeling' Jericho the ability to feel and love ? and that saves the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jan Stroop (Michael Pitt) aka the Dutchman wants to make a deal with the CIA and give up the Wormhole (a program that controls all missile weapon systems of the United States) in exchange for money and his freedom. Agent Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds) is on his way to the Dutchman to complete the deal when he is killed. The CIA has Pope's memories installed into Jericho (Kevin Costner) a really bad guy, animal-like with no empathy for anyone. Will that operation turn Jericho into a good guy and find the Dutchman? (We can only hope) Let's find out. This will have you on your seat most of the time so find a good relaxing couch. The CGI and physical stunts along with the heart- pounding music will keep you awake and alert. The acting all around is excellent. We don't like seeing Jericho do the mean things he does, but we have to get over that and see (and hope) if Pope's memories take hold as Doctor Francis (Tommy Lee Jones) insists they will. The pacing is fast and furious almost like a Jason Bourne movie. What's not to like?There is one very big plot hole early on as Jericho escapes his CIA custody. Why didn't the CIA keep a closer eye on Pope's home to see if Jericho goes there? Had they done so they could have corralled Jericho quicker and made him comply with the mission he agreed to. Can the CIA be this inept? Let's find out. Things begin to turn, but not too quickly, for Jericho when he encounters Pope's wife Jill (Gal Gadot) and daughter Emma (Lara Decaro). Here the pacing slows down and we get to enjoy a friendlier Jericho. Will it last? Let's find out. We see CIA Chief Wells (Gary Oldman) constantly looking for Jericho and the Dutchman as both elude CIA surveillance. His blood pressure rises when he learns the Russians are now in contact with the Dutchman for the Wormhole and he cannot let the Russians get that program. There is a truly unexpected twist near the end when chief bad guy Xavier (Jordi Molla) jets away with the Wormhole. (Whaaat?)Over all this is an excellent thriller despite some minor plot holes. (There are others?) The action is fast and furious and we like it that way, but we also liked the scenes with Gal Gadot, Lara Decaro and Kevin Costner and these scenes were pure gold. In order to appreciate this movie we need to get over seeing Kevin Costner as a bad guy and hope beyond hope that he eventually turns into a good guy. Will he? Go find out. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cosner is Excellent in Convoluted Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a film filled with unsavory characters, it turns out that the most likable is the hardened criminal without a heart or a brain, as played by Kevin Costner."Criminal" weaves together multiple plot strands in a race against time to stop a potentially mad industrialist named Xavier Heimdahl, who may potentially destroy the world with stolen software. An intelligence agent played by Ryan Reynolds dies in the attempt to thwart the villain. In the meantime, the protegé of Heimdahl, a young man called The Dutchman, has intercepted the secret computer program, and he becomes a threat to national security when he threatens to indiscriminately launch missiles.To stop the villains, the research scientist played by Tommy Lee Jones implants stem cells of the deceased Ryan Reynolds character into the brain of the criminal played by Costner. The criminal has no function of his front lobe area, so he is the perfect recipient of the "mind" of the Reynolds CIA agent. Costner's character, named Jerico, then becomes the bait to get back that precious software. The head of intelligence, who should one of the heroes, is actually one of the most nefarious creatures in the film, and is played with great gusto by Gary Oldman.But the strength of the film is the softening of Costner's character Jerico, especially in his budding relationship with the widow and daughter of the deceased intelligence agent. In a film that includes nonstop action, the best scene was a quiet moment at the piano where the young daughter teaches Jerico how to play a duet. There was also a thoughtful closing scene in which Oldman's character finally loosened up and we saw a spark of emotion. Most of the characters in the film were truly brain dead. But the character with the biggest heart, if not the best brain, was Costner's Jerico.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a review, this is a clear warning for rest to avoid watching such worthless POS.This movies must be one of the worst movies ever. The plot have holes bigger than ocean. How does one sign-off movies like this? Just put these retiring artists in some old age home and spare rest of the humanity of their nonsense. Between this and the latest Bruce Willi's movies, I am having a hard time figuring which was the worst. Just for sake of your own sanity, avoid it. I normally never write reviews unless I find some really disgusting movies.There is nothing to talk about acting, Kevin Costner was at best average. Never ever looked convincing. Gary Oldman was always in rush for whatever reason. The action sequence were C-grade and in general the movie was just awful. I can't find even a single positive thing in the movie. Unless the producers have paid people to vote up this movie, I don't see why this movie has such high rating here. The plot is worse those those cheap Van Damme movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible, Awful, The Worst EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Criminal might be the worst movie I have ever seen in my short life, because it's criminal, absolute criminality, to waste that much talent on the most incompetent direction, production, cinematography, screen writing and editing I have ever laid eyes to, ever. And man, do I ever feel sorry for Kevin Costner, though I probably shouldn't. He made his bed and now he has to lie in it. Perhaps he should do a sequel to The Postman, called "The Post World." This movie could take place in space, where the last hope and refuge of mankind is so alienated, disconnected and removed from itself that only a true "space-postman" can bring them all back home. "Ride, Space-Postman, Ride!" Costner is a supremely fine actor and plays the part perfectly here, but every other actor's potential is wasted on the awful, awful screen writing. A reboot of Robocop 2 would have been preferable. By matter of principal, send a message, don't rent or buy this movie, ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Criminal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main problem of Criminal isn't swallowing the premise of the memories transplant, but accepting the increasingly improbable situations in which the main character gets involved, pushed by the volatile combination of his psychotic personality and the brain impulses of a CIA agent, which motivate him to do good (because the CIA always does good). After all, that's a classic debate of science fiction: How is identity defined? Is it the result of a collection of memories, or is there an indescribable and almost spiritual element modeling our conscience? Unfortunately, co- screenwriters Douglas Cook and David Weisberg decided not to explore those themes, preferring to employ clichés recycled from uncountable action films, including the confusing search of a generic terrorist, the intervention of a magical hacker controlling everything from his laptop and the obligatory innocent persons under a mortal danger (including a girl who automatically considers the main character her best friend... despite having attempted to rape her mother just a moment ago). On the positive side, Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones and Jordi Moll? managed to bring decent performances despite having had to work with such poorly written characters. In conclusion, I found Criminal a boring film with bad creative decisions and unintentionally funny scenes. In the "anti-hero Costner" sub-genre, I found Criminal a bit superior to 3 Days to Kill, but that's still not enough to make it worthy of even the slightest recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing New or Interesting Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Hollywood needs desperately is to find a few writers who have never seen a movie before in their lives. I think this is the only way to keep from making the same movies over and over again. In this action drama they begin with what they think is some highly original idea, transferring the mind of a valuable CIA asset into the head of a psychotic killer. Throw in a few car chases, a lot of gun play, a heaping helping of clichés, and you have Criminal.This pic gives new meaning to the idea of gratuitous violence. I wonder how many people died from start to finish. News flash: Hans Gruber died in Die-hard so you can't revive his character for the villain in this huge budget excuse for a thriller?and simply changing his nationality doesn't disguise this plagiarism. Then there is Hans Gruber's right hand girl, the sociopathic femme fatale, which I suppose is meant to be seen as progress for women but is just completely stupid. And if you want to have a guy called "The Dutchman" then use a real Dutch guy with a real accent instead of some hack actor with a phony one.In the end this movie is little more than the sum total of about 30 movies of its ilk, and by "ilk" I mean dumb action movies. The undead dead thing has been used about a thousand times, I mean when someone is supposed to be dead but they really aren't, and they used that in this movie on a few occasions. There is the very important matter of how the criminal escapes. He is an extremely dangerous murderer yet they throw him in the back of a car with his hands cuffed in front of him and then proceed to ignore him in such a way as to make the mother of that child who ended up in the gorilla cage look like parent of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth Seeing Even if You Feel You've Seen Before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to buy a matinée ticket on a rainy day for this movie based on its terrific cast, and I wasn't disappointed. Yes, it feels like a cousin of Face/Off. Yes, there are tremendous conveniences in the story. Yes, it is predictable. However, if you like the cast and if you like action movies with some surprises then it is worth seeing. Costner brings his star power to the role of Jericho, a man with no social skills due to his underdeveloped frontal lobes, which were damaged as a child (in a touching story). Therefore it's fun to watch him steal a vehicle right in front of people, walk to the front of lines and punch people just because he can. I was happy to see Gal Gadot in a bigger role than I expected. And I spent most of the movie trying to figure out who one of the villains was, as I recognized her from another role but couldn't place it. She is very distinctive (and very beautiful), and at the end I realized it was Antje Traue, the East German actress who played a super villain in 2013's Man of Steel. Overall, the movie is good enough for a entertaining matinée at the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was amazed this movie was rated as low as it was. Hopefully my score will give it a boost. Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Ryan Reynolds - where can a film maker go wrong?Well I guess it's the premise of putting one man's memories into another man's head. Yet, I did the research and it's science in the making. It has worked on rats, as quoted in the movie.Costner's character made me laugh, wince, smile, cry, laugh and smile again. He plays the villain and the hero to a tee. Oldman's last line gives me the idea there may be a sequel and I will be first in line to watch Costner strut his stuff once again.Love the London locations and British references, but I may be bias having been born and raised there.Have not come across this director before but is reminiscent of McG and Luc Besson. Was quite sure one or the other had a hand in this movie until the credits. Give it a go lovers of Besson and McG. It really isn't Dances With Wolves, although note the recurring religious imagery, especially within the names.As I've hinted - can't wait for the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern day Frankenstein with a heart of gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As bizarre as it may seem, Kevin Costner does play a role similar to a modern day Frankenstein monster. The film introduces Costner as wild man criminal Jericho Stewart as the bearded prisoner chained in a jail cell. He talks with a gruff voice with grunts. He is treated like the criminal monster he is. He has no real emotions, he has killed and injured people without anger or remorse. The reason that brings Government Honcho Quaker Wells (Gary Oldman) to Jericho's cell. They need to retrieve important memories of important national security information and transfer it into Jericho's accommodating skull in hopes of retrieving the info. Government agent Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds) was killed while attempting to secure the important information from a secret contact called the Dutchman (Michael Pitt.) Wells wants Dr. Franks (yes similar to Dr. Frankenstein) portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones to perform the delicate brain operation on dead Pope retrieving the info and transferring from his still active brain, into the wild man beast's brain. Why Jericho? Seems his brain is the only choice that will accept memories since he has a rare brain malfunction. After the operation is completed there is not much change with Jericho he still seems like a wild monster brute. Yet he starts to have strange visions begin to flash through his brain, but can't decipher what they are. Which causes him much pain. Wells believing the operation to be a failure, gives the order to be transfer Jericho to someplace he could be terminated. However in transit Jericho, kills the security guards and makes good his escape. Once on the streets of the city Jericho unleashes his brutish violence upon anyone and everyone he runs into. He brazenly takes food from a fast food restaurant, daring anyone to interfere, just by his monstrous glare no one does a thing to stop him. Then Jericho steals a van by beating up the tough thug occupants. Suddenly the memories of Bill Pope become more clear and vivid in Jericho's mind. He sees images of Pope's gorgeous young wife Jill ( Gal Gadot) She has an angelic like beauty as she dances on a beach reaching out to her husband, yet it is Jericho who receives the enticing memory. Suddenly Jericho is no longer the brutish monster. He now can speak several foreign languages, he remembers security codes and highly classified information. The villainous character Xavier Heimdahl ( Jordi Molla) is also interested in Jericho, he wants to retrieve the information from Jericho to find the elusive secret contact Dutchman, who has the ability to take over nuclear weapons via his computer and launch them. The only thing to stop the Dutchman's countdown to launch is Bill Pope going to the Dutchman and paying him with a huge payoff. But with Pope dead it is now only Pope's memories in Jericho's head that could find the Dutchman that will save the world. Xavier and Wells are hoping that Pope's memory transferred into Jericho's mind could be the key. Xavier sends his army of thugs to retrieve Jericho. When Wells discovers that Jericho's mind is recalling the important data he also sends agents to retrieve Jericho. Jericho on the run, goes to Bill Pope's home. He remembers the code to open the security system for the front door. Once inside something strange happens to the brute Jericho. As he finds Jill lying in bed, the images of her tender beauty from her husband flash through his mind. Even as he tapes her to the bed, you can see his mind fighting to calm the beast within himself. He gently touches her bare leg, steals a few items then leaves. Now the Jericho before his operation would have raped and sexual assaulted and killed the helpless Jill. Yet something miraculous has happened to Jericho for the first time in his life Jericho VIA Bill Pope's memories has felt tenderness and caring. Later during an escape from Xavier's thugs Jericho is seriously wounded. He is found in the Pope's basement by Jill who has a gun trained upon him. As he patches up his bleeding leg he looks up at her with a calm sentimental expression. He then says to her "Your husband could never hurt you and neither could I" Then he tells her all about the memory transfer from her dead husband, and that he can recall all of his memories and all of his feelings. Now Jill's fear vanishes she has now a caring curious look on her face. Could she actually be communicating with her dead husband through Jericho? Then when she sees her young daughter Emma (Lara Decaro) teaching this once monster brute Jericho with scars on the back of his head like the Frankenstein monster to play the piano. She and her daughter take him into their hearts and he also cares for them. There is of course for the action fans a big climax shoot out that has Jericho risking his life for Jill and her daughter, something he would have not ever have done at the beginning of this film. I like the ending twist plot that is so rewarding as is the finale.A truly magnificent; film, acting, directing and screenplay. One of the best films I have seen in a long time. Costner should get an Academy Award nomination for his acting here. And Gal Gadot should have the name Gal Goddess. She is just a stunningly beautiful actress. I liked her as Wonder Woman in Batman vs Superman, and I love her in this film. Definitely a future super star actress with immense talent and beauty. This is a film you should see!!!</fullReview>

I wanted to laugh but instead I just felt sorry for Hollywood's future and people who watch this movie. "Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds) is a CIA agent on a mission in London tracking down a shadowy hacker nicknamed "The Dutchman." When he gets mysteriously ambushed and killed, an experimental procedure is used to transfer his memories into dangerous ex-convict Jericho Stewart (Kevin Costner). When he wakes up with the CIA agent's memories, his mission is to find The Dutchman and eliminate him before the hacker launches ICBM's and starts World War III. But complications soon arise and the mission turns personal." This summary should have given me the warning but I ignored for the sake of the cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Costner Kills in Criminal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, I loved Criminal, which is surprisingly good. You need to know it's bloody and violent, but if you are OK with that, the story, acting, and action really rock.The cast is a veteran crew, starring Kevin Costner as Jerico, an absolute psycho who is in prison because he has no way to differentiate right from wrong due so some brain injury from his childhood. As it turns out, he is the 1 in a bazillion candidate for the new procedure, experimental, from the lab of scientist Tommy Lee Jones. That's the start of why I loved this movie. Costner didn't want this part, but the producers convinced him that he was what they needed. Wow, what a role and he sinks his teeth into it. He is brutal, unforgiving, unrepentant, and gets his head cold. You'll see.Jones is this kind of quirky doctor who actually gives a crap about Costner as his patient. He and Costner are kind of like giving each other a purpose in life. They are both loners, with nothing much besides themselves.Enter Ryan Reynolds, yes, Deadpool/Green Lantern, again. Isn't he in about every movie you see now? His role is short but critical. Let's not forget his wife, played wonderfully by Gal Gadot, the new Wonder Woman.Memory transference is the key to this movie, but what makes this movie great is Costner. He's evil, no feelings, but slowly, creepily, something starts in his brain that he never felt before. He attacks it like he does everything in life. What an awesome portrayal of this change by Costner.What is also great is that this movie actually makes you root for a bad guy who is becoming a good guy to return to be a bad guy, because he's fighting other bad guys, almost kind of like Dr Jekyl/Mr Hide, but smoother.Gary Oldman plays a key role too as the leader of the military or govt that is trying to save the world, all hinging on this guy with a hole in his head, a real psycho.There's one scene that is straight out of Silence of the Lambs. Again at an airport. In some ways, Jerico plays on Hannibal Lector a bit from the totally psycho side at the start, butthen as someone who is actually becoming a somewhat reasonable man as he learns more about Gal Gadot and her husband Reynolds.Criminal is not for the faint of heart. Costner goes berserk many times. But Costner just kills this role with such great acting, that I think you will love this movie. Criminal is a must-see flick. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kevin Costner's best role since Dances with Wolves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, there are some implausible elements to the plot, but this film is really about redemption, and certainly this is a true come-back role for Kevin Costner. It's too bad this film didn't receive wider distribution or a larger viewing audience. I've often felt that Costner has been misunderstood over the past two decades by film goers and movie producers alike. He really is a fine actor and living proof that actors do become better with age... Most of the supporting cast, with the exception of Gal Godot, were just average, given they didn't have much to work with because of the limitations of the script. That being said, I enjoyed this film and it has much to offer thematically speaking. It certainly deserved a better rating that what's been given here on IMDb. Costner is at his crusty best in the lead role, and has truly broken the mold of his former "good guy" roles. If you're a spy or thriller fan, enjoy the twists and turns of the plot, then just sit back and enjoy the ride. Criminal is a very satisfying film on several levels.Two thumbs up for Kevin Costner!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie feels like a Bourne movie without Matt Damon and his martial arts. The intrigue and the gritty action makes it feel like it takes place in a Bourne movie-verse. It helps that there is a lot of talented cast. Kevin Costner was excellent despite my initial doubts. Tommy Lee Jones played a convincing doctor who cares about his patient. However, there is not much for Gary Oldman. He is basically Commissioner Gordon with more dialogue and running. A brief appearance by Ryan Reynolds also helped drive the plot a lot. His nice-guy character helped set the tone for Costner's character development during the movie. In fact, Kevin Costner carries the movie effortlessly. He is both menacing, and sensitive. His combination of brutality, and sensitivity makes him a close parallel to Damon's Jason Bourne and gives a certain freshness to the spy genre. Yet, it is too bad Scott Adkins did not get to do much. He is the reason I wanted to see the movie in the first place. But I think if he does his martial arts in the movie, it would detract too much from the story. However, he does have quite a presence in the movie. You always feel that this guy has something in him, and he is so serious. In short, criminal is a surprisingly good movie and its strength lies on its focus on the characters, and what drives them; especially Kevin Costner's character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Costner is a Criminal that happens to have a rare Brain dysfunction, one that gives him a unique opportunity. Unfortunately, he doesn't care about anything or anyone, "Hopeless Case" in his case, is an understatement.This all star cast is led by Gary Oldman with yet another odd name, "Quaker Wells". Surrounding him are the magnificent Gal Godot, Alice Eve, Michael Pitt, Tommy Lee Jones, Scott Adkins and a very creepy Jordi Moll? as Heimdal, we also saw him as the soon-to-be-beheaded cretin and Jamoke "Santana" in "Riddick". Here, he does his best Ron Silver (From Timecop and Blue Steel) impression. Antje Traue is another "man of Steel" Bad Girl. except she looks a lot nicer. But that's misdirection. Bad people usually look the most normal.Kevin shows us what it would look like if a violent, uncontrollable criminal would have the memories of a decent man implanted, eventually he can't help but to start having feelings and doing good. He doesn't want to, he just can't help it. Of course, Quaker Wells the CIA chief played by Oldman, doesn't do much good to encourage that goodness to come out. Costner also inherits all of Reynold's skills, at first using those to simply stay alive. His only ally is Dr Franks (Tommy Lee), but that list gets larger as we go on.Somewhere in here is Danny Webb, the only survivor of "Alien 3", the British backdrop of this film gives us interesting actors from that area as local denizens.It took me a few weeks to get to this film, at first it did not look like something I'd like. But it has a lot of good things, Science Fiction, Spies, and good Buttkickings. And Gary is always great in Spy movies. This is the second film in which I have seen Gal Godot, and she's a wonder woman here as well.The premise here, is that Reynold's character was after a hacker who had a program that could do some damaging things. So we have the elements of an IT Thriller as well.But what pleases me is that Costner is not finished acting, not by a long shot. And this role is something a lot different, it is the anti-hero. Something which Tom Cruise tried in "Edge of Tomorrow".</fullReview>

The cast for this film was good, but somehow i kept thinking they were keeping their contractual obligations. It is a well crafted movie and nice soundtrack. But i kept thinking of it as a jason bourne redux. Instead of losing his identity and saving the world. He has gained an identity to do the same. You can write an essay comparing the parallel narrative of the two story lines. It was a linear story, good guys tries to get the bad guys, a western with automatic weapons and elongated tubular objects thrusting up into the clouds. It wasn't really a waste of time, not much to it, it was entertaining. Sort of like watching football, basketball, hockey etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay diversion despite some significant flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I feel that I should warn potential viewers of "Criminal" that while the ads and the critic quotes used on the Blu- ray box brand the movie as an action movie, it really isn't. Yes, there is action, but it's kind of sporadic. And when the action does come, it usually concludes very quickly. The movie is more of a thriller instead of an action-packed enterprise.So now you know the actual path the movie takes, the question comes as to whether the path it takes is done well enough. Well, the results are kind of mixed. First, the negative stuff. There is some sloppy writing here and there that raises some glaring questions. (For example: How did the bad guys escape from the authorities during the bridge sequence? And how did the bad guys get Kevin Costner's character out of the library without anyone seeing them?) Another problem is that I don't think the premise is exploited enough. The idea of the movie - a psychopath being injected with the memory and abilities of a secret agent - is indeed a great one. But the actual execution felt a little lacking. I'm not quite sure why, I admit, but I think the main problem is that we don't see Kevin Costner's character struggle enough between those two extremes. With more of a struggle, there might have been a lot more drama and tension.The movie also moves a tad slow at times. But I have to admit that despite the somewhat leisurely pace at times - and those aforementioned problems - I wasn't really bored at any time. The movie always have something going on that kept me interested. So while I don't think the movie reached its full potential, there's enough here to make it acceptable rainy day viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I mean by that, of course, is you won't see anything you haven't seen before. It's a decent popcorn flick and anyone could've played the hero - Steven Seagal, Arnold Swartzenegger, The Rock, Sly Stallone, any modern wrestler, really. They did spend a fortune on the editing and CGI, so it wasn't a total washout. Kevin Costner did what he was paid to do, deliver his performance of a strong but incredibly flawed human being.Were there holes? Of course. What Hollywood film would be worth its weight in gold if it didn't? Watching this film, a lot of other movies came to mind - Ghost, Face/Off, Die Hard, etc. There are worst ways you could spend your time. If you're looking for a no frills, pick me up kind of film, Criminal will suffice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so the cast of the Criminal will blow your mind away. But was it all really needed when you were trying to cook an under-cooked meal? When you look at the screen time people have in the flick, known faces that try to earn a role with their popularity meter have measly dialogues to deliver, you can't help feel sorry for them. I will name them one by one.SPOILER CRIMINAL CHARACTERSRyan Reynolds: Although Criminal tries to cash in on his name, he has the most laconic role ever. He disappears with a cameo. Budget issues? I get it that it was supposed to be the storyline. But really, you kill him that early? At least delve into the details!Scott Adkins: The guy can do so much. But all Vromen asked him to do was stand next to Oldman taking orders, listening to what's next in the course like a normal guy. That was pretty much it! Did the director even know he could fight? Should have taken tips to include a fight scene at least?Michael Pitt: All he did was wait, smoke, wait more, react to some failure, eventually got shot.Antje Traue: She looked promising for a while as she slithered in that T-X kinda feel. But where does she end up? Under a bashed pot!Tommy Lee Jones: He appeared to the scene when he wanted to expound terse memory concepts, and to get ravaged by another 'Old'Man fury.Amaury Nolasco: He was just there.Alice Eve: Was she even there?Taking the spotlight to other actors now, those who could really act. Starting off with Kevin Costner. He still has it in him. You have to give it to him. Had this plot demanded more of him, I have no doubt he could deliver. Gal Gadot was simply good. Gary Oldman gets under the skin of his character so good that you cannot even poke him without getting gouged at. He is definitely good. Unfortunately none of them knew what ground they were in. It was a landslide, and they were dancing on it.BETTER DIRECTOR FOR CRIMINAL?I wish the concept of Criminal found a better director. Definitely not Ariel Vromen. There is no subtlety in him. It flung me into minutes of boredom and insouciance in the beginning itself that it was hard to concentrate. Good thing Costner did some crazy stuff to bring back the Mojo. Otherwise, it was simply falling down.I say, this movie is criminal. It deprived us of our time, and plundered us of our money.Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say. First of all, Im a critic not a writer. Im not here to bamboozle you with airy fairy frucktard crap like some people here do, Im here to say it for what it is. Enough about me, onto the movie:)To be honest, Im not a huge fan of Kevin Costner, but, I have to say for this particular movie, he has done a bloody good job. This is an action packed movie from start to finish. If you don't like action then why watch it? The movie starts a bit slow, but, you will get the gist of it as it wont let you go, just hang in for the first 5-10 minutes of this film, then after that, your eyes are glued. An enjoyable movie for the whole family to watch , with a bit of everything there to please someone. Like, you want ROMANCE, suspense, Action, Chases, Power and Compassion..... Hmmm, getting carried away here:) Seriously though, if you want a good all rounder, grab your movie ticket, your popcorn and your favourite beverage, sit and be gobsmacked. Enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an enjoyable film who is its own worst enemy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**MINOR SPOILERS INCLUDED**out of the gate, putting Kevin Costner - whom i suspect was a driving force behind this production - in this role is the proverbial shot in the foot; there is just no way anyone is going to see him as anything but the one, same character he plays in every film.And yet you can see him clearly trying his best and most to not-be the same guy he always is, the emotional, righteous person empowered by justice. or, just Kevin Costner.See, this film is half based on Costner's character being a savage, brutal killer, and half being Costner The Director's classic soppy, emotional shlock where everyone must turn good and there's gotta be an happy ending. So you see what i mean when i say, this film is its own worst enemy; if *anyone else* had been cast in this film as the lead, even an unknown, it would have been better. Pick whether you want to make a grim, sadistic film, or a carebear film where everything turn out for the best, and stick with it, don't jump between styles.Criminal is the story of a thing which is very dangerous. The Amuricans are looking to get it back and the bad guys are looking to steal it. While trying to get the thing, one good guy dies, so they put his brain in Costner's brain. Costner was a bad guy but he becomes a good guy, he kills all the bad guys and gets the thing. (Winner of 2016 Most Innovative Plot Award)Criminal uses fairly well all the other actors it has, without over-saturating the screen time with them, and by keeping the plot moving. It's not perfect, it has a couple things which are plain bad (how they drag the wife back into the picture, a totally unnecessary twist which goes against the tone of the film), it can't decide if it wants to be a hard and unforgiving film, or an emotional feelgood film. But all in all, it's a pretty decent spy story with an unusual character in the lead; Costner in himself is not bad, the direction is pretty solid, the dialogue is decent (the Dutchman is horrible and should be completely re-written), and just to remind you that this is Hollywood, the ending is garbage.I liked Criminal. I liked it despite its baffling choices of cast and plot, and while i will say that this film could have been made into a really epic film and it wasn't, which is a shame, it's still worth the price of a ticket.my vote: 7/10 - conservative here, innovative there, faulty but enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tries to be cool and interesting but fails miserably</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that tries to emulate other movies that the director of this film thinks is cool. Films such as "Face/Off", "Inception" and few other films. It's okay for directors to try and emulate other films if it works, but it just didn't work for this movie. It sort of reminded me of a reversed version of the movie "Self/Less" except "Self/Less" is a more entertaining movie and more engaging...At least compared to this movie. I could see what the director tried to do, but there isn't any thing here to really get the audiences to get attached to the characters. It was trying to be a film where the audiences really gets attached the the leads and enjoy the journey the protagonist takes while building interest. It falters because there is nothing really interesting about the characters or the story and despite it trying to look cool with it's musical notes and how people are dressed and how things look. The whole experience felt bland with nothing new going on. Plus most of the talented cast didn't even seem to be trying, and just had the expression like "why am I even in this thing, I gotta do something to get that paycheck regardless". So yeah, even the cast looked disinterested. Overall, I just have to give a pass on this movie the whole thing was a badly edited snooze fest that tries so hard to be cool but just isn't. 3.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting &amp; fast moving. A movie I really enjoyed even with the high expectations I had. Costner is the perfect choice for this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They messed with my brain. Thought they knew what they'd get. But they were wrong." Quaker Wells (Oldman) works for the CIA and the agent that they had tracking a dangerous plot was just killed. He decides to try an experimental process which puts the memories of the dead agent into a vicious convict on death row and enlist him to help. They choose Jericho Stewart (Costner) but the memories that are implanted begin to mess with Stewart's mind, and Wells' mission. I was excited to see this movie for many reasons. One I am a huge fan of Costner and Oldman. Two, my favorite movie is JFK and its almost a reunion with those two and Tommy Lee Jones in this. I also thought the idea was interesting and due to all of that I had pretty high expectations for this. That said, I was not disappointed. This is not a masterpiece and isn't in my top 5 Costner movies but this is very entertaining, fast paced and one that I could watch a few times I think. The idea is along the lines of Self/Less which came out about a year ago, but this was no where near as disappointing as that one was. Overall, exciting and fast moving. A movie I really enjoyed even with the high expectations I had going in. Costner is the perfect choice for this. He plays the every man so perfect in all of his movies that you forget he is a dangerous murderer in this and actually root for him. Not many actors can do that. I give this a B+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Average Thriller that Attracts Based On a Stellar Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These were my expectations from the movie, confirmed when I finally watched it. Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Alice Eve, Gal Gadot, and Ryan Reynolds. That looked good enough to me. However, this strong cast is easily eliminated based on a general lack of screen time. Eve is in this in an incredibly minor role, so much so that I'm confused as to why she took it. She is killed off in the third act and serves little to no purpose. Reynolds makes his mark for maybe ten minutes, including flashbacks. Yes, he does die. That's what the movie is about, really. Too bad they sort of had to give it away in the trailers, because if they had given us a big star like Reynolds in the beginning, we could have had a scene like the Drew Barrymore-in- 'Scream' killing, in which everyone is surprised when the big- name star bites the dust. Anyway, the movie is about a criminal getting the memories of a spy implanted into him. This surgery scene, by the way, doesn't have CGI quality any better than 'Agents of SHIELD'. I would think that this movie had a good- sized budget to get this many awesome actors, but maybe it was all spent on said actors. Costner does an okay job. It's a very standard thriller that reminds me a lot of '3 Days to Kill' or any of his other average, rather slow-paced thriller movies. To be honest, he doesn't fit this role. He's playing a psycho, and it's not his kind of character. He can't balance it out well at all. Maybe that's due to script issues as well. He sort of channels his inner Liam Neeson, so it might have been a good idea to switch leads in this case. Given my personal preference is Neeson, and so many scenes in this felt like a Neeson movie, I think I would have enjoyed it better if it weren't Costner. All in all, this is about a 5.5 out of 10. And usually, I would just round up and make it 6/10, but it's not that good of a movie. 5/10 will do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really enjoyed the first part of the movie...got me on the edge of my seat for the first half hour...and from there, hooked me into the plot for the rest of the ride...What kinda spoilt it for me was Gary Oldman's character...someone who is supposedly quite high up in the CIA, acting like a little child throwing tantrums in almost every scene he's in is frankly ridiculous and unrealistic. That he is always one step behind doesn't help too. Could someone so incompetent and with such poor human interaction skills rise up so high in any bureaucratic organisation? A tad over-acting on his part perhaps?Other than that, the film was very good...until the end.I wish they left Jericho the way he was...let the memory fade and everyone goes back to their lives as before...forcing a 'happy' ending is the weak link in the plot. What is she suppose to do with him now? Or him with his new identity, for that matter?It is sci-fi...not a fairy tale...making one little girl happy took so much from the plot that it didn't make sense to me. Even showing that he didn't relate to the little girl at the end and the guy in the jeep had to put Jericho down would be a better (more realistic)ending...Nevertheless...I enjoyed the movie and would recommend my friends to watch it. Good job Kevin...almost forgot that you're still around.Easily 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie almost ruined by modern action movie clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to argue that Criminal is a very good movie. In fact, in my opinion it starts off pretty terrible, incorporating all the clichés of mediocre fast-paced action / spy flicks down to agents doing stuff on high-tech computer screens, people getting tracked and scene shifts with the typical modern "action movie font" introducing cities and characters.However, it gets much better once Jerico (Costner) enters the picture. Bolstered by a really good performance by Costner, all the scenes featuring the character are pretty fun to watch. This could be a much better and interesting movie if it mostly only followed Costner at a slower pace, exploring the conflict he faces regarding his newfound emotions and "family."Unfortunately, in the movie this potential is smothered by cliché after cliché and poor cinematography, overall offering a pedestrian effort that manages to shine through the tropes from time to time.</fullReview>

This was a great rainy day mid-afternoon Sunday matinée. Sci-fi adventure action - disregarding the plot and holes all over the place - it was a fun ride. I am among those that like Costner and he appears to have had fun making and playing this new character. I am 100% certain once was enough - but it was $5.75 that I was not disappointed to exchange for 1hr 30 min film. bonus - the young Emma was just an adorable character.

But the man pulled it off, and I don't think there's more than a handful of actors in the world that could've pulled that off and made it work. I don't know why he disappeared for as long as he did, but it's a delight to see him bring the main character to life. The guy truly has a gift.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Psychopath to Caring Human Being, and a whole lot more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know, I know the reviews thus far from popular ratings sites don't score this movie too high, but this is one you should judge for yourself.Keep in mind the cast; this was my first reason to consider watching 'Criminal', my second and third as well. I'm not in the habit of repeating IMDb's full Storyline so I'll let you read that for yourself if you haven't already, and I'll add my take on that, at the risk of revealing some parts you really should discover on your own. But don't worry, I'll give you a warning just before the spoiler.So, the cast includes Kevin Costner, the main character; some roles are good for him, some not, the role of emotionless psychopath in this movie is right up his alley. Then there's Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Ryan Reynolds, Jordi Moll? (oh you'll remember him when you see him), the gorgeous Gal Gadot who you should remember as Gisele from the Fast and Furious franchise and Michael Pitt as 'The Dutchman' who everybody is trying to catch in this movie. You may think the storyline is that of a B movie, but the script by Douglas Cook and David Weisberg (they wrote The Rock) and direction by Ariel Vromen who directed the 2012 movie 'The Iceman', a movie you ought to have watched if you like tough characters, then you can start to understand why it is not a B movie. It is packed with action, suspense, twists and it will keep you engaged.The part when Reynolds' memory is transferred to Kostner's brain is done effectively, thanks to Tommy Lee Jones credible acting as the doctor who devised the procedure. In fact Jones' participation, minimal as it may be, always comes just in time to add that credibility element throughout the movie, right to the ending scene, my favourite of the movie.The movie lasts one hour and fifty three minutes, but it absolutely feels like a much shorter one. In my humble opinion this an important reason for the critical comments about 'Criminal'. Cook and Weisberg's story would have made a terrific novel because of the secondary sub-plot, the one dealing with Moll?'s criminal organization and The Dutchman's role in that organization. In the near two hours movie there was simply no way to expand on that sub-plot. So, moviegoers have to piece together the relation of The Dutchman and Moll?'s criminal organization. For those who enjoy a good novel as much as they do movies, that won't be a problem. But I feel those who didn't would have been left with what might be perceived as a messy story, but it isn't. Let me explain.Here come the spoiler parts.The Dutchman, Pitt, worked for Moll? who is an advocate of global anarchy, because he thinks he alone should rule the world, not unlike leaders of cults and such. When Pitt found a vulnerability in the US military arsenal control and developed a program to take over the control while disabling its failsafe measures, he knew he had in his possession the ultimate war device, one his boss Moll? would not hesitate to use for his mad quest. So of course Pitt negotiates with the CIA to sell them that program for lots of money and protection to hide from Moll?. That's the part that you have to piece together from bits of scenes throughout the movie. Furthermore, at the beginning of the movie, Reynolds, the CIA agent who was charged with the mission to make good on Pitt's deal is killed by Moll?' himself, he having figured out Pitt's defection, and this is something Pitt didn't know and concluded he was screwed by the CIA. Again it's something you piece together during the movie, but not knowing this makes it harder to understand why Pitt turns to the Russian FSB for the same deal. See what I mean by the story making a better novel than a two hour movie!So if you read comments that the storyline is messy, it's because it has a criminal organization, the CIA, The FSB, and a psychopath with no allegiance and a third sub- plot (my favourite) I'll get to just below, all in one movie. When the CIA decided to move ahead a secret program to transfer memories from a recently dead person into another living human being, this suddenly having become a necessity for them to find Pitt, using dead Reynolds brain, Jones picked the best candidate for the procedure, but it happened to be Costner, a psychopath with no emotions. As Reynolds memories start to rebuild in Costner's brain, his personality also starts to change. It is a haphazard process as one should expect, and as Jones explains. Reynolds widow and child become as important to Costner as they were to Reynolds and in the end the psychopath has become a human being, worthy of a second chance. That aspect of the movie is the one I most liked, though the fight Costner puts up with all parties to get Pitt's money and break free turned out as well after all the twists.It has a Hollywood ending, so those who don't care for such thing, don't bother; I wanted to be fair in my review, but I still think it's worth watching of course.</fullReview>

It starts off with immediate action, then the suspense and drama continues, it's very hard to follow the amount of movies in which follow a similar plot, seen them all haven't then spent 5 minutes working out a way so I can leave a great review.

		<fullReview>This is my first ever review of a movie and boy what movie.The cast is perfect, the setting is brilliant. The story flawless (if you let yourself go with it)First of all let me say that Mr Costner has proved beyond a shadow of a doubt he is one of the greatest actors of this or any generation. His performance is powerful, stirring and just plain amazing. I would never of thought he could portray a character like this. This is not the man from Robin Hood.. far from a Field of Dreams and so much more than a Waterworld. The pace never lets up and you will find yourself shocked, stunned , cheering, laughing and wincing in equal measure. All parts are played by cast brilliantly and with conviction. The action sequences do not feel like set pieces but more like a fluid progression of the plight of the main character. Gal Godot is beautiful in this movie, frail and torn and you can see it, I mean really see it. Ms Gabot is proving to be far more than a pretty face (not that I only thought that) Ryan Renolds is on key as usual in a familiar kind of role. At one point (i'll let you figure which part I mean) my heart breaks for the man. Gary Oldman is frantic and who can blame him , also brilliantly done. I'm not going to dissect the movie as I'm sure many will but only say be prepared for a movie that will draw you in and keep you hooked until the very end and then have you begging for the movie to be longer. Down to direction, location, stunts, sfx BRAVO !! I'm not sure if this is a movie that will be looked upon as Oscar worthy (it should be) but for the sake of common sense and justice to a great performance, Mr Kevin Costner take a bow and I hope beyond hope that you get the recognition you deserve for this movie... Outstanding !!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Face/Off and Self/Less had a lovechild and its name is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a failed attempt to retrieve a CIA agent (Ryan Reynolds, "Deadpool") who has intel on an industrialist-turned-anarchist Heimdahl (Jordi Moll?) The CIA are forced to implant the memories of the now deceased agent into Jericho Stewart (Kevin Costner, "McFarland, USA") who in turn struggles with the memories and complexities of being a good man. This is the second collaboration between Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Costner, and Gary Oldman following the 1991 film JFK. Hard to believe that it took us 26 years to put these three talented actors together again, and although I would have like to have seen them in a film like JFK; Criminal does hold its own in some merit. Director, Ariel Vromen made his English directorial debut with 2012's The Iceman. With this film, he showed us that he could handle a little budget thriller with a talented lead (Michael Shannon) and shape it into a watchable thriller that whether critics loved it or hated it - It would definitely make him a household name to talk about. Again he works his magic here with Criminal, under the writing talents of Douglas S. Cook &amp; David Weisberg ("The Rock", "Double Jeopardy") who borrow the shared plot device from "Face/Off" &amp; "Self/Less." If you hated those films then maybe you will hate this film as well, although it does differ in some way adding an anarchist for the baddie. Ryan Reynolds is a pleasure to see for the time spent with him, who coincidentally previously starred in last year's "Self/Less." Gal Gadot taking a break from "Dawn of Justice" is captivating as a now single mother forced to handle this new found information. Oldman and Jones rarely have much to do which is sad considering their talent. But the real star would be Costner although he does nothing special in the film. It's fun to see him play a character different from what we are normally subjected to among the lines of ("3 Days to Kill") While Criminal does have enough star talent to break the bank and send people rushing to the theaters - You'll have to determine if the film if worth remembering the minute you leave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Criminal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here are a few observations I've made about some actors/actresses in 2016's Criminal (my latest review). OK, let's begin: Kevin Costner with his meager dialogue readings, grumbles, growls, and grunts. Gary Oldman with his umpteenth American accent, gets ticked off and yells customarily. Tommy Lee Jones who fades in and out of the film, talks fast and doesn't really get to emote. The prepossessing Alice Eve looks sedated while really phoning in her performance and finally, Ryan Reynolds is well, Ryan Reynolds. Now is Criminal the reunion-like sequel to Oliver Stone's JFK (Oldman, Costner, and Jones in the same flick together)? No, not really. This is a nastily violent, techy thriller that's edited tightly, preposterous, and flows nicely. For better or worse, Criminal is passable entertainment despite a premise that is seemingly "on parole" (ha-ha). And Costner who looks so far gone from trying to get in the Academy's good graces (remember Dances with Wolves from 25+ years ago?), bulks up here all the while trying to become a successor to Liam Neeson (oh my, the badass, senior antihero circuit is ever expanding).Filmed primarily in London, England and distributed by Summit Entertainment, Criminal on the surface, projects itself to be another straight-to-video endeavor. There's its poster channeling 2015's Extraction (released only on DVD) and then there's the generic title (which feels a little hackneyed). Don't be fooled though, this is a movie that's above the limited release muck. The production values are stronger and director Ariel Vromen (The Iceman) seems to know what he's doing with the camera. Yeah Criminal does promote itself as action for the bloody, horror film host. And yes, its script, musical score, nullified computer speak, and slick look come off as rather stock at times. Here's the thing however: Criminal does deserve a true, theatrical release (despite what I initially thought). Just imagine something above Costner's previous 3 Days to Kill and slightly below Pierce Brosnan's The November Man. Not half bad as far as I'm concerned.The story is sort of unoriginal yet somehow someway, an audience member could be distracted from that notion. Jericho Stewart (Costner) is a despicable man, a convict with a frontal lobe disorder. As the film tells us, "he has no impulse control, he's unable to calculate the consequences of his actions, and he has a total lack of empathy for anybody or anything." Because of his condition, Jericho has been tapped to be an experiment for the CIA. Supervisor Quaker Wells (Gary Oldman) with the help of Dr. Mahal Franks (played by Tommy Lee Jones), wants to infuse the memory implants of a dead agent (Ryan Reynolds as Bill Pope) into Stewart's brain. This will enable Costner's Stewart to find the location of a computer hacker known as 'the Dutchman' (played by Micheal Pitt). Said 'Dutchman' has the ability to create a wormhole bent on protecting the world's nuclear defense codes. This diegesis is all made simple by Vromen's gruesome, penchant for street-style brutality and Costner's free-based arrogance (he likes to play these types of characters a lot). Look for a scene where Jericho uses a sharp part of a police vehicle to rip a cop's neck open. Also, look for another scene where Costner's Jericho beats a female malefactor with a disassembled lamp. Talk about Antoine Fuqua kitsch that's truly not for the kiddies. Rating: 2 and a half stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine if Robert Ludlum wrote Total Recall. This would be the result.Kevin Costner, whom I really didn't like before this movie, does an absolutely wonderful job as the bad ass protagonist.Gary Oldman is for some reason overacting and plays the role as a theater role.Jordi Moll? is the antagonist, and like Oldman, he is over acting.But still, it's a rock and roll adventure like they used to make them. Solid suspense, good story. It reminded me of The Man from Berlin, even though they have nothing in common. But I remember how that move made me feel when I saw it in theaters many years ago, and this was somehow similar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Run-of-the-mill setup but Costner delivers it well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a longtime fan of Costner's and have always enjoyed his works, including "Waterworld" (1995) that everyone shits upon ? a flop doesn't mean that the movie didn't have good stuff and vision in it, no matter how campy it might be. His sensibility and gravitas make for interesting characters, like in this crime drama; the story gets right into it as Oldman does what he used to better do in "Léon: The Professional" (1994). Costner visibly jars up his act to embody a careless and violent son of a bitch with no moral restraints, but it gets to be more believable as things develop. And you wind up rooting for him too, since you see him as a redeemable victim of bad circumstances. It's really in Costner's balanced portrayal, since fancy biotech stuff is common movie fare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the official J.F.K 25 year reunion......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's really refreshing to see an actor play against type for a role. To see one of the biggest stars of the nineties play an abhorrent piece of work for the most part of the film certainly brings something refreshing to a hackneyed old terrorist wants a computer hard drive for world domination trope that has been around longer than the star himself...Sociopathic death-row inmate Jerico Stewart is implanted with the memories of a deceased CIA agent, in a desperate attempt to thwart a deadly plot involving a Dutch hacker, known as......wait for it......The Dutchman.At the same time, Jerico reconnects with his own humanity as he bonds with the late agent's family......The film, in my opinion, has been unfairly dismissed by critics and thus has been avoided by audiences, because when you think about it, if the film had been made 22 years ago, and starred the majority of the same cast, it would have been one of the biggest films of the year, and I believe it would have been well received.Costner here is wonderfully over the top, sneering and causing havoc with whatever he does, he goes to get a coffee and breaks someones nose, and in the funniest scene of the film, where he goes to get a kebab, and somebody literally says to him 'that's bang out of order' (the makers are as subtle as a sledgehammer the way they portray the locals).Costner may have portrayed a bad guy in 3000 Miles To Graceland, but here, he's pretty much channelling his character from A Perfect World, except to craziness is turned up to 11.Oldman is in it just to shout and swear a lot, and although he's a great screen presence, he's wasted in this. As is Jones, Eve, Adkins, and Gadot.Reynolds has a wonderful cameo at the beginning of the film, and to be fair, it's the best mind swap film he's ever been in (two and counting).Add some much needed humour, to sweeten the clichés and the predictable narrative, Criminal is a fun film, with decent action, disregard for the British emergency services, and if you look at it another way, one of the strangest DC/Marvel universe mash ups you could ever wish for.Two Face puts Deadpools mind into Jonathan Kent, Kent gets told off by commissioner Gordon a lot, and proceeds to stalk Wonder Woman.Now thats a fun film, much like this one</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie must be the original Suicide Squad with the title of "Criminal" and an all-star Superhero cast with actors from Man of Steel, Captain America, Deadpool, Batman v Superman, Batman Forever, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Green Lantern, the Men in Black series and The Dark Knight trilogy. But, those are just films the actors played in. This screenplay, however, has made appearances itself in such movies as: The Bourne franchise, Payback, Face/Off, Source Code and The Silence of the Lambs. Unfortunately, this extremely dark, depressing and gritty film has none of the charm it "borrowed" from.This experience isn't a pleasant one, but it does have a better second half than first. Basically, to catch two sets of bad guys ? one, a hacker, ? la Edward Snowden and the other: a terrorist ? they need a third bad guy, the worst of them all. And, like the aforementioned Suicide Squad, they manufacture the (insert movie title here) with the brain of an agent to save the world.Sounds convoluted? Well it is, but it all evens itself out to be a somewhat decent climax. Nothing's plausible and I'm not just referring to the rushed sci-fi aspect. Overall recommended? Eh. Not really. It's just too down and too long to get to the point. But, I guess for a leave-your-brain-at-the-door feature, it works. Barely.***Final thoughts: Kevin Costner rarely makes a bad bad guy. But, if you want this role of his multiplied by a hundred, watch the little known and phenomenal Mr. Brooks. In fact, if you started this movie, stop it, or leave the theatre (like it's still playing) and go get Mr. Brooks. Much, much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Costner delivers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You hurt me?I hurt you worse." Jericho (Kevin Costner) Costner is the titular bad guy, who is implanted with the memory of deceased CIA operative, Bill Pope (Ryan Gosling?don't expect to see much of him as he dies early), and spends the better part of Criminal dealing with emotions new to him. It's a film rife with clichés but engaging largely because Costner is believable as a monster turned humanist. And the supporting cast is first-rate.While this thriller is rife with electronics ( the bad guy has hacked into the USA's military computer system), the humanism is what strikes me as satisfying: not just Jericho's assuming Pope's affections but also Gary Oldman's CIA officer, Quaker Wells, sliding into a rage and Jordi Malla's head terrorist, Xavier, just being cool. I also must acknowledge that the growing affection between Jericho and Pope's widow, Jill (Gal Gadot), is believable if not just as improbable as their planting her deceased husband's thoughts and memories in Jericho.In thrillers like Criminal, we've seen before the action sequences with vulnerable helicopters, racing cop cars, and ominous computer screens. What we haven't seen much of is a bad-boy hero who captures our sympathy immediately so that we care what happens to him regardless of the mayhem he causes in his journey. Costner has the stature and mien to carry this ambiguous hero right into our hearts."You don't remember me but I remember you," says young daughter, Emma Pope (Lara Decaro). Out of the mouths of babes come wisdom and the hope of love for a soulless murderer whose life is transformed by modern technology. Who would have thought technology could grant humanity? Besides, it's fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From criminal to hero: A journey of redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please watch this film!! Give it a go! I'm watching it a few times.1. The wonderful: Lots of suspense and thrill! What a journey of redemption! How entertaining and intriguing!! As Jericoh (Kevin Costner) progressively gets more involved with Pope's sentimental memories (feelings of love and kindness), he also develops a sensitivity for humanity: he develops positive emotions. And of course we empathize with JEricoh when we learn the cause of his brain damage--his father throws him off the window of a running car...this marked him forever. I also love how Pope's wife (Gadot) connects with this "criminal," because he carries her deceased beloved husbands memories and feelings. Likewise, Pope's daughter bonds with Jericoh. And the emotional climax of the movie is my favorite part! It's a moment of truth and tears. Another thing I liked was the Russian hacker (Michael Pitt) that have taken control of nuclear missiles system--in the end, he sabotages the system and prevents the wicked Spaniard (Molla, the real villain of the film) to carry out destruction. The science-fiction portion of the story is such an mind-opener! Can people with no ability to distinguish between good and evil be saved? What if they are exposed to the neural pathways/memories of goodness, of kindness? What if they experience these positive emotions and can then make a choice? This is what Jericoh does. He doesn't automatically turns good, he makes the choice to turn good, because he discovers something he has never experience before, thanks to Pope's memories. One of my favorite lines in the movie is when he tells Gadot he couldn't ever harm her because Pope would never do so. After that moment, Gadot overcomes her fear. Pope's goodness has reflected on Jericoh, and Jericoh has accepted that. I also love Tommy Lee Jones as Dr. Frank! Just love him. AND THE ENDING? Fantastic! I wanted to stay in that moment forever! A shining Kevin Costner.2. The ugly and terrible: Seeing Kevin Costner commit such heinous acts of violence without a trace of emotion in his face is hard to watch. Of course his brain is impervious to emotion or the sense of good vs. evil. Hence that's why he becomes the perfect target for Dr. Frank's experiment. But it's Kevin Costner! Our sweetheart wonderful good-guy actor. Also, Pope(Reynolds) suffers a brutal death...that's hard to watch (or hear).3. What I ponder about: Lots of layers, lots of elements going on. But the whole idea of this Spaniard anarchist having such level of power. He doesn't operate on a global scale or doesn't seem strong enough to have such impact.Overall, this is a film with a positive message. I walked out of the theater feeling good! Give it a try!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite good, could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After CIA operative Bill Pope is killed while still in possession of essential information, he is subjected to an experimental procedure wherein his memories are copied across to the partially unused brain of amoral jailbird Jericho. This puts Jericho and Pope's wife and daughter in a great deal of danger.Dressed up with a little bit of science fiction, this action thriller concentrates on Jericho's journey as Pope's personality and inherent morality begins to imprint itself over Jericho's nihilism. Kevin Costner, as Jericho, has more fun with this part than with any since Silverado, to start off with at any rate. By the end, Jericho's gleeful and unrestrained violence has been replaced with a rather more subdued persona, much closer to what we are used to seeing Costner playing. Ryan Reynolds as Pope is hardly in it, but Gal Gadot impresses as his widow: not only does she look good, she can act, and she makes sense of the odd relationship between the widow and the man on whom her late husband is partially imprinted. Gary Oldman as Pope's boss delivers an hysterical performance of a badly written character.While I quite enjoyed this, I felt almost all the way through that it could have been quite a lot better, although I can't quite put my finger on why.</fullReview>

Sometimes when a movie starts you just get that feeling that it's going to be good, you won't be disappointed by watching this because it's very good flick with a good cast that ultimately delivers some great enjoyable acting.Honestly, this was unexpectedly good, I really liked the last part of the movie but saying that though, most of it is very entertaining and gets you gripped, mainly due to how awesomely good Costner is.

		<shortDescription>Like Not Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The memories and skills of a CIA agent (Ryan Reynolds) are implanted into the brain of a dangerous criminal (Kevin Costner) in order to stop an international terrorist. While this is a nice brief description, it does little to inform that what you get is a slightly convoluted and predictable plot with solid performances supported by capable direction. The marketing lacked punch and perseverance so audience turnout was lackluster. I liked this movie but didn't love it.Reynolds' character Bill Pope is more than a cameo but less than a supporting role. Costner's portrayal of Jericho Stewart arcs nicely with restrained resistance and confusion of a man who's new memories conflict with his damaged frontal lobe causing emotional disconnect and real anger issues.Tommy Lee Jones supports this crime drama as Dr. Franks in a more understated role than I enjoy watching but gives the role a nice edge. Gil Gadot who plays the wife of Bill Pope is underutilized but performs well and I hope to see her in more than just Wonder Woman's uniform.In a landscape filled with epic comic book films which I tend to enjoy, a nice character driven action drama like Criminal is a nice alternative.</fullReview>

The film's edgy tone gives the illusion of depth within the brutal and ruthless violence, while the excellent cast adds weight to a variety of the other characters. Kevin Costner gets some real depth with Jericho constantly surprising and mixing a killer instinct with invention and some dark emotions. His scenes Bill's wife and daughter are tense and moving.

		<fullReview>This movie was just OK. The biggest problem with the movie was Gary Oldman's acting. He was so bad, in comparison to the rest of the actors, that every time he came on screen it would ruin the suspension of disbelief, which is saying a lot, because the story was a little ridiculous, the directing was mediocre, and the editing was passable. Nevertheless, the movie had a flow, and was cohesive, and had pretty good cinematography, and it wasn't hard to enjoy... right up until Oldman would come on screen and throw a tantrum, and perform like a C-list actor.Nevertheless, the movie rises to the level of watchable based on the performance of Kevin Costner, who did a pretty good job with it, and it was not an easy character to pull off.Tommy Lee Jones was good, as was Gal Gadot and the rest of the cast.Overall, this movie is probably worth watching if you don't have anything else to do.</fullReview>

Even with a partial brain transplant from Ryan Reynolds, the Canadian gray matter is not enough to prevent Jericho from wiping out half of America's CIA agents in London, as well as a large number of British Highway Patrol officers, not to mention a few random bystanders. Jericho also blows up the Chemistry Building at Oxford University, and trashes the George Orwell section of that school's Rare Books Collection. CRIMINAL makes the argument that the government must permanently lock up the kids of Flint, MI, immediately to protect Society from the violent behavior experts forecast is sure to result from their recent Lead Poisoning. You can shoot Michigan Governor Rick Snyder for High Treason because of this Intentional Poisoning of the Democratic Base if you want to, but ALL of these kids are now ticking time bombs just as much as Jericho is in CRIMINAL. Simply because these kids caught a bad break doesn't erase their future violent tendencies. The entire American population was kept safe from Jericho, and it must be safeguarded against the brain-damaged Flintstones, as well--no matter how evil their governor was for poisoning them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Criminal (2016): Dir: Ariel Vromen / Cast: Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Gal Gadot, Ryan Reynolds: Title seems to symbolize both the anti-hero Jericho Stewart, a convict chosen for a brain operation that fuses a living brain into his own to locate information from the mind of a deceased agent. The title can also reference the operation itself and the head trauma and agony that it leaves Stewart in. He is played by Kevin Costner who escapes custody but keeps seeing images of the agent's mind, which eventually leads him to his family. Tommy Lee Jones plays the surgeon who has second thoughts about the procedure and dislike for the whole treatment. He does give Stewart medicine to calm the pain. Gary Oldman is unfortunately flat as the agent heading this operation that killed one of his men in the film's opening. This is where the film presents an idea that director Alfred Hitchcock employed in Psycho as we have the high profile actor Ryan Reynolds as an agent whose presence is compromised and he is on the run. He sends one last call to his wife and daughter before fate closers in. Gal Gadot plays his wife whose first encounter with Stewart has her tied to a bed. Eventually she comes to realize what is happening. Her husband's brain is fighting through Stewart's. This is all very complex and sometimes complicated but director Ariel Vromen has fun with the action violence that often goes over the top and pointless. The ending is questionable at best but it draws focus on legalities and liberties as well as the good of one's mind influencing the human frame of a villain. Score: 7 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A recent Kevin Costner European produced thriller was such a joke that not even himself look comfortable; however it is not the case in Criminal where gives a humble but very strong performance as psycho with memories implanted from a CIA spy killed in the kind of mission that could represent the end of the world. Kevin's Jerico had his brain damaged as a kid after a violent attack. He cannot discern good from bad so he is basically a psychotic criminal with no conscience. His brain; is however the perfect place to implant the memories of a dead CIA agent; killed in London for a group of Anarchist lead by the Spanish Jordi Molla. As first the implant does not seems to work; so CIA local director Quakes (Gary Oldman doing a character as cruel as Costner's but supposedly on the good guys side) order his disposal. Jericho escapes and start remembering about some money the dead agent was carrying. Things go very violent; the kind that is not easy to swallow. The movie does not try to create even one good guy; everybody is disposable and the result justify the means. The Jericho character is incredible violent and does not care to kill innocent bystanders. It is really a pity that at the end the two main characters get more human; but is a minor defect in a movie that keep you hook on your seat for almost two hours.In brief; do not miss it.</fullReview>

Of course most folks think artificial intelligence is twenty five years away too.Besides a lot of great action and suspense, Gal Gadot (the new Wonder Woman) did some decent acting besides just looking great. I thought Kevin Costner's did a very good job given the difficult dual role.If you don't like spy action thrillers than this movie is a waste of time but if you do it well worth the price of a matinée admission.

		<fullReview>The classic Frankenstein drama asked the question what could go wrong if you put a criminal mind in a good body. Now "Criminal" puts that question in reserve in this homage to Frankenstein. Now the good mind is put in the body of the bad man. But the link is far greater.The story itself has so many references to Frankenstein that it's a wonder people miss them. Dr. Franks is the man heading up the operation. Jericho (the bad guy with the good frontal cortex) plays attentively with the little girl (as he does in a deadly fashion in the original). Jericho learns about music (as he does with the fiddle player). Jericho gets to smoke (as he does with the cigar smoking blind man). Jericho shrieks like a banshee before the good cortex sinks in(as the monster shrieked before he was taught language) etc. etc.Putting aside the obvious Frankenstein references, the film could have been better and it lagged in places, largely a function of mediocre directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprised How Good This Was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By way of it bursting out from nowhere with next to no marketing, and being funded by a hit- and-miss Lionsgate, I didn't exactly have high hopes for it. The trailer painted an interesting concept and the cast was enough to get me going anyway, but I at least hoped for an entertaining couple of hours. Well, it exceeded those expectations. Criminal opens with the death of an American spy living and working in London. Unfortunately the CIA need the information the spy had just before he died, otherwise the world would be in jeopardy from a Spanish anarchist, so they enlist the help of a doctor who's been working on the transfer of memories from one mammal to the next. The candidate for the experiment is a violent psychopath locked away in maximum solitary, who doesn't know how to function in society and completely lacks empathy for those around him. Of course gaining the memories of a father and husband opens up his mind to the emotions that have eluded him his entire life.The thing that surprised me most about Criminal was how refreshing it was. Jericho, being a violent psychopath and all, is not your typical hero. He's a complete asshole who just happens to have the memories of a good man in his head. This results in some entertaining scenes like him ordering something in French and having no idea what he just ordered, or thanking a clerk and immediately wondering why he did. He's generally not a likable guy, but you can't help to root for him and hope his identity crisis eventually leads to some humanity. He's also not some super human capable of anything. The American spy he gains the memories of is shown to be quite proficient with a gun, but Jericho doesn't gain any of the spy's physicality. Any talents he gains are intrinsically linked to the mental shift in his head (such as language and mathematics). It was also refreshing that the villain wasn't your typical villain. He wasn't Muslim, or Russian, or a drug lord. He was a bit more like a James Bond villain; a Spanish anarchist searching for a hacking program that would enable him to take control of the world's missile systems. This movie is brimming with recognisable faces, in addition to the ones in the trailer. Ryan Reynolds was rightly not made a big thing of in the marketing because he plays the spy who dies at the very beginning. However he does make quite an impact. He plays Bill Pope quite straight and level-headed, proving (again) that he is capable of more serious roles every now and then. Gary Oldman plays a character who's probably a polar opposite of that. Quaker Wells (seriously, this movie has a hard-on for unusual names for it's characters) is hot- headed and impatient, giving Oldman lots of shouting to do. I don't want to say it, but his character was maybe a little one-note. Tommy Lee Jones' Dr. Franks is a relatively small part, and Jones doesn't make too much of an impression with what he's given, but he's certainly serviceable as the remarkably calm doctor. Gal Gadot continues to prove me wrong about her acting. I mean, it's still not worthy of an Oscar, but she brings some great emotional depth to her grieving wife Jill Pope, playing the role of emotional anchor to Jericho.Talking of, I've never been a particular fan of Kevin Costner, but he was actually really, really good as Jericho. In his first appearance he's a threatening figure chained to his cell, with dashes of playful insanity thrown in. By the end he has a softer demeanour and look in his eyes. The journey between that is a spectrum of psychopath and emotional. His stone-cold, emotionless presence is slowly subdued and Costner does a fantastic job of adjusting that progressive balance in his character's emotional state. Michael Pitt, Jordi Molla, Antje Traue, and Alice Eve all do really well with their small supporting roles.I mentioned that there wasn't a lot of action in Criminal, but what action there is was gritty and realistic (to a point; a police car exploding into a lorry wasn't exactly the film's finest realism). It's not flashy or stylistic, it's straight to the point, and is often short and sharp. There isn't a lot of digitally created effects either. The most I noticed was an airplane exploding in the air, but it got bonus points for being a really logical and realistic explosion rather than just an indiscriminate ball of fire. Most of the action revolves around punch-ups and gun fights, and you feel every one thanks to the crisp sound design. The protagonists also miss just as much as the villains, making every shootout feel like a level playing-field.I went into Criminal hoping for a superficial action movie, but what I got was an emotionally- resonate thriller. It may be a bit slow at times for those expecting a more action-orientated pace, but it uses that shift in pace to give us a deeper look at Jericho and Bill Pope's life before he died, adding far more depth than I ever anticipated. Criminal isn't just entertaining, it was actually really, really good. I give it a solid 8/10, and would recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Criminally underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Criminal has been slated in most reviews I've read, so I went into this film expecting very little from it. However, the film is actually considerably better than these reviews suggest and has some clever ideas running through it. It's all about the memories of Bill Pope, played by Ryan Reynolds, being transferred into Jericho Stewart, played by Kevin Costner. Both actors do well with what they are given, and Costner is particularly impressive when he has to deal with his own thoughts and Pope's as well. This memory transplant is done so a task can be completed, and you'll understand why if you watch the film. The start of the film is very intense and really pulls in your interest, with a selection of plots being introduced and I felt they all connected quite nicely at the end. The script is a bit lacklustre and uses swearing for effect rather than proper character development, although this isn't totally lacking, as Stewart tries to connect with Pope's family, which develops the story and characters quite nicely.The action sequences provide nothing new or inventive to the genre, but they are well done and they always feel like a payoff for decent storytelling. The primary issue I had with Criminal is the middle section, which becomes very lacklustre and slow, and to be honest is a bit boring. I know most films slow down at some stage, but this one lost my interest a bit, which is never a good sign. We get to see a lot of Gel Gadot here, and she plays a good part and acts well alongside Costner. However the film picks up again with a pretty good final third, although again, nothing new is shown and the action is slightly generic. The film ends well, and the clever principles of this film are not lost through the seen it all before action scenes.So overall, Criminal is film with clever ideas but has generic action sequences which does not merit these ideas, despite the action being entertaining. The acting is good, but the script is lacklustre and the middle section is slow. Criminal is worth a watch, but it won't win any awards despite it being a decent crack at the action film genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Costner is well cast as a dispensable criminal used in an experiment to take the thoughts of a dead CIA agent, Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds), in order to relay his thoughts to the authorities. All does not go to plan however, and it's a chase for the CIA to get the information before the crime lord Xavier Heimdahl (Jordi Moll?) does.Tommy Lee Jones makes a good job of playing Dr Franks and it's nice to see Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) as Pope's widow.The movie takes a little while to really get going but stick with it, although a bit clichéd, there is plenty of action and it's a descent watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would not like another person's memory in my head. It wouldn't be too pleasant. You'd remember connections with complete strangers, have knee-jerk reactions to different fears, be familiar with behaviors and even languages you thought you never knew. You might even be pursued by the wrong kind of people and won't even know it, and that is what happens to hard- ass, deranged criminal Jerico Stewart (Kevin Costner) when he gets the memories of a dead CIA agent (Ryan Reynolds), wanted by both his CIA handlers and a fanatic terrorist.Criminal is a mid-budget, high-concept and brutally violent B-movie, handsomely crafted for the guy crowd. It stars A- listers both present (Ryan Reynolds, Gal Gadot) and past (Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman) bringing their game faces and having fun - none more so than Costner, here trolling more than ever with a gruff, can't-give-a-damn attitude that combines Tom Hardy, Nick Nolte and Keith Richards all in one ultra-badass, ultra-insane swoop.The film was produced by Millennium Films of Expendables and Olympus/London Has Fallen fame, and I'm digging their old- school action offerings. They never aspire to be high-brow entertainment, but given the right script ? and this one is from the same scribes as The Rock (1996) ? they can make fun movies with a rough-and-tough edge. This has added midnight movie strangeness to its concept, and to Vromen's credit, no action beat is missed.For reasons I'll never know, this film is being savaged by Western critics for being too 'dull' and 'dumb'. Perhaps I saw a different movie. It may be dumb, but it sure as hell isn't dull.</fullReview>

To wit: Costner's mind is beset with flashbacks of Reynolds' family life as well as the deal-gone-wrong with hacker Pitt and villain Molla. While the overcooked script by Douglas Cook and David Weisberg is all over the map, co-stars Oldman overacting and Jones underplaying-borderline-bored, director Vromen wisely allows his veteran lead to grouse and gruffly grunt his way thru the hokey plot with aplomb and some surprisingly canny motivations including Gadot as the shapely widow and adorable Decaro as the slain agent's daughter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CriminalThe problem with getting someone else's memories implanted in your head is that you have to remember a ton more birthdays.Sadly, the recipient in this sci-fi thriller isn't the gift-giving type.A CIA higher-up (Gary Oldman) directs a doctor (Tommy Lee Jones) to imbed the memories of dead operative Pope (Ryan Reynolds) into the mind of a noted prisoner, Jericho (Kevin Costner), in order to locate a hacker (Michael Pitt) in possession of nuclear launch codes.However, Jericho escapes during the procedure and heads to Pope's house for sanctuary, where his wife (Gal Gadot) and daughter help him track down the hacker before the Russians do.Extremely light on the science fiction aspect of the story, but heavy on the generic car-chases, shootouts and encrypted flash-drives, this middle-of-the-road mind meld offers little in ingenuity or excitement.What's more, Jericho now knows the passcode to get into the CIA's sauna.

		<shortDescription>Very interesting, although didn't reach its potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That was very much do to the lackluster direction of Ariel Vromen, who has a poor track record. My guess is they chose him because it bore similarities to his previous The Iceman (which didn't match up to the far more interesting, but very disturbing, real person). Iceman was mostly fictionalized and not worth the effort.Much of my praise revolves around the Costner character. It brought up a lot of interesting questions about nature vs. nurture. In the film, he suffered a very severe brain injury that eliminated his impulse control and empathy. Thus it asks a whole lot of questions that swirl around bad and good and the soul of man.But it really didn't explore that very well. It hung onto those elements while delivering a decent action ticking-clock film with a predictable ending. Costner's character had done some very bad things in life and during the film. He really needed a strong dose of guilt about all that but it was kind of white-washed it in favor of trying to make him a conventional hero, which he was not. Some other very good actors doing the best they could. The action was run-of-the-mill except for the very good confrontation at on the tarmac at the end. But it was glossed over when the character caused a couple of cops chasing him in the final car chase to be killed. His character celebrated that even after the half-hearted attempt at him feeling guilt previously.It's really more for a student of film that could forgive the poor elements of this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'CRIMINAL': Four Stars (Out of Five)Action-thriller flick, starring Kevin Costner as a dangerous convict; implanted with a dead CIA agent's memories, in order to finish an important mission. The film costars an impressive all-star cast; including Gal Gadot, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Jordi Molla, Antje Traue, Alice Eve, Michael Pitt, Scott Adkins and Ryan Reynolds (in a special extended cameo). The film was directed by Ariel Vromen, and written by Douglas Cook and David Weisberg (the duo also co-wrote 'THE ROCK' and 'DOUBLE JEOPARDY'). It received mostly negative reviews from critics, but I enjoyed it.Xavier Heimdahl (Molla) is a rich, and extremely dangerous, anarchist; that hires a computer hacker, known as 'The Dutchman' (Pitt), to make him a device which will bypass all nuclear defense codes. The Dutchman panics though, and tries to turn the program over to the CIA. Agent Bill Pope (Reynolds) is sent to retrieve the device, but he's caught and killed; before he can do so. Due to the fact that Pope is the only person that knows The Dutchman's whereabouts, the CIA is desperate to try a special new experiment; which will transfer Pope's memories to another person. The doctor performing the procedure, Dr. Mahal Franks (Jones), recommends convict Jericho Stewart (Costner); due to the fact he has an underdeveloped frontal lobe, from childhood brain trauma. He's also a violent, and very dangerous, criminal; due to this fact! The movie is without a doubt entertaining, but in a cheesy B-movie kind of way. Despite it being poorly written, and almost completely unbelievable, the film does showcase Costner's talents well; he's fantastic in it. The rest of the cast is impressive, but it seems like they're all just there to support Costner. The guy used to be the most popular actor in Hollywood (in the 90s) for a reason, and this movie definitely shows why!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuGIEoCGrtw</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Involving Espionage/Sci Fi Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I assume it's important to emphasize the science fiction element in this spy thriller. One of the criticisms propelled against this movie is that it requires a huge suspension of belief regarding brain memory transfer. Well considering today's quantum computers, nanotechnology, and all sorts of science gizmos whizzing about, it's not hard for me to pretend that in five years the possibility of some pretty fantastic technologies coming about. The memory transfer stretch made me only appreciate how it made the story plot well realized.Spoiler Alert: Following in the footsteps of Kurt Russell's Snake Plissken's character from Escape from New York (1981), with themes from Cliff Robertson's Charly Gordon in Charly (1968), and Arnold Schwarzenegger bipolar role in Total Recall (1990), Kevin Costner has been offered this delicious role that his whole temperament and film character persona has been evolving towards over the decades. Finally taking movie elements of hard edged espionage films as The Bourne Identity (2002), Bourne Supremacy (2004), and Bourne Ultimatum (2007) as well as Enemy of the State (1998) and even Kevin Costner's own recent spy thriller 3 Days to Kill (2014) or his cold psychological thriller Mr. Brooks (2007), Criminal offers up an intense and captivating action thriller.What makes this movie special is its focus more on thoughtful intrigue rather than just big explosions and action scenes. This movie's action scenes are more focused on the raw, personal violence of one man brutalizing another, so much so, that this movie almost becomes politically incorrect and not exactly sympathy inducing. Even so, it seems that female audience members preferred this movie over the male audience movies, suggesting there is an underlying emotive component that really weeps through the digital screen. Criminal was the movie that Kevin Costner was born to play and he did it magnificently. Even though admittedly there were a few logical flaws aside from the science fiction in regards to expected espionage techniques and the tendency for the movie to be more predictable than average, these weakness pale when considering how bold and rough this movie impacted the emotions and senses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's with Ryan Reynolds and mind transfer movies?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mean seriously? First Self/Less and now this? In first one mind was transfered in his body...And now his mind is transfered to the other guy? Come on man...Okay enough of this, let's get to the movie. Sci-fi genre has been developing awhile now. In 90's the peek of it's development was time space-travel(2001 Space Odyssey) and cybernetic organisms(Terminator). In 2000's it was an emotionless society(Equilibrium) and of course The Matrix. In 2010's the directors have begun to tackle with ideas like human mind transfer and gravity. The latter has been explored in a glorious way through Interstellar. But the first one not so much...The last couple of years have presented us a number of movies about mind transfer: Transcendence; self/less and our current matter - Criminal. All three of these movies had some portion of action and drama in it. And all three of them weren't met with high praises. Why?The idea of mind transfer itself is a complex matter. Even in science theory it's hard to imagine it becoming a reality. But why can't they make it work in science fiction...?About Criminal i'll say that this movie was anticipated, but met pretty critically. The film opened couple of doors that weren't meant to even be in the movie like this one. The performances were good and crime + action in the movies description were decent. But the sci-fi element, which should be more important for the film was left out to leave room for drama. And i'd say it worked...in a way. We fell more connected to the characters this way, but the movie doesn't deliver, especially because you can1't shake a feeling that something like this can actually happen.So if you wanna see Deadpool marry Wonder Woman, than die and leave her to mercy of Joseph Kent, who really doesn't like to work for commissioner Gordon, than this movie is for you.But you can absolutely spend two hours watching it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oscar winning film director Kevin Costner hasn't made a good action movie like "Criminal" since he co-starred with Kurt Russell in the eccentric Las Vegas-heist caper "3000 Miles to Graceland" where robbers were Elvis impersonators. "Criminal" washed the sour taste of dreadful epics like "Three Days to Kill" and "Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit" out of my mouth. Aside from his supporting roles in good movies like "Man of Steel" and his cameo in "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," most of Costner's actioneers have been forgettable. Basically, he hasn't made a good movie in 16 years, at least nothing that matches his better films, including "Message in a Bottle," "13 Days," "Waterworld," "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves," "No Way Out," "The Untouchables," "Silverado," and "JFK." Yes, I enjoyed "Waterworld." In "Criminal," Costner gets a chance to shine with a performance that ranges back and forth from one end of the spectrum to the other end. Mind you, "Criminal" isn't going to clinch Costner an Oscar. Nevertheless, this contrived but entertaining memory swap movie is provocative enough to watch more than once. The London settings add a touch of exoticism, and the cast boasts Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Gal Gadot, and Ryan Reynolds. Clearly, Ryan Reynolds must have made this movie before "Deadpool" smashed global box office records. If you're a Reynolds fan, you're going to be enormously disappointed with his peripheral role. Indeed, had "Deadpool" not become the sensational hit that it did, Reynolds might have been reduced to minimal roles like "Criminal." Interestingly enough, Reynolds starred in a movie about a year ago with Ben Kingsley where he played the guy who acquired the memories from another man. "Selfless" was a terrific movie. Ironically, the roles are reversed for Reynolds in "Criminal." London-based CIA agent Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds of "The Proposal") has stashed a cunning computer hacker, Jan Stroop, alias 'The Dutchman' (Michael Pitt of "Seven Psychopaths"), in a safe place until he can conduct the million dollar deal that the Agency has promised Stroop. 'The Dutchman,' it seems, has pulled a "War Games" and has hacked through the Pentagon's firewalls so he can launch weapons of mass destruction whenever and wherever he pleases. The Agency is not alone in their pursuit of Stroop. Insane anarchist Xavier Heimdahl (Jordi Moll? of "Colombiana") has been tracking Pope so he can find 'The Dutchman.' Heimdahl's right-hand man, actually an indestructible, trigger-happy dame, Else Mueller (Antje Traue of "Seventh Son"), has been maintaining surveillance on Pope. She nabs Pope with Xavier's henchmen, and Xavier personally tortures Pope in the worst way possible to learn the whereabouts of 'The Dutchman.' Although he shoves a taser into Pope's mouth and singes him to death, Xavier cannot get a useful word out of him. The CIA careens onto the scene at the last moment, but Pope is kaput. What began as an Edward Snowden type thriller takes a crazy swerve into science fiction as the CIA bring in a neurosurgeon, Dr. Franks (Tommy Lee Jones), who has been tinkering with the concept of transferring the memories from one man to another person. All this reminded me of the recent predicament that FBI found themselves in with a terrorist's iPhone. Anyway, with clinical trials years away, Franks manages to appropriate Pope's memories and transfer them intact into another man's mind. "Criminal" shifts gears as swiftly and abruptly and goes from probable to improbable. The CIA hopes that this new guy will be able to lead them to whenever Pope has hidden Stroop before Stroop either gives himself up to the Russians or Xavier's henchman can find him. Meantime, Stroop aims to prove to the world that he can really hack U.S. military technology with an example of his derring do.If the CIA and Western Civilization weren't in dire straits enough, the man selected by Dr. Franks for the memory transfer turns out to be a psycho afflicted with a condition known as "frontal lobe syndrome." Meaning, prison inmate Jerico Stewart (Kevin Costner of "Wyatt Earp") has no feelings one way or another and does whatever he feels when the occasion arises. Basically, he is a loose cannon without a qualm. The experiment succeeds and Jerico suffers intervals when he speaks French that he has never spoken and has access to Pope's memories. He enters the correct security codes to Pope's London apartment and questions Pope's suspicious wife Jill (Gal Gadot of "Batman v Superman") about a case containing millions of dollars. Originally, Pope had planned to use this money to pay off The Dutchman, but everything fell through after he died. Initially, Jerico wants the loot for himself. As the plot of this 113-minute, R-rated epic thickens, he decides to do the right thing. Incredibly, he wants to pick up where Bill Pope left off, and Pope's adorable daughter Emma (newcomer Lara Decaro) takes a shine to Jerico.The pair who penned the Sean Connery &amp; Nicholas Cage thriller "The Rock" were the minds behind "Criminal." Scenarists Douglas Cook and David Weisberg also collaborated on the Tommy Lee Jones &amp; Ashley Judd thriller "Double Jeopardy" as well as the Patricia Arquette crime comedy "Holy Matrimony." "Criminal" shares similarities with "The Rock." First, when we are introduced to Jerico, he is locked up in maximum security and sports shoulder-length hair, just as Connery did in "The Rock." Against everybody's objections, Jerico is recruited for this radical experiment. Like the Connery hero in "The Rock," Jerico is a Houdini of an escape artist, but he doesn't give a crap about anybody but himself. Second, the man-in-the-middle of "Criminal" is as amoral as Ed Harris was in "The Rock." The Harris character threatened to launch missiles, and 'The Dutchman' is prepared to wield the Pentagon's doomsday arsenal against it. Essentially, the similarities end here. Of course, "Criminal" is incredibly far-fetched, especially its happily ever after finale, but "Iceman" director Ariel Vromen never lets the pace slacken and stages several exciting action scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has substance, needed more style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a competently made film, with a decent-enough story, and the interesting sci-fi premise of transferring memories from one person to another, with great performances, especially from Kevin Costner, but... it felt lacking in some ways that could have elevated it to being considered great. I think this is a case of a movie that has substance, but could have used some more style.Story: The real story here is not the beat-the-bad-guys and save-the-world plot, but rather it's the personal redemption arc of Kevin Costner's title criminal as he starts out as an all-around bad guy at the beginning, but transforms throughout the movie into someone we actually care for, because for the first time in his life, he possibly starts to care about others. It was actually pretty touching.Characters: The supporting cast (Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Gal Gadot, Ryan Reynolds, etc.) is good, they serve their purposes, but Costner is the standout here as Jericho, gruff-voiced, physically intimidating despite his age, capable of brutal violence, but also witty sarcasm.In case it's not clear, by the way, Kevin Costner does not simply wake up thinking he's Ryan Reynolds after the memory transfer! Instead of ever completely turning into Ryan Reynold's character, he is only influenced by his memories - and that's what's interesting here, watching this guy struggle with whether to resist or accept those memories.The villains had minimal backstory or motive or personality, which unfortunately made them mostly uninteresting, which was a wasted opportunity, because this movie could have used some over-the-top villains, instead of the bland ones we got here. They should have taken some pages from Gary Oldman's past performances.Action: Here's where I wish the movie had a little more style. The action in this movie is best described as competent, but not better than that. There are moments when it's pretty good, especially the vehicle scenes, but I wanted more. I feel like a director with a more stylish sense of action, could have handled this movie better, like John Woo perhaps, or maybe the guys who made that John Wick movie.I mean, they got Scott Adkins in the cast, a talented acrobatic martial arts guy, but they don't even use him for any of that. Why not throw into the movie a couple of cool hand-to- hand combat fights? Costner can still handle it, I'm sure, as he shows in this movie, when he's given the chance. But I wanted more. Make good use of him before he gets too old!Final thoughts: I don't regret seeing it, but I'm not in a rush to recommend it to people, or to see it again, which is a shame, because there's some good stuff here, but it could have been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Criminal' is actually Good Fun, Despite A Silly Premise! The idea is a bit too hard to believe, but luckily, the narrative doesn't lose steam &amp; remains engaging for the most part. And the Ensemble Cast Delivers! 'Criminal' Synopsis: In a last-ditch effort to stop a diabolical plot, a dead CIA operative's memories, secrets, and skills are implanted into a death-row inmate in hopes that he will complete the operative's mission.'Criminal' is racy, violent &amp; ridiculous. I mean, planting a person's memories into another person is a silly thought. But, this is Escapist Cinema &amp; hence what matters here, is how engaged you are amidst the madness. Jericho, the protagonist (played by Kevin Costner in a comeback performance), is an unlikely guy, but its interesting to watch him fight between memories as well as fight the villains behind him. I liked the protagonist &amp; hence the goings-on were thoroughly watchable.Douglas Cook &amp; David Weisberg's Screenplay is entirely escapist, but its arresting, at most parts. Ariel Vromen's Direction is good. Cinematography is passable. Editing is mostly crisp, although the film overstays its welcome by, at least, 15-minutes. A shorter running time would've worked more. Action-Sequences are raw &amp; brutal. Background Score merits a special mention. Performance-Wise: Kevin Costner is in form after a long time. As Jericho, Costner is at his deadliest &amp; also his toughest, enacting the unlikely hero with command. Gal Gadot is wonderful. Gary Oldman is loud, but delivers. Tommy Lee Jones is effective, as always. Jordi Moll? is excellent as the antagonist. Ryan Reynolds adds star-value in a tiny cameo. On the whole, 'Criminal' works for the most part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I made it to the local multi-plex over the weekend to see what's being described a "thought-provoking thriller". Kevin Costner stars as one bad-ass dude (the film's titular "Criminal"), who is implanted with a dying CIA agent's memories to finish an assignment, and prevent -what else- world annihilation! You'll see the reunion of three of the main players of Oliver Stone's classic, "JFK", besides Kevin, Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Oldman. This film does bring up some interesting issues about human behavior. Most of the movie, I was on the fence. It mostly followed Kevin on the run in London, pretty much wreaking total havoc! But without giving anything away, it was about the last part of the movie that caused me to give it a borderline recommend. But definitely not worth seeing in theaters. Wait for it to be on TV. LOL And I see it just tanked at the box office- one of Costner's all-time lowest opening weekends-??- and THAT's saying a LOT... LOL Recent "Deadpool" star, Ryan Reynolds, also has a key- surprising- role in this.</fullReview>

His English doesn't sound like a Dutchie speaking English but a Russian, German at best, no way a Dutchie. And not being able to pronounce Jan Stroop the right way, unforgivable. Would take 10 minutes of practice to get that right. If you're a good actor. As for the rest, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Exciting, touching, the way he's struggling with his emotions. Just a good movie, great acting on the part of Kostner. And absolutely wonderful to finally see a worthwhile again, not yet another comic book film. (I so hate that crap!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strange mix of good, bad, dull, fun, stupid, interesting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gary Oldman is bad. Never seen him this bad, like he wants to do a bad job.Gal Gadot is good. Never seen her this good, usually she just walks around, as if it's enough - well, for some purposes, it actually is, but, for the purpose of acting, it is as if someone finally got to her.Tommy Lee Jones is dull. It's like "I got the money, I'm gonna say the lines, but for real performance, give me more money or a better script".Kevin Costner is fun. This is not his traditional role, he's not great, but he's fun.Script is stupid. Not just the silly mind-transfer surgery thing. Pretty much all of it.But, the ideas behind this are interesting and Costner and Gadot also have a few interesting scenes. Also, it does seem like someone put a lot of actors from DC characters movies together on purpose. Kind of makes you think, Alice Eve is surely up for a DC character, otherwise why is she here? Apparently, her agent hasn't told her yet, 'cause she also doesn't quite get why is she in this movie.I could go on, but you get the picture. A very, very strange mix of unmixable things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The style is imitation Jason Bourne. Kevin Costner is relentless. It is also relentlessly stupid 75% of the time. The C.I.A. has a hundred agents, all the police in London and technology to view every street in London, and instantly identify every person with face recognition, but it keeps losing Costner, plus the guy he's trying to find - a hacker called the Dutchman, and the bad guy- Anarchist. They can plant memories in Costner's head, but they forget to plant a tracking device in his body. The Dutchman has hacked into every defense system in the United States and launch any nuclear missile at will. Smart guy, right? Yet he asks for $10 million dollars to return control to the C.I.A. It reminds one of Dr. Evil in Austin Powers who demands 1 million dollars to not destroy the world. Does this guy really think the C.I.A. and security agencies around the world are going to just leave him alone if he gets 10 million dollars? He can still hack into the national defense systems and destroy the world. He apparently can control all the weapons in the world from a thumb drive. Yep, a thumb drive. One could have a good time laughing at the ridiculousness of the movie, but it really has a nasty edge to. Its like the writers said, of course this is ridiculous, but the audience is 16 year old imbeciles and they won't care. There is a lot of disgusting and pointless violence. Yeah, the 16year old sadistic imbeciles like to see people getting hurt, so lets have the hero hurt a lot of people, smashing things over their heads and punching them in the face. Another problem with the movie is that Michael Pitt who plays the Dutchman is really a handsome young actor and should have had the lead role and Kevin Costner should have had the much smaller Dutchman role. Anyways, if you like stomach churning violence, ridiculously dumb plot elements, and few laughs, this is your movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, if you are into just entertainment, and so into make sense detail kind of thing, so this is the movie for you. I saw it, and immediately came to mind my mind another movie Face/Off. This one the story is somewhat similar, to frustrate an extortion plot, an agent dies and his memories, secrets, and as well his skills are implanted into someone else, a casted away death-row criminal; all they hoped was for this man to finish the dead agent mission? Yes, Ryan Reynolds again, I think he does have some kind of difficult in choosing his roles, you could say it again, a talent that slowly is being wasted? On the other hand, Kevin Costner tries really hard to play a badass criminal, but the result was something like his role in Robin Hood, goodness grace, give me a brake? Anyhow, overall it isn't such a bad movie, like I said, pure entertainment, with a good taste of location, and a very well elaborated shots sequence?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nowadays racism is the talk of the town. Apparently however, if the race happens to be Russian, all bets are off.As long as the western establishment... well, "establishes", that hating Russians, Putin, and just about everything and everyone else who is associated with Russia is okay, then, voila! Perfectly fine. Ah why not, right? The news media says Russia and Putin are bad so it MUST be true.I wonder how difficult it would be to convince mainstream society that East Asian children have been conspiring to take over the world due to all the sneakers they collectively have had stolen from them by innocent jogging enthusiasts? I will bet dollars to donuts that every person who reads this review will agree that mainstream media along with Hollywood and pretty much all information resources available through the internet and TV, lie. Yet still, while agreeing with that statement, many will still agree that Russia is the bad guy and Putin is evil. What irony! What paradox! It's like saying, "I know snakes bite but I can't just not take that cobra home with me and let my kid roll around with it." How does this relate to the movie? Pure racist anti-Russian garbage and propaganda. Typical "'murica good, Russia bad" filth. I would hope that in this day and age when we can easily realize about mainstream internet giants blocking our abilities to know the facts, that every single day people are also realizing that it is America and the western media and propaganda that are the bad guys, and definitely (!!!) not Russia, and certainly not its president. In fact, they are about the last stand between good and evil in this world today as it sits.This movie however, makes it a point to continue to force the lies about Russia down the collective throats of whoever watches it. For that reason alone the story was ruined for me. Had they, for instance, made 'murica the bad guy for JUST ONCE (Mary and Joseph!), I would have said okay, realistic story line. But nooo. CIA always smarter. Bad guys Russian. "Of coooourse" the Russian bad guys are just sooo darn dumb that at the flip of a switch the CIA knows everything, and of course, yup, 'murica wins.What a racist bunch of drivel. Hate has a rule book and clearly that rule book has inclusive and exclusive races. Russians are once again, via fake reasons contrived by Washington and Hollywood, perfectly good fodder to be racist against. When unsure which race is okay to hate, just open the rule book on liars.gov or watch any Hollywood sewage pipe extract like this one, and your brain will be set straight. Be a good sheep.Unfortunate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"They messed with my brain?" Opening with a line that comically (rather than ominously) portends the mind-swapping element of the premise, "Criminal" proceeds to show a clip from the climax before circling back around to the beginning. It's the most overused way to start a movie, but that didn't stop the filmmakers, who also notably christened their project with a terribly bland title. The real shame, despite so many tiresome routines, is that there's a wealth of unrealized potential in what follows.CIA Intelligence Agent Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds) hustles through the streets of London, hoping to elude the henchmen (and uncommonly sexy henchwoman Elsa Mueller, played by Antje Traue, clad in black leather and uncomfortably high heels) of Spanish anarchist Xavier Heimdahl (Jordi Molla). Impassioned with the notion of toppling all established governments, Xavier needs to track down Jan Strook, a.k.a. the "Dutchman" (Michael Pitt), a young hacker who has taken control of the U.S. military's defense systems. But Pope has arranged for Strook to flee the country in exchange for his "Wormhole" governance program (safely stored on an unencrypted, plug-and-play flash drive).When Heimdahl catches up with Pope, the agent is killed, leaving the CIA's head of operations Quaker Wells (Gary Oldman) to call in controversial Dr. Franks (Tommy Lee Jones). Though he's still five years away from human trials, it's imperative that Franks uses his inexplicably advanced surgical technologies to implant Pope's memories into the brain of a suitable candidate. And that subject is Jericho Stewart (Kevin Costner), a man locked away in prison for most of his life due to specific damage caused to his frontal lobe during childhood (leaving him with a total lack of empathy and an inability to determine right from wrong).It's actually not a memory transfer. It's a memory duplication, which is marginally successful a few brain drillings later. Regardless, the movie takes too long to get going. Especially for an actioner and still noticeably for a basic thriller, "Criminal" meanders with its setup, going through the effort to film Pope's capture, his torture, Stewart's confinement, the recollection replication process, and finally the orientation time - before finally getting into the adventure. Sadly, for Reynolds fans, he's not the star. But then neither are the smattering of Academy Award-winning supporting players, all disappointingly underused. Gary Oldman struggles with his generic dialogue, Alice Eve is little more than a background agent, Tommy Lee Jones disappears for most of the film, and even a recognizable character actor like Robert Davi is hard to spot. But Gal Gadot is in the most unfortunate position, scripted to readily accept Jericho as a replacement for Bill - not long after she's potentially threatened with rape and even the slaughter of her child. And her traumatic experiences don't prevent her from allowing that same young daughter (Lara Decaro) to interact with Jericho as if he was her father.Nevertheless, there's something fascinating about the idea of an irredeemable sociopath getting an opportunity to grapple with emotions for the first time, or an adept terrorizer gaining and then slowly losing his ability to stave off the desire for destruction. This, of course, anticipates a tense, bloodthirstily satisfying showdown with the completely evil villain - which doesn't quite happen. As Kevin Costner endeavors to be an action hero (evident through his previous turn in "3 Days to Kill"), or a Jason Bourne spook of sorts without the martial arts prowess, he's immersed in a story that, surprisingly, possesses an ample helping of engaging possibilities. There's not just a good movie but a great one buried deep within this mess of espionage clichés, though it's too far from the surface for most viewers to comprehend.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Criminal is a bad film with an amazing movie inside of it. It's very hard to explain because everything in this movie is total crap except for the Kevin Costner story arch. I LOVED his character, the story about him receiving these memories from someone else, and now he is caring about other people that he wishes he didn't care about. It was a very interesting concept that had great execution because before Kevin Costner had the memory transfer, he was a serial killer, and had no emotions towards human life. Sadly though, the film suffers with having too many subplots, over complicating itself, all other characters are annoying, and some cheesy dialogue here and then. I really wish this was just a straight forward movie about Kevin Costner's story but it isn't.

		<shortDescription>Awkward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even with the efforts of its top notch cast, Criminal never really leaps off the screen to give us anything of substance. It may please some genre fans with its cool premise, but they'll likely be left with a film of no real substance or personality.Kevin Costner stars as Jericho Stewart, a death-row inmate who is forced to undergo a surgery to recover the memories of Bill Pope, played by Ryan Reynolds, a CIA agent with important and dangerous information regarding a mission. Even though Reynolds is barely in the film at all, I can't help but feel like this idea is utterly similar to his 2015 film, Self/less. But Reynolds isn't the problem here. In fact, the opening 10 minutes in which is largely focused on him, were quite compelling. The opening of the film feels like an entry in the Bourne franchise with its espionage, chases, and thrill sequences. Sadly, the rest of the film never reaches the heights of its opening.Being a criminal, as the title clearly states, it becomes hard for the audience to root for Jericho. Glimpses of his humanity underneath are only shown here or there. As Jericho becomes more and more like Pope, he draws his attention to Pope's family, and there lies several awkward scenes. Gal Gadot provides a solid performance as Pope's wife, but I felt no chemistry at all between her and Costner. Awkward is really the best way to describe it.Gary Oldman and Tommy Lee Jones have some screen time and they are great as always, but again, I was never invested at what was going on to these characters. The script/directing never pulled me in to care about the consequences and what's at stake. The villain, known as the 'Spanish Anarchist' is over-the-top, and there's plenty of gratuitous violence that doesn't fit in with the story they were trying to tell. Overall, the best way I can describe the feeling I had watching this film was awkward.+Good effort from the cast-Wasn't invested in the characters-Gratuitous violence5.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Get ready to root for the bad guy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tagline I listed above is actually the tagline from the 1999 film starring Mel Gibson, "Payback." They seemed to take that tagline to heart and decided to try to do that same thing, more or less. However, it is actually quite painful to watch. To steal a line from another movie, Tropic Thunder, "never go full retard"; or in this case, never go full bad guy. The problem when you actually make the main character, supposedly a "hero", a genuinely bad person - you find yourself not wanting to root for them, and that was definitely the case in this film. Near the beginning there is one line of dialogue essentially explaining why Coaster does bad things, and this one line is supposed to create sympathy for the audience toward the main character - but it falls flat. They take the true "good guy/hero" (Reynolds) and then combine him into the same person as a true bad guy (Costner) - but not like a bad guy in Mel Gibson's Payback where you still find yourself liking/rooting for him - an actual bad guy you want to dislike. Beyond that, I'm not generally one to nit pick on plot hole issues; but there were some huge ones in this movie - it wasn't so much that I wanted things explained, it just made some things confusing and hard to follow. On the plus side, I did think the acting was all pretty good and all the production values were really good. Bottom line: More of a Netflix watch then a lets go spend $20 at the theater kind of movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Criminal is yet another formulaic, unimaginative, espionage orientated action flick, with status quo, affirming overtones. There'e the usual formulaic CIA "hero", the classic cardboard cut out terrorist and to try and liven up things, a criminal, who has the CIA operatives memories implanted in his noggin. Once again, as is the current "trend", the Russians are the bad guys pals, aiding and abetting, the terrorists. Sorry but the cold wars over and guess what, if people are anything like me, they are not buying into the ersatz "re-run". Simply put, Criminal, comes across as a yet another "beige" production line affair. A situation made worse by rather bland performances from the actors and a storyline that meanders around aimlessly, like the key character, played by Kevin Costner.Are there any positives here, I hear you ask? Well, there's some action scenes that are not too awful and the acting, whilst uninspiring, is not dreadful.There's not a lot more to say really. I have seen Kevin Costner in at least one decent spy action thriller but this is, most definitely, not it.Three out of ten from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Criminally misdirected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often times, after I see a film, I look up the director and writer of a film on IMDb to find out more about them. After seeing the Kevin Costner starring film CRIMINAL, I set out to find out more about Director Ariel Vromen and Writers Douglas Cook and David Weisberg.So I can make sure that I NEVER sit through another movie of their's again.CRIMINAL has an interesting premise, the memories of a dying spy are implanted in the brain of a criminal, slowly, those two minds battle, who will emerge? The smart, kind spy? Or the umempathetic, hard edged CRIMINAL (now with super spy skills)? They even enlisted a pretty good list of actors - Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman and Tommy Lee Jones. Even Wonder Woman herself, Gal Gadot, shows up for a few scenes.So where did it all go wrong?Let's start with the Direction. Vromen, known for 2012's THE ICEMAN (I know, I haven't heard of it either), makes a "criminal" sin in this type of movie, he took an interesting premise that could have been a "bang bang" Arnold or Willis movie and decided to throw artsy touches and long takes, filming in semi-darkness the ENTIRE film. This makes this movie seem long, languid and BORING. I kept wanting to scream to the screen "pick up the pace"! The action sequences are mediocre at best and the performances he pulls out of the actors range from bored (Tommy Lee Jones) to over- the- top shouty (Oldman) to Nick Nolte-level grunting (Costner). And that's too bad as they had a chance to make Costner's character really interesting. Jones states that Jericho (Costner) cannot tell right from wrong. Apparently, that means cutting in line at Starbucks and killing bad guys or guys that "had it coming". How about putting some real "I don't know right from wrong" moments in here that would shock, or at least get our attention. Have him punch a Nun. Have him pee on a cat. Have him liking BATMAN V SUPERMAN. ANYTHING that would make his character actually interesting.At this point in a bad review, I usually pick out one performance that I can say "at least that was good". The best I could do here is to say that Gadot and Alice Eve (Star Trek: Into Darkness) didn't suck.Oh, did I mention Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool, himself!) was in this film? I wonder who he owed this brief favor to.As for the writing, I usually "go with the flow" in these types of movies, and will cut it slack for moments of logistical nonsense and "non-science science", but there were a few plot holes in this movie that I just could not get past. I couldn't understand how the bad guys found out about Costner and I REALLY couldn't understand why they cared about him. Don't even get me started about the inevitable "twist" at the end. It made no sense and I just couldn't "go with it".You can try to "go" with this movie. Or, more to the point, you can "go past" this movie and check out something better in this genre, like Arnold in TOTAL RECALL or Travolta and Cage in FACE OFF.5 out of 10 stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No one objects to a big star like Kevin Costner playing his "aging-actor-career-extension" card, right? So what if Liam Neeson called and wants his gravelly vocal delivery back? Not even Mickey Rourke would ask for the return of the haircut. **mild spoilers ahead**The screenplay tries to skate along a Bourne-type action path, with just enough sci-fi-ish novelty to support a catchy tag line and get financing. Unfortunately the result is criminal for audience and actors alike. The evidence:Gary Oldman, as Special Agent in Charge of Everything That Happens in Europe, is made to say and do more foolish, self- defeating, contradictory, openly stupid things than any actor should ever be saddled with.Tommy Lee Jones plays a medical genius named Dr. What Movie Are We Shooting. His job seems to be to show that someone has a SAG card with more sags than Mr. Costner's. Both the good and the bad guys have laptops and wall-screens that show perfectly framed video of everything that is happening in all places, public and private, except for the agent's home where the World's Most Wanted Man is hanging out for long stretches. About halfway through, the guy who can launch any US nuke at any moment decides he doesn't want that capability to fall into the wrong hands after all. Maybe just give it to the Russians.Either the production tried to save money by eliminating all use of tripods and dollies or someone kept bumping into the cameraman a LOT.Finally there's Kevin Costner, whose head aches horribly because he is holding the intelligence of two separate people in his brain at once. They both should have turned down the role. It's hard to believe the people who wrote this screenplay once wrote The Rock. Welcome to the action movie business of today--where good writing is not welcome, but big stars compromise themselves just to keep their hand in the game, and pray for a couple of quality acting moments per flick. Faint Praise Dept.: Everyone plays it straight here, and while the actors look confused about their motivations on a moment- by-moment basis, they really aren't just mailing it in. in fact, Gary Oldman may actually be trying to have fun (but I'm not certain about that). Like its main character, this film wants to be bad-ass, not simply bad. But if it does get a sequel, that would be Criminal, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unemotional, Overlong Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Criminal, Kevin Costner plays Jerico Stewart, a sociopath, who feels no empathy, emotion or regret. Imprisoned as a violent criminal, he is given a second chance when a CIA operative is killed in action, and "transplanting" his memories into Jericho's head could be the only way to complete the mission. In a cast full of talent such as Gary Oldman and Tommy Lee Jones, Costner's portrayal of Jerico is over the top, unnecessarily brutal and slightly moronic. Don't get your hopes up about the rest of the cast either, they do little to shine. Tommy Lee Jones is used sparingly in his role of a doctor who provides little to the story outside of performing the surgery, yet somehow is deemed important enough to tag along the rest of the film. Gary Oldman's character also probably has some psychological issues as well, and it feels as though his only purpose is to drive the nonexistent story line with his impatient mistakes. Overall, Criminal fails to deliver any emotional moments, provides poor characters who I was never able to relate to, and quite frankly, never even liked. I never fully decided whether or not I was supposed to root for this violent, blood thirsty beast or if he was intended as the antagonist. The most disappointing aspect of the film is that it is based on the very interesting, thought provoking subject of transferring memories, and the morality of such actions. Never once did they question should they be doing this, or what kind of adverse effects it could have on society. A bland and stereotypical script fails to delve into what could have made this a very thoughtful and enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the whole length of the movie I've been extremely frustrated knowing that this could have turned out a great movie since it has a good idea for a plot yet endlessly many mistakes, situations that don't make sense, ridiculous script and sometimes funny acting making it the worst movie of the year for me and one of the stupidest I've ever watched. A senior CIA figure panicking all the time and losing his nerves, giving up on a piece of potentially world saving information after 3 minutes of trying, not being able to follow the recommendations of the ONLY scientist in the world who knows anything about this "experiment" yet at the end of the movie taking all the time on the world to blame another one of the main characters while security people are rushing them to evacuate the place asap for fear of their lives; having a serial killer braking into my house and not changing the security code after, seeing the same serial killer in my house and not calling the police, the CIA having powerful surveillance systems able to locate subjects in seconds yet when it doesn't serve the plot they take ages to do so; the whole movie is just so flawed, ridiculously directed; it has done so much damage to the image I have of 3 of my favorite and top Hollywood stars; I'll never be able to watch them in any movie again without remembering this fiasco. 2 of the "foreign" characters though being German and Spanish would have seemed much more convincing had they actually spoken with a Spanish and German accent respectively, I actually had to go back and check them on IMDb because I was wondering why they were chosen for the roles and not native speakers only to discover they are.And what is with Kevin Costner's voice? I mean this is not a Batman movie.Ryan Reynolds is the only one of the main characters escaping unscathed but only because his character dies on the first 10 minutes.I'm running out of words, I'm sure I was annoyed by so much more but it's frustrating trying to remember, so I'll keep it at that. Having said all that, the movie was not totally "not fun" to watch; just stupid fun.</fullReview>

The story is ... well really stupid.. but its an action flick.. so we can go along with it in the name of fun.... but the film is very very frustrating to watch. I don't know what Ariel was thinking.. Did he make his mark in music videos or something? The full use of hand-held cameras and the constant movement make sure that the picture is jittery and blurred throughout. A very lazy and cheap approach to film making. It can really ruin a film. If you couple the hand held camera aspect with the way it is cut with extreme closeups in practically every shot, you end up with a film that is extremely frustrating to watch. I have seen enough of Kevin Costner's nose hair. :-)Very few shots last more than 3-4 seconds. Every shot is an extreme closeup, and very jittery and constantly moving.. Arrrrgh.. I kept noticing how much the film resembled the previews shown before movies. Previews are teasers, with very quick flashes of video. But they aren't the full film. This movie is essentially an hour and a half of a preview video. If you can endure it, along with the stupid stupid ridiculous story, you might have a decent time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I get on with my energetic mockery of "Criminal" (R, 1:53), I'd like to tell you about the opening scene ? one of the film's few which isn't cringe-worthy: Knowing that a heroic character is about to be killed can be tense. You know he's going to die soon because that's made clear in the movie's theatrical trailer and sets up the whole plot, but you don't know how it's going to happen (and I'm not going to spoil it). As the character careens from one dangerous situation to the next, you feel like the director is playing a game of Jenga with the unfortunate character's life ? and your emotions. It's too bad that the script by Douglas Cook and David Weisberg (who co-wrote 1996's "The Rock") and the direction by Ariel Vromen (who made 2012's criminally underseen contract killer biopic "Iceman", with Michael Shannon) didn't make this entire film as smart as its beginning.When Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds), an American CIA agent stationed in London is killed, Quaker Wells (Gary Oldman), the CIA's London Station Chief, goes into a bit of a panic. There's a Spanish anarchist with the (odd) name Hagbardaka Heimbahl (Jordi Moll?) out there and he wants to decimate the capital cities of major world powers so he can show (what's left of) the world how (what's left of) the world should properly be governed. (Think, Ted Cruz or Bernie Sanders on crack.) When Hamhock (sorry? Heimbahl) calmly explains his idea in an ordinary-sounding TV interview, all he needs is the cooperation of his favorite missing computer hacker. But the CIA wants the hacker too.Before he stopped breathing, Pope was trying to secure a computer program called "Wormhole", which fits on a flash drive and can control the U.S. military's worldwide arsenal of missiles. Pope was on his way to meet Jan Stroop (Michael Pitt), who calls himself "The Dutchman" (a VERY safe and secure on-line name for a Dutch computer hacker). Only Pope knows where The Dutchman is, so with Pope dead, the CIA is SOL (Seemingly Out of Luck). But hold on! Pope's not REALLY dead, he is just most nearly dead.There's still brain activity! There's also an American scientist named Dr. Franks (Tommy Lee Jones) who has successfully transferred memories from one mammal to another and thinks his process can work the same way on humans! There's a chance to save Pope's memories! Oh, happy day! If only Franks had a suitable human host for what's left of Pope. Wait ? he does!! It's a good thing that the movie's title character, a dangerous, completely amoral prison inmate named Jericho Stewart (Kevin Costner), has an underdeveloped brain that would make the perfect "clean slate" on which to transfer Pope's memories! It's too bad that when Stewart wakes up after his major brain surgery, he cannot immediately recall the hacker's whereabouts. Oh, well. Rather than wait a little longer to see if Stewart will come up with this potentially world-saving information, Wells decides simply to have him killed. (Arrrrgh!) The movie's set-up may be ridiculous, but at least there are good guys to root for and bad guys to root against. However, most of these characters are wearing both white hats and black hats. Dr. Franks is a mild-mannered scientist who admits that he's years away from human trials, yet immediately agrees to operate on a human subject without Stewart's consent or even understanding of what is going on. Wells (ironically, the same last name as the scientist who put bionic parts into Steve Austin in TV's "The Six Million Dollar Man") is ostensibly trying to save lives, but tosses aside those who don't matter to him.Hambone (Heimbahl. Whatever.) is willing to disregard the rights of millions of people who don't agree with him, but, hey, it's all about making the world great again, so it's okay. (He's just telling it like it is.) Hummelfigure has a henchman (excuse me, henchwoman) named Elsa Mueller (Antje Traue, rocking ginger locks) who is every bit as ruthless as Stewart, but she forgives and hugs her beloved homicidal maniac after he apologizes for a verbal outburst, so, she's kinda cool. The Dutchman has the power to destroy the whole world with his computer program, but he doesn't really want to. (That's why this highly irresponsible computer expert fled from that highly insane anarchist.) Stroop is willing to give Wormhole to the CIA... for a U.S. passport ? and $10 million. (But "it's not about the money".) Even though Costner's character is described (and shown in his prison cell) as a less cannibalistic, but more dangerous version of Hannibal Lecter, he behaves more like a spoiled child? albeit an extremely violent spoiled child. (Think the "Affluenza Teen", without the money, but with Rocky Balboa's fists and The Terminator's family values.) The only really decent people in this film are the Popes. (Sorry. Bad phrasing.) Bill, his erstwhile wife, now widow, Jill (Gal Gadot), and their sweet young daughter, Emma (Lara Decaro), are decent folks whose goodness rubs off on Stewart when they? um, get inside his head."Criminal" is not a terrible movie; it's just a stupid movie. Many political thrillers require Movie Fans to press the "I Believe" button, but I wore my button the --ck (heck) out in the film's first 20 minutes or so. Ignoring the story's silliness and plot holes, I actually enjoyed the film's action and its resolution, but that's not good enough. My advice? When "Criminal" is out on video, watch the trailer to remind you of the set-up, then start watching the movie at the DVD/Blu-ray chapter "The CIA Guy Tell His Thugs to 'Take Out the Trash', But the Criminal is Too Stupid to See What's Happening and Gets In the Agents' Car Anyway" (or whatever they end up titling that scene). Watching this entire movie should be illegal. "C"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a horrible movie. Kevin Costner did the worst acting imaginable. The whole movie is one long boring monotone flop. How on earth did the 3 well known actors sign onto this? I guess Costner needed a paycheck as well as tommy lee.... Anyone else would have turned down this role. Seriously. I love him in almost all his movies. He sounds like a drunk gangbanger the whole movie. Tommy lee jones sucked as well. All Costner did is mumble and grab his head in fake pain all movie. That's it. The plot? Laughable. No action no suspense no drama no nothing. This must be one of those "it costs 30 million to make it but it will only gross $18 million" movies because the actors wanted too much money each to screw over the paying audience. I walked out 3/4 way and sat at the movie theater bar and shook my head. Luckily my sprint stock I own went up a point and paid for the movie on paper. The music sucked, the scenery sucked, the scrip is pathetic, and is as if some high schoolers wrote this. Dead pool was 100x better than this movie and I didn't even like dead pool all that much. Save your $$. Don't believe the 10/10 lying @ss reviews. They are put up by idiots trying to get this movie budget to break even. Boycott this and go to an arcade. You will have much more entertainment. I saw someone sleeping 1 row over and laughed :D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof that Studio Producers still DON't get it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's begin with the title. "Criminal." Is the title of this film something that inspires one to spend money...NO. Most females, don't want to see Kevin Costner in a movie titled "Criminal." That's a demographic lesson for you idiots that continue to push films with Stars "Outside" their demo's comfort zone. So cross-out the female audience.Two, is "Criminal" a date movie...NO. 15-28 year old women and girls don't care about this silly concept of a movie. So what do you have left? 15-25 guys that have testosterone raging through their veins, but only have enough money to see a movie with somebody their age, starring in it.So all in all, Executives at the Studios and the Executive Producers really don't have a freaking clue what sells, to what demos they're going after.Thanks for wasting money and time for a really average film, that had an old story-line with an old Star.</fullReview>
