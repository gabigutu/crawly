		<shortDescription>A crazily woven tale that breaks the mould of genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film will divide audiences and critics (as it already has; especially American and British ones), so it will be interesting to see whether it finds a market here in Australia. 'The Dressmaker' is the long awaited directorial return of Jocelyn Moorhouse. After 'Proof' was a major critical success in 1991, American features followed, but this is the first for Ms Moorhouse in nearly 2 decades. There is an audacious feel to this movie from start to finish and for me, an unexpected one. From the movie poster, this would seem like a period costume drama; well it is certainly set in a bygone era, and there is a panoply of amazing costumes, but this film is impossible to squeeze into a genre; making it a challenge to describe nor summarize.As I write this review, the film has not yet opened nationwide in Australia; but if the preview audience I attended was any indication, this film will be enjoyed by local filmgoers, but will it find a mainstream audience? I somehow doubt it. It is anarchic; indulgent, broad, implausible and loads of fun!! I enjoyed most of its 2 hour running time; but the final quarter did feel clumsy with a little too much plot shoehorned in; giving it a chaotic and lurching quality. Early on I sat wondering how this movie will fit into the already idiosyncratic reputation that Aussie films have; both at home and on the world screens. 'The Dressmaker' is ultimately going to be its own genre. As an adaptation from the novel of the same name; there are so many characters to depict and follow; and part of the chaos was the litany of quirkily filmed sequences with a who's who of local talent. This is easily the best cast ever assembled for an Australian feature; from stand up comedians to TV icons, to stage and screen legends; and new talent. Perhaps it will be the star lineup that will lure filmgoers into the cinema for this movie. Judy Davis, one of our most celebrated actors, virtually steals the movie from the British import, the amazing Kate Winslet. Davis is in top form here, showing a screwball comedic side; rarely seen in her stellar career thus far; perhaps only glimpsed in the Woody Allen films she has appeared in. With the blackened teeth; the haggard make up and hobo costuming, Judy is a riot as the mother to the story's protagonist. If Ms Davis doesn't get the AACTA for Supporting Actress, I'll be very surprised. And if the movie gets the right marketing, perhaps that elusive Oscar for one of the great unrewarded screen stars. The teaming of Judy with Kate Winslet works well; there are some riotous moments and tender ones too; which give the film not only respite from the breakneck speed but some gravitas. Liam Hemsworth is suitably the movie matinée idol; with his piercing blue eyes, his tall, muscular frame and that true blue Aussie drawl. Sarah Snook shows once again why she is the lady in waiting for the big time, and is racking up an impressive list of screen credits. There are so many great actors here: Sacha Horler, Barry Otto, Julia Blake, Genevieve Lemon, Rebecca Gibney, literally just naming a few, and perhaps best of all, a cross dressing Hugo Weaving, showing that there is nothing this great actor cannot play, and play admirably.The film is beautifully filmed and designed, and the strange world of this quaint little town in the middle of nowhere is perfectly captured and lovingly presented. So what are the criticisms? I was fine with the morphing of black comedy, western, revenge, love story motifs and styles; but I struggled a little with the matching of Kate Winslet, who at nearly 40 is way too old to have been a contemporary of the characters played here by Snook, Hemsworth et al. Winslet is nearer the age of the actors playing the parents of her and her contemporaries - Alison Whyte and Rebecca Gibney. As gorgeous and brilliant in the role as she is, it does seem as if the film, which was possibly funded and built around Winslet, has forgotten about this age difference. At 25, Liam Hemsworth, and Sarah Snook at 27 simply don't look right in the context of the main characters return after 20 years. That said, i mostly ignored this, and just enjoyed this caper movie for what it is.In reading reviews of the movie from overseas, and seeing the vitriol targeting the movie's 'mish mash' and 'mess', I reflected on which other films or filmmakers 'The Dressmaker' was reminiscent of. Wes Anderson's 'Grand Budapest Hotel' sprung to mind as well as the work of Joel and Ethan Coen and Quentin Tarantino. All of these storytellers dabble in an array of genres, rendering them difficult to categorize, whilst still engendering praise and an audience. Anderson's recent multi Oscar win, had a glorious cast, a beautiful design, and a similarly caper like quality: at times just silly, but handsome to watch and enjoyable in the moment, and arty for sure, but hardly earth shattering or deep and meaningful. I hope that Australian critics and audiences alike get behind 'The Dressmaker' as it is a caper movie; I don't think it believes it is making a weighty, earnest Oscar bait movie, but a roller-coaster of a cinematic kind; funny, biting, gauche, heightened,tense and raucuous; and at the end of the day, very very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant movie. Kate Winslet as the star lives the role so perfectly you forget she is not a native born Australian - her accent is flawless, her acting is raw and beautiful. The movie is heart wrenching, darkly funny, shocking and confronting all in a delightful way. Judy Davis is brilliant - irascible as Mad Molly, you gradually discover her depth and beauty. Again flawlessly played. Hugo Weaving is fantastic as always - several laugh out loud moments with him. He is the consummate actor and where someone else playing this role would have just been a plain unlikeable weirdo, Hugo makes you love him and his quirky nature. Liam Hemsworth is sweet and very watchable. The townsfolk played by many notable Australian actors are well played also. All in all a wonderful movie that will touch your heart in many ways. Liked it so much, I will definitely go and see it again. It's THAT good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over the years there have been many quirky, eccentric characters featured in Australian films such as Muriel's Wedding, The Castle and Priscilla Queen of the Desert. The stories have been uniquely Australian to be appreciated by Australian audiences but occasionally they become worldwide hits like Crocodile Dundee. It's the laid-back Aussie humour that international audiences sometimes just don't understand which prevents the majority of Australian films from crossing the cultural barrier. The Dressmaker has been successful at the Australian box office for it features a story where the underdog or misunderstood succeeds along with a story that promotes the Aussie dry wit with dialogue that appeals to the everyday Australian.Myrtle 'Tilly' Dunnage (Kate Winslet) returns home to rural Australia after spending time abroad developing her fashion designing skills. As a child she was sent to a boarding school in Melbourne by Sergeant Farrat (Hugo Weaving) for she was accused of murdering a boy who bullied her. Her mother, Molly (Judy Davis) initially doesn't recognise her and isn't convinced she's her daughter. She eventually accepts her in her house and Tilly transforms it into a fashion factory where she makes clothes for the women of the town. In the meantime, she becomes romantically involved with Teddy McSwiney (Liam Hemsworth) whom she has known since they were children. The town still hasn't forgiven her for apparently killing the boy and believe she is cursed. Tilly will virtually stop at nothing to exact revenge on those who did her wrong. The Dressmaker is a long way from being perfect but what it does offer is an entertaining two hours that is well-paced and beguiling. There might be a few too many flashbacks and slow motion sequences but the compelling storyline featuring a wide range of interesting characters allows the majority of the film to shine. Some of the depictions of the characters might be broad but that's just the perfect fit for quintessential Australians. A lot of the dialogue is witty and adds much to the Aussie humour on show. Davis garners most of the laughs in a performance which demonstrates her sensational acting ability. Winslet perfects the Aussie accent with this being her second time playing an Australian after 1999's Holy Smoke! Many of the scenes she shares with her screen mother are hilarious. Weaving also has his turn in the spotlight with a wonderful performance as the cross-dressing police officer. Hemsworth plays it straight in comparison to his co-stars and reliably fulfills his role as the love interest. Support actors such as Shane Bourne, Sarah Snook, Kerry Fox and Barry Otto also succeed in projecting the individual traits of their characters.Credit must go to the costume designs with the haute couture style befitting of the movie title. With the story being reminiscent of a Clint Eastwood western where the main character comes to town, mingles with the locals then affects their lives one way or another, the music score by David Hirschfelder has some resemblance to a western. It's an exciting score that perfectly sets up the moods of the characters and the theme of the plot. The cinematography by Donald McAlpine also enhances the look of the film, ensuring that the rural town maintains its 'western' appearance.Although clichés do affect the characters and story, the overall quality of the film ensures that most viewers will be entertained. Jocelyn Moorhouse (the director and co-writer) should be chuffed with her film's box office success even though not all critics have praised her work. Sometimes it's the majority you have to please, not the minority. http://mlaimlai2.wix.com/magical-movie-review</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Australian Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Dressmaker' is not the type of film that instantly attracts me to the cinema. It's the wrong genre, (although this movie is difficult to place) the wrong story and it creates the wrong type of atmosphere. Leave this to the women and go and see something a little more.......you. How wrong I was and how glad I am to have jumped out of my comfort zone. It was a good excuse to take my good old mum and treat her to a midday-midweek viewing and some company with her first born or that is what I told myself when I entered the theatre only to find it filled with women and retirees excited to be out and about without the frightening hording masses that congregate on weekends.'The Dressmaker' has been dubbed as the long awaited return of Director Jocelyn Moorhouse to the chair since 1997 and she has delivered a film that will be remembered for some outstanding performances from Judy Davis, Hugo Weaving and Kate Winslet. I agree with the statement that this film doesn't fit into any particular mold but this peculiar inconsistency is what keeps the audience fixated on the screen. Just when you think that the story is heading down a certain path it quickly turns sideways, takes a detour before arriving at its intended destination. Some viewers may find this lack of direction annoying and even film destroying but I think this could be a little over dramatic.'The Dressmaker' holds a certain charm that never leaves it as it sways back and forth from one type of genre to the next. It can be billed as a 'black comedy' but it does allow the audience to experience an array of emotions. At times you will be laughing at the antics on screen and at other times you will be gripped by the drama unfolding.Based on the novel of the same name by Rosalie Ham, 'The Dressmaker' centres around Myrtle 'Tilly' Dunnage (Kate Winslet) and her chaotic return to a small Australian country town in rural Victoria in 1951. Tilly's tumultuous departure years before were under controversial circumstances and the small rural community have not forgotten. She is everything the town isn't - sophisticated, stylish, experienced and worldly and she has come back for one reason......to reek havoc on those that callously betrayed her all those years ago.Kate Winslet rarely puts in a bad showing and her turn as Tilly Dunnage is made even more exceptional with a flawless Australian accent. The audience will forget that she is English as she seamlessly slides into the fabric of her surroundings, not once slipping up when delivering her dialogue. Judy Davis is the star of the show as Tilly's mad mother, Molly Dunnage. Davis effortlessly steals every scene she is in with outstanding engagement with a character that is a little bit off centre. Judy will be recognised for this performance with an AACTA and it will be thoroughly deserved.Hugo Weaving adds his superb presence as the cross dressing cop, Sergeant Farrat. His character grows on the audience with eccentric colourful manner, bringing the best out in Weaving that gives this wonderful film an extra element of charm. Liam Hemsworth provides the eye candy for the ladies in a solid role as Teddy McSwiney. Both Davis and Winslet are caught hot under the collar on numerous occasions. He is the stereo-typical tall, blue-eyed, rugged country boy who is the proverbial apple in his mother's eye and does exactly what Moorhouse hired him to do......stand there and look pretty. Good onya Liam.Joining the familiar talent is a who's who of Australian television that many international audiences won't recognise but they do give the film a more authentic Aussie flavour. Could this be the breakout role for Sarah Snook? Her character Gertrude Pratt is totally transformed by Tilly Dunnage only to treat the outsider with disdain when 'theories' are whispered throughout the town.I cannot see any reason why this film won't be enjoyed by the masses. It is Australian and its dry wit may not appeal to foreign markets which is a shame. The narrative is all over the place but don't let this put you off. Dig a little deeper and you will be rewarded with some brilliant performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spell-binding Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Banished from a remote and sparsely populated Australian town when she was ten, Tilly (Kate Winslet) returns many years later. Fresh from conquering the fashion world in Paris, Tilly's form fitting red dress turns heads immediately. Some say Tilly committed a horrible crime and was cursed for it. Tilly has come in order to better learn the truth about what really happened and to set things right. There are many things on her mind including determining her own guilt in the matter, her mother Molly who appears to be mad, lifting the curse, finding love and revenge, among other things.Battle lines form. Many want Tilly to be guilty and cursed. They work to get her seen in the worst light. The haters may even include Tilly's mother Molly. Yet there are many who believe in Tilly. As she sets up a dress making shop and helps create new and better characters for people, her allies grow. The dresses she makes change how people see themselves and how others view them. It may not be Tilly who is cursed, rather it might be the town for the judgments that they heaped upon a girl.At the heart of this wonderful film is the theme of how a few awful people make life so bad for others by their terrible and swift judgments. The film is set in the 1950s and is both serious and funny. P.J. Hogan is one of the best screenwriters. His stories are complex and full of amazing twists &amp; turns. His insight into human nature, especially female characters, is spot-on. Added to the spell-binding writing is superb acting by Kate Winslet, Hugo Weaving and the others, the always intriguing back-drop of Australia, compelling themes and characters, and superb directing and organization. Of the 32 films I saw at the Toronto International Film Festival this year, this was the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Any ideas why this masterpiece was snubbed at the Oscars?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is hands down the best film in the English language I've seen for at least two years. Not only does it do its source absolute justice, it adds a genuine, highly original Oz visual atmosphere to its themes. The cast is nothing short of amazing, with every single character bringing the utmost of their craft to the roles. Judy Davis delivers one of the best performances of her illustrious career, but Kate Winslet, Kerry Fox and Sarah Snook are also fantastic. Liam Hemsworth isn't just hotter than Chris, he's also the far more nuanced thespian. Hugo Weaving, one of the best actors of his generation, sinks his teeth into his beefy part of an exceedingly well-mannered cop in the 1950's Oz outback.Winslet is the mysterious stranger arriving by night whom he delivers her luggage to in the beginning of the film. He quickly recognizes her as the girl he sent away following the death of a boy her age 25 years earlier. The townsfolk, including her quick-tempered mother played by Davis, alternate between suspicion of the motives of her return and attraction for her stunning dressmaking skills and resolute character.Some people will find the meandering story, which constantly shifts between mystery, comedy, tragedy and romance hard to follow. It's their own fault. Everyone else will highly appreciate the original story, the excellent camera work and set design, the abundance of love shown in every frame for a project that took 15 years to realize. Its domestic success as the 2nd most successful film of 2015 after you-know-which-one could not be more deserved.One can therefore only wonder why the Adacemy snubbed this for the Oscars, especially if you look at the usual suspects which represent the contenders this year. And as justified as the #OscarsSoWhite debate is, this omission also reminds us of another group of movie artists which are all too often absent from the list of nominees: Women. For what makes "The Dressmaker" so highly enjoyable on top of its original story, local feel and excellent cast, is that it offers a feminine angle of storytelling which we do not get to see enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little Aussie marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today I had the absolute pleasure of seeing a film I've been waiting about a decade for. 'The Dressmaker' is adapted from Rosalie Ham's bestselling Australian book which first came out in 2000, and I studied in high school about that long ago too. Ms Ham actually came and spoke at my school, and I can still remember her telling us that she was currently writing a screenplay of the book ? but that she wasn't sure if the American production company would want the movie to be set in Australia or adapted to the bible-belt/deep south of America.Well. It's the year 2015 and 'The Dressmaker' is here ? and it's spectacular and spectacularly Aussie. Indeed, I couldn't have pictured a film adaptation that took the Australia out of this country-Gothic dark comedy tale, and watching the film (shot around Victoria in Horsham, Little River and Yarraville) I got tingles when I saw the town of Dungatar on the screen ? bought so precisely to life. The lonely white gum trees and rocky-red dust bowl look, the rusted tin-roofs and sagging clapboard buildings. The distinctly Australian setting becomes a character unto itself, and a stark background to Tilly Dunnage's unfolding tale of style and secrets ?I absolutely loved the book when I studied it in school, and I'm thrilled to report that the film is equally fantastic and one of the best adaptations I've seen. Kate Winslet is Tilly who returns home to look after her ailing mother (and town outcast) "mad" Molly ? but she's also returned home to discover the truth of why she was sent away as a child. The town of Dungatar is sure that Tilly murdered a boy, and Tilly is half-convinced of the rumor too, and sure it's why she's now cursed. But she also knows that Dungatar never had any love for her and Molly growing up, and if she wants to get close to the truth she'll have to use everything in her arsenal to pry it out of them. Tilly's arsenal happens to be fashion. Haute-couture, to be more precise. Since running away from a Melbourne boarding school as a girl, she traveled from London to Milan and Paris, studying under the greats (Balenciaga!) and when she returns to Dungatar she's a veritable fashion powerhouse ? using her Singer sewing machine to create Dior-inspired and Tilly-originals to coax the vile women of Dungatar into a false sense of individuality and specialness ?The cast in this film is fantastic. Kate Winslet and Judy Davis clearly have a ball playing contentious mother/daughter pair Tilly and Molly, and there's a beautiful balance of the absurd and heartbreaking between them. Liam Hemsworth as one of the few kind Dungatar townspeople who pursues Tilly romantically, despite her dire warnings of a curse, is at his charming best here ? the role of Teddy McSwiney isn't much of a stretch for him, but it's lovely to see and hear a Hemsworth in a little Aussie role that suits him to a tee (and, look, at school my fellow classmates were dead-set on the likes of Beau Brady from 'Home and Away' playing Teddy so ? Liam's wonderful!).The film is choc-a-block with Aussie stars playing dastardly villains or defeated characters in the town of Dungatar ? Shane Jacobson, Barry Otto, Shane Bourne and Alison Whyte among them. Some of these minor roles clearly got a bit jumbled in the editing; there's a wayward flirtation between Rebecca Gibney and a shop-keep that just sort of goes nowhere ? but then there's Hugo Weaving as the kindly cross-dressing Sergeant Farrat, making up for mistakes in the past by befriending Tilly and coming to her and Molly's defense ? Weaving shines in the role and clearly had a ball.Another stand-out was Sarah Snook as Gertrude 'Trudy' Pratt, an old classmate of Tilly's who becomes one of her main clotheshorses. Snook is in everything at the moment (coming off 'The Secret River' adaptation, now in 'The Beautiful Lie') and she's just wonderful. In this film when the clothes are also characters as much as the setting, Snook is breathtaking in Tilly's Dior and Balenciaga. The film is set in the 1950s so it's vintage Dior and Balenciaga, darling ? everyone looks like a Lauren Bacall and Katharine Hepburn throwback, and it especially suits Snook with her luminous, luminous skin and enviable hourglass figure.Kate Winslet is truly superb ? of course she nails the accent, that's one of her great strengths (remember 1994's 'Heavenly Creatures'?) ? and she's absolutely stunning in all of the vintage couture. But she really does justice to Tilly, a complex and fragile character beneath all those breathtaking outfits like suits of armor.I t was great fun to see this story I've long loved come to life. Director Jocelyn Moorhouse has made a sumptuous film that frames the stark town of Dungatar as beautifully as she does the actresses swanning in the stunning gowns. The adaptation is one of the best I've ever seen, but then again Rosalie Ham had some great material on offer in her country-Gothic tale of ball gowns and small-town brutality. I couldn't believe how hard I cried in some parts, even as I vividly remembered having the wind knocked out of me when I first read the twists and turns in Ham's book all those years ago ? 'The Dressmaker' is a little Aussie marvel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Thoroughly Conflicting Night of Emotions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, that has to be the most conflicting movie experience I've ever known. I was invited to the premiere of The Dressmaker last night and I'm unsure whether I can say I loved it, hated it, thought it was hilarious, found it terribly sad, was frustrated because it was so weird or enjoyed it because some of the characters were so endearing - this movie caused all of these emotions and more. It's certainly entertaining - just so many roller-coaster sensations within the space of only a few minutes. A viewer will fluctuate continually between laughing raucously one minute only to find themselves experiencing deep sadness, anger, confusion or just plain asking yourself 'Why did they include this?' with the next breath. And they're a mix of the most quirky / weird / unlikeable / endearing / heartwarming characters I've ever seen / met. There was one character I didn't like at all, even though at some stages I still found myself laughing at some of their antics. I'm sure many readers will either disagree with me or think I'm referring to someone else - but that's okay, that's what makes us all different. The Dressmaker is definitely worth a look but not something I'd pay to see again - mainly because of the inclusion of that one character already referred to. This movie is very very dark in places and the ending is definitely not what you expect! The dialogue flurries and stubborn, though endearing, rapport constantly firing between Kate Winslet and Judy Davies are exceptional and certainly to be applauded. A very big hats off to Kate for a wonderful portrayal of an Aussie accent - you would swear she is a true blue Aussie. I have never heard anyone who wasn't born here to pull off an Aussie accent with such authenticity as she showed in this. Proves her calibre as an actress and the exceptional talent of Victoria Mielewska, her dialogue coach. Added to all of this, the budget must have been huge as every single person involved was easily recognisable from another movie or TV series - and most of them big Aussie names. So don't bother asking me whether you should go and see it - you'll just have to go along and see for yourself - but I can almost guarantee it's definitely not at all what you'll be expecting. And interestingly, other ladies in two book clubs I am connected to said they felt exactly the same with both the book and the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing for the first 90 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kate Winslet and Judy Davis steal the whole movie. Liam Hemsworth is very nice on the eye. Everyone else is a caricature.The movie was surprisingly humorous for the first 90 minutes. Not all the one liners are in the trailer after all. But then the plot takes a dark turn and really loses its way. The book probably took its time to get all the characters to the end, but the last part of the movie feels rushed and really rather silly, in a slapstick kind of way. First the townsfolk hate Tilly then they love her, then they hate her, then they're back pleading with her to make costumes to save the town's pride ... Honestly, I felt like I was getting whiplash trying to keep up with it.The other distracting aspect is that Kate Winslet is looking her age and while she's still fabulous, Liam Hemsworth is 15 years younger than she is in real life, and it's just not remotely believable that they were children of a similar age growing up together. Winslet was probably wearing her first makeup and heels, the day Hemsworth was born.On the plus side, Winslet gives a flawless performance, including the Aussie accent, which is notoriously difficult to pull off convincingly. Meryl Strep's dreadful attempt at an Aussie accent in Evil Angels just proved how hard it is to do. All credit to Winslet. And it was fabulous seeing Judy Davis on the screen again. The fight between the two of them before the bath scene was hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS FILM IS INTENDED TO SHRED APART YOUR PRECONCEPTIONS!!! Do not go into watching this film with the idea that you are watching a tragedy. You may not connect with the majority of the characters. They may not feel entirely three dimensional. You may not empathise with them and you are not intended to. It is extraordinarily true that you do not get what you expected from the trailer of this film. However, what you will get will most definitely blow your mind whether you appreciate the artistry of such postmodern blurring of genres or not. It is important to note that many of the critics (but by all means all) whom have given bad reviews to this film, do not entirely understand the essence of genre itself. Whilst the Aristotelian theory of genre concludes that genre is a fixed ridged entity, whereby texts must possess specific content, form or features in order to belong to a selected genre, modern theorists understand that genre cannot be a fixed entity as these conventions are too narrow to classify all texts under. Genre is an extremely dynamic concept and changes or evolves along with it's context. Therefore, genre now - as a taxonomy of works - classifies texts according to their intended purpose, recurring priori actions as well as it's relationship with it's audience. Whilst The Dressmaker may initially present itself as a western film or even a Gothic film, this does not mean that the film is in that genre! The Dressmaker is a COMEDY. Indeed it possesses many MODES of other genres, however, the film intends to SATIRISE the attitudes modeled by many in 1950's Australia. And this - my dear friends ... and foe - is EXTREMELY CLEVERLY DONE!!!!! I have read many reviews of this film whereby the responder has said something along the lines of "this film doesn't even know what it is" or "The mix of genres is a mess" oblivious to the fact that this is the intended purpose of the film. The film combines elements of many genres and sub-genres including Gothic, western, thriller, crime, horror, tragedy, comedy, farce, satire, slapstick and black humour just to pinpoint a few. As a satire, the film uses absurd humour to highlight major issues within this 1950's society. Issues such as abuse of power, rape, deceit, sexuality, misogyny and hypocritical attitudes. The post-war 1950's is ostensibly known as a fruitful decade however Jocelyn offers a far more ignominious perspective on a time that was tainted with misogyny and hypocrisy, and the extend those guilty of such behaviours would go to in oder to save face. The essence of satire is to make you laugh as an audience and then make you question what you are laughing at! Whilst many have thought that this could only be the work of an uneducated lunatic, this mixture of generic modes is a quintessential example of the blurring lines between genres and adds an element of shock to narrative. The technique is intended to add an distinct absurdism to the storyline, and the deficiencies of the gross caricatures that are the townsfolk are distorted in order to draw attention to the cultural or social issues within society that are still contextually relevant today! Yes, the film exposes relics or icons that were not relevant to it's contextual time-frame, however these are intentional! They are supposed to make you question why the director has included them! Like how these issues are still relevant today on some level. Remember that everything placed in a film is intended to depict SOMETHING. I am an 18 year old year 12 student currently studying the notion of Genre in Extension 1 English, and this movie literally blew me away! It is just so so so so clever! Like the way it includes familiar or traditional narratives such as the revenge plot of a western film or ugly duck makeover of Gertrude Pratt, to then take those familiar narratives in an ENTIRELY different direction, so that just when you believe you know what to expect, you are presented with something completely different. Or the way the characters names perfectly reflect their personalities. Mayor "PETTYman" etc. What is even more interesting to me is the set design, looking like an imposed western saloon set on an Australian outback scene. This almost gives the impression that we are witnessing some kind of bizarre human experiment. This is intended to distance the audience from the characters. None is quiet life-like enough to be relatable, except for Tilly and Molly Dunnage and perhaps Teddy. However, whilst tragedy is intended to make the audience empathise with multiple characters, comedy does not require this. Therefore the audience is supposed to feel obscured from many of the caricatures in the film, and they are not supposed to be realistic or relatable, rather they represent an ideology, attitude or perspective. It is this distance between the audience and the characters that allows the audience to make their own distinctions about the insane situations that occur within the film. I could ramble endlessly about this film and it's effect on me, however instead I will just give a word of warning: When watching this film be aware of it's social and cultural context. Be aware of that which it is drawing your attention to, not only within the film but in the wider world. Be aware that the acting is exquisite that each character is intended to elicit a response from you. but most of all...be prepared. Be prepared to laugh, to question, to cry, to scoff and to be utterly shocked or even horrified. This film is an utterly beautiful piece of genius. Enjoy it thoroughly....or don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where do I even start? (MAJOR SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film started my early impressions of it were good; we have Kate Winslet arriving back in Australia very much playing against type as a 'bad-ass' women seeking revenge. Upon hearing her mutter the line 'I have a score to settle here' I thought Yes this is going to be a really good revenge film. I really couldn't have been more wrong....Tonally &amp; narratively The Dressmaker is a complete mess and it seemed obvious after about the first 20-30 minutes that the filmmakers seemed to be unsure how to actually play this film; from the outset it seems to be about Kate Winslet exacting revenge against those that have wronged her as a child - however this aspect is then ignored for large portions of the film and then starts to become a melodrama focusing on the fraught &amp; rather strained relationship between mother and daughter. I realise that a lot of narratives will focus on different themes during their running time, but in The Dressmaker a lot of the time it's feels like you're watching a sketch-show i.e a series of unrelated incidents strung together with very little connecting these scenes together. This is OK in sketch-shows because that's the point of them, but in a film there needs to be some kind of logical flow and some sort of cohesion to connect everything together, but there is little evidence of that here. As well as purportedly being about revenge and self-discovery the film also throws in other random nonsense such as a wedding which had nothing to do with the story, one character who is a police sergeant who likes to dress up in women's clothing (which isn't particularly funny in the first place). The film also flits backwards and forwards covering the same ground which makes it also feel very repetitive - this isn't helped by the fact that the film flits backwards and forwards a lot whilst doing little to actually move anything forward!!!. The romance between Kate Winslet and Liam Hemsworth was nauseating and totally unconvincing - there was just no chemistry there at all and every time I saw the pair of them on screen together they made me cringe... Another issue with this film is that the people and the scenarios never feel believable. I mean the last time I saw that many crazy people together was when I watched One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. There are some funny moments, but sometimes the filmmakers just go overboard and mostly create scenarios that seem more surreal than real. This set-up is amusing at first, but just gets more tiresome and less and less believable the further things progress....There were other things I didn't understand such as how come Myrtle/Tilly and her mother couldn't remember that she'd allegedly killed someone? And how come later they were able to recall the event? It's never confirmed that they've suffered amnesia or such like and we're not given any explanation for their lapses in memory or them suddenly regaining their memories.Although it generally seems like it's pointless the film does eventually start to make its point (about 2/3 of the way into the film). It throws in various twists such as the boy killing himself as opposed to Myrtle/Tilly killing him. The deceased boy being her brother and the dead boy's father also being her father. Despite the fact that it seemed to be trying to create a 'thought-provoking' ending about moral decency it undoes itself when we learn that Myrtle/Tilly's father sent her away to get back at her mum which in turn causes Tilly to exact her revenge on all of the locals??? Even with some of the clever twists it's still a very weak film with a rather unrewarding pay-off.Thankfully, some of the performances in this film are excellent and really help to raise this film from the doldrums; Judy Davis is brilliant as Kate Winslet's mother and rising star Sarah Snook was also very good. Hugo Weaving is normally a reliable actor but he was uncharacteristically poor here (but then look at what he had to work with). Hemsworth smiles a lot and takes off his shirt but contributes little else. Kate Winslet puts in an above average performance but she wasn't the star of the show as far as I was concerned.The Dressmaker is roundly a poor film but it does benefit from some very good performances and Judy Davis is responsible for a lot of the comedy moments which does make the film tolerable on odd occasions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird and wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tiny Australian town of Dungatar, which appears to be constructed out of corrugated iron and dust, is home to a small population of mainly picturesque eccentrics and poisonous women. Dressmaker Tilly (Kate Winslet) returns to Dungatar after being driven away when she was 10 for murdering a classmate. Her remarkable dressmaking skills earn her some brownie points, but the old wounds are far from healed.This extremely odd film defies classification. It is often very funny, sometimes mystifying, always intriguing, sometimes tragic, and boasts some terrific performances and some sights you never expected to see, most of them involving Hugo Weaving. And the story keeps you constantly interested and keen to find out what happens next. Liam Hemsworth does some shirtless stuff, if that floats your boat (and it floats a couple of boats in the film). Judy Davies, an actress I have never liked, made me cry. The dresses made by Winslet's character (and her competitor) are visually impressive and sometimes hilarious. The people who populate Dungatar are not believable for an instant, but they work wonderfully well as characters.This is a truly weird film, but I really liked it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie isn't sure what it wants to be. A straight out comedy, a drama or a black comedy. For me it misses out on being a straight comedy or a drama - and just about fits into the black comedy genre.I will say that the basic premise of the story is pretty good - fairly original. You can pick holes in the story like moths on a blanket - too many to mention.In some ways, it reminds me of Waking Ned Devine - a small town full of bizarre characters (set in Australia). I don't feel able to recommend you go the a movie theater to see it, but it is worth a watch on Netflix or Red Box. I didn't dislike it, but I wanted to like it more.I feel that the movie would be better in the hands of a more experienced Director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dressmaker is one of the most utterly bizarre films I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What on Earth did I just watch?The Dressmaker absolutely cannot settle on a genre. When Tilly (Kate Winslett) first arrives in town, it has the taste of a Western. There's also a mystery element added regarding an incident in Tilly's past. There's a romance in there, the abundance of costumes make it feel like a period piece, a few scenes feel like a horror. Ultimately, most of the film fits firmly into the category of comedy or soap opera. Many scenes in The Dressmaker is competently made, but when they are strung together, they so horrendously clash in contrast that the whole film becomes an exercise in incredulity. Moments after a tearful scene over a main character's body, we're laughing out loud at slapstick.The acting is the film's saving grace. Kate Winslett does absolutely everything the horrendous screenplay asks of her. Her mastery of the Australian accent is impressive and she is classy, funny, dramatic and utterly gorgeous. Judy Davis is very funny in all of her scenes. Sarah Snook cements herself as an exceptional Australian talent, portraying both the ugly duckling and the upper class socialite she becomes later. A look of haughty superiority is so genuine you will scrunch up your nose at her. Hugo Weaving rips his character right out of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, but is so much fun about it that you'll forgive him for his occasional overacting. Gyton Grantley and Liam Hemsworth round out the cast and do solid jobs, even if Hemsworth still isn't what I'd call a major talent. The gowns and dresses created for the film are breathtaking and the cinematography is also splendid. The writing is utterly atrocious, again due to the banal mixing of genres. The mystery is exciting to see unravelled but is ultimately based off a character doing something so stupid and inexplicable that it defies belief. Whenever Tilly's "curse" is mentioned I cringe. Winslett's bizarre memory loss exists only to support the mystery. Elements about Molly not remembering Tilly contributed nothing to the film. Late in the film Hemsworth and Winslett share sappy romantic dialogue and Hemsworth is forced to drop the awful line "It can't be Superman. He's right here." Its a credit to him and Winslett that they were able to get through even a single take of the film.The Dressmaker is one of the most utterly bizarre films I've ever seen. It's simultaneously one of the greatest and worst movies I've ever seen. That's the same category as Tommy Wiseau's The Room. Not great company.</fullReview>

Yes it had the RomCom moments, but it had a very deep dark underlying river of a very good story. The ever Stunning Kate Winslet was top of her game in this film. She was stunning, beautiful, witty, charming, and just plain Bad ass. She worked it like no ones business. Her character was coming back for not only revenge but for peace in her own skin. Perfectly casted and perfectly executed. Liam Helmsworth....just plain delicious. Best of all was the ever FAB-U-LOUS Hugo Weaving back in the skirt again. He is just perfect in this film. With a taste of Priscilla Queen of the Desert it just doesn't get any better than Hugo. I see how this movie received standing ovations at film awards. It's worthy of it and more.

		<shortDescription>A Movie with Surprising Healing Power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before deciding to write a review for The Dressmaker, I read a scathing review of the movie that called it a choppy dark comedy that was all over the place. I agree the movie is "all over the place", but it is for a very good reason. "The Dressmaker" is about facing one's past, and the Pandora's box of secrets and emotions that usually opens. It can also trigger new events, some great and some bad. It's how well one navigates through all of that determines how much said person heals when all of the dust settles, so that they can move on to their next chapter in life as whole a person as possible. And Winslet's character navigates well. I felt a surprising sense of healing after watching this movie. This movie gave me happy tears, and has helped me decide to finally go back and face my past. The movie is full of charm, wit, and obviously, style. My only gripe is the lack of Australian accents in the movie. I forgave Winslet's character not having one, as her back story explained why not. But there was no excuse for the other main characters. The only memorable Aussie accent in the movie is Chris Hemsworth's, who was born there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a disappointing film in virtually all respects. Strained acting, combined with a ridiculously unbelievable plot which was heavily overacted throughout. Don't get sucked in by flowery reviews if you are looking for an enjoyable, meaningful experience. This film lacks substance, struggles to be funny, and isn't consistent with the time frame that its set in. Rather it awkwardly tries to meld modern themes into a time and place where they don't belong and likely didn't exist! I'm 60 and grew up in Victoria so I have a pretty good idea. I Strongly recommend you look elsewhere for some worthwhile viewing. Maybe the late night movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the best-selling novel by Rosalie Ham, this comedy-drama is set in early 1950's Australia. It's a vibrant tale of revenge, mother- daughter bonds, small-town secrets and the great power of clothes, in a movie that is both bittersweet and funny and is dominated by a stunning, multi-layered performance from Kate Winslet. Jocelyn Moorhouse's latest feature is enjoyable enough and so unexpected, and let's be honest she also has a great team to help her achieve that. In few words, "The Dressmaker" is a dark comedy in Australian style, that will catch many by surprise, especially if you love clothes and fashion in general. nikisreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-the-top to the point of silliness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to call this movie a success although it starts off well. Basically it's overdone in most respects, can't settle on a mood or theme, and is bedevilled by hammy actors who clearly think this is their big chance to make an impact. Their parts should have been red-pencilled out or clipped onto the cutting-room floor. Kate Winslet acts her way smoothly through this as though she wasn't surrounded by a lot of substandard stuff going on. She is really getting a bit old for roles like this, however. Hugo Weaving shows his experience by taking a low-key approach to his otherwise potentially hammy role. Liam Hemsworth ("the Torso") looks relaxed and mildly amused by what he finds himself in. I don't care for Judy Davis in this, as the character clearly invites her to ham it up and she does. As it's some time since I read the book, I can't say what the true mood of the story should be, but I'm sure a more restrained and consistent treatment of it would make it appear more adult and less childish. Just about everything in the film could have been improved by more subtlety and a surer touch. As it is the story and the minor characters become more and more bizarre and as a result I'd almost completely lost interest by the end credits. I can't believe it's only 118 minutes, as it seemed at least 45 minutes too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing original in this film.Nothing.It is a real pity because the first half is interesting, characters well acted and effectively introduced.1st half is a series of gags imported and rearranged from Emir Kusturica movies. It works considering the good actors involved. Even though not very original.Then the story falls horribly flat. Not enough material probably. Too short for a comedy? OK, then let's have some useless and pointless accidents turn it into a messy tragedy. Gut feelings, too much hate. Much easier digging in negative emotions than writing a good story. That's where Malena by Tornatore kicks in.This is basically all about it.1st half Kusturica comedy rip off. Funny, effective, but not very original.2nd half pointlessly tragic bad copy of Malena by Tornatore.All connected via a silly, pointless, useless accident.The end.Better have a full story next time.Sorry, this may impress people who aren't aware of the aforementioned directors.

		<shortDescription>Having To Seek Revenge Itself Is A Curse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it to be cursed? To be born in unfortunate circumstances, growing up in an abusive environment, failing to trust anyone in life. All these recipes of a cursed life are there in this movie. In this story you'll find the crooked, the manipulative and the kind - all living together in a town that is so God forsaken and utterly unimportant that no one cares if its literally named 'Dungatar'. As life progresses slowly in such places, bigotry is often a part and parcel. Social elite with all the power and connections go unpunished while they exploit the common folk for their weakness. Sounds pretty universal. Also, the women are particularly made to suffer more than the men. It is a hopeless situation but sometimes they exact revenge. Kate Winslet depicts it so elegantly as she returns to her childhood tormentors. Her travails have transformed her into the proverbial "vamp". She is armed with her looks, her thirst for revenge and... a skill that makes her the perfect femme fatale. The Dressmaker is more than a typical revenge story. It is a good revenge story! When tortured people use their pain for creativity, the result is mesmerizing. Their craft becomes their most powerful weapon. They don't need to use guns or physical violence to prove a point. That's the brightest part about this dark comedy. It gives hope to the viewer that some sacrifices are worth making. Although, revenge is an emotion that burns both the wrongdoer and the wronged, forgiveness is just not an option sometimes. Neither is running away. Not at least in fiction. Bad people will do bad things and even with all your efforts to set things right you can't escape it. This movie brings in a tragedy just in time to remind the viewer of that fact. Social behavior of humans is driven by deception. The Dressmaker points to the hypocrisy and manufactured perceptions that decide the social status of people. Insecure folks move in packs. They denigrate and ridicule others behind their backs. The guilty ones hide behind misinformation as they fuel rumors to avoid being pointed out. Individuals who don't manipulate are pushed down. Efforts to overcome such curses leads to unexpected casualties. Unfortunate, but educational. On a side note, this movie vaguely reminds of Edward Scissorhands especially with the location of the protagonist's house on top of a hill and the way the townspeople go about doing their day-to-day politics.The Dressmaker is a very women centric drama that never once tries to shove feminism down the throat. Men are both good and bad just like women are both enlightened and ignorant. There are selfish and there are martyrs. The worst are those who justify their wrongs through their bigoted worldview. Even if you manage to burn down the whole place for revenge... it is only bittersweet at best. Watch this movie for the performances of Kate Winslet, Hugo Weaving and Judy Davis. If you've watched Predestination then Sarah Snook's short role will further impress you.</fullReview>

The role she has to play has a past that she has to wrestle with. A past that is well hidden from the viewer and something that will be revealed in time.It's nicely told (and hopefully the major plot point is not revealed in the trailer, which I obviously haven't seen) and has a really good pace for a drama/thriller to it. Add a bit of romance to the mix and you get a really fine end product. Acting is generally very good (Hugo Weaving is another major standout, though it's really tough to pick favorites, they are all having a blast and it translates to screen) as is direction and design. Especially the clothing is phenomenal too. A really good dark and sinister little movie, that knows how to shock</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Dressmaker is a dark comedy drama and undeniably a sinfully guilty pleasure. Girls swirl and tumble in gorgeous gowns around a dry, Australian landscape, and the guys slick around town like sheriffs in a Western ? unless you're Liam Hemsworth, in which case you also take your shirt off and smile gorgeously. Kate Winslet very rarely disappoints, and in this film Tilly's character suits her perfectly. She gives a sexy, capable, tortured portrayal of a betrayed woman bent on revenge, and does it brilliantly. Judy Davis is delightful comic relief, and her one-liners are spot- on. Her chemistry with Winslet is also strong, and the film benefits well from two excellent actresses who effortlessly carry it. Liam Hemsworth is admittedly eye-candy ? probably for fans of The Hunger Games ? but his performance is still good and solid; his acting skills are not exactly what I would call brilliant, but he fits his character well and gives what's expected of him. The story is slightly muddled ? and the conflict rather weak ? but the cinematography is brilliant and visually the movie is gorgeous. Beautiful, brightly coloured dresses light up the rustic Australian town, and the cinematography captures the mood perfectly. It's an artistic, emotional, unique story with Winslet strutting in gorgeous dresses and giving a stellar performance. A good film ? although the actual story has many flaws ? and carried by brilliant cinematography, awesome visuals, and good acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, heart-warming movie of love, drama and fashion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is great in general, with many spectacular scenes. The existence of accusation, murder, revenge, drama and of course, romance makes the movie worth watching. The best scene of the movie, I say, is when Tilly run away from the wedding, Teddy run after her and take her back to the place where the boy killed himself twenty years ago. The moment when Teddy help Tilly face her utmost tragedy. How it happened, what really happened, she remembers it now, she now faces it, that moment is gold. The scene when Teddy and Tilly on the bed together, talking about their future plan, about running away together, starting a new life, even bringing Tilly's Mother and Teddy's brother with them and away from the town. I feels like there are more than that and that happy ending is just not gonna work for the characters and the audiences. Teddy and Molly, they belong to the town. They are town people. But Tilly, she is a big woman, with a gifted talent; she can do much more than cleaning house, taking care of babies and family and making dress for local people. It's such a waste of her talent to spend the rest of her life in that town. The world needs her, she belong to fashion, like Paris and Milan. She is THE DRESSMAKER. So definitely, the idea of Tilly and Teddy running together for a happy ending just doesn't work for both of them. That's maybe a good idea for Tilly but not for Teddy. He's gonna be miserable and their love is just not gonna last. So right at that moment, I doubt the movie is gonna end with that ending. But I knew that Tilly, she's not gonna bury her feet in that town. She will definitely leave it when she finishes her business. However, I can't help but think about her loved ones, her mother and her childhood friend/lover Teddy. What's gonna happen to them when she decides to leave? The town seems to be small, so small that nothing really happen there in the past twenty years. Everything in the past is kept and told from generation to generation like folklores. Even people, they don't change at all. And that is the hardest thing, but as soon as you realize that truth, you feel more released inside. You can't change people, and your family and friends are the only ones you should spend most of your time with. Other people, they either don't know you or don't know you well enough to make your life miserable. Revenge, I say, is drama and I love to see drama on films. There must be more than just coming back home, visiting mom and neighborhood and then saying bye. Somebody is gonna pay for what they did. And yes, it happens like a chain of falling domino. And those parts of drama are the best in this movie, beside sweet romance and humors. It's funny, it's not too much romance, just enough to make you feel like falling in love, and drama of course. Most importantly, the movie makes me to think about myself, about life and my decisions. How the movie ends is just brilliant. At first I just feel terribly sad for good people who die, but then, I finally see it. It is the best option for Teddy, for Molly and for Tilly. Those people, they deserve more than that town. The ending for those characters are just logical and sympathetic. I have to say, movies like this get me in the heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Dressmaker brings to screen a successful Australian novel by Rosalie Ham who sets her 1950s story in a small dessert town in the middle of the big Nowhere which is the Australian wilderness. It's one of these 'out-of-the-track' films which generates extreme opinions and wins lovers and haters, because one needs to like films with weird characters and situations, accept a story that departs from the usual right vs. evil conditions, and stop considering real life credibility as a principal criteria to evaluate a movie.Apparently this is a story of home coming, of lost memory and revenge, with Mirtle 'Tilly' Dunnage coming home to imaginary Dungatar Many years after she was sent away ostracized for allegedly killing another kid at the age of 10. The ugly crying kid has turned into a beautiful and elegant woman (Kate Winslet) who not only attracts the stares of the male population and envy of the feminine one, but will also change their lives in many ways. She does not remember a thing about the crime that she is accused of having committed in childhood and will try to bring back the memories and put her life back on track.Director Jocelyn Moorhouse at her 5th film made after 18 years of interruption in her career chose a mix of styles and genres. Some of the ('professional') critics that I have read blame her for not picking and sticking to one well-known pattern. Is this film a comedy, a romantic story, a feminist drama, a revenge saga, a bloody action movie? I would say that the quality of the film resides in the fact that it is all of these combined and more.Then we have the fashion story. Tilly has become a dressmaker in Europe and will use her skills to change the appearances and the lives of the women in the village. The classic Greek saying 'The man is his clothes' better known in English by 'clothes make the man' (Shakespeare used it among other) was never better served. I found the idea charming, it also remembered me the story of a lesser known Israeli film 'Turn Left at the End of the World' in which it is cricket that changes the lives of the inhabitants of a desert town.The movie is enjoyable because of a few splendid acting parts. I especially enjoyed Judy Davis as the apparently demented mother of Tilly, and sparkling Hugo Weaving as the man of the law who secretly loves wearing dresses and ribbons. Kate Winslet is strong and expressive, but the miscasting of her handsome peer Liam Hemsworth was very evident. She seems to be a bit too old for her role, he seems to be a little bit too young for the role. But again, maybe even this miscasting is intentional, and the director gave us one more warning to take the story and the world she created in a non-realistic manner. Her world in its splendid isolation, with its characters that are rather archetypes that real life characters mostly in the comic registry reminded me another lesser know film - the Romanian 'Somewhere in Palilula'. Tragic death and violence will make their appearance, but terror is inflicted mainly by shooting golf balls, and eventually all falls into farce. Did I mention Tarantino?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I really liked how the story blinked to clichés than said "No, thanks. I don't buy that." Poison of the society is something we struggle all the time and sometimes it becomes its the most destructive form. So, as a criticism of that, I liked the story's main idea... "Small people's small problems bother those who can think of another." I must mention Kate Winslet's performance was at a high level. She is truly an artist as an actress. (I hate sexist word seperations like actor/actress...What a lovely society!) Also her chemistry with his mother and the act was fascinating. But there were somethings missing. Visuals and places were well constructed but I have concerns about how the story from the book is adapted. The dark turn, which was out of cliché and well prepared, was rushed. I would expect all the characters to express their emotions, what they feel, what they think...There could be more scenes like a characters sits, express it with body language. But instead, to show characters' feelings the scenes were constructed like, "something happens, another thing happens and another happens..." I mean there should be scenes to process the story. The last 30 mins I was a little off the movie. Also, it was interesting to see the society's hypocritical choices about Myrtle's dresses. It was symbolic and a nice touch. And at the end, Myrtle burns the red fabric to burn down the whole town, which was also beautiful to express her feelings and to end the story. I should also mention the musical score. It was beautiful but in some scenes, it was not a font music, which was distractive. All in all, from the beginning to the ending, the story was the most important element and I wish we could see all the other elements of a movie werewell constructed in this movie. My heart is broken how the societycould be messed up by the people who cannot see themselves as an individual; sees some one shaped and designed by the community they live in.

		<shortDescription>Classic Australian Cinema at its Best - but it shows you how awful and just wrong many Critics are.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Dressmaker is one of the best Australian movies since the golden age of Australian film making in the 80s and 90s. (The Thornbirds, Muriel's Wedding, Pricilla etc). But I don't understand the snubbing at the Ocars and the bad reviews from most of the critics some of the whom were downright insulting like @trim_obey a the Telegraph, "the films biggest blunder...is mistaking Kate Winslet for Rita Hayworth". (She wasn't cast as Rita Hayworth!) He goes on to say although Winslet managed to achieve the "modest feat of managing a soft Aussie accent" (that is not a modest feat; not even Meryl Streep could master it!) And just plain snide and idiotic "the costumes are flat-out ghastly!" errr, really?? Was Rita Hayworth's black satin dress in Gilda, one of the most famous in Hollywood history (to which you erstwhile incorrectly assumed Kate was actually playing Rita), ghastly?? Or did you mean Winslet couldn't fit in into the dress as well as Rita? To which she damn well did and was absolutely stunning (even though BOTH actresses just gave birth months prior to filming). And your review was full of errors: "The local lads were playing Rugby" (it was Australian rules or back then a local Victorian Football League final). If you're going to write a review and publish it in a quality paper such as The Telegraph, then at least watch the film without littering it with your own obvious prejudices, misogyny, snobbery and veiled homophobia. And check your facts mate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Dressmaker offers many fabulous performances, some great Haute Couture and much more- Bitchiness of people of village. It is an overall memorable screen experience, not to mention the eye pleasing costumes and a hazy plot that is not difficult to the mind but truly dull. The story does lack substance but that is covered by good dialogues and greater screenplay. It is weekend lightening movie when you wish to sit back and relax. It is worth a watch but don't go deep into the vengeance feelings of Kate.Though Liam Hemsworth's body is surely remarkable when compared to a 1950s Australian village chap, I can surely recommend you a happy 2 hrs to pass the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The trailer is misleading but the movie is worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This trailer is a PERFECT example, of how misleading these things can be. What you see, is a romantic love story with comedic elements. A rom-com if you will. The Dressmaker is SO MUCH MORE than just that. As a matter of fact, it's nothing of the sort! This movie is more a dark comedy with romance and heavy drama thrown in. The acting by everyone involved is really spot on, with Liam Hemsworth surprising me the most. His portrayal of Teddy, made him seem much more mature/older than he usually is in movies, which in this case is very good thing. Kate Winslet hits all the right emotional notes as Tilly, a woman searching for answers about her past, but also fearful of her future, believing she isn't deserving of happiness. My only complaint would be the tone of this movie VASTLY shifts, from Act 2 to 3. Something major happens and without spoiling anything, it's so jarring that it made it hard for me to enjoy the rest of the story. It's not that it's bad story telling, it just caught me off guard and made me wish thing could've turned out different. I won't go into to much detail (all the non-readers out there will get bored), other than to praise the Directing, Writing and Visual beauty of The Dressmaker. A movie very much worth watching</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an international fan, I greatly enjoyed the movie and its story. It perfectly fits into black comedy with great acts. Casting Kate is great idea. First of all The scenery, colors, all cinematographic elements are displayed with beauty. Classic yet so amazing. Haute Couture pleases your eyes and I admire Kate for learning sewing for the movie. As a woman audience , Dressing as you want to be is a bliss. The story contains many elements such as love, revenge, bullies, isolation, prejudice, social pressure. The movie makes you feel the way it goes. Even though It is classified as comedy, There is so many heart-breaking moments and got you emotional. When the Teddy died, I heard loud cries from everyone saying ''Why''. It was bizarre but still couldn't help stopping my tears. Flashbacks also serve as deep points in the story. From bullying parts to little town's witch hunt The movie gives you more than just a few laughters. Sergeant's discovery process also adds some good spices. His love for details amazed me. The love story itself is so heart- fluttering. It also made me question why Academy pass this by. It could have a few nominations. So pity that It is ignored. At least It gets what deserved from local industry.</fullReview>

Same film rehashed, subtle plot changes, but yes, that's all this rehash is. It's perfectly well executed, and an enjoyable film, but I cannot believe that people are not drawing this comparison. There is the the talented dressmaker(hairdresser) ostracised by the local community of gossips and 1950s dressed women. Considered dangerous or even murderous, living in the strange house at the top of the hill. Okay they add some subplots but seriously, guys, 0/10 for originality. Even the quirky characterisations and over exaggerated characters are on a parallel. If they had Tim burton directing this you'd think you were watching the same film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What did I just watch?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with The Dressmaker is that it doesn't quite know what it wants to be. Feel-good Australian comedy? 1950s timepiece? Murder-mystery? TV-movie? Or a quirky revenge fable? It's inability to find a consistent theme and momentum is partly what leaves a funny taste in your mouth after viewing.How did the makers of this somehow lure the talents of Kate Winslet to the project? The cast is highly remarkable, filled with some of the most talented actors in Australia and abroad. It's just a shame their talents are largely lost in this screenplay.It features one of the most awkward movie-deaths of all-time. I hadn't read the book, so found it largely unexpected. I was struggling to develop a connection with the romantic element of The Dressmaker and just as I was beginning to, the bloke jumps down a hole and dies.After that and other story developments, I was half-expecting Kate's character to go fully-rogue. After pleading her innocence for most of the film, I was waiting for her to take to the town with a shotgun. Burning it to the ground was almost anti-climatic.This movie jumps around in time and tone so often, that I couldn't help but relating to the mental state of "Mad Molly" by the end of it. Unfortunately, a highly promising Australian movie once again falls flat at a time Australian productions are struggling for a consistent standard in quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible and ridiculous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm absolutely shocked that this film has received such a high rating on IMDb. I think it's one of the worst films that Kate Winslet has ever done.The characters are not deep enough, the story is not believable and the sense of humour, or attempt to have some humour in it was pathetic and boring to say the least. Kate Winslet is not convincing at all, she seems to be in revenge mood but it's like she doesn't mean it. Not even the relationship with her mother makes you feel any type of emotion for them. Basically the film doesn't move you at all.Her relationship with the character who plays Liam Hemsworth is also dull and meaningless. Again not great love story here, just plain boring and I won't go into any details but it's almost laughable the way this relationship evolves. Then from then on you have nonsensical dramas all over, that never seem to end and make no sense at all. The police officer for example is OK but they try to make him funny but it just doesn't work. They're not funny. Predictable plot. Quite frankly I wanted to leave the cinema I just stayed because I paid a lot of money so I was wondering if it would pick up. But a total waste of time. The only positive side of this film are the dresses but apart from that, choose another film if you really want to enjoy a day at the cinema. You won't be missing anything if you don't watch it. And for Kate Winslet's standards her performance here is well below par.Silly plot and not what I expected at all. Totally forgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A stylish Aussie revenge-comedy that is adapted from a novel of the same name. Just superbly built screenplay on a tragedy that occurred some time back, but the movie reveals it only in the third act. About a woman who arrives in a small town where she was born and slowly gains popularity among the young women who seeks her stunning costumes to impress their counterparts. The town divides over her return, but why all the hate is the mystery that the movie going to solve for us in its entire narration.The location and the settings were fantastic and it brought a western feel because of the Australians hot and humid weather. Kate Winslate was very good, her role simply reminded me Juliette Binoche from 'Chocolat'. I have heard people saying it was emotional, but I did not find it like that. Instead, I had fun watching it, not like I had the open laughs, but felt joy and satisfaction for the time I spent for it. My initial thought was it could be overrated, but after watching it proved I was wrong. This is one of the best Aussie movie I have seen in the recent years.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot put into words how much I loved this movie. You will be surprised. I'm so glad I saw this movie. For non- Australians some of the humor will fly over their heads so I don't know how it will go overseas. The cast is fantastic, special mention to Judy Davis and Hugo Weaving who took their characters to town. Music from Australian composer David Hirschfelder (Shine &amp; The Water Diviner) again outstanding! Cinematography from Don McAlpine was breathtaking, just gorgeous. Costume designs by Marion Boyce, the lady that dresses Miss Fisher Murder Mysteries has all the ladies in town dressed to kill.The Dressmaker is Australia's great novel in much the same way Great Gatsby or To Kill a Mockingbird is Americas and Pride &amp; Prejudice is England's. I loved the book and was not sure whether it would translate into film accurately and do the book justice. Boy was I wrong. This is not a comedy, drama or tragedy movie, although there are some elements there, it's not solely comedy or drama or tragedy, it bears snippets of all these elements and so much more. It doesn't fit into any single genre and that's okay. I picked up immediately that some of the characters are in fact caricatures of small town people which is why they are over the top.I ADORE THIS MOVIE!!! It was worth every $ I paid and I can't say that about a lot of excruciatingly boring, unoriginal &amp; lacklustre movies of 2015 such as Revenant and Spotlight. Watched the Dressmaker 5x at the cinemas. Bought the DVD. My favorite Aussie film of 2015 apart from Mad Max.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay attempt at Cohen brothers meets "Steel Magnolias," good themes though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>my reviews are designed to be short and sweet and without much attention to literary style...people can feel free to take them or leave them, as I know I am not an exceptional writer, but I know what I like. In my opinion, this movie could not decide if it wanted to be a weighty drama that considered important issues, or a light and playful movie like "Oh brother, where art tho?," or Django Unchained. While some movies are capable of combining the two, I like a consistent reality and tone in a movie, and for me, this movie did not successfully achieve that. If you are less demanding of a movie in terms of expecting a certain consistent atmosphere, you might like it more than I did. But for me, it was like a serious drama filled with interjections of playfulness that did not quite work. These scenes were always signaled by music reminiscent of Django unchained or Kill Bill. This seemed really contrived to me, where they were signalling the time for comic relief and levity, even though it did not fit organically with the story. It seemed like the directors were using a formula designed to emulate those types of films, even though it was not suitable. The petty rivalries in the town are treated like comic fodder in such a way that they seemed inconsistent with the drama that I was trying to be engaged in. The second half of the movie works for me better than the first half, as the more serious aspects of the drama come into focus. There is an examination of prejudice, justice and personal transformation that at times is substantive. The merits of this film, in my opinion, lie in its attempt to look at those more substantial issues such as bias and personal tenacity. However, I like a movie that creates a tone and reality that holds together in a way that this did not. This reminds me of other movies, such as Mr. Nobody, where I enjoy some of the philosophical themes, but found the plot wandering and too torturous for me really to enjoy it much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly entertaining throughout! 6/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: The first hour of this movie was really funny but then it seemed to go down a dark avenue of mysterious deaths in the little town of Dungatar. The storyline was truly unique and Kate Winslet (Tilly Dunnage) and July Davis (Molly) were great and it was good to see Hugo Weaving (Sergeant Farrat), parading himself in women's clothing again, as he did in the Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert, but once the love story kicked in between Tilly and Teddy McSwiney (Liam Hemsworth) the film seemed to slow down a little. The mixture of humour and intense drama, was great throughout the film and there is so much happening, which keeps the movie interesting. Its mainly about Tilly Dunnage, who is banished from her small town at a young age, after she is accused of killing a young boy, who is the town bully, so she is sent to boarding school, leaving her frail mother, Molly, behind. Tilly goes on to become a successful dressmaker in Paris but when she returns home to be with her sick mother, her troubled past is still in the villagers minds. Whilst building a relationship with her mother, who is suffering with selective amnesia, she starts to build a relationship with the people in town, by making them dresses for various occasions. She also builds a relationship with Teddy McSwiney, who she completely falls in love with but she still thinks that she is cursed and that bad thinks happen around her. After planning to run away with Teddy, her whole world apart, and she ends up losing everyone that she loves, including the trustee local police officer, Sergeant Farrat, who helped her prove that she really didn't kill the young boy when she was little. When she finally gets pushed to the edge, she takes matters into her own hands and then she hits the road again, with her sewing machine in hand. Its a truly inspiring story about a strong woman who goes out of her way to build a relationship with her mother but the whole curse side of the movie, went haywire after a while. I was quite shocked with the way the director changed the direction of the film at various points throughout the film, which made it entertaining and definitely worth a watch. Enjoyable!Round-Up: After starring in this biggest movie of all time, Kate Winslet, 40 has taken on very few projects which haven't really blown up at the box office but she has proved that she is worthy of her Oscar, which she received for the Reader in 2009. She was great in Holy Smoke, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Little Children, Revolutionary Road and Carnage and with Steve Jobs, Insurgent and Triple 9 yet to be released in the UK, she is slowly climbing back up the ranks to reach the stardom that she gained after starring in Titanic. Her performance in this movie was great and the chemistry between Kate and Judy Davis was brilliant, so it's good to see her back on the big screen after disappearing out of the spotlight for so long. Anyway, this movie was directed by Jocelyn Moorhouse, 55, who brought you Proof in 1991 with a young looking Russell Crowe, How To Make An American Quilt in 1995 and A Thousand Acres in 1997, starring Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer. Although this movie was pushed back a year because of Kate Winslet's pregnancy, it was definitely worth the wait and the costumes that were used throughout the movie were pretty impressive. Its one of those movies that have "chick flick" written all over it but from a man's point of view, I found it funny and entertaining.&nbsp;Budget: $12million Worldwide Gross: $19millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their dramatic movies starring Kate Winslet, Liam Hemsworth, Sarah Snook, Hugo Weaving, Judy Davis and Kerry Fox. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a woman who is wrongly accused of having killed a boy when she was merely ten years old. She is sent away to a foreign country, but she comes back to get desolate town for revenge.This heart wrenching story is told slowly, in layers and with much suspense. She gets a lot of abuse from the villagers still, and I feel for her so much. The story is so sad because there is one tragedy after another. She shows remarkable resilience to survive it all. The dressmaker does make beautiful dresses, which is a very pleasant addition to the film. It's a remarkably touching story because it could happen to anyone. I truly enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As some other reviewers, I would describe "The Dressmaker" as a mostly fun fairy tale. I only wish our filmmakers could have maintained a little more consistency. The film included several awkward transitions and just seemed to wander off track throughout. I don't know if these little breakdowns were due to the writing, editing or both. The actors were basically caricatures and I was able to forgave the majority of over the top acting. The exaggerated behavior, circumstances and great visuals didn't always contribute or fit into the overall story. I got the feeling the director just fell in love with a few individual scenes and just had to be wedged in. The Dressmaker was an OK film that just nearly missed being a really good one like "Liza the Fox-Fairy" for example.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone looking at this and expecting a mature story will be disappointed. It's a child's fairy-tale which entails all the qualities - good and bad - that that genre carries.The story is minimal and at times strains the patience with its ridiculous flashbacks and enduring plot-lines from childhood. But it's a simple retribution and justice tale and so the ordinary rules don't really apply.That freedom of judgment has to be applied to the characters too: more like overly exaggerated caricatures than realized mature characters. The absurdity of a poor rural community dressing in expensive fabrics in the dry brown landscape is another fairy-tale touch.This form and genre may exhaust the patience of some and fairly so, but taken on its own terms, which oddly are not too different from an early Dickens novel, because it approaches life and struggles in the same childish fairy story terms, this is quite amusing: quite, but not completely.It is played broad like an amateur production which is tiring. It might have been more successful if played straighter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like quirky, character based films bridging the drama, thriller and rom-com genres, this will suit. And if you like condensed laconic Australian dialogue without lots of non essential words even better. Kate Winslet leads a large cast of mostly locally well known and competent Australian actors from film and stage. I had to check that she really was British, her accent is so good. The tight writing and unexpected twists and turns in plot, from a book by Rosalie Ham led to an effortless two hours of entertainment.Kate Winslet carries the emotional traumas of Myrtle / Tilly Dunnage returning to a tiny Australian country town she had left in uncertain circumstances years earlier, and Hugo Weaving as the police sergeant inhabited the conflicts of being the only police officer in a remote community. The transformation in Sarah Snook as Gertrude / Trudy Pratt was a marvel to behold. But Judy Davis made the most of enormous opportunities, and attracted the limelight to Molly Dunnage, Myrtle's mentally unstable mother throughout.The locations and cinematography really rang true, with the setting appearing to be the dry farmland with granite boulders on low hills between Melbourne and Geelong. I'm not quite old enough to recall the era, but the style and artefacts highlighted seemed convincing.I found this a really interesting film, with strong, unpredictable plot and well-drawn characters I could believe in and feel for.Give it a go!</fullReview>

That was both mine and my partners impressions. But wait: separately one of my work colleges (mid 50s like moi) saw the movie with a friend and said the same thing!! We thought we were going to see a serious movie filmed in the style of "Far from the Madding Crowd". Nope.So what else was not to like?Kate Winslet being 15 years older (in real life) than all of her friends from school. Not very convincing. Especially as I believe Kate's character had travelled the world for 20 odd years. I suppose they needed a big star.Terrible and distressing storyline with really misogynistic men. If you do not like domestic violence then do not see this movie.A stupidly small made-up back lot town. Could they not pick a real country town from somewhere to make this movie? Like Hills End?Whats to like? The costumes. Ohh lah lah!!!So save your money and get this movie on Bluray or stream it.It could have been a contender.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An uneasy mix, an uneasy story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film based on a novel by Rosalie Ham is set in a tiny and extremely remote village in Australia in the 1950s. The central element of the story is the return of a young woman to this village which she left as a child. The main character is admirably played by Kate Winslet, with her usual shadings of emotion and her admirable skill. She has come for two reasons, to try to re-examine her origins and childhood, and also to wreak vengeance upon those who have wronged her. The main motif of this film thus resembles that of Friedrich Duerenmatt's famous play THE VISIT, which was so brilliantly filmed in 1964 by Bernhard Wicki, with Ingrid Bergman as the woman who returns, and Anthony Quinn as the male lead. That film has undeservedly disappeared from notice, but it was one of the most powerful films made anywhere in the world in the mid-sixties, and contains one of Ingrid Bergman's finest performances of her career. (The next time I watch it, I shall review it.) It used to be impossible to find, but it is now available on DVD, although so few people are aware of its existence that it remains little known. This new film entirely fails to exploit the powerful theme of a woman returning to her village or small town for vengeance. Instead, the director Joselyn Moorhouse (an Ossie by birth) makes excessive excursions into wildly over-the-top satire on small Australian communities (which are also portrayed as intrinsically evil) and attempts at broad humour which are also overdone. Perhaps the humour is some kind of local Australian gnomic humour which those of us who are not Ossies simply cannot grasp. But many of these attempts are just silly. Moorhouse was not cut out for making comedies, and should not try, because she clearly has no reliable comic judgement. The story is thus diluted, like a whiskey and soda with far too much soda and barely any whiskey. One knows the film could have been very powerful, but the focus was lost and it just does not make the grade at all. This is a great pity, and an opportunity wasted. The director clearly never made up her mind whether she was making a tragedy or a comedy, and since she is not Shakespeare (she also collaborated on the script), she could not successfully mix the two. So few people can that it is usually a mistake to try. Despite the best efforts of Winslet and of Judy Davis as her mother, with good support from others as well, the sprawling and blurred uncertainty of the director's intentions left one wondering just what her purpose in making the film really was. The film is entertaining because everyone tries so hard. But it does not actually 'work', and is like one of those inferior Chinese takeaways that leaves you hungry again five minutes later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is hands down the best film in the English language I've seen for at least two years. Not only does it do its source absolute justice, it adds a genuine, highly original Oz visual atmosphere to its themes. The cast is nothing short of amazing, with every single character bringing the utmost of their craft to the roles. Judy Davis delivers one of the best performances of her illustrious career, but Kate Winslet, Kerry Fox and Sarah Snook are also fantastic. Liam Hemsworth isn't just hotter than Chris, he's also the far more nuanced thespian. Hugo Weaving, one of the best actors of his generation, sinks his teeth into his beefy part of an exceedingly well-mannered cop in the 1950's Oz outback.Winslet is the mysterious stranger arriving by night whom he delivers her luggage to in the beginning of the film. He quickly recognizes her as the girl he sent away following the death of a boy her age 25 years earlier. The townsfolk, including her quick-tempered mother played by Davis, alternate between suspicion of the motives of her return and attraction for her stunning dressmaking skills and resolute character.Some people will find the meandering story, which constantly shifts between mystery, comedy, tragedy and romance hard to follow. It's their own fault. Everyone else will highly appreciate the original story, the excellent camera work and set design, the abundance of love shown in every frame for a project that took 15 years to realize. Its domestic success as the 2nd most successful film of 2015 after you-know-which-one could not be more deserved.One can therefore only wonder why the Adacemy snubbed this for the Oscars, especially if you look at the usual suspects which represent the contenders this year. And as justified as the #OscarsSoWhite debate is, this omission also reminds us of another group of movie artists which are all too often absent from the list of nominees: Women. For what makes "The Dressmaker" so highly enjoyable on top of its original story, local feel and excellent cast, is that it offers a feminine angle of storytelling which we do not get to see enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I read the book and wasn't disappointed with the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took my 13-year-old son to see this with me and we both thought it was the best movie we'd seen all year. We laughed out loud for the first 30 minutes. I read the book last year and I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. Some parts were funny, some sad. The ending wasn't what I wanted to happen, but the characters were great. I loved the descriptions of silks and satins and needlework. I enjoyed the movie more than the book as I knew where it was going. The story is set in a tiny outback town in Australia in the 1950s. Tilly Dunnage (Kate Winslet) was sent away as a child and is now returning. She looks like Veronica Lake, all bright red lipstick and Dior inspired outfits. But it quickly becomes clear that she is not welcome. It is only when the locals realize she can make them look fabulous that they begin to tolerate her.There are flashback and hints as to what it was that forced Tilly to leave. I won't say anymore as I don't want to spoil the story. Believe me, it's a good one! Judy Davis (who plays Tilly's doolally mother) plays a great part; she reminded me of Maggie Smith. All the characters are larger than life, but it's a comedy. The part where Liam Hemsworth takes his shirt off (watch the trailer) had some of the audience cheering!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow - isn't Australian Film deliciously outstanding at the moment, finally someone has said, "lets get the script and story right, before we commit to rolling a camera"Congrats to &#x202a;#&#x200e;suemaslin&#x202c; and &#x202a;#&#x200e;jocelymoorehouse&#x202c; on delivering to us the &#x202a;#&#x200e;thedressmaker&#x202c;. You laugh, you cry, you hiss and shout, this film grabs you and carries you along to its ultimate outcome. Its cast - wow what a cast - are awesome in giving us over the top and yet realist characters who you either love to hate or hate to love. Judy Davis is brilliant, Liam - well is just a total hunk, Kate Winslet comes to us as the real Aussie sheila with a past, and does it so wellDon McAlpine, as Sue Maslin said at tonight's film event, paints with light and so he does. Its a film that is a constantly moving tapestry of rich Australian colour, and this is heightened further by an outstanding soundtrack - not only the music by David Hirschfelder which is outstanding, but also the wonderfully rich sound scape created by the sound design team, ohhhhh that sizzling cigarette drawback.This is seriously a 10/10 film and for me sits beside Holding the Man as being two outstanding films for this year. That they are both Australian, says much about our film sector and their ability to tell amazing stories.This film took Sue Maslin 7 years to get to screen, 7 years to get the $17m it took to make it, maybe that amount of time gave PJ Hogan, his partner Jocelyn Moorehouse and author Rosalie Ham to really create a wonderful script and for Sue to gather a company of artists who could bring the story to life. I would hope that in future, Aussie investors jump at the chance to be part of films like this, an investment were worth the effort.And if you have not seen the film, can I suggest that you jump on board, its bloody outstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Make my dress!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title "The Dressmaker" hardly raises expectations like "Spectre" does but this movie is destined to become an Aussie classic. Populated by a swag of Aussie actors along with import Kate Winslet, the movie moves from lightness and comedic to something darker. The theatre was packed and the laughs were frequent and some of the audience were in stitches. Kate,the good dressmaker makes the most of her skill and if you are into fashion then you will really get a bonus. I was taken by Sarah Snook who looked luminous in her new rags - just shows what makeup and a smart dress can do for a girl. Revenge is on the menu and gets served up in various ways that are deserved by the good burghers. All in all an enjoyable movie and I learned that you should really look very carefully before you jump into anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is pure pastiche comedy that has no intention of taking things seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If pure entertainment is your goal, then The Dressmaker is a very funny and engaging Australian farce. However, if you want authenticity in storytelling, accuracy of period-sets, and narrative believability, you might be disappointed. It's all about expectations: the higher you set them the further you fall. But you will enjoy the film more if you recognise this piece of Aussie silliness as pastiche comedy, a genre that has no intention of taking things seriously. It's like the painter who deliberately applies layers of paint too thickly, with exaggerated colours and bold strokes that produce caricatures not characters and a story arc in crazy loops without predictability or linearity. That's why opinions differ so widely about The Dressmaker. So just accept the incongruity of Dior haute couture in an outback shanty town, the endearing closet transvestite policeman, the parody of class bitchiness between respectable townsfolk and outcasts, and the quest for vengeance using the transformative power of female fashion. None of it is serious.It could easily have been made into a great Australian film that was understood by audiences around the world. But as an incoherent Aussie mashup, with lashings of bogan humour and echoes of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994), Muriel's Wedding (1994), Strictly Ballroom (1992) and many others, it has been home-grown for our enjoyment and enjoyable it certainly is. Kate Winslet is almost upstaged by Judy Davis as her mum, and Hugo Weaving trumps them both in uniform or pink taffeta. Liam Hemsworth is a bit too hipster to be believable as a 1950s farm hand, but his eye-candy value adds another visual wild-card. The star-studded cast would have enjoyed the frolic and so will any audience if the film is approached in the right way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Delightful, exaggerated and fanciful, feel good and tragic, this movie set in an Australian small town is something different. The use of fashion as a weapon is quite hilarious especially set in the background of the podunk town. The scene with Sarah Snook's dance transformation and wedding dress incident are quite funny and amazing. There is a deeper more serious message about the small town mentality.A dressmaker (Winslet) returns to a small town that sent her away as a young girl after a young boy was killed years ago. She reconnects with her eccentric mother and the residents of the town.The acting is superb from Judy Davis in particular. She is fantastic is Mad Molly. Kate looks elegant if slightly plump in her couture outfits. Surprisingly she doesn't look too old for a bearded Liam Hemsworth who plays her charming if impulsive love interest. The accents aren't too thick so things are understandable.Kind of wished there had been a happier ending. Still worth watching - it will surprise you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about love, revenge and haute couture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i m always a fan of English actress Kate winslet.But in this Australian flick she done a nice job.from arriving in her own village to leaving in a train all are awesome in the movie. cinematography and direction are also excellent.if you believe in critics,go for it.Banished from a remote and sparsely populated Australian town when she was 10, Tilly (Kate Winslet) returns many years later. Fresh from conquering the fashion world in Paris, Tilly's form fitting red dress turns heads immediately. Some say Tilly committed a horrible crime and was cursed for it. Tilly has come in order to better learn the truth about what really happened and to set things right. There are many things on her mind including determining her own guilt in the matter, her mother Molly who appears to be mad, lifting the curse, finding love and revenge, among other things.rest you see in theater.i m not gonna spoil the fun..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant cast writing and photography. Bumping off people has never been more fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went to it thinking it was entirely another film, but I'm glad I went in with the wrong expectations.Absolutely gorgeous photography and frocks, who could ask for more? Especially the local cop.The wit and hilarious characters really keep this rolling story tumbling on through every twist and turn right down to the last bump, or what you think is the last bump and off you go again with a series of explosive scenes to the final culmination that beautifully wraps it up. Favourite lines: "They should do something about whoever is burning that rubbish" "You haven't met the rubbish!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fabulous movie! Wonderful mix of humor, emotion, mystery, from a superb cast! Awesome and honest Australian setting, with totally memorable characters! One minute you are laughing the next moment crying, and always the mystery of what actually did happen back when Tilly was young that saw her leave her hometown. The adorable mother, Molly, who's memory is not too great but her outspoken ways are to the forefront; the flamboyant police officer who's 'love of good fabric' leaves us wondering just when or if he will finally make it out of his closet life. Then there is "Teddy", handsome and adoring of Tilly ~ what a guy! Good times; Sad times; an intriguing and fun story based on finding the truth and moving on from the past. Well worth every moment in front of the screen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky Australian Movie with Great Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has all the trademarks of a typical Australian piece of cinema: a who's who of Australian actors (excepting Kate Winslet), a yarn (story) that is funny, moving and unpredictable, a classic Australian setting and a flair of the likes we've seen in Priscilla Queen of the Desert and Strictly Ballroom. While all of the performances are outstanding, for me Judy Davis stood out. As Molly she encapsulates a woman who has been derided by her community, suffered loss, been mistreated by men and comes out the other side valiant and invincible. Her performance is a tour-de-force. If for no other reason, see this movie for Judy Davis' performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another in the long line of delicious Australian movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Diane and I saw this wonderful movie just a day ago and we both enjoyed it tremendously. Diane was attracted by the subject matter: dressmaking in rural Australia while I knew nothing about the film. To be honest making dresses took a very modest amount of time but albeit several critical scenes in a complex story. The complexity of the film rolled out fairly quickly and then seemed to me to plateau before picking up speed and then continuing along slowly before the conclusion of the film. The interweaving of the characters of this very small country town was magical to someone like me who knew nothing about the story. I unashamedly love outback movies set in small country towns during a time set somewhere between WWI and the middle of the previous century. Be prepared to be subject to beautiful: set scenery, photography and acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undoubtedly, Hollywood will remake this without the harsh plot twists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was arm twisted into seeing this, and, by and large, ended up enjoying it. The movie is deliciously Australian in the comedy, and it is a credit to Kate Winslet that she 'stood and delivered' her lines in the typical Aussie dry comedy manner. Hugo Weaving was just brilliant, as he always is in roles. Shane Bourne was adventitious assuming a role that may change public perceptions about him. I found the plot twists rather jarring, and at times, what the actors revealed was personally uncomfortable to me. That said; there is great depth to these plot twists. Even some days after the initial viewing, I find myself replaying the movie in my mind and seeing more detail bubble to the surface. Give it ten years and Hollywood will remake this movie. But they will do based on some USA small town, without the harsh plot twists and the dry Australian humour, and they will make more money. More the shame, really.</fullReview>
