		<shortDescription>A beautiful comedy movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Mother's Day draws close, a group of seemingly unconnected people come to terms with the relationships they have with their mothers. Sandy (Jennifer Aniston) is a divorced mother of two boys whose ex-husband has recently remarried a younger woman named Tina (Shay Mitchell). Miranda (Julia Roberts) is an accomplished writer who gave up her only child, Kristin (Britt Robertson) for adoption at birth. But as a grown-up Kristin prepares herself for marriage, she begins to contemplate the missing part in her life and is encouraged by her friend, Jesse (Kate Hudson), to go out and find her mother. Meanwhile, Jesse, who never sees her mother, is surprised by her parents when they come to visit and must come to terms with their failing relationship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605; - tragic, humourless waste of talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems director Garry Marshall is either getting lazier, more impatient, or less interested in his old age. That's the only explanation for this movie - another dull and cheesy holiday romp, with no real story and flimsy characters.Most of the damage was done in writing. Kochoff, Walker and Hines's screenplay isn't just badly written, but painfully grating. Particularly at the start, people speak sentences that no human would ever say, mostly for exposition. The trouble is when you're introducing about 10 characters in the same amount of minutes, that's a lot of face-slapping exposition to comprehend when they all talk so unsubtly.Unfortunately, the damage having already been done, Marshall and his crew apparently makes no attempt to salvage anything from the wreckage. Roberts looks like she has no idea what she's doing as the obnoxious TV star, Hudson and Sudeikis have such little enthusiasm, and every character behaves unrealistically and inconsistently. Only Aniston seems vaguely believable as she tries to make sense of her ex- husband acting irrationally. Whitehall's acting, surprisingly, peaks during the more serious scenes when he steers away from the comedy, and his relationship with (the pretty decent) Robertson is the only thing that verges on feeling genuine.Not only are the big stars pretty awful, they've inspired the minor characters to bring a whole new level of terrible to the movie. The set pieces are inexplicably unconvincing, from the laughable football/soccer scene to the seriously unfunny stand-up comedy. Let's not forget the racism - which is even worse in this movie because the writers clearly think the rock-solid stereotypes which their minority characters match are funny. They're not.What we've ended up with is half a dozen half-baked story lines, with faked sentiment and characters with no substance. Not every film needs to try to push the boundaries of their genre, but they need to do more than regurgitate the same old garbage we've seen done a million times before and a million times better.1/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and relaxing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with my wife and we both found it funny and relaxing. You will probably recognize a lot of the situations as the movie is very much in touch with today's social reality and how people cope with it. It's an honest and natural story. Don't expect a heavy-handed drama but a good laugh instead and a surprise here and there. Indeed there are different story lines, in the end they come together and it all makes sense. The duration is OK, we were not bored at all. We feel the many famous actors must have enjoyed themselves while filming. It's of course not the most difficult role they have played in their careers however we appreciated their work a lot and left the theater with happy faces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the critics reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved it. My husband and I thoroughly laughed until my stomach hurt. This movie is very funny and has lots of funny tag lines to laugh about later. I don't get the rude reviews and the harsh comments. I thought it was very well done and a different twist. If you are super critical and everything offends you easily, this isn't the movie for you. But if you like a good clean movie that isn't filled with naked sex starved scenes you will enjoy it. It is nice sometimes not to get cussed out and see every body part on a person. Just good clean fun is enjoyable too. It has many judgmental aspects, but it's a comedy, get over yourself. People make things too deep. The critics are just that, too critical. They rip movies apart so much it's hard to please them.This movie is funny and as a mother (sister and child), I loved it. My mother would have enjoyed it too. I will be recommending it to whomever wants a unique take on a movie. I thought it was going to be sappy and it wasn't. I laughed repeatedly, my husband did too and so did the entire theater. My sister and I went on a double date, loved by us all. Great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank God a good movie to watch!! No needed of violence of sexual-nudity expositions. Great humor, great acting. I recommend this movie to anyone that just need a relax and have a good fun quality time. Julia Roberts, Jenn Aniston, Kate Hudson, just EVERYONE made a great acting job. I don't really understand why this movie is having bad reviews?? What is going on with us? Finally a decent movie to watch, without violence-stress-porno, and people thinks is not good enough? I really appreciate there are still productions like this one. Hopefully more people will see it and will have a much better and fair reviews. WVS</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It had so much potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the stories of several mothers who spend Mother's Day in different ways."Mother's Day" can easily draw families to the cinema, because of its topic and the number of big stars. I watched it for Julia Roberts and Jennifer Aniston, but I was rather disappointed by it. These ensemble comedies have so many subplots and so many characters, that none of them are fully developed. As a result, I don't really know the characters well enough to care for any of them.the Kate Hudson subplot is funny and entertaining enough, providing the comic relief. The Julia Roberts subplot is very disappointing, because it could have been so much better. She could have made a touching announcement on TV, which would have a far greater impact on the viewers. Instead, something else happened on TV which I don't care for at all."Mother's Day" had so much potential, but wasted the concept and the talent involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst. Movie. Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seriously, never in my entire life, seen something on screen that was this painful to watch (including Jackass and Klovn). Poorly written, poorly executed, unenthusiastic acting from otherwise talented people. Just awful. I feel hurt and betrayed. I want my money back. And my time (finally out of the house, with my fiancé. Great date. NAHT.) From the outrageously racist jokes, the fat jokes, the stereotypical comic reliefs, the utterly pointless scenes and unbelievably unrealistic characters - Just the worst. I expected a pointless, turn-off-your-brain low quality romcom but never did I imagine it being SO BAD. To a few of my favorites acting in this film: Please - PLEASE - have more ambition in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite Reviews my Friend &amp; I Enjoyed This Movie Tonight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We went for some light entertainment &amp; knew what to expect and we were NOT DISAPPOINTED ! What do the critics expect - every movie to be a potential Academy Award nominee ? Sometimes I like serious movies, like Spotlight which I enjoyed very much &amp; knew beforehand what I was going to see. Same with this movie; sometimes light entertainment is fine. I knew it wasn't going to be a physical comedy, I knew there were no action scenes and that was fine tonight. It's what I chose to see and we enjoyed it. I also liked Gary Marshall's other two multi-storied, holiday movies even though they were panned by the critics too. Each separate story with different casts are basically short so you're bound to like some of them. I can't see how you could dislike everyone &amp; their story lines. Of course there are corny jokes and references to other movies --so what? Biggest thing with me was that after seeing The Boss on Tuesday, I was not offended by anything in this movie. I was extremely offended by many situations &amp; mostly the language in The Boss. I found The Boss to be extremely offensive hearing such crude sexual references in all the dialogue filled with the F word, etc. This movie has none of that. It's not crude, offensive nor inappropriate for kids and that says a lot about Gary Marshall and his movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very, very disappointed with this movie. There is no real-life link or lessons or messages that have been sent through or even tried to be sent through. The story lines are all over the place, there is no real development on the story lines and they are extremely short. Characters are also not developed at all. The only character that was a little deeper was that Jen, the others had no time to be developed. Great cast but some mediocre acting. Jen and Kate I found to be good, the others not so impressive. Very, very disappointed in Jack though. What was wrong with him. His acting was so bad. I was excited to see him in this movie because usually I am a fan of his but in this movie he was so bad. The only scenes that he did well were those on the stage since he has real life experiences on comedy life acts and I think he felt more comfortable. But that is not acting at all if you can only do things that are real in your real life. It is the opposite actually. In any other scenes when actual acting was required he just wasn't good at all. I guess the only good thing about this movie despite having a famous cast is that it is warm since it revolves around motherhood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some mothers might like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rom/Com regular Garry Marshall continues with his holiday days themed films with this one being centred around Mother's Day, though not strictly a sequel to either Valentine's Day or New Years Day. Reuniting with key stars like Julia Roberts for the fourth time (Pretty Woman, Runaway Bride, Valentine's Day) and Hector Elizondo, who's pretty much been in every Garry Marshall films. It's an all star cast who loosely connect with one another in some way or another, covering a board variety of mother/children relationships. Those that disapprove, those that are single, those that have up their responsibility and those that step-mother's. Jennifer Aniston, Kate Hudson and Jason Sudeikis are among the key cast with other great actors such as the Chips Legend Robert Pine, Timothy Olyphant, Brit comedian Jack Whitehall with Jon Lovitz and Cameron Esposito. Each playing their part well clashing and bouncing off one another as the film progresses. I say they're loosely connected as there isn't really anything firm or concrete among them all. I think I was half expecting them all to together for a mass Mother's Day party at the end but that's not the case. It's more of a friend of a friend kind of connection but doesn't make the film least enjoyable. Just harder to see how the characters relate to one another. It's lacks a decent soundtrack which I think was a shame, every rom/com is accompanied by a good soundtrack if not a decent score which was also non-existent. It was there but nothing outstanding that helped create the mood. I didn't notice it myself. There was a little weakness with how characters came together, clichéd maybe but it becomes slightly unbelievable that it ends the way it does, everyone going from not talking to one another for years to being a loving happy family within a day and almost makes a mockery of the issues the film is trying to challenge. There's not much to laugh at but is easy going entertainment. Colourful and structured well, we get the point but feels a little rushed towards the end, possible to ensure everyone gets the closure so they can conclude the film. I think it just needed to be a little smarter with connecting the story lines Running Time: 8 The Cast: 8 Performance: 7 Direction: 7 Story: 4 Script: 4 Creativity: 6 Soundtrack: 3 Job Description: 5 The Extra Bonus Points: 052% 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very promising story which was ruined by utterly poor execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mother's Day had a very promising story which was ruined by utterly poor execution and a complete waste of acting talent which was loaded due to the casting of the movie. Story (7/10): Well, nothing was so much wrong with the story. Four different lives, four different challenges and at some point of time, they cross the paths - and all of it is centered around the hullabaloo of Mother's Day. They all have their own theories and ideas for the big day but they end up doing almost nothing that they originally thought of - and that's where teeny tiny bit of the fun lies in the movie. A well conceptualized story though. Acting (5/10): Acting is where this entire movie falls apart in spite of big names like Julia Roberts and Jennifer Anniston. Anniston still seems to be in that "Friends" zone with her dialog delivery. The expressions are off and doesn't seem to be in the character really, except for last few minutes in the climax. Julia Roberts holds pretty much a flat face throughout the movie. Jason Sudeiki was probably the only saving grace. The rest of the cast makes a decent attempt but aren't able to lift up the movie. Direction (4/10): The direction of the movie is awful. Close to half of the movie misses the flow and the scenes look like stitched together as the director struggles to smoothly transition from one story to another. The screenplay is pathetic and isn't able to hold the audience more than few seconds. It is only at the end that things come together when the four characters converge. However, the overall execution of the movie "executes" the story. It just looks like the director suddenly realized that Mother's Day is arriving and he has to release a movie before that. Overall (5/10): Poorly executed. Should give it a pass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mother's Day (The 3rd Part of the Holiday Trilogy!!!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, Mother's Day is #3 in a trilogy behind Valentine's Day and New Year's Eve. I love both those films and was worried this wouldn't hold up to the other two. I was glad to see that it was just as good, great story, great characters, and a tiny little twist. Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts, Kate Hudson, Britt Robertson, and Sarah Chalke play all the moms with interconnecting stories that lead into Mother's Day. Aniston plays Sandy, a mom who dreads having to deal with her ex and his new lover. Roberts plays Miranda Collins, an accomplished writer with a secret. Hudson and Chalke play Jesse and Gabi, two sisters that keep their relationships hidden from their overbearing old school parents. Robertson plays Kristin, a young mother who doesn't want to get married due to her dark past and abandonment issues. Finally, Jason Sudeikis plays Bradley, a widowed father dealing with the loss of his wife. This movie will hopefully make you laugh and tug on your heartstrings and will make you appreciate your mother and all she's done for you. I highly recommend MOTHER'S DAY!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about real life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK there are many negative reviews of this movie - I do not think it is meant to be an Oscar nominee. It is a movie about families with different needs/problems/real life issues and it is centered around Mother's Day. Just as Valentine's Day is a big favorite of millions of people - it did not get any Oscars - but it is a movie that people remember. Sometimes that is better. Three families with problems. A one year anniversary for a mother's death, a divorce, and sisters with secrets from parents. and a commitment issue woman wanting to know her birth mother. Of course things get smoothed out - but it was fan watching it all happen. It is move about real life and I appreciate that. The sound track is fun, the pratfalls are OK, but the stories are real. If you have been through a divorce - you will understand. Not a great movie but a believable one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Memoriam: Garry Marshall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Garry Marshall died this year after a very long career of feel goo films he wrote, directed, acted in, produced ? and sometimes all simultaneously, both on television (The Odd Couple, Mork and Mindy, Happy Days, Laverne &amp; Shirley) and in movies (Beaches, Pretty Woman, Runaway Bride, The Other Sister, The Princess Diaries, Valentine's Day, New year's Eve, etc). He often worked with the same actors ? a trusted bond of friendship. While MOTHER'S DAY my not be one of his best films, it completes his trilogy of holiday films and brings the usual warmth and keen observation of interpersonal relationships to play from a richly popular cast of fine actors.Three generations come together in the week leading up to Mother's Day. Sandy (Jennifer Anniston), a divorcée who has two sons who tries to co-parent with her ex (Timothy Olyphant). But when her ex remarries a girl half her age (Shay Mitchell), she freaks out because she's spending time with her sons and doing things with them that she usually does. Her friend, Jesse (Kate Hudson) is surprised by her parents (Margo Martindale and Robert Pine) who show up unannounced and they discover who Jesse's Indian husband (Aasif Mandvi) is and he learns that she didn't tell them about him which prompts him to leave, And they also learn whom their other daughter Gabi (Sarah Chalke) Is married to Max (Cameron Esposito) in a lesbian marriage. Kristin (Britt Robertson) is a girl who has a boyfriend Zach (Jack Whitehall) and a child but her boyfriend wants them to go to the next level, marriage but she has unresolved issues which keeps her from taking the plunge and her boyfriend is uncertain how long he can wait. Things change a bit when Kristin discovers who her birth mother is?. Bradley (Jason Sudeikis) is a widower with two daughters, one of whom is a teenager and Bradley finds it hard to accept her new interests like boys and he still misses his wife. It all comes together at Mother's Day ? time heals all things.Also in the cast are Julia Roberts, Hector Elizondo, Anoush NeVart, Jennifer Garner, Jon Lovitz ? and many others in small but significant cameos. Watch for the pleasure of seeing fine actors get a little silly and for the pleasure Garry Marshall brought to the entertainment industry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phony, Maudlin, and Predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a sitcom-style film like "Mother's Day," one should expect some clever dialogue, interesting character interactions, and at least some grounding in reality. Unfortunately, this film never got on track with either the humor or good characterization.One of the major problems was that there were far too many characters and relationships. The film switched from one set of family interactions to another for two hours of superficial dialogue. Despite the good cast (Julia Roberts, Jennifer Anniston, and others), the dialogue sounded scripted and artificial.Sit com always has very generalized characters. But this film was so full of clichés that it was difficult to find credible any of the character types: divorced mother, career-obsessed mother, racist mother, divorced dad marrying younger woman, obligatory lesbian couple, interracial couple, and wounded adopted daughter.On the surface, the screenplay attempted to celebrate diversity in contemporary families. But the shallow characters and predictable situations resulted in a smarmy and dishonest approach to family systems. Who would possibly want to watch this film on Mother's Day?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a demographic that will relate to this film: Females who are (or somehow wish they were) moms and who have lives enhanced by cheap daytime soaps and cheap paperback romance fiction novelettes. And, who don't mind a script that challenges a sophomore writing class (that's like the HS one) for stereotypic blandness; a dialogue seldom exceeding seven words (with lots of head shot panning back and forth and ?) and repetitive plasticized robotic acting. Plot: Predictable buffet of female family situations. I knew before watching they would have Aniston in a sweating jogging or workout scene - yep. Usual preteen and teen issues. What subsequent scene always shows up when a vending machine fails to drop your snack? Yep again, someone tries to stick their arm up. That is creative writing?? The whole movie imitates that vending scene. Directing/editing: See somewhere in the above. Setting: White suburbias (as in plural many times over).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The PlotThis disaster follows the lives of different mothers on Mother's Day. Sandy (Aniston) is happily divorced, until she finds out her ex- husband eloped with a much younger woman. Now she must learn to deal with big changes in her life as her two boys now have a step-mom. Sisters Jesse (Hudson) and Gabi (Chalke) get an unexpected surprise from their mother, who is not happy to find out Gabi is a lesbian and Jesse is married to a man of color. Miranda (Roberts) doesn't have any kids and is focusing on her career. Kristin (Robertson) is enjoying life as a new mother but is feeling pressure from her boyfriend to get married. Bradley (Sudeikis) is trying hard to be the best parent for his two girls since their mom passed away last year, however his idea of Mothers Day is pretending it doesn't exist at all.I really like Garry Marshall and he's be involved in a many good movies and TV shows. Sadly this is not one of them.The movie is a series of absurd pandering offensive politically correct vignettes. The only group missing was the Asians. There's gays, lesbians, wheelchair blacks, Indians, you name it. OMG! It's absolutely idiotic.There is really no story line. And for some reason there are several scenes in a comedy club that relate to nothing in the movie! It's really sad that this movie represents the end to Marshalls comedy legacy. He died soon after this was released. Maybe he saw it and realized what a piece o9f garbage this movie was. It sucks. I'd give it a zero if I could.</fullReview>

Okay, I'm not 100% sure that these last four varieties of Mamas are spotlighted in MOTHER'S DAY, but I do recall that there is a lot of lying going on in this flick. MOTHER'S DAY does NOT focus on a single family, as was the case with I REMEMBER MAMA, but on at least four major gangs of jumbled up folks, according to its closing credits. Perhaps Jennifer Anniston's "Sandy" is the Main Mom, but her usurpation by a younger Trophy Wife interloping bikini (or infamously Media Nudie) replacement "Mother" is less likely to bring Jenny's Real Life defector husband Brad Pitt to the minds of moviegoers than that much more important American, Donald Trump, who I believe trumps Brad by about 100% in the ex-wives department.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm really disappointed with this movie. Scenario had only couple funny sentences, and that's it, and I assume this should be a comedy. If you expecting romantic movie you will be disappointed, because the only thing we see there is some people with some inessential problems, and making big thing out of it. Slow development of story, although is unpredictable because you can't expect that someone will devote such attention on not important details. The only bright thing in this movie is cast, which is making me confused why did they do this especially Sudeikis. It's cast with big experience i just don't understand need for this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. We enjoyed it, many of our favorite actors are in it. Not just a lightweight comedy, it addresses some important issues in family relations but does it in mostly humorous ways. Garry Marshall died of complications of a stroke and pneumonia less than three months after this movie hit the theaters. The DVD extra "gag reel" is fun because it contains a lot of Marshall himself talking about the movie and cast.Set and filmed in Atlanta it looks at the lives of several mothers, and one single father whose military wife had recently died, leaving him to raise two young daughters. We were totally entertained, we found it better than the rather low IMDb rating would suggest.Garry Marshall made a particular type of movie, this is one that most fans of his other movies will enjoy.Hats off to you Garry Marshall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mother's Day is here and Flo (Margo Martindale) is somewhat upset when she learns that one of her 2-daughters Jesse (Kate Hudson) married a person from India; another daughter Gabi (Sarah Chalke) is gay. Sandy (Aniston) with 2-sons has to deal with ex-husband Henry (Timothy Olyphant) marrying someone much younger than he is. Bradley (Jason Sudeikis) with 2-daughters has to deal with the passing of his military wife (Jennifer Garner). Kristin (Britt Robertson) won't tell Zack (Jack Whitehall) why she won't marry him. The beginning almost had me shutting the movie down. There were just too many people doing this and that, running here and there, and saying many things we had no knowledge of. I had the feeling I would never know who was who and what was going on. It was like we came in on the middle of a conversation and had no idea about anything. But my TV shows hadn't come back yet, the Olympics were over so I decided to stay the course. I was glad I did.Behind the wheel of her parked car Sandy loses it because she finds out Henry her ex-husband plans to take his young wife to Paris, France. (Oh, he never took her? Bummer). She goes bonkers yelling and pounding the steering wheel. Bradley, walking by, sees her acting this way says, "I'd hate to see her in traffic."There is a major twist (In a comedy?) that involves Julia Roberts' character Miranda. I am not a big fan of Julia Roberts, but she nailed her role in here. Kudos. Timothy Olyphant in a comedy did good, but I missed seeing him with a U.S. Marshal's badge and a gun as he had in the Justified TV show. Notables: Jennifer Garner, Hector Elizondo, Robert Pine, John Lovitz. Randy (Matthew Walker) the Clown had the best line when he tells Sandy that the bottom line is: the love of a mother to her kids. They know it's there and sometimes take it for granted.This movie surprised me. It eventually became clearer and many of the dialogues were actually quite funny and I mean LOL funny. Yes, there were many plots to be resolved and that made the movie a bit too long, but all in all everything was good. I should have realized that when Garry Marshall directs it would be good. Kudos. (7/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: One F-bomb by Julia Roberts when the credits run and outtakes are shown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Denouement To A Formula Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Garry Marshall again ends a romance with a punch which is emotionally satisfying. The large cast reorganizes a familiar theme starting with the movie LOVE ACTUALLY in which unconnected people experience similar misgivings at holiday time, in this case Mother's day to each resolve them in their own fashion at the end. The opening scenes however are so frantic and disorganized the effect is thirties screwball comedy gone wrong. Perhaps millennium technology raises the bar of the size of the cast, the scope of the set and the visual punch to the point the screwball seems to hectic or disorganized for the premise. Familiar names from Sarah Chalke, a once familiar sitcom star to Penny Marshall, Garry's daughter also a once familiar sitcom star provide interest until it is the emotional punch of the reconciliations which brings the film to a satisfying conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie that is overly criticized!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I'm surprised at so many of the negative reviews here that nit pick it apart. I watch movies to be entertained, to enjoy myself and this movie did just that. If you want a lighthearted fun loving movie, then you won't be disappointed. I don't think the point of the movie was to be deep or complex. To criticize the acting is silly- the cast did a great job for what the movie was. Plus it was about real life. People like being able to relate to painful real life situations portrayed in a funny way. This is a movie I'd wholeheartedly recommend to my friends or family. Will it win an Oscar? Doubtful. But it's still a great feel good kind of movie that is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mother's DayThe biggest difference between Mother's Day and Father's Day is that kids can actually find their moms to celebrate with.This romantic-comedy, however, has found a few fathers that have stuck around.Bradley (Jason Sudeikis) is a single dad dealing with his wife's death during May; Miranda (Julia Roberts) is a successful writer reunited with the daughter (Britt Robertson) she gave up for adoption; Sandy (Jennifer Aniston) is a divorced mother whose husband (Timothy Olyphant) has just remarried; and Jesse (Kate Hudson) and her sister (Sarah Chalke) are about to introduce their narrow-minded mother (Margo Martindale) to their controversial partners.The third installment in Gary Marshall's forgettable sabbatical series, Mother's Day may follow the same sappy multi-love story narrative as its predecessors, but it differs because it arrogantly believes that schmaltz can eradicate intolerance.Besides, why make a million-dollar movie for Mother's Day when a phone call home would've sufficed?

		<shortDescription>Predictable but not cheesy. That is a hard thing to pull off, and a very good final movie for Garry Marshall.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We're not who the world thinks we are. We decide who we are, when we want and who we want to know." Being a mother is hard. Just ask Sandy (Aniston) who's ex just got remarried to someone much much younger. Jesse (Hudson) who is trying to hide the man she married from her racist mother. Kristin, who has issues keeping her from marrying the father of her child and Bradley, a single widow who is trying to me mom and dad. When Mother's Day comes around everyone handles things differently. This is actually a very funny and sweet movie. Being a guy I wasn't all that excited about watching this, but I sat down with my daughters and we watched it together. I have to admit I did like this much more than I expected to. Yes, it is girly, but there are some pretty funny parts in this that made me laugh. Perhaps the best thing about this movie though is that, even though it is pretty predictable, it is not overly sappy and cheesy. That actually made it easier to watch and I actually do recommend this for a movie couples can watch together without one of you cringing too much. Overall, predictable but not cheesy. That is a hard thing to pull off, and a very good final movie for Garry Marshall. I like this. I surprisingly give this a B+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kinda cute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mothers Day (2016) is the third Garry Marshall holiday film. It's not as good as Valentines Day or New Years Eve, but it is kinda cute. Jennifer Aniston is very good here, I really liked her in this, she is well acted, funny, looks great for 48, and has good chemistry with Timothy Olaphant, who plays her ex husband. Julia Roberts is nice here too, she has a well written character and definitely has the deepest character development, her background story is very well articulated. Kate Hudson is pretty funny and entertaining too, she isn't like the greatest here, but is pretty good, she suffices. The cast has good natural chemistry with each other. And there are many humorous situations that the plot gets the characters in. There are some parts in the film that drag a bit, but thankfully, they aren't like rampant throughout. Jason Sudeikus is alright here, not the greatest I've seen from him, but he's not bad by any means. Jennifer garner does make a very very brief cameo in here, which is nice, I like to see her even if it is small. Margo, Kate's mother is awesome here, her character is hilarious and I love her lines, they can be offensive, but it's all played for humor. In short, Mother's Day has its moments of good homur, sweet warm hearted moments, but it is not as good as Valentine's Day or New Year's Eve, which are the previous 2 Garry Marshall holiday movies. I give Mother's Day a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the quality of this genre you would expect but decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as the "chick flick" goes, I love Garry Marshall. The man is a master of story telling, fun adventures and romance. He has done some of the most influential and classic films of the last couple of decades. His last batch have all been this "holiday" based ensemble cast romances (which my wife loves) and so far they have been pretty darn good. Mother's Day felt like a step down. It isn't a bad film but considering some of the cast and the potential and seeing as this genre of film has been well played out before, this feels rushed and forced without a lot of depth to the characters. The dialog is dry and the pacing a little slow and most of all the film is lacking chemistry between the characters. I would even go so far as to say it's almost non-existent. You're watching this movie strictly to see the stars doing a little cameo in different scenes. Mother's Day is completely forgettable and that's not right for a Marshall film let alone being in this series of multi-stories- interconnected films he's done.There are a few familiar A minus Hollywood stars in the film. Certainly recognizable faces and we've seen them in decent comedies before but they are completely under utilized. I can't even say I really "liked" a certain story or character because there is just no depth. Still if you're avid fans of any of the stars you may at last enjoy their blase moments. I don't necessarily blame them as actors but rather the rushed story and probably lacklustre effort on their part. Jennifer Aniston tries at times but the script gives her very little to work on. Timothy Olyphant is completely underused as her ex-husband. Julia Roberts probably gives Garry Marshall a performance as a favour and she adds not much more than the star-face. Jason Sudeikis has an okay role but again underused especially when he and Aniston have chemistry and have been in a good comedy before. Hector Elizondo and Larry Miller make their obligatory Marshall cameos. The kids in the film including Caleb Brown and Brandon Spink are decent as well. But this is the issue with Mother's Day. Everyone is decent and present but it is so excruciatingly average in every way that you'll forget about it as soon as the credits wrap.Garry Marshall is a living legend not unlike the late great John Hughes who made mainstream films with incredible characters and story that were so memorable. So what happened here? Well you have an insane amount of co-writers (7 people who had hands in the pot of the story) You revolve it around Mother's Day and yet has no real connection to mother's day. You use some very tired and overused story lines and it's so vapid and emotionless that it's almost hard to watch. Literally the film rests entirely on it's star power and makes it watchable based on that. A few relatively funny lines and overall it's not even a great date movie but I guess it has to be watched considering the cast and director. I can absolutely agree with the critics on this one. Avoidable at best! 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't forget her. Oh wait too late.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My review of Mother's Day (spoiler free)** (2/5)Cast: Jennifer Anniston, Kate Hudson, Julia Roberts with Jason Sudeikis and Timothy Olyphant.Plot: Three generations come together in the week leading up to Mother's Day. Films about international holidays that take a comedic edge don't go down well just like Christmas with the Coopers (2015), and this is joining them. Just like all those other films about holidays, this one isn't funny even slightly and also, no story-line what so ever and when it comes to the characters there is no development. Writer/Director Garry Marshall who is also known for many TV comedies like Mork &amp; Mindy (1978-82) decides to just write the funny lines in this movie but doesn't bother to do any actual story, which is needed in a comedy it's like the core ingredient. Coincidentally this is the fifth film with Anniston and Sudeikis all comedies they are usually a duo that work well together except in this it feels like their characters were rushed. Anniston plays a character called Sandy a mother of two who through the entirety of the film it feels like she is missing something, after being divorced and swapped for a more younger and sexier woman by ex-husband Henry (Olyphant), and then ditched by her two boys who love the younger woman more. Anniston's character is very interesting because she just feels lonely and she makes you feels sorry for her. Jason Sudeikis plays Bradley who is same ball-pit as Sandy he is a father of two but after the recent death of his wife he is trying to find someone new you get the whole story already and that is pretty the entire film well apart from some other bits. Even with an appearance from British Comedian Jack Whitehall as Zack who coincidentally plays a comedian in the film, it still doesn't make this any better.Here are some points as to why this comedy should be avoided:No story: All this film is trying to get through is celebrate the most important person in your life but it actually takes ages for it to get to that day, and once it does it is just as equally disappointing as the other days. The story is supposed to say through the entire film "don't forget her", that point wasn't clear as I said there is no story, Garry Marshall should just go back to TV because that is what he's good at and not this. Not Funny: The film's initial genre specifically says it is a comedy but it doesn't feel like one because it just isn't funny. Even Jack Whitehall who is known for comedy doesn't this a funny experience. To be fair it doesn't feel like a drama either and really this just seems a film that shouldn't have been done just like those other films about holidays.The one good thing about this film is the use of a soliloquy which is basically taking on your own without anybody else hearing you. Now these soliloquy's are said by Sandy (Anniston) and they are unique in film like this as I can recall I think there has only been one other comedy that has done that, and that is The Big Short (2015). The bad thing about the soliloquy in this is that it doesn't get the point across which is what they are made to do.In conclusion try to forget this even exists and well it will probably flop just like Christmas with the Coopers, did and it turns out you don't need to watch a film to know that you do need to celebrate the most important thing in your life.Verdict: Rushed, no story and the whole experience is just one that could have been missed. It's already gone but every year don't forget your mother you don't need a film to know that.4/10 Poor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2 Hour Sit-Com</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Mother's Day", starring Jennifer Aniston-The Horrible Bosses movies, We're the Millers; Kate Hudson-Rock the Kasbah, The Skeleton Key; Jason Sudeikis-The Horrible Bosses movies, We're the Millers; Britt Robertson-The Longest Ride, Life Unexpected_tv and Julia Roberts- Valentine's Day, Notting Hill.This is a comedy directed by Garry Marshall-New Year's Eve, Valentine's Day, Pretty Woman. I get the feeling that he likes holiday themes for his movies. Anyway, here he uses a big ensemble cast to tell interconnected stories that have ties to Mother's Day. Jennifer is recently divorced and dealing with her ex-husband and their kids. Kate is in a mixed marriage-he is an Indian, from India, not the native American kind-and has not told her parents, who are coming in for a visit. Jason has just lost his wife in the military and has 2 daughters to raise by himself. Britt is an orphan that wants to meet her biological mother before she will consider marrying her live-in boyfriend, and Julia just happens to be the biological mother that is being searched for. Most of the rest of the cast are recognizable stars; I remember seeing Jon Lovitz, Jennifer Garner, Larry Miller, Robert Pine, Sarah Chalk, Hector Elizondo and Timothy Olyphant. It's not a bad movie, just kind of mediocre. It just reminded me of an extended 2 hour episode of a TV sitcom. There are some out takes shown, just as the end credits start and one quick one at the very end. It's rated "PG-13" for language and some suggestive material and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 58 minutes. I don't think I would buy it on DVD but it would be all right, as a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Contemporary Mother's Day Treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie hits all the emotional buttons of contemporary mothers everywhere. In some ways, perhaps too well. This is like an updated, saccharine Mother Knows Best, like the 50s television series Father Knows Best but in a great way. For Millenials, however, this movie might be too tame and for older men, this movie might be like watching some unrelatable foreign movie. See the almost unbelievable division of IMDb ratings for this movie.For the rest of us, this movie reveals much of what most Americans experience but hide and avoid talking or feeling about. Garry Marshall has once again created fabulous comedy-drama that somehow with all the multitudinous characters the story lines remain intelligible and entertaining. This movie taps into and reveals many of the hidden difficulties of being both a female and a mother and acknowledges their wonderful and vital contribution to humanity. By tapping into the female psyche and offering a mainstream audience a view of a "politically correct" or better yet, a more realistic but morality lesson, Mothers Day is a tribute to better, quality movies so sorely under-rated by the male film industry and those that can't comprehend what this movie is really about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nonviolent, nice friendly movie. Energetic throughout the whole film, grabbing your attention with an A+ cast. Gives the mixed family life a reality check, from the new age mom played by Shay Mitchell to the normal average mom played by Jennifer Aniston From the mom who is career minded and has no time to slow down to the mom scared about life because that career minded mother was never there. This film will be an instant classic and a must watch film every year. Just like Pretty Woman,You've Got Mail, Forrest Gump this will be added as a REAL life films. A film to bring the common descent American family back to the big screen. From learning to understand life is never just normal, but how to act normal in that life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gary Marshall , well known Director , especially for Pretty woman, directed movie Mother's Day. Some of my favorite actresses, Julia Roberts as Miranda, Jennifer Aniston as Sandy, Kate Hudson as Jess, Sarah Chalke as Gabi ( loved her in Scrubs)and newcomers for me Shay Mitchell as Tina (Pretty Little liars, Glee), Britt Robertson as Kristin( from movie Cake) got together in this simple movie about mothers. Mothers are kind , nice and possessive. Jennifer Aniston did extremely well with her emotions and showed how difficult it is to let go the father of her kids and on top of that share the kids with their new, young mother Shay Mitchell. Not all new mothers are mean and Shay Mitchell is kind, loving and caring and knows exactly who to call when there is a kids' crisis. I enjoyed the movie Pretty woman a lot and am sure all who enjoyed that movie as much as I did, understand the reference to fork and salad from Hector Elizando as Lance Wallace to Julia Roberts. Julia Roberts as Miranda is sincere and as usual perfect. Margo Martindale(from August Osage county) as Fio , mother of daughter Jess ( married to dark skinned Indian male physician)and daughter Gabi (married to wife Max ,actress Cameron Esposito)is initially upset and then accepts because mothers are naturally forgiving and look past everything done by their biological children. very pleasant movie. Not Oscar caliber but definitely a pleasure to watch. Loved Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts, Kate Hudson, Sarah Chalke, Britt Robertson and Shay Mitchell.</fullReview>

If you watch in US the movie can help to recall lifestyle millions of Americans were enjoying before last market collapse, and achieve it together again. This movie was just like few of last fiction books I've red. That could be like a food for positivity in case of lost relationships or simply if you want to get over something girlfriend, boyfriend, job or period of your life such as if you been living in another city.

		<fullReview>It seems as though a lot of people went into this movie expecting Shakespeare. This movie did what it was supposed to do, made me laugh. Does the movie have some camp, yes, but with any movie intended to be watched with your mother in the room it will be a bit campy. With all the bad reviews you would think no one can appreciate a simple, clean, family comedy without tits, drunkenness, teenage sex or cussing. Now I for one am a big fan of all those things and enjoy them quite extensively in other movies. However this movie was exactly what it should have been, cute, quirky, obvious jokes, with a bit of family values and mom appreciation added to round it all out. Throw in a big helping of respect for a single dad and you have a great movie. Is it a 10, no, is it a 5 that it is sitting at, not even close. If you are looking for National Lampoon or Broken Lizard you will be severely disappointed, if however you want a movie you can laugh at, feel good about and enjoy with your mom, this is every bit the 7 I gave it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mothers and their responsibilities despite struggling through.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard Garry Marshall has died a couple of weeks ago, so I decided to watch it rather sooner. He was a good director, one of the rare kind to focus on the women subjects and multi-starrer. I loved films such as 'Overboard', 'Valentine's Day', 'Pretty Woman', 'Frankie and Johnny' and many more. His films definitely not for everyone, but certain kinds of viewers would enjoy them and so did I.This is the final movie in the Special Day trilogy. I certainly adored 'Valentine's Day', but the next film 'New Year's Eve' was pretty bad and this third film comes between those two. The story was okay, but nothing looked seriously compelling. The best parts were the actors, theirs present and performances makes it watchable. What Jason Sudeikis is doing in the 'Mother's Day' poster is the first thing I wanted to be answered.The story opens a week or so early to the mother's day and focuses on the various mothers who are all has connections somewhere. Being the mother and their responsibilities were this film's purpose. Though I anticipated a bit emotional or the strong message, but it ended as an ordinary film. Surely a decent timepass film, but it had its chances to be a better one and it never untilised that opportunity well. A few people might like it, but most won't. Overall a feel good film, despite whatever your rating going to be at the end of the watch.6/10</fullReview>

However, it was an easy watch and i saw my fantasy land. The wig was funny and was the most memorable thing. The acting was OK but lacked at times, usually with Kate Hudson. The plot was rushed and very fake at times and it made me sad as i wanted more. Some sad moments and some laughs. It was made as a chick flick and usually chick flicks are underrated. My brother found it boring, but i liked it and want it on DVD. At the end of the day it is up to the individual if they like it or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>10 June 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Mothers Day. From the same stable as Valentines Day and New Years Eve, this film is an extension of the previous two. Easy to watch, a laugh here and there, especially in the outtake section during the credits, and totally inoffensive. This is the tale of several families and how they are coping with the impending Mother's Day holiday. As in the previously mentioned films there is a tenuous link between all our characters which developed as the film progressed. A few famous faces to be seen, not least Jennifer Aniston, who to me was portraying Rachel from Friends, all grown up, Mother to her two sons, living in the burbs but still the same old Rachel we know and love. Julia Roberts plays a career woman, who has no real time for anyone, and Jack Whitehall.......pretty much plays himself and very refreshingly too. With children and parents disconnected, secrets being revealed and some slapstick humour Mother's Day was a very pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. A little trivia, apparently all three of Julia Robert's children appear in this film and Hector Elizondo has appeared in 18 of Frank Marshall's films, he is credited at the end of the film......and as always, Hector Elizondo (source IMDb website)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "comfortable shoe" of a romcom, sweet and funny; fans will enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Mother's Day is nearing, some folks don't feel like celebrating. First, Sandy (Jennifer Aniston) is a divorcée with two young sons. Her ex, Henry (Timothy Olyphant) has been extra friendly lately and asks to speak to her privately later in the day. She thinks maybe he wants to get back together, but, no, he wants to break the news that he has re-married. Horrors, she's very young. Then, Jesse (Kate Hudson) is happily married to a doctor of Hindi heritage but, she's never informed her Mother and Dad, who live three states away. That's because Ma and Pa have some prejudices. Jesse's sister (Sarah Chalke) has also not broken the news that she is gay and has a lady partner. Wouldn't you know, the parents show up just before Mother's Day! Meanwhile, Kristin (Britt Robertson) is in a longtime relationship with her beau, Zack (Jack Whitehall), with a little girl, but because she is adopted she is reluctant to get married. Zack wants an answer now. Widower Bradley (Jason Sudeikis) is a struggling parent to two daughters and he doesn't feel like celebrating M Day at all; his children may need it. Finally, a star of the Home Shopping Network, Miranda (Julia Roberts) has faithful assistant (Hector Elizondo) arranging her book signings &amp; autograph events; she's too busy for a personal life. But, there may be a secret of her past that will come to light soon and turn it upside down. In summary, will anyone really celebrate M Day in happiness and peace? This very pleasant, "comfortable shoe" romcom is the third addition to a series by Garry Marshall. Its not a heavyweight in the world of romantic comedy but fans of the genre will like it. It has some funny moments along with the tear-jerking scenes. The cast, extremely large, does nice work. Then, too, the sets, costumes, script and direction are quite fine though the tale is somewhat predictable. All in all, those who wait months for a new romcom should not let this one slip on by.</fullReview>

It's a feel good movie and I know some people need more than that, but it's definitely a movie that almost everyone will enjoy. The plot is very realistic and it draws you into it. You feel with the characters and understand more the difficult situations many mothers or fathers have to live through. The acting is great, especially Jennifer Aniston. I've been a little disappointed in her in some of her movies in the near past ( horrible bosses 2) but I'm impressed with this one. She plays her role impeccably. Well done Jen! All in all, I really enjoyed it and so did my friend. I can see that it can be classified as a chick flick but it's one of the best chick flicks I've seen the past year.

I had seen one or two previews for this film and thought, "Huh, looks like another 'Valentines Day' or 'New Years Eve.' I always like when a bunch of stories intertwine some way. Well, I was gravely mistaken. This film is one of the worst I've seen in a while. I saw this a week after Mother's Day so our theater had maybe seven people in it (I'm shocked that even that many turned up to this train wreck). I'm so glad my theater had a BOGO deal on tickets for the movie otherwise I would have had to pay $18 for my mother and I to be so utterly disappointed. Come to think of it, maybe since the film was so bad, that's why they did the BOGO, to get more people to see it.Now, the film. I'm so disappointed that some of my favorite actors and actresses were in this movie. The writing was lazy and forced. Very very VERY cliché too. Married couple divorces that then the guy gets with a much younger woman. YAWN. How many times have we seen that?? Countless.The scenes themselves were maybe two minutes or less. Very short and discombobulated. I'd describe this film as though you're flipping channels on TV and tuning in to three different programs at different parts. That's how unorganized this film was. We'd go from a dramatic scene with a young boy being rushed to a hospital for an asthma attack to Jason Sudekis rapping on a balcony. Like I said before, it's like I was channel surfing. The only plot line that kind of had some meaning to it was with Julia Roberts and her daughter. But even that felt quick and underdeveloped. Overall, I think this film really did have potential to be a feel good movie that could have allowed us to turn to our moms and said, "Aw, I love you, mom." But this film lacked any sort of compassion and just aimed to get laughs, which were very weak. I barely cracked a smile at anything throughout the film. And don't even get me started on the Kate Hudson story line. Way too dramatized and slightly unrealistic and not funny. This film would have been better off not being released in theaters and just going straight to DVD or Netflix, or not at all. Maybe read the script out loud before making it a done deal so you can see how forced and uncomfortably awkward the dialogue was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect Mother's Day gift if you hate your mother</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this was worse than I had expected. A movie about Mother's Day should invoke feelings of love and gratitude towards mothers and show a strong bond. Sadly, this movie did neither or rather the attempt towards showcasing that was pretty horrible.The movie was completely incoherent with a bunch of different stories thrown in the mix with neither regard for any logic nor an effort to make the audience feel anything for the characters. The pace of the movie was haphazard and there was no flow. There were abrupt ending to scenes or the scenes following didn't make any sense.In addition, the movie makers probably asked each one of the actors (except a couple of them maybe) to showcase the worst acting of their careers. I would recommend completely skipping this train wreck even when it comes out on DVD or Netflix.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HUGE disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want my $11.00 back, plus popcorn and drink. Seriously!?!? what happened???? The actors in this are in my top ten favorites to see at the theater so when I got ready to see this movie with my BFF (both of us Moms)---I had no idea that both of us wanted to walk out of the theater. I really kept waiting and waiting for this to get better and sadly it never did. Kudos for the actors trying to take a script and make the best of it. I'm really not that picky of a movie goer and don't go by reviews to make my decisions but this was such a flop.The only thing good about my evening at the movies is spending time with my chick flick BFF and the extra $$ that we donated to our local charity when we bought our tickets.Don't even see it on DVD-Netflix or any other downloadable place. It will be 2 hours that you will never get back :(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Mother's Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love my mom more than anything else in the world. But come on, do we really a need two-hour movie about May's most popular holiday? Director Garry Marshall sure thinks so. I mean, he has to complete his almighty trilogy of all things festive. With 2010's Valentine's Day, 2011's New Year's Eve, and now Mother's Day (my latest review), Marshall has become the second-tier version of a mawkish Robert Altman. Lately, he has been juggling multiple story lines, huge casts, and lots of defunct coincidences. His films are clearly the equivalent of birthday cake. They are nutrition-free, they are full of sugary sweet moments, they are fluffy, and they are kinda confetti-like. Channeling his weird side at age 81, Garry Marshall has sort of lost touch. He hasn't been as sharp as when he did Pretty Woman and/or Frankie and Johnny (and that was a long time ago). Regardless, his Mother's Day is pretty much harmless if you can get past the sight of a womb parade float, Jason Sudeikis singing "The Humpty Dance" (to a bunch of pre-teen girls), and Jennifer Aniston walking around near some young tykes in nothing but a towel. Would I recommend taking your mother to see "Day"? It wouldn't be a crime but you have been warned.Taking place in Atlanta, GA (what flick doesn't take place in "Hotlanta" these days) and co-starring Marshall's "lucky charm" of an actor (Hector Elizondo), "Day" feels like a Garry Marshall endeavor literally a couple minutes in. You can easily tell by the first musical score note and the compulsory opening credits. The story follows five to six different people as they iron out their relationship conflicts a couple days before the second Sunday in May. Sandy Newhouse (played by Jennifer Aniston) is a divorced mother of two. She shares custody of her two kids with Henry (Timothy Olyphant). Henry just got remarried to a twentysomething named Tiny (Shay Mitchell). Obviously, Sandy is a little miffed by the condition. Then there's Jesse (Kate Hudson). She is married to a doctor (Russell played by Aasif Mandvi) but is reluctant to introduce him to her parents because they are a bit racially challenged. You also have restaurant worker Kristin (Tomorrowland's Britt Robertson). She has a child and is unmarried. She holds back on tying the knot because she never knew who her real mother was (boo-hoo). Finally, we have Miranda Collins (Julia Roberts). She's a successful writer and I guess, sells stuff on a fictional home shopping network. She has a daughter but gave her up for adoption years ago. I think you can guess how Kristin and Miranda's dots will connect.Now everyone in Mother's Day seems to conveniently run into each other. Aniston overacts, Sudeikis (as mentioned earlier) is manipulatively closed off, and Larry Miller (a Marshall regular) makes a thankless cameo. It's almost fictitious the way the trouper's paths cross. They are mercilessly connected by a ridiculous amount of kismet. In verity, I felt like I was watching an episode of The O.C. The only difference being that the events were less tidy and much less entertaining.With haphazard acting (minus the Julia Roberts performance which feels like a slight revelation), a few laughs, and background music deeming Mother's Day to be less than dramatic, Garry Marshall is clearly on holiday here (no pun intended). The adult situations involving the main characters, are resolved quickly and predictably. Added to that, the outtakes at the end are a tired combination of bonus scenes and bloopers. Is Marshall gonna keep making movies about kaleidoscopic, celebration fare? I can't stop him. However, if Independence Day, Columbus Day, Sweetest Day, or Yom Kippur make their plights to the silver screen, I sure won't be buying a ticket. Rating: 2 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every cliché' possible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Garry Marshall has hit on every Hollywood cliché' possible without generating a single laugh. He covered gay marriage, interracial relationships, younger bride/older husband, wacky parents, overweight all knowing black woman for comic relief, wiser than their years kids, kid with asthma, widower with coming of age daughters, etc. etc. in fact the only couple of the same race and approximate age group, what most would describe as mainstream, are the only divorced couple, and he does it all without a hint of originality or humor. This may be in the running for worst movie of the year, perhaps decade were it not for the Coen Brothers stink fest "Hail, Caesar"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mother's Day" is the latest - full of Hollywood stars - comedy from director Garry Marshall, and if you have seen his previous films ("Pretty Woman," "Valentine's Day"...) you know what to expect. Unfortunately, the drama is lightweight to go along with the comedy that produces some laughs. Many skilled actresses - led by Jennifer Aniston, Kate Hudson, and Julia Roberts - come together for this predictable but entertaining comedy about motherhood. But there's so much going on that there's no time to build characters that make any sort of meaningful relationships. In a few words "Mother's Day" is not a tribute to mothers, but besides all this bad reviews about the movie, I think is a good choice for a "feel good" evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-Mother's Day is a 2016 American romantic comedy film directed by Garry Marshall and written by Tom Hines, Lily Hollander, Anya Kochoff-Romano and Matt Walker. The film stars an ensemble cast, led by Jennifer Aniston, Kate Hudson, Julia Roberts and Jason Sudeikis, and featuring Timothy Olyphant, Margo Martindale, Shay Mitchell, Britt Robertson, Héctor Elizondo, Jack Whitehall and Jon Lovitz. Filming began on August 18, 2015 in Atlanta, Georgia. It was released in the United States on April 29, 2016 by Open Road Films.-The film is similar to Marshall's previous two ensemble romantic comedies, Valentine's Day (2010) and New Year's Eve (2011).--Critical response: -Mother's Day has been panned by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 9%, based on 79 reviews, with an average rating of 2.9/10. The site's consensus reads, "Arguably well-intended yet thoroughly misguided, Mother's Day is the cinematic equivalent of a last-minute gift that only underscores its embarrassing lack of effort." On Metacritic the film has a score of 17 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating "overwhelming dislike". On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.-Richard Roeper gave the film zero out of four stars, saying, "...nothing could have prepared us for the offensively stupid, shamelessly manipulative, ridiculously predictable and hopelessly dated crapfest that is Mother's Day."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No candy for mommy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel like I have to apologize that I went to see that movie. But it was raining like crazy and I decided to wait it out and see a movie before facing the floods in the roads. I have not seen a movie with Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts and Kate Hudson and I was surprised how ordinary all of them looked. There are plenty of more beautiful and interesting looking women everywhere I go. So the casting person did the right thing when they gave Kate Hudson rather ordinary parents and an Indian doctor as a husband who did not look very Bollywood. Roberts' wig did nothing for her and the daughter she acquired in that movie looked like somebody else's child. I never liked Pretty Woman and the new combination of Roberts and the director Marshall was even worse. So I have seen Roberts in a movie before... The second surprise was that one of the so-called funny moments in the movie was a very tired scene where a candy bar got stuck in a vending machine. The same thing was used in another movie I recently saw where the whole movie revolved around the stuck candy bar: Demolition. Screenwriters must be on an unhealthy diet ........ And so must be the character Jennifer Aniston played, she acted like a nut case. The movie was filled with one stupid cliché after the other. Divorced husband going for younger woman, parents not accepting partner with different skin color or gender, successful business woman giving up child for adoption, lonely widower not wanting to date.None of the characters felt real or relatable. It certainly was no feel-good movie , no mother should be subjected to this soap opera. I may have been the target audience and for once they got me, usually my built-in chick-flick detector prevents me to see these kind of movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better suited to the Hallmark Channel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went to a screening last night and kept checking my watch, hoping the movie was finally over. It's nearly two, very long hours. The film is so weak that I cannot help but wonder who in their right mind green-lighted this thing? There are so many stories going on in the flick that there is zero character development and all remain cardboard cutouts at best. Even Margo Martindale, a favorite of mine, failed to amuse me. As for Aniston and Hudson, they could really benefit from acting lessons. The crowd at the screening laughed only a couple of times, and not every seat was filled for this free showing. That's a bad sign for a movie. Save your money - this should be headed to the Hallmark Channel momentarily.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Connections. Hollywood is all about connections ? connections among actors and filmmakers, connections among the characters in a film's story and, hopefully, a finished film connecting with its audience. The comedy-drama "Mother's Day" (PG-13, 1:58) is a good example of all those kinds of connections. Director Garry Marshall's sister and fellow director, Penny, provides the film's opening narration and several of their relatives appear briefly in the film. This is the third "Special Day" ensemble comedy Garry Marshall has directed in less than a decade (after 2010's "Valentine's Day" and 2011's "New Year's Eve"). This movie co-stars Julia Roberts, whom Marshall previously directed in "Pretty Woman" (1990) and "Runaway Bride" (1999) and whose three children (Hazel, Phinneas and Henry) appear in this film. One of the character actors in "Mother's Day" is Hector Elizondo, who appeared in all 18 movies Marshall directed through 2016! Apart from the Garry Marshall connections, this is also the second time that Jennifer Aniston and Britt Robertson have been in the same film (after 2014's "Cake"), while characters played by Aniston and Jason Sudeikis make a romantic connection in this film, as their characters did in "We're the Millers" (2013) ? and this one is their fifth film together! Connections.Like Marshall's previous two films, this one explores several different story lines, but the characters' stories in "Mother's Day" are more closely intertwined. Jesse (Kate Hudson) and Gabi (Sarah Chalke) are adult sisters who live next door to each other in suburban Atlanta and are both trying to hide the facts of their long-term relationships from their old-fashioned and closed-minded Texas mom and dad (Margo Martindale and Robert Pine). Jesse's parents strongly disapproved of her former boyfriend Russell (Aasif Mandvi) because he's from India, so Jesse told her parents that they broke up, and then married Russell. Gabi has told her parents that she's engaged to someone named Steve, while she's actually married to Max (Cameron Esposito), her female life-partner. Gabi talks to her parents on Skype, but Jesse tries to avoid talking to them altogether. The old folks would be shocked if they ever learned about either of their daughters' marriages ? let alone both ? especially if the revelations happened at the same time! Meanwhile, Sandy (Jennifer Aniston) is trying to cope with her divorce from Henry (Timothy Olyphant), his long-term relationship with the much younger Tina (Shay Mitchell, one of the few newbie adults in the cast) and how all this affects her relationship with her sons (Brandon Spink and Caleb Brown). At some of her more frustrated moments, Sandy keeps running into Bradley (Jason Sudeikis), the owner of a local gym who is still mourning the recent death of his Marine officer wife (Jennifer Garner) while doing his best to raise their tween daughters (Jessi Case and Ella Anderson). Sandy is friends with Jesse, through whom she meets Kristin (Britt Robertson) who has had a baby with Zack (Jack Whitehall), her live-in boyfriend and aspiring stand-up comedian (who's trying to impress a club owner played by Jon Lovitz), but she's hesitant to commit to marrying Zack due to abandonment issues stemming from her adoption as an infant. Sandy, by the way, is an interior designer, who is planning on proposing a new look for the studio set of Home Shopping Network maven Miranda (Julia Roberts, with Hector Elizondo playing her manager), but Miranda is occupied with her busy schedule ? and mommy issues of her own."Mother's Day" is a relatable but lackluster portrait of modern motherhood. Most Movie Fans will see themselves in at least one of the situations portrayed on screen, although the cast is strangely lacking in diversity. Screenwriters Tom Hines, Lilly Hollander and Anya Kochoff and Matthew Walker, who, as a group, have written an average of 1.25 produced screenplays each (including this one), do a good job of telling a variety of stories and weaving them together, but offer up relatively few laughs for a comedy. The film also features a subplot involving a wild Mother's Day parade float which would never be allowed in a Mother's Day parade (if there even were such a thing) and highly unlikely endings to some of the film's other plots and subplots.Although the major characters are fully-drawn and well-performed, the minor characters come off more like one-dimensional caricatures. This film tries to do a little too much in its plotting, tries too hard to reach certain moments in its script and goes out of its way to marginalize characters who think differently about modern motherhood. It doesn't even do a good job at celebrating the holiday of its title, which is something else connecting this film with its immediate predecessors. So? why do so many big-name stars want to work with Marshall? What? Other the fact that he's a legend in the entertainment business? "Happy Days" and "Laverne &amp; Shirley" and "Mork &amp; Mindy" and all those fun films from the 1990s and early 2000s? C'mon! All I'd be asking is "Who do I have to kill?" Just killing. I meant kidding! Kidddding! Kidding.I started this review by talking about connections, so let's finish with a few more. All three of Garry Marshall's "Special Day" movies have earned less than 20% positive reviews from critics and less than 55% from audiences on RottenTomatoes.com, while all three currently have an IMDb.com rating in the 5.0 ? 5.9 range (out of 10). On the other hand, "Valentine's Day" and "New Year's Eve" each more than quadrupled its budget when domestic and overseas box office numbers are combined. Whether or not "Mother's Day" carries that connection forward, and even though I enjoyed some stories, moments, and characters in the film, I can't quite recommend it. "C"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlong, Pretentious, Unfunny, Pointless Holiday Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mothers Day is a pretentiously overlong holiday movie that feels like it was made by aliens. Garry Marshall's third holiday movie is one of the most inept and pointless movies of this year. Why in the world did they think the concept of Mother's Day would be a good idea? If you can be creative about it, it might have worked, but instead we get a horrendously offensive comedy that has no originality whatsoever.I can't even remember any of the plot of this movie because they focus way too little and way too much on one plot to another. Kate Hudson's plot is skipped over completely until the last thirty minutes, Jennifer Aniston's plot is focused on way too much, the Julia Roberts plot is a pointless infomercial to sell Mood Pendants and the Jason Sudeikis plot is about a guy who can't stop mourning his dead wife who got shot in the head by terrorists or something.That tells you how entertaining this movie is.The acting feels unnatural and not human. Jennifer Aniston goes on rants and talks to herself like she is in a mental ward, Sudeikis being dramatic falls flat. Everyone else feels tired and dopey. Their comedic bits are what kill the movie.The comedy involves a lot of offensively unfunny things. Racial Minorities being treated by police like animals, candy getting stuck in vending machines, someone falling of a balcony and getting their foot broken and to top it all off with a overdone asthma attack that takes them to the Emergency Room. Because that's funny. Having an asthma attack on a family holiday.Very rarely did I ever get a laugh out of this movie. The funniest thing is when Kate Hudson's parents show up and find out shes married. That is the comedic highlight of the movie people.Mother's Day is also way too long. Clocking in at nearly two hours, the film should have been 86 minutes long. But instead the plot(s) drag out way too long and make everything boring and frustrating to watch. The only target audience this movie will please is seniors because it's safe and non risk taking. Mother's Day the horror movie is probably five times better than this Mother's Day.If you're wanting to see something new this week, Watch Keanu or Ratchet and Clank, those two movies at least aren't under 30 on Metacritic. This movie is a sharp pain that I wish would end and I thought it never would.26/100 D</fullReview>
