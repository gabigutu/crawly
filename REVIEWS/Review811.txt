		<shortDescription>If you love Kurt &amp; Nirvana like I do.... Please pass on this crap.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Money is a necessary evil, this I understand. However, when it involves one of the most iconic and loved artists of the 90's, a line should be drawn. This was 2 hours of drawings and video footage that were not donated to this documentary, they were sold by Courtney and his family. The overall direction they took with this film puzzles me. At the time Mr. Cobain was exactly what the music industry needed.... a voice for the different, the young and confused. They never came close to expanding on any of that. Instead, they went with "unruly-child- with-a-drug-habit".Really? 'cause that only describes a few rock stars childhoods from the last 50 years right. Our society always looks for flaws to exploit, even in death. When they should be celebrating what the dead accomplished. Where was Dave Grohl? Not only was he one of Kurts best friends but he was also 33% of the friggin band. If he had the smarts to stay away from this mess, so should we. This review is just my opinion. I have heard and seen everything about Kurt n Nirvana and encourage you to judge for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of an Overview</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure why this is being touted as "the definitive documentary" on Kurdt's life. It basically skims over most of the important events which can be found in more detail in Heavier Than Heaven. Several key players in his life are left out of this documentary completely. There are some unseen videos of him as a small child, but the concert footage is mostly stuff that can be found on previously released Nirvana DVDs. There's also a big deal made of showing us his journals, but his journals were already published in 2002. And then there's Courtney Love. She isn't mentioned at all until halfway through the documentary, but after that point, she shares most of Kurt's screen time. There are several home videos of them goofing around and being silly together and playing with Frances, which gives the impression that their entire relationship was a bed of roses, even though most of those close to the couple have said the opposite over the years. The only hint this documentary gives of their marital troubles is toward the end when Courtney says Kurt killed himself because she *considered* cheating on him (she doesn't admit to actually doing it). The other big problem here is Kurt's parents. I've never much liked them after reading Come As You Are and Heavier Than Heaven and watching this documentary made me really angry at them. It's clear that they agreed to do this not to help shed light on Kurt's life but to save face and try to bury the fact that they screwed up their son's life in a very big way. I mean, they're more than willing to point the finger at each other, such as when Wendy brings up how emotionally abusive Don was to Kurt or Don pointing out that Wendy "couldn't handle" Kurt but they only tear the other down to make themselves look better. Oh and don't even get me started on Don's second wife (Kurt's stepmom) Jenny. She's still maintaining her narrative that Kurt was just a bad boy who acted out for no reason even though she was soooooo nice to him. Funny how the director didn't feel it was necessary to include Leland's (Kurt's grandfather) testimony that after Don married Jenny, he showed preferential treatment to Jenny's kids over Kurt, almost as if he was afraid Jenny would leave him like Wendy had. As for Jenny, I have no doubt that she treated her own kids better than Kurt since they were hers after all. The more I look at it, the more MoH seems like a whitewashing campaign launched by Kurt's family to try to absolve themselves of any responsibility for screwing up their child's formative years. Overall, this is not really an essential documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm disappointed in this movie and the hype surrounding it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am saddened at how so many critics, journalists and fans are irresponsibly throwing around the phase "the definitive documentary" in regards to Kurt Cobain. This film is absolutely not definitive. It offers a very narrow slice of Kurt's life and has little to no focus on his craft, which is the one thing Kurt wanted people to examine more than anything.The title "Montage of Heck", taken from one of Kurt's old mixtapes, is surely a fitting name. The film makes use of several clips from Kurt's home videos, drawings, notebooks, poetry, love letters and more. The editing in these montages is gorgeous and alluring, and there are some animation segments that are absolutely beautiful. Nonetheless, these sections of the film often dragged on too long and felt like they were unnecessarily repetitive, distracting from the narrative instead of serving it and over-selling us on parts of Kurt's mind and inner turmoil which were already very clear.Speaking of narrative, the one story this film tells is a story we already know and understand too well. The film has a single theme only, which is to use personal media graciously offered from the Cobain family to tell the story of a talented, hyper-sensitive tortured soul and drug addict who killed himself, and the cloud of chaos that lead up to that point. There is little to no insight on his art, only the struggles that propelled him to make his art, which are much less interesting because as an audience we are well aware of what negative habits can do to the psyche or physical health, but the real intrigue is what a person creates or does despite those issues. Perhaps that's my opinion, though.The irony here is saddening. This film, somehow managed to spend over 2 hours on highlighting the product of a failed marriage and broken upbringing, drug abuse, Courtney, ridicule and the pressures of press, all of which are the exact same things that ultimately lead to the recluse Kurt became and fed into his tragic suicide. This film somehow managed to become the enemy and mirrored everything Kurt tried to run away from.All that being said, I guess in the spirit of Rock and Roll, there is no real justice. Kurt won't get the movie he deserves, even after his death we seem to continue to focus on the obvious redundant clichés of the dark sides of his life. Although those things are real and an important part of his story, they are indeed only one part. That isn't definitive at all. As Kurt always said, "Just listen to the music, everything I have to say is there". He wasn't lying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense portrayal which relies on source material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 21 years since Kurt Cobain's death by suicide and his status as a legendary alternative rock figure and totem for a disaffected generation has not dimmed in the intervening period.Although I had been eagerly awaiting this documentary, at the same time I approached it with a wariness more than half expecting it to be a depressing encounter. Given what I already knew about the mental difficulties and addiction problems Kurt faced during his short life and the eventual sad outcome it was hard to believe that anything of a positive nature could be wrung from seeing this.This is the first official documentary made about the life of Kurt Cobain. It has been made with the co-operation of his family. His daughter Frances Bean is an executive producer. His parents, sister, wife- Courtney Love, first girlfriend and fellow band member Chris Novoselic (the third band member Dave Grohl is the notable absentee) have all contributed, allowing themselves to be interviewed.The expectation of access to intimate home videos as well as Kurt's own drawings, writing, outpourings etc and other previously unseen footage bringing with it the possibility of gaining a clearer view on Kurt Cobain's life is probably the thing which will entice most viewers to go see this. This heavy reliance on this intimate source material makes for an intense portrayal of the subject. It's also what makes it a success. It's noticeable how often for instance on screen we are shown up-close, his own words in his hand-writing in the original copybook complete with stains and other words and sentences crossed out. It's the closest place the director can bring us, next to occupying Kurt's mind. Much of the writing is angry and nihilistic but there are lots of lists too- of things to do for example; it all suggests a wildly active mind and one not easy to keep a rein on.Home videos himself and Courtney produced, both while pregnant with, and then after Frances Bean was born similarly get us up-close and personal. It's excruciating to watch but compelling too- a couple wrapped up in each other but also in their drug dependency. When Frances Bean is born his love for her is touching but then the videos also reveal the declining health as the heroin addiction spirals. As intense and personal as it is there are no major revelatory insights into the life or death of Kurt Cobain in this documentary. This is not a failing of the documentary as I don't think any revelatory new angles or expositions could have been expected. As well as this the title (taken from the name of a mix-tape Kurt put together) does indicate obfuscation or a lack of clarity or certainty about a picture drawn. So it should be; where a life ends so tragically definitive answers can never be presented and any distillation of his life or death into neat summations is thankfully and rightly avoided. The documentary tells us the following (which in essence we already know or suppose we know). Kurt was an energetic, intelligent child who became withdrawn and angry as he got older, probably owing largely to his parent's divorce. He was often a lone, self-hating teenager who found a release from his angst in smoking pot and then at a certain age he discovered punk music which lit a torch and he began to teach himself guitar and write music. He was disaffected enough and genius enough to write brilliantly disaffected genius songs. His music struck a chord, Nirvana became huge almost overnight and then he struggled with the idea of being held up as a spokesperson for a generation. Desperately insecure, above all else he craved love and a need for rootedness- a family to belong to. He found this with Courtney Love and later their daughter. He sought refuge in them away from what he saw as a hostile world but tragically he also sought refuge in heroin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasted potential due to Director's ego</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hoping for this film to be great. As a Nirvana fan (most people who claim to like Nirvana have no idea what 'Incesticide' or even 'Bleach' is), I was looking forward to a thorough insight into this beloved figure who is still shrouded in a fog of misrepresentation and false hero worship. Unfortunately the film did not live up to expectations as it seemed the Director, "Brett Morgan" was more concerned in making the film aesthetically pleasing than emotionally interesting. First off, a few positives about the film. 1. The way it portrays Courtney Love: She is despised by most music fans who believe she ruined Nirvana, but it's pretty clear that Kurt's self destruction was mostly his doing and his natural tendencies which add an appropriate sense of melancholy to the movie. 2. Some of the montages were nice when not excruciatingly overdone. 3. The music of course was good, it had a wide range from their b-sides (Dive), their first album (Mr. Moustache) and their popular stuff (Territorial Pissings) Including some fascinating covers of the Velvet Underground and the Beatles. 4. The story about Kurt and the "Retarded Girl" was absolutely fascinating. However, the pacing of the film is truly awful. The first hour trudges along after a promising start and becomes bogged down in the Director's own agenda to show off his style. By far the best scenes in the film is just raw footage of Kurt and Courtney living alone in their dingy apartments and hotel rooms. The film is appropriately titled, as the film is almost solely montages that don't progress the story and just serve again to stroke the Director's ego. Another example is the overuse of EXTREMELY LOUD to absolute silence. Also, the ending of the film is not only unsatisfying, but extremely clichéd. There are countless films that have the same end title card and it felt awfully lazy. This is also disappointing because we experience none of the emotional damage that Cobains death has, which would have been far more interesting than 5 minutes of repetitive montages. What's sad is that this film claimed to be the definitive Cobain Doco, but it's so obvious that there is plenty more interesting video and audio recordings made by Cobain HIMSELF that were left out in order to make way for dead end animation montages and hyper editing. The film could have been just as emotionally effective with 20 minutes cut from it. However, I am still at least glad I saw the film, all the less wanky stuff was honestly well directed and Cobain's home video footage is nothing short of riveting and sometimes becomes really funny and beautiful. So I give this film a 6. At the end of the day, I feel it would have been far more interesting just to sort through 3 hours of Cobain's home recordings than to watch a Director trying to steal the limelight from his charismatic subjects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My problem with this movie is that I simply had the wrong expectations. I thought it would be the most comprehensive portrait of Cobain ever made. But no. It's named after Cobain's 1988 mix tape of the same name, and that's exactly what this movie is - a montage. You get to see some very interesting interviews with Cobain's parents, his sister, ex-girlfriend Tracy and Krist Novoselic. These interviews are great, but they're all very short and make up a small part of the entire movie. Which is a shame.Apart from the interviews you get to see a lot home video footage, both from Cobain's childhood and from his last years. Some of it is interesting, other parts (like all the shots of Courtney Love's tits) are just ridiculous. I wanted to get a glimpse of Kurt Cobain's life and personality, not Love's tits.Then you get to see animation, a visualization of Cobain talking to himself on the Montage of Heck tape (I think). They also made animations of drawings that Cobain did in his journals. To accompany these, they included shortened versions of different Nirvana songs. They also scanned text from his journal. Which does not work in a movie. I could barely manage reading the first sentence before it cut to another page.There's also concert footage - from Reading, Live and Loud, Unplugged and other shows that every Nirvana fan has seen before - no doubt, nothing new there.Also, before the movie starts, text on screen is telling viewers to stay in their seats through the credits for en exclusive interview with Brett Morgen. First, I'm thinking - why make us wait through the credits? Why not before? Secondly, the interview is around 15 minutes of Morgen talking about HOW INCREDIBLY GOOD the movie is.Also - why isn't Dave Grohl there? To sum it all up - yeah I had the wrong expectations - but still, the interviews are great, the rest isn't. A. J. Schnack's About a Son is much better in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Courtney Love Approved This Film - 1st Reason to be Skeptical!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an insult to the memory of Mr. Cobain. To even give it the label of documentary is even more insulting! It is a hastily put together montage of carefully crafted and depressing scenes that lead viewers to believe what Ms. Love would like the fans of her late husband to believe.As another reviewer stated it is not "the definitive documentary" of Mr. Cobain. Far from it. Montage of Heck is simply a compilation of regurgitated film footage &amp; a lot of crappy animation. Mr. Morgen should be ashamed of himself!In fact huge parts of Mr. Cobain's life have been summarily left out. The parts that were included were designed to reinforce the story line that he was mentally ill since he was a teenager and has always wanted to kill himself and successfully did so when he was 27. Many can attest to the fact that this was not true! But if you are a person who is just a passing fan of the NIRVANA front man, you would believe exactly what Mr. Morgen portrays in his trashy depiction of this man's life. He takes unconscionable liberties with the video material which he has stated over and over again no one has ever seen before and that he acquired in the recess's of the Cobain vaults. That is just not true.I for one can point to only a few scenes that have not been scene by the public before, primarily his baby years, and yes they were adorable. The rest of the material was lifted from a variety of sources some of which include: The Year Punk Broke &amp; MTV Live &amp; Loud, &amp; MTV Unplugged all footage everyone has seen many many times!Mr. Morgen has stated again in interview after interview that this project took 7 years to see the light of day. I find that terribly hard to believe. If this took 7 years to complete, Mr Morgen should find a new occupation!A major player in Mr. Cobain's life was left on the cutting room floor. Dave Grohl an integral part of not only NIRVANA but a close friend of Mr Cobain's was not included in the film. Yet Mr. Morgen states he did an interview he could not find a proper place in the film to include it because =at the point he was happy with his cut. Smack of a Courtney Love intervention as it is widely know that those two have been quarreling for decades!Morgen takes liberties with Mr Cobain's already published journals, highlighting and animating sections that cater to the overall direction of the film which is essentially to show the general public how depressed and addicted Mr Cobain was at the end of his life. It is a high subjective view and it is one Courtney Love would like people to believe in order to keep people from looking to deeply into the circumstances around her husbands death. For more on that I wold recommend watching "Soaked In Bleach". This movie unlike Montage of Trash is based on actual facts and circumstances not lies and innuendo. I am not trying to pretend here that Mr Cobain was an angel, he wasn't. He had a drug problem, wrestled with the fame he quickly acquired and had a horrendous childhood. But to watch his mother sit there and pontificate about her son who she knows very well, she threw out on a number of different occasions is just sickening. How much was she paid Mr Morgen? What Mr. Cobain deserves is a documentary that includes parts of the terrible film Morgen made but include the whole picture, his adolescence, his early years in forming a band, his time with The Melvins, how he created NIRVANA, the changes the band went through before becoming the band we know today. The film should also explore the circumstances of his death which were, I am sorry to say you nay sayers out there, very very suspect!This movie is designed to pull at the heart strings of people who know little to nothing about Mr, Cobain because certainly those that do know a thing or two about him see this as the propaganda piece that it is. Mr Morgen did this because Courtney asked him to and for the money, period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredibly intimate and emotional portrait of a rock icon.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been more than 20 years since the death of Kurt Cobain, and while there have been numerous documentaries, books, and television programs devoted to telling his story, it's difficult to point to any one account as being the definitive portrait of the Nirvana frontman. But Brett Morgen's fascinating film Cobain: Montage of Heck is more than worthy of that title.Chronicling Cobain's life and career through never-before-seen home videos, sketches, audio recordings and diary entries, Montage of Heck provides an unprecedented look into the mind of one of rock music's most iconic figures. This is the first film to have the full support and cooperation of Cobain's family, and the wealth of material resulting from this partnership is staggering.Most of the journal entries featured in the film have been animated and set to music, providing a unique and frenetic energy that seems to distract the audience from the fact that they're being forced to read in order to keep up with the narrative. Sometimes they're nothing more than a few short words, other times they're entire pages of ideas and song lyrics and scribbles, but they all showcase a mind that functioned with the same sort of reckless abandon with which Cobain played music.But the animation isn't just limited to the words on the pages of Cobain's many journals. Indeed, there are several fully-animated sequences that are combined with recordings of Cobain recounting anecdotes from various periods in his life. These scenes, from animators Hisko Hulsing and Stefan Nadelman, have an almost dreamlike quality, and breathe an incredible amount of life into Cobain's own narration.Montage of Heck is also peppered with interviews, with frequent quotes from Cobain's parents, his first serious girlfriend, former bandmate Krist Novoselic, and even his widow, Courtney Love (conspicuously absent is Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl, who served as the band's drummer for the bulk of their short career). Once again, the cooperation of these individuals provides tremendous insight into the series of events that led Cobain into his downward spiral.But the most emotional material, and certainly the most difficult to watch, is a lengthy segment during the film's second hour devoted to home video footage of Cobain and his wife. We see them holed up in their apartment during a heroin-fueled binge, with frequent cuts to news headlines about their drug problems, and Cobain's angry handwritten retorts. We see them at home after the birth of their daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, taking baths together and cracking jokes, obviously in love despite the undeniable toxicity of their relationship.Far from the sort of talking head style that is so common with other music documentaries, Montage of Heck instead offers the most intimate look at Cobain that we've ever seen. From the casual listener to the hardcore fan, every viewer can expect to learn something about Cobain that they didn't know before, leaving with even more appreciation for his art, and more sorrow over his tragic self-destruction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Cobain focused documentary I've seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some will complain that the documentary doesn't focus enough on Nirvana, and there's a very good reason for that. It's not a documentary about Nirvana; the film is intended to provide a more intimate look at Kurt Cobain as a person and provide insight into his more private and guarded moments. In that respect it is pretty successful. Nirvana's history is very well publicised, and the film assumes it's viewers are already fans that know a lot about the band (Why else would you watch a movie about the band's frontman?) The films biggest selling point is that for the first time a director had the full cooperation of Cobain's family and access to the archive of materials he left behind, much of it had never been seen by the public eye before. These include home movies dating back to him as baby, behind the scene footage, and audio recordings. There is also going to be a companion book dedicated to never before seen photos and other materials that were unearthed. Unfortunately, it's not as exciting as it sounds. There may have been information I had never heard before, but none of it was surprising or profound. It all falls in line with what you would expect if you knew anything about Kurt going in. (I'm sure some people will disagree and say they found it shocking, but I didn't.) That being said the archival materials were well utilized and had a good presentation that fit into the story that was being told. It was nice to see them even if it was an over- hyped aspect of the movie.From a technical standpoint the film really is a marvel. The animated transitions were a great way to incorporate the drawings and doodles that littered Kurt's notebooks. There are also scenes featuring puppetry and stop motion that are also inspired by his art and/or song lyrics. These are all really cool and actually provide more insight to his artistic style and writing process than you would think. Additionally, several segments are entirely animated, and they look beautiful. Doing this is much more captivating than just just showing people talk about events or have a voice-over with a slideshow of pictures. It was a very good choice, and adds a lot to the viewing experience. The film's soundtrack features live Nirvana recordings, covers and remixes, as well as music by other artist that fit the scenes, such as the Buddy Holly song that plays over his parents home movies from the '60s. This is well executed and I particularly love the violin rendition of "Smell Like Teen Spirit" that was used to mimic an orchestral score in the longest animated sequence. Overall the film is an energetic and seemingly honest look at Kurt Cobain and the man he was. It was well made, entertaining, and a worthwhile documentary that stands head and shoulders above any other documentaries about him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have given this movie a rating of 5, which feels generous to me after just coming from the cinema, only because the director was attempting to stick solely to the matter of Kurt Cobain, rather than that band he was in, whatever they were called (I'm sure nobody is interested in them anyway ;), and he DID do this. And as a university essay, this would have meant great marks. However, these rules seemed more like massive limitations to me. I went in wanting to know more about Kurt, of course, but as a fan I was looking for more music stuff; more Buzz, Dave, Dale, Chad, Albini, friends etc. In a strange and telling move, the director agreed to include an interview with himself at the end of the film. To be honest, this seemed like either a way of offering us an excuse as to why we are walking away very disappointed, OR, to further grandiose himself; it's is hard to tell. He stated that he wanted to involve only the main actors in Kurt's life; those who would have been at his funeral if he had still been a janitor, rather than what he became (this wouldn't include Courtney- she has stated she wanted a rock star, and only one with a good nose at that). The problem is that he wasn't a janitor. Surely they could wiped out all the cartoons, all the journal and live stuff that has already been available for years; STILL included the cassette recordings, AND all the stuff about Nirvana and the music, and still come in at 2 hours without losing any of the GOOD stuff in there.Personally I found the whole thing a bit embarrassing and awkward as a viewer. I felt like some horrible sycophant or creepy voyeur through most of this. MAN he would have been embarrassed also if he was alive. In my opinion Kurt's success was as part of a team of people who helped his vision come to life. Yes, he was the alpha visionary in the band, but those musicians, producers and record folk (who we are assumed to understand if this is the definitive Kurt Cobain documentary- don't matter), helped polish the thing to perfection in a manner that we all love. Apparently we are all Kurt worshippers first and foremost. Creepy!This brings me to the thing that bugged me the most. The corny, cringe worthy sabotages of Nirvana's legacy, with all these montage video clips, which just rob the music of all its power, forcing these enigmatic and subtlety crafted songs into the directors less than subtle, frankly, ham fisted visions. At the end when you hear and see the director, you get a sense of how this was doomed from the start. Perhaps even a pinch of Kurt's modesty would have helped here. I wrote this review because I don't want any film maker out to feel the story has been told. This film is just a whole lot of smoke and mirrors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple but worth a watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read a couple Bios of Nirvana and found this doc to be fairly simplistic. Still I enjoyed seeing the unseen footage and cartoon montages. What I was really hoping for was a bit more focus of Kurt when he lived in Evergreen and was dating Toby Vail(would have liked to of seen her in the doc). The experience he had during that time is what inspired him to write many if not all of the songs from Nevermind. What the doc did include was well done. I also wish there was a few more people included in the doc. Dave Grohl, Chad Channing, Toby Vail, to name a few. Still A must watch for any Nirvana/Kurt Cobain fan. The story of Kurt Cobain is a frustrating one his personality mixed with his addictions was what ultimately led to his downfall. I really wish he would have sucked it up and stuck around a bit. I will admit the Doc did a good job capturing just how sensitive and awkward he was before during and after his fame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By far this is the most comprehensive look into Kurt as a human being, without the sole focus being on his drug addiction and his depressive moods.For the last 21 years the majority of what has been published has focused on Kurt's last few years and his impending demise but it was refreshing to see a documentary that tried to look at the big picture which included home footage of Kurt with his family as a young kid and as an adult, just being himself.The inclusion of so much of Kurt's art and personal journals added so much depth and insight into his feelings at different times over his life, even though editing can skew what we see and what we don't.It is fantastic that Frances Bean Cobain had an integral role in producing a more accurate representation of who her father really was rather than who the media/tabloids wanted him to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie suffers from misleading advertising. This is NOT the definitive documentary. If you were looking for a story about Nirvana, the songs or the rock stardom then you will be heavily disappointed. I think this is a story about Family, Parenthood and Addiction. The tragedy of 2 generations in the same family that were cursed with dysfunctional relationships, selfishness, irresponsibility, self-destructiveness and of course addiction. Kurt was abandoned as a child, and he was tossed around between his parents and other family members, because as they themselves put it in blaming each other "couldn't handle him". And then there is Courtney and Kurt the married couple, the parents, the addicts, and the damage they could have inflicted on their baby. I used to think that Cobain killed himself because of what was happening with the music, and the stardom that he never desired, but after seeing this movie, I am more inclined to think that he was torn between his love for his child, his yearning for building a family that didn't resemble the one he had as a child, and his inability to raise her, mainly due to his addiction -some of the footage was immensely disturbing- I don't think he could bear the idea of the inevitable future of her being taken away from him. But then again, if this was true, he chose to give up and abandon her all together. This a beautifully made film, tries to go inside Kurt's mind and relive the events in his life that led to his tragic death. It is also the saddest movie I have ever scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Times are tough in the UK. The Tories have been let off the leash in Westminster. A wave of self-interest and fear has swept the country. The NHS is on its death bed. Amid this cultural and political wilderness, Nirvana have never seemed more relevant.Kicking and screaming his way to global fame against the backdrop of Reaganism, Kurt Cobain became the nihilistic voice of a disenchanted generation. We all know the story - endless books and articles have been written, and plenty of documentaries made too. The challenge faced by "Montage of Heck" was to bring something new to the table, and it did.It's a sparse and minimal film, peppered with gloomy animation and shots of Cobain's journal jottings dynamically brought to life. You get the sense that Director Brett Morgen wanted to give Cobain's story room to breathe; he chooses to linger on poignant photos and intimate home videos rather than cram the time full of interviews with friends and relatives. It's an approach that works to a degree, although it sometimes feels like he's gone too far in the other direction and doesn't have much to say.Cobain himself was mass of contradictions. He hated the corporate music industry, especially the music press, but exploited it. He could be extremely selfish but also incredibly kind and selfless. He was apathetic but passionate. Confused and lost, but also driven and ambitious. All of this played out in the wider Nirvana story too, reflected in their frosty relationship with the media and inability to cope with their success.The mark Cobain left on the world is just as complex and conflicting. He's both a larger-than-life rock star and also the vulnerable junkie you see wandering around your neighbourhood. He represented futility, powerlessness and absolute despair, but he also raged against these things and brought people together in their anger. He united a generation, and that, more than anything else, is his legacy.www.naomisaffron.tumblr.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary about Kurt Cobain focuses on the life of Nirvana front man rather than his death or legacy. The film's start focuses on Kurt's birth and early childhood in Aberdeen, and proceeds to follows his successes and troubles all the way up to Nirvana's iconic unplugged performance. Director Morgen does an excellent job blending footage, art, music and interviews into a coherent story without any need for a narrator; its style ultimately (and intentionally) dragging the viewer into Cobain's emotional state. The soundtrack makes use of faves, outtakes and a surprising portion of ROCKABYE BABY! LULLABY RENDITIONS OF NIRVANA. Montages are used liberally to help shift tone, but it causes the film to go on way too long.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Montage of Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the home footage of Kurt as a child. I liked hearing and seeing his parents talk about him for the first time instead of just reading about them in articles and interviews. I liked hearing them recall memories, even the unpleasant ones (because they were real). I enjoyed the audio montages of art Kurt made and the animations that were designed around them. Hearing Kurt talk and seeing him laugh were great (though I can also see this anytime I want to by going to YouTube and pulling up Nirvana interviews). I loved seeing Kurt being silly, affectionate and loving with Courtney and Frances in unseen home movies. But there's a lot that left me feeling very disappointed with this film. I do not feel that you accurately represented Kurt Cobain. I don't believe you made this film for the fans or for Frances. Kurt as an artist; I thought this would have included his lighthouse paintings, boat paintings, fetus paintings. What about the artwork he did for the Lithium single? The In Utero art collages on the back of the album? Kurt made dolls. He made short films. He was interested in more than just one form of art. Kurt was an artist in the truest sense of the word because he was able to immerse himself in art, not just one form of it. Kurt was a lefty and for a time he struggled with this, having to restring all his guitars upside down to make them work right for him. He loved vintage guitars and had a preference for Fenders. No mention of any of this, huh? Between Kurt's time in Olympia and Nirvana making it big between Bleach &amp; Never Mind " there was a whole era of time when Kurt was focusing on his band, making demo tapes, sending demo tapes out to everyone, going through drummers left and right trying to find the right fit for the band. When they finally got Chad and they signed with Sub Pop and then accidentally recorded Bleach in Drop D. There's a whole story involved with the recording of their first album. Why wasn't this in your film? Don't you think this is kind of important? I do.Sub Pop to Geffen - Seattle to Los Angles - Reading Festival in England - to find out that they were instant stars in heavy rotation on Mtv. These are all pretty important events that were either skimmed over and given little attention or no attention/mention at all.There's also the fact that Kurt helped many bands like the Melvins, Mudhoney, Earth, Screaming Trees - these were bands I would have never heard had Kurt not mentioned them in interviews, giving attention to his friends who were in unknown bands. He helped the underdogs. He was one.While I can appreciate wanting to "show Courtney through Kurt's eyes",if you are going to claim to have made this film for Frances, why would you chose footage that exposes Courtney naked? You left out your interview with Dave Grohl, which many people do think is highly relevant, and included an image of Courtney Love full on nude in bed instead.You focused on a broken little boy, who appeared to rise to stardom with little to no struggle to get there (quite the contrary, he hustled to make it and when he did make it, it wasn't because luck fell into his lap, it's because he promoted the hell out of himself and his band, he MADE it happen - and THIS is what has inspired me as an artist). I felt that the focus was more on his stardom, addiction, love and family life rather than his artistic life and person behind the name/image/band/brand and the many fascinating aspects that his fans were drawn to.I also absolutely hate the way you ended the Montage of Heck. You didn't have a very strong opening - you had a good subject matter; that is was drew your audience in. Your ending is quite possibly one of the worst endings I've seen in any film. I get that you were trying to allude to Courtney lying about cheating on Kurt as you go from her interview talking about it to the unplugged performance where he is singing "Where Did You Sleep Last Night/In The Pines" by Led Belly. And then you just end the film. Right there. At the unplugged. That was not near the last performance Nirvana had. If you wanted to end it mid song to symbolize his life being cut short right in the middle - just ending- then it would have worked more in your favor to pull a song from Nirvana's final performance.I even heard an interview where you smugly gloated about how Kurt's own mom and sister HATED the film when they saw it. If his mom and sister hate it, maybe that should tell you that you didn't get it right. I whole heartedly believe you are just one more person who came along to exploit Kurt Cobain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have been a book -not a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Montage of Heck is exactly what the name suggests, a montage. An overly long montage I'd say. Most of the film is made up of hand written notes and drawings from what appears to be from Kurt's scrapbook. And that's the problem; notes and drawings don't make for good film material. The film makers have thrown in a few interviews for good measure, but they add nothing to a story that's already been told a million times. I'm no big Nirvana fan, yet I learned nothing new from watching all 133minutes of this film. Kurt's mom and sister, Courtney, Krist Novoselic and Kurt's ex-girlfriend are the only people interviewed (if I'm forgetting someone it's because the film really didn't hold my attention). Where are the interviews with Nirvana members Dave Grohl and Pat Smear, ex members Dale Crover and Chad Channing (to name but two) and Kurt's friends Buzz Osbourne and Dylan Carlson (again to name but two)? And there must have been so many other people behind the scenes that could have contributed to the story, childhood friends, managers, crew members, even bleeping drug dealers. I know the title says montage, but I was hoping for a documentary and was greatly disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Quintessential Kurt Cobain Doc</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some say that you're not a true rock and roll legend until you've had an extensive authorized documentary made about your legacy. Just kidding, nobody says that. Kurt Cobain was a legend as soon as Nevermind hit record stores, and his legacy continues today, immortalized by Nirvana and the massive impact his genius had on punk rock. But not only was he one of the best rockers who ever lived, Kurt Cobain was one of the most extraordinary and misunderstood minds of his generation, whose own brilliance caused his self destruction. He's a complex and intricate spider web of a person, and Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck goes on the deepest and most intimate exploration of this enigmatic genius that has ever been done. Montage of Heck chronicles Cobain's entire life, beginning with his parents meeting and Kurt's childhood, all the way up to his suicide in 1994 which is nothing more than a title card at an abrupt end of the film. Don't think that this is a Nirvana documentary, or a Courtney Love documentary, or any other kind of documentary other than a Kurt Cobain documentary. Montage of Heck examining his relationship with his family, his lovers, his band, and Nirvana's massive following which played on Kurt as a blessing and a maddening curse. Montage of Heck is directed by Brett Morgen, the director of my personal favorite ESPN 30 for 30 episode, June 17th, 1994, a sports documentary that only uses news footage from one particular day in sports to tell its story. Morgen employs similar techniques here. The amount of home video footage that exists of Cobain from his adolescence all the way through his relationship with Courtney Love (which includes some pretty disturbing drug induced home video), is astounding. Montage of Heck is brilliantly pieced together through this home video footage, interviews with people close to Kurt, audio recordings of Kurt and friends, and Kurt's own journal writings and drawings, gloriously animated in what makes for the most fascinating look into the mind of this troubled genius. Some of the best parts of the film take us through his journals where his mad scientist scribbles and macabre H.R. Giger-esque drawings show us his reactions and feelings towards the band, their rising popularity, Courtney Love, etc. all to paint a fascinatingly intricate portrait of this man. To call Montage of Heck an examination of Kurt Cobain would be doing a disservice to this great doc. Montage of Heck is less of an examination and more of a journey, a violent yet graceful boat ride into the seas of one of rock and roll's most dynamic minds. It's a film that is as beautiful as it is brutal, and as sentimental as it is visceral. This is the most honest and in depth insight into a man who seemed to have everything, yet battled demons all his life to find what really could make him happy. Sadly, those demons won, but not before Kurt Cobain could be immortalized as a rock and roll icon. And now we're lucky enough to have this film which celebrates all that he left behind. A film that shows us not only who Kurt Cobain was on stage, but who he was as a passionately flawed human being who wanted nothing more than to love, be loved, and rock the f out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Tell me where did you sleep last night?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been an admirer of Brett Morgen's work for a while, and throughout his films (Kid Stays in the Picture, Chicago 10, 06/17/94), he's constantly displayed a great gift for how to do montages and to expand the form of the documentary, whether it's through voice-over that is (and isn't) right out of a book with corresponding imagery for Robert Evans, or with rotoscoped animation for the trial of the Chicago 7 in the late 60's. So it is logical that if he'd take on a documentary on Kurt Cobain it would be in montage form. The question is is it any good? That of course will depend on how attached you might be to the Cobain "mythos" that has sprouted since (or even before) his death.I didn't have that kind of attachment - I love the band and like his work as a lyricist and musician, but it stops there - so went in to this fairly fresh and only knowing scattered facts about Cobain (all of them petty and none of them really mentioned here). What made the movie work for me is that Morgen sets up empathy with his subject and the audience very quickly, and it's thanks to a treasure trove of archive material. This director had access to so much 8mm home movie footage, hand-held camcorder video from the early 90's, old Nirvana band tapes, audio cassette recordings that Kurt made as a teenager, even a couple of voicemail messages and conversations (if the movie doesn't make you want to check out Over the Edge, it's doing something wrong).But most of all are the journal entries, which is where much of the real meat of Morgen's film comes through. You get a complete purview into who Cobain was, from youth up until just near the end, with these journals and they're full of so many words but also drawings - Cobain was an incredible drawer and artist, and maybe in another life could've been a comic book guy with the sensibility of a more deranged Mike Judge or something - so Morgen uses these to his advantage and leaps off from creating animations from these drawings into animations based on Kurt's words. Possibly the highlight of the first half of the movie comes with Cobain's story of being disaffected, smoking pot, and trying to have his first sexual experience with a messed up fat girl, and it's startling to see how these images unfold.But unlike Chicago 10, the movie's not anchored in this style. Morgen is all over the place at times with his montages, going from behind the scenes footage of music videos to Kurt and Courtney's own home movies. The latter becomes borderline invasive in some way, not too far removed from watching the Tommy Lee/Pamela video from years back, minus the sex (though Courtney Love cant help but show some boob). Perhaps it is necessary to see just what their relationship was like without any media bias; this part is also brought forward with articles that I found fascinating for what could very well have been totally true... or a bunch of BS, and probably the truth was in the middle. They were junkies, they were in love, and the degree to how much they were using colors perceptions for people.Oh, and the movie is with wall-to-wall Nirvana music, from very deep, obscure, super-early-career cuts from punk shows to Kurt recording the Beatles 'And I Love Her' on a little cassette. Morgen has a natural ability to combine images with rapid succession, but I never really felt lost so long as I was paying attention to what was going on on screen. I saw it on HBO, but now regret I didn't get the full visual-aural experience in a theater, since it seems made for that kind of maximum impact.I don't even think Montage of Heck gives a 100% clear view of things that happened for Nirvana or in all of Cobain's life, and yet that's kind of fine - it has enough time to go through the major accomplishments, but it doesn't matter the how completely except that he did it, and at that point now what? But by the end of it I felt like I got enough to see the man in a slightly new way. Before my impression of Cobain was of some cooler-than-thou dude who lived the rock and roll lifestyle too fast. In reality, he was a sensitive dude who loved punk rock and skyrocketed much too quickly to fame. Had Nevermind somehow not been so good, one wonder if he'd still be alive - or what else might've taken him down after a childhood of persona non grata status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of Montage of Heck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Montage of Heck, a Sundance Film Festival award winning movie directed by Brett Morgan, was released, Rolling Stone Magazine called it "the most intimate rock doc ever made". This could not be more true. Frances Bean Cobain was credited as a producer for the project which was terrific news for Morgan. Courtney Love is, quite frankly, a nut case, all of the rights to Kurt Cobain's music, recordings, notebooks, and home movies are in Frances' name. These rights are exercised to their fullest extent in this movie. Many other documentaries focus on one story, told in different parts by people related to the subject. There is very little music or excitement in them. A documentary about Kurt Cobain had better be playing Nirvana nonstop. Not only that, but the film features popular music from his childhood and live performances, and even includes arrangements of songs like Smells Like Teen Spirit. Certain guitar parts or vocals are isolated and played to create certain moods over a scene. The entire soundtrack is quite genius actually. The interviews are told by people that are generally well known to Nirvana fans and the public. Krist Novecelic (Nirvana's bassist) and Courtney Love (Cobain's wife) are amongst several people who contribute to the story, along with Kurt's parents and the muse of Nevermind, Kurt's ex-girlfriend Tracy. Each person has another heartbreaking piece of the Cobain legacy. As stated before though, this isn't the only way the story is told. The home movies and recordings are pieced together in this amazing time line that lay most of Kurt's life out on the screen. Kurt Cobain was a mystery to the world. He told such extravagant stories and lied because, as the voice of Kurt explains, he was bullied as a child and wanted to make himself "cool". First of all, hearing him talk about being bullied possesses such a humanizing effect, Kurt seems like another run of the mill faceless kid, which is exactly what he was before Nirvana. And also, it is such a refreshing way to hear a story. Rather than be told one opinion of the man by people who knew him, the viewer can watch, god like, over the story and form their own opinion. For the parts of his life that were not recorded, Kurt's digital journal was used as the narration for an animated version of 1980's Aberdeen, 1990's Seattle, and everywhere he was in-between. The story is interesting to be heard with an artists rendition to help the viewer visualize the story better. Listening to Kurt's voice on these stories is amazing, while being a little demented. It's a great strategy to get the audience closer, but while some of the audio clips were from interviews, some sounded as if they were recorded journal entries. Almost as if everyone watching the film was reading his diary. Kurt was quoted saying that he never wanted all the fame. People constantly trying to figure him out and get in his head made him uncomfortable all the time. Had Cobain himself seen the film, he probably would've hated it. Every aspect of this poor man's life was too chaotic for a perfectly strong person to handle. Kurt was a sad boy at heart who had a broken brain and a rotting stomach. Every single morning, he would wake up to a swarm of thoughts constantly stinging him like yellow jackets. Which makes Montage of Heck a perfect title for a story about the tragedy of Cobain. Rather than focus on the band and his contribution to rock and roll, Montage brings the viewer into the enigmatic mind of Nirvana's front man. From the beginning where he was a giddy, creative, and loving little kid, to the end where the weight of being the worlds biggest rock star makes him want to taste the shell of a shotgun blast. The legend of Kurt Cobain is a difficult thing to capture, but Montage of Heck does an exceptional job of telling it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great,, super.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a documentary that presents another side of Kurt Cobain unseen by the public. What many don't understand is that, like Dylan's 3rd album, "Another side of Bob Dylan," this is simply all this movie is, another perspective of the great grunge genius. Kurt was never a man, always a boy with the gift of genius. Unfortunately, all the risk factors for suicide were there: childhood abandonment, genetic family history of bi-polar illness and suicide (two uncles committed suicide), addiction to heroin, stress of fame, Severe Depression and, of course, a highly unhealthy and destructive relationship with Courtney Love. He never had a chance really, and those who loved him had no clue, couldn't have, at the path of destruction he was on. And yet, he left us with perhaps the best rock songs ever, especially on Nevermind, and I am sure his legacy will last for a long, long time. The scenes in this movie depict a Cobain at his best and his worst, strung out in his daughter's presence and raging on the stage. Like Amy Winehouse, Cobain was on a mission to self-destruction. We've seen this before. Syd Barrett,Ian Curtis, Nick Drake, the list goes on. For those blessed with genius, the normal developmental milestones don't mean quite so much. At 21, most of us are struggling with independent living skills, young adulthood, etc. Not so with Kurt Cobain. He was busy proving to the world his potential, which like Dylan, he was very aware he was predestined for. The Blade-runner line, "The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long" is all too applicable to the life of Cobain, especially in light of his bi-polar illness. When I heard, "You Know You're Right," I couldn't help but to feel helpless, angry at what might have come had he somehow lived, had he accepted Duff mckagan's invitation to chill with him that night (a Mckagan knew he was suffering). But like Poe, his creativity came from a well of mental illness, and that is the frame we must view Cobain in, for the kind of illness he suffered from is the kind that cannot last in it's piercing incarnation, at least without medication, be it heroin or lithium.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimately, Montage of Heck is the most honest window into the troubled and tortured soul of Kurt Cobain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never has there been a more intimate film produced about the trials and tribulations of Kurt Cobain until now. Director, Brett Morgen, has been hard at work since 2007 rummaging through Cobain's diaries and home movies to take us through Kurt's trajectory from childhood to super stardom and finally to his untimely demise. Ultimately, Montage of Heck is the most honest window into the troubled and tortured soul of Kurt Cobain.Nirvana bassist, Krist Novoselic, sets the tone early with the heartbreaking and remorseful statement, "With 20/20 hindsight, you think, Why didn't I see it? or Why didn't I say something?" Though a sentiment, his ultimate end seemed inevitable.It is no secret that Cobain's childhood was dreadful and home was broken. This film shed further light on the fact, having been displaced from his and multiple family members' homes in his teenage years. He was an outcast and loner through his formative years, to the point where he attempted suicide for the first time, by way of a train, but fortunately fate went the other way. There is solace that his upbringing inspired such beautiful, though at times, twisted, art.If you're not fond of Courtney Love, this film will add more fuel to the fire. The most uncomfortable scene to watch is an array of clips of Kurt and Courtney clearly out of their minds of heroin, being ludicrous. Kurt and Courtney's drug use was no secret, but seeing the effects is undoubtedly the most troubling and painful scenes to watch.One of the overarching themes throughout Montage of Heck was Kurt's overwhelming sensitivity. Novoselic recounts Kurt feeling humiliated and devastated by a small time critic's negative review of their first single. Courtney echoed Novoleslic's claim in telling the cryptic and infamous tale of the Rome incident. Love sheds light that Kurt felt severely betrayed when his wife almost cheated on him, responding by taking 67 Rohypnol pills, overdosing, and going into a coma. This was a month before his untimely suicide at the age of 27.For better, Montage of Heck, ends without going into any detail of his suicide, as it fades to black and merely states the fact on a plain, black screen.This brilliant film does a splendid job of not withholding the gritty details and benefits from exposing the most intimate view of Cobain. There is no other subject as complicated as Kurt Cobain, but Montage of Heck will live as unequivocally the closest idea of the inner demons of Kurt.</fullReview>

His suicide was not unexpected. Courtney definitely put him on the fast track for ending it. Sad but eye opening film. It also makes you realize that Dave Grohl would still be living in Seattle as an unknown if weren't for Cobain. Cobain wrote every song and was a very talented musician. It is definitely a difficult film for hardcore Nirvana fans. Knowing that Cobain was so fragile and unhinged. I would strongly recommend this film to documentary fans.</fullReview>

This movie doesn't show the main part of him, his death. This is only created to divert the attention from "Soaked in Bleach". The only good thing about this movie is that we can see Kurt's works from the background. This is only a documentary focusing on one aspect of Kurt. Even though they tried to show his negativity, ultimately you can see that Courtney was the culprit due to her negativity and addiction. She was the wrong person to get married to Kurt. If he hadn't married her, he would have been with us now, here. I hope his case reopens.</fullReview>

No reference for the The movie basically want to show that he was happy with his family, sorry Love... he was not.

		<shortDescription>What A Waste Of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying this documentary could have been an hour, tops. There's just an enormous amount of useless filler shoved in here. This film started off strong for the first 5-10 minutes then swiftly started to spiral downwards. The whole thing is a cross between what could have been a solid (not great) documentary mated w/ Pink Floyd's "The Wall" movie. To call Kurt Cobain a genius diminishes the meaning of the word altogether. He was simply a miserable, self-loathing drug addict. When Courtney Love finally enters this film, she brings this slow-moving train to a complete halt. The only redeeming aspect of this film are the home movies of Kurt interacting w/ his infant daughter.One would think that Kurt's involvement in Nirvana would be an integral part of this documentary. Interviews with his band mates should be a must; after all, they spent a lot of time with him. Well, Dave Grohl wasn't interviewed for this film at all. He only appears in this film during archival footage of the band. How do you make the "quintessential Kurt Cobain documentary" without interviewing 1 of the 2 remaining members of the band Kurt helped to create?!This film is a complete waste of time and was way better suited as a book. It's filled w/ the scribbles of an obviously depressed human being. 20 minutes into this film I couldn't wait for it to be over. Terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst kind of a "documentary"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I'm neither Nirvana lover nor Nirvana hater. I didn't pay much attention to the band in its heyday. It was Cobain's performance of the last piece played during the MTV unplugged, which got my attention. I find the Nirvana's music OK and in my opinion beyond the mainstream standards. Even back then. In today's standards it would be light years beyond, because today there's no music in the mainstream.Secondly, I'm reluctant to call this a "documentary" at all. It's just a mash up of private recordings along with babbling how Kurt Cobain miserable was. There are barely some dates or facts, interviews with record company members are missing completely. It just spins around a depressed heroin addict, who in fact was a pretty good poet. But that, along with the main subject of Cobain's and Nirvana's success, music, is almost not mentioned at all. The only interesting thing was the first part of animated cartoon, which seems to be narrated by Kurt himself. The rest is just kind of junk which was bothering not even Kurt Cobain back then, but is bothering other artists of today as well. This piece of low life thrash is nothing more than polished tabloid journalism. Did you hear Kurt and other band members their general opinions about the interviews? They didn't like them. They didn't like to be covered by media parasites. Sadly, the market demand was and is still very big, because the moronic so-called "fans" would do anything to get more of their idols (gods). For example PJ Harvey expressed the sickness of "journalists" (more correctly "paparazzi"), who are trying to strip the artist to the bone, so they could deliver either "biography" of "documentary". Similar thing happened to Tom Waits as well. An unauthorized biography book was published few years ago. People, would you be please so kind and leave your favorite musician/actor/princess alone, especially if they wish not to be bothered? And by the way how the hell could this Montage of Heck be "authorized", when the subject is dead? Is there a mention in his testimony, that the personal tapes should be put on the big screen? Those kinds of intimate personal recordings shouldn't be published this way at all. Never, ever.To me it seems it was exactly this type of media coverage, which helped Kurt Cobain to pull the trigger. But I didn't know him, so I really can't tell. Still, this isn't a documentary. This is a tabloid journalism flick for the reality show freaks.If you've paid to see this garbage, you're the part of the problem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a good biography and i really liked it. For moments you almost can feel what Kurt felt trough his life, he was almost trapped itself. It would have been better if the movie had more testimonies from close Friends, an interview from Tobi Vail and other persons. However, for moments you can feel Kurt's depression, his frustration and how Deep was his addiction; and that really takes you into the movie and his life. The compilation of videos is great and you will be witness of his changes all over the years and all the stages of his life. The only thing i didn't like is that the movie is a Little bit (a lot) weird for moments. if you can't avoid that, you will enjoy it.Concluding, here you can almost feel Kurt's feelings; you will see Nirvana's birth and how they became famous very fast but also a lot of things of his personal life. If you like Nirvana, this is a good chance to know Kurt's life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Digging for the Damaged Soul Behind a Cultural Icon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An uncomfortably close look at the private life of Kurt Cobain, short-term rock superstar and unwilling voice of a disgruntled generation. In the decades since his untimely suicide, Cobain's become an almost mythical figure, which isn't to say he was anything less at the height of his mid-90s popularity. To that end, it can be useful to ground his legacy in this way: intimate home video footage shows him unguarded behind closed doors, but also captures his steady state of mental decay. Where there's a gap in his video history between childhood (and it's heartbreaking to watch this happy little boy, knowing what tragedies his life held in store) and early adulthood, journal entries, artwork and beautiful animated segments keep the narrative moving. Clearly he was hanging on by a thread for longer than most could manage, pushed into a pit of despair by a bleak combination of abandonment, physical frailty, intense media scrutiny and constant, desperate drug abuse. It's not the Cobain many of us might want to see, or to believe in, but it feels so close to the truth that I could almost feel his breath on me. As an extreme close-up on one of my era's biggest names it's significant, with a killer soundtrack of course, and unexpectedly real. It frequently feels invasive, though, especially in the interviews with his parents (his stepmother's continuous, awkward smile is particularly unnerving) and I'm not sure I'm totally okay with the way it made me feel. Powerful in many good, and many bad, ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls a little short of its potential.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Nirvana, but I've never loved them. Maybe too much oversaturation in childhood keeps me from finding much of Nevermind particularly special, but I do adore their MTV Unplugged show. That's when I got it. I hoped Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck would further my appreciation for the band and the icon, but it fell a bit short. It's a frenetic documentary as expected, but instead of feeling raw and passionate, it can feel overcooked and overcalculated. Granted, that's what you get when you invite a montage. It is an impressive blend of archive footage, home video, talking heads, original animation. It lacks focus, taking anecdotes in chronological order and it doesn't feel like a full picture. The film doesn't come to fruition until Frances Cobain is born and you see a different shade of Kurt. To be frank, from the home video and interviews, Kurt is nothing more than an average irritating and mopey guy in his mid-20s. I don't know why I expected more of him, but his standoffishness was annoying before it became tragic. I can't say it illuminated his talent or any pioneering spirit in the music industry, but I guess it's lightning in a bottle. The best moments are the rise to success montages where you really feel their influence. Solid doc, but you can only do what you can with what you're given.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable film, but an informative and insightful documentary it is not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary told me little I didn't already know about the great Kurt Cobain. With supposed access to numerous home videos, journals and members of Kurt's immediate family, friends and band mates, I find it curious the aspects of Kurt's life the director chose to focus on. It is evident that the aim of the documentary is to show what a troubled soul Kurt was, yet it doesn't give any real insight into the events that created such a feeling in him. One such oddity is the interview with Kurt's mother which never delved deeper than the surface points of some of the major events of Kurt's life (ones that we've already learned more about from other journalists in years past). For instance: They touch on Kurt's homelessness as a teen, yet don't venture into the circumstances that caused his homelessness or have any depth of discussion about this major point in Kurt's life with his mother. How Kurt came to be the man and artist that captivated so many is still as mysterious now as it was before I watched this documentary.Apart from the documentary's questionable focus and content, the style in which the story is told is well done, with fluid interchanges between Kurt's journal entries, old home videos, photos, sound recordings and interviews. The use of animation helped pull everything together and added a dreamy dimension to the story telling.All in all an enjoyable, well made film, but an informative and insightful documentary it is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poetic intimate exploration of a genius gone before his time,,,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very enjoyable award-winning documentary depicting insight into Kurt Cobain's adolescent upbringing, family and relationship with Courtney Love - from childhood, teenage years and the birth of Nirvana onward, rising to become the biggest band in the world during this era. Exploring Cobain's years with heroin addiction, is eventually his downside yet never the main focus of the film that shows a rare chance to become familiar with such a genius up close.The film uses a variety of media with highlights from home videos of Kurt and Courtney and their daughter Frances Bean including audio recordings, interviews with family and friends, personal scribblings, song lyrics and intimate thoughts. These elements are animated with an artistic brush stylistically particularly the audio recordings and writings that suit the visual story while fitting the tone beautifully.The film keeps a strong rhythm throughout the 145 minute running time with a similarity to the animation and music montages of musician Rodriguez in the music documentary 'Searching for Sugar Man'. Not to imply that this is monotonous but rather the meditative groove is what makes it such an enjoyable ride with all the musical and visual elements. In fact the film plays out a bit like a mysterious fairy tale, most of Nirvana's music has been reinterpreted as motifs to accompany the animation or archival footage, which gives the film a poetic feel.Overall Cobain: Montage of Heck is an awesome film to sink your teeth into, like finding a box of someone's personal belongings, where each item tells a story but packaged within a mixed media format with a rhythm that makes it an enjoyable ride. Fans will be satisfied with the film as a source of information but it is much more than that. The intimate portrait of one of the most famous rock stars ever is painted using a visual style and mood to match the music and the characteristics of Kurt's character. It was exceptional knowing the film is endorsed by the family with the use of documents and footage that they decided to share for the first time. Seeing Kurt and Courtney so intimately, it is almost like you were in the same room as them.At the end of the day being an immense Nirvana fan, seeing all the footage of Cobain and the band is very satisfying, showcasing one of the most famous rock stars ever to fall at the classic age of 27, well before and way ahead of his time.http://samuellbronko.tumblr.com/post/121494805827/cobain-montage-of- heck-2015-brett-morgen</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never has there been a more pure, raw, gripping and grotesque documentary as Brett Morgen's Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck. A stirring look into the self destructive life of one of rock and grunge's biggest icons. Interviews from Courtney Love, Kurt's Parents and Siblings, Bass Player Krist Novoselic is seen while archive footage, old comics and drawings, intense imagery flashes onto the screen shocking and giving viewers a hard boiled look into the life of this great rock star.Morgen's visual style is seen from using new footage he directed which follows animated sequences and live action film are amazing. The movie also uses footage of inside the human body, gory comics, disturbing drawings such as Snoopy as a Nazi to show the troubled times that Cobain is going through in a most passionate way. Morgen cares about every single detail and doesn't leave anything out and although it can be tiring at times with it's long 2 hour and 25 minute running time, the film never runs out of steam and is as raw as a music documentary can get. No more History of the Eagles or the four hour epic masterpiece Running Down a Dream, this movie is life like. It breathes, it reproduces, it is crazy.Montage of Heck is one of my favorite movies of 2015, and this movie surely will be nominated for an Oscar. 95/100 A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made Purely for Kurt Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>His daughter was so happy with this film that she was crying and thanking Brett Morgan at the Sundance Festival. It's sad that her only birthday that he was alive for, he accidentally got too high for. Then again, he is human and that's why we stand by him.Other than that, it was very enjoyable being able to finally hear Tracy speak. I have only seen pictures or heard of her, for the last 21 years, prior to this film.I had heard the cassette tape started by Kurt Cobain in which he called 'Montage of Heck' where you can hear Kurt vomiting and urinated (at one point) so the title of this documentary kinda scared me, but they did not play the cassette.Aside of home videos and other footage, they showed videos in which Kurt once put together, unreleased journals and drawings of his (provided by Miss Tracy), his mom even gave them drawings that he drew when he was little, and some of his audio diary was put in there, although he did already speak of the train track suicide attempt in the About A Son interview.Unfortunately, his life shows the reality of heroin addiction, but he was a very talented young man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Baringly humanizing and intimate look at Kurt's personal life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say it beforehand that I've never watched a Kurt/Nirvana documentary before this nor read any of the books about him and I'm not a Kurt obsessive, although I've admittedly read up on his death and admire Nirvana's music and their contribution to 90s pop culture (which I am a fan of).This documentary is a surprisingly humanizing look at him, with pretty much zero focus on the circumstances of his death (only a two-second note about it appears on the screen right before the credits roll) - which was quite refreshing since there seems to be a macabre obsession about Kurt's death, almost to the point of overshadowing what he was like as a person. And that's precisely what this documentary does - bring him from this deified rock legend pedestal to the level of a man, what he was like as a son, as a father, as a brother, as a husband and ex-boyfriend.The interviews with his father, sister (it's the first time his immediate family has agreed to one), ex-girlfriend Tracy Marander and his mom Wendy in particular - along with more familiar faces like ex- wife Courtney Love and bandmate Krist Novoselic - are touching, at times uncomfortable and revealing. They map out a sensitive and talented but vulnerable artist who was a little too conscious of himself.Although there's also performance footage here, Nirvana's music is almost a minor footnote and the focus strictly remains on the man himself. The stylized animations of Kurt's journal entries, drawings and narrations of his teenage years fill in the rest of the details about his youth, although the most effective parts are conveyed by various home videos at different points in his life - including some very intimate and unnerving ones that depict his domestic life with Courtney Love and their daughter Frances.In a memorable scene, Courtney is giving baby Frances her first haircut as a visibly impaired Kurt nods off on heroin while holding the baby. It's a baring, unfiltered look ? their messy house and unwashed appearance depicts a chaotic domestic life that's far from idyllic. It also shows that despite the rumours, Kurt and Courtney were very much in love and somehow made naturally suitable partners (despite, or because of, their drug habits). Morgen makes the brave decision of letting Cobain come across as a flawed character rather than a romanticized tragic anti-hero, without denigrating him or making him seem unsympathetic.I was also quite surprised by how meticulously documented virtually all his life (even pre-fame) seemingly was - by his family members' home videos since he was a little child to the way he meticulously preserved his possessions, feelings and thoughts (artistic, mundane to-do lists or otherwise) in his journals and the 'treasure trove' of boxes upon boxes of tapes (among other belongings) that director Brett Morgen used to fill in the details of what went on in his mind. Of course, not to mention the baring, rather unflattering home videos of his personal life with Courtney and his daughter. It's as if he was anticipating the opportunity for legend-status fame and preserved his life for it just in case.This documentary is a humbled, humanized view that goes into the deep end of what made Kurt the person he was, rather than the ideal that he was made out to be. It also provides a fairly unfiltered, at times disturbing window in the mind and life of the 90s' quintessential rock star and so-called voice of a generation - without any baggage of the romanticizing fandom that surrounds his tragic death.</fullReview>

I'd like some more interviews of Cobain so I could understand him better. The only thing that annoyed me were the scenes with Courtney Love.

		<fullReview>Tough upbringing as a teen especially, no one wanted him at their home. He bounces from one relative to another, all kicking him out sooner than later. You feel sorry for him, seriously. I'm guessing Dave Grohl didn't participate since the film does not really flatter the departed. And would only beg the question, "Why didn't you see it coming?" "And why didn't you do something?" Who needs that awkwardness from the past coming back up? This flick actually makes Cobain out to be exactly what you think a young major rock star would be like after going from a nobody to really famous overnight.Some of the footage with Cobain's kid is riveting only because you think something bad is going to happen to the child. It does not paint the parents as responsible very often.The key lesson is even though someone may really be extra sensitive and hurt by criticism, or by being embarrassed, or by being mocked, etc., when they clearly are on a crash course with an early demise, say f*cking "something" people! No doubt the bass player is haunted by his inaction.100% sad. You've been warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with other reviews that this was an opportunity for Courtney Love and Kurt Cobain's parents to whitewash the whole affair and the director to pad his resume. A lot of the 'cut scenes' went on way too long and had nothing to to with the story. Not only that, many inserted footage designed to disturb you or help you come to certain conclusions about Kurt Cobain's state of mind.The documentary made Kurt Cobain look like a crazy, drug addicted fiend. It was rather one dimensional and didn't do a great job of showing him as an individual or the artist he was. It wouldn't be crazy to consider it character assassination. I haven't had the opportunity to watch the other Nirvana documentaries out there, but they have to be better that this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a huge Nirvana fan I was extremely excited to see this. I pretty much know everything there is to know about Kurt Cobain so I didn't think it would surprise me too much. However, I was actually very surprised a few times during this film. For instance, the story Kurt told about his failed sexual encounter as a teen, was heartbreaking to hear. As well as the suicide attempt on the train tracks not long after. The film is as you might expect, a "montage" of Kurt's life told through various ways. Animation, journal entries, artwork, cassette tapes &amp; VHS home recordings. Also included are interviews with Krist Novoselic, Courtney Love &amp; many of Kurt's relatives. What made this film great for me, is the fact that it was unflinching. For a film to be made about a person, that's the way it should be...otherwise why bother at all. It's definitely difficult to watch at some points, but that's not a bad thing. It could've been another MTV style documentary about Kurt that offered nothing new but thankfully the filmmakers wanted to approach his life in a way it hadn't been presented before.10/10. If you're a fan, this is unmissable. I'd recommend it even if you aren't. Montage Of Heck is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen about a musician.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It really does take the myth out the man, and you are able to see him as real person who was super talented and unfortunately was never truly happy with himself and you see glimpses of happiness when he is with his family and band mates or playing music. I loved it, and it has stayed in my head for days because I always had this idealism towards who Kurt was, that seeing him as just a human being with severe self-acceptance issues, and at the same time, a very honest and sensitive guy who loved his wife and daughter, but could only love them the way he knew how, it was really cool and refreshing.People who do not like this documentary are of course entitled to their opinion, but I have never watched any nirvana or Kurt documentaries and I thought this one was a great presentation of the man he was and how he saw the world, so I don't get why you would not like this and think other documentaries are better. It is all about perspective and what the documentaries focus on, so I don't understand why people think they needed to see more footage of this or that... I 100% recommend this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found Montage of Heck to be a scatter-brained documentary that couldn't decide which direction to go. It grabs at various forms of media culled from Cobain's family, and tosses them into a blender, with splashes of interviews and band footage. There were some stunningly rotoscoped animation, using narration from Cobain, that briefly takes you through his dejected teenage years in Aberdeen, Washington. They also rendered the years Cobain spent living with his first girlfriend, Tracy Marander, who supported him when Nirvana started getting noticed. Marander isn't shown (only in interviews and rare photos), we just see how Kurt spent his days being creative while she was at work. Anyway, not long after, the band signed to Sub Pop and released Bleach. There were also drawings and writings (many would make Jack Kerouac's "spontaneous prose" seem lucid by comparison) from his sketchbooks / journals, that were brought to life using muted computer graphics. These were scattered throughout, and became laborious after about the 10th time. Still, the music that accompanied them were great. We get to hear plenty of unreleased material, and I even noticed some Nirvana covers, which felt redundant. Now, cue in Courtney Love. Sigh. It was annoying seeing her all dolled up by a makeup artist, chain-smoking and sounding incredibly untruthful about Kurt's last couple of months. I won't ruin it, but it's towards the end of the film and it made me more suspicious of her. The home videos of Kurt, Courtney, and Frances Bean were quite touching, although at times it got dark, especially some moments with just Kurt and Courtney (not 100% on who recorded them). You know he was the happiest he's ever been, but they were also plunging into the abyss of heroin and other drugs. Overall, Montage of Heck started off as a sweet concoction that ultimately left me with a bitter aftertaste. I hear that 'About a Son' is the superior documentary, so I'll watch that in hopes of getting a deeper insight into Kurt Cobain and Nirvana.</fullReview>

How Cobain was shaped, being a son of a wrecked family and growing up confused in a isolated youth. Knowing how hard it is to tell someone's life story in one and a half hour, one can say this documentary succeeded by providing an experience that only a moving picture can create. It contains home made videos, good interviews, music, notes and even animated scenes, so the public can feel not only what Cobain represented, but how he must have felt.Definitely worth watching.

Perhaps due to my high expectations this documentary left me very disappointed. Where I wanted to see a an in-depth, intimate picture of Kurt I was instead confronted with a flurry of noisy montages incoherently lumped together. Some might argue that this reflected the chaotic nature of Cobain's life and music but to me it came off as forced and distracting. These montages were interspersed with animated sequences which, while being visually impressive, felt out of place amid the viscera of Kurt's own scrawls, themselves cleverly-used to lend a coherent chronology to the film. Some of the home footage is fascinating, such as the clips of Kurt's childhood and the early jam/practice sessions in Aberdeen, but I couldn't fully engage with the movie due to its tonal ambiguity and lack of focus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a simple documentary that is taken in a more artistic direction, which I didn't really have any problems with. I actually enjoyed this documentary and especially liked the interview with the Kurt animation scenes. I thought the first half was very well done, and didn't much like the second half. And it's not only because the second half revolves around the romance between Kurt and Courtney. And it's not because their is a high probability that Courtney murdered Kurt. But the second half was super slowly paced and was a bit boring to watch through. Although it would have been very difficult to get certain footages of Kurt without Courtney's permission. And it was disappointing that Dave Grohl was included in the interviews for this documentary. This film focuses in on Kurt's background, his childhood, his parents and where he came from as a teenager to focusing on his band work. And his physical and emotional struggle, which also includes his drug addiction. Overall, I wished this had more information going for it, but it's still worth a watch. Although some fans of Nirvana might disagree. It isn't great, but still a pretty good documentary.6.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the longest documentaries I've ever seen, but it's for good reason. Watching this film took me deep into the life of Kurt Cobain, someone I knew very little about.It is powerfully made, informative and very sensitive, like Kurt. Almost too sensitive to the point where the end didn't touch on his suicide or the events surrounding the suicide. Of course it gave an incredible insight into the possible reasons why he had committed suicide, but I really felt that I needed more when it ended. I resorted to reading articles on wikipedia but I feel that this documentary could've given us a greater insight into that event just like it did in every other chapter of his life.I can understand wanting a layer of respect, this film celebrates him and some would say it wouldn't have felt appropriate. I'm sure some of the fans, his family, and his daughter, (who also produced the movie) feel it would've distracted from the point and allure of the film.But ultimately, the text screen at the end explaining his death didn't satisfy me. The rest of the film is rather incredible and will serve as the ultimate Kurt Cobain documentary for years and years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A sad exploitation of a talented man. As a film sanctioned by his estate, it was clear this was only part of the story and only the part that they wanted to put the spin on. What a disgrace to paint Kurt Cobain as nothing but suicidal long before the success of Nirvana. The 2 1/2 hour documentary is tolerable for only about the first hour. After that, the backstory of Kurt Cobain is polluted by the relationship choice he made and a highly biased or third-party influenced (or paid for?) fallacy that this young man, despite having fulfilled his goal of being a recognized musician and having the possibly unexpected pleasure of being a father, wanted nothing more than to die. The snippets from his journals seem taken very much out of context, again to push the idea this man was suicidal for years, and the Pink Floyd "The Wall"-esque animations are cheesy and make this overly-long film a burden to continue to watch until the end. The saddest part for me was watching Kurt Cobain's mother and father, who both rejected him and would not allow him to live with him while he was a teenager, snivel about their loss. You didn't want him then, but you want him now? Many authoritative sources have debunked some of his mother's statements in this film. Very sad. Others who knew him personally adamantly have denied events portrayed in the film, even as the words came from Kurt himself, the sources noting that Kurt was quick to embellish or make up stories to cause subterfuge in the rampant media coverage at the time of his popularity.Also very telling is that Krist Novelic was interviewed for the film but not Dave Grohl due to "scheduling conflicts." In other words, he did not want or was not invited to participate and some PR firm concocted a reason for his absence that some may choose to believe. Watch the first hour to see some precious moments of Kurt as a youngster, skip the last 90 minutes unless you enjoy being manipulated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious, or just misunderstood?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again boys and girls, it's time for a story. I missed out on Kurt Cobain, I was born the year he died, so I was first introduced to Nirvana in my middle school years, and hated it. I saw Kurt as this whiny, pretentious, junky, that blew his head off because suicide was for the weak. I was a pretty stupid teenager. But this outlook followed me until just recently when I began to wonder, what Kurt Cobain was really like. And in my curiosity, I saw this documentary, and my mindset changed. Not completely though, I'm still not a huge Nirvana fan (the only song I really like at the moment is "Heart Shaped Box"), but my opinion of Kurt changed. I feel regret for the things I said to people about him, because when I saw this I realized that he was just overwhelmed by his success.I remember saying, "Well if he didn't like being famous, why did he invent a new form of music? What an idiot!", but now I see why he felt that way. Fame is not an easy thing to handle, but could you imagine being called "The Voice of a Generation" and all you wanted to do was write songs? I certainly can't, it's almost like a double-edged sword. Kurt was writing what he felt, but it captured so many people, and he ended up pretty much being surrounded by expectations and gossip and constant media coverage. No wonder he got so heavy into drugs and eventually ended his life. I'm not gonna come out and say that Kurt Cobain is all of a sudden a musical genius because of one documentary, but I am intrigued. I'd like to see his concerts like the Paramount and his performance at MTV Unplugged, just so I can maybe learn more about him. You can expect reviews of those, in the future once I get my hands on them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not authentic but a collector's item</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this documentary for what it is. A documentary. I wasn't trying to find evidence of anything or validation of whatsoever. I lived my teens with Nirvana for the better and for the worse. Many times for the worse. This documentary is not proof of talent, it's not proof of drama per se, it's not proof of anything but a good montage of Kurt's personal and private contribution to the analysis of his own pitfall.Why I rated it 7? I knew already all that was reported in this documentary, but some stuff from his own hand made me go back in time. Travel through the mist of memory. This is not authentic but a collector's item because, and just because, people love collecting stuff. For the remedy of these new teenagers who didn't know Kurt's personal drama, here it is the 257th version of what we all know so far, i.e., a broken family triggers a broken personality, a society living off of prejudices creates an unbearable experience for empathetic kids, drugs are a false remedy and kill you (not eventually - but always). There are many ways of dying, and this is just another one, hereby portrayed in his persona with Montage of Heck. Listen to his music rather than watching drama documentaries, it will do you better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tricky but intimate doco</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As polarizing and up and down as it's subject, Brett Morgen's unique and labour intensive documentary about Nirvana front-man Kurt Cobain is an experience that will offer highs and lows but is nonetheless a must watch for any long term fan of the musician as documentaries don't get much more intimate than this.Not professing to know much if anything about the life and times of Cobain and his incredible rise to fame, riches and eventual demise, Montage of Heck will not exactly allow the uninitiated to get an exact feel for what drove Cobain and made him tick but it gives us a look into his life like never before with Morgen's access to home video footage, diary entries and archival footage, allowing an impressively vast array of elements that combine together to try and pinpoint Cobain's thoughts and mental processes.Taking inspiration from the man himself, Morgen infuses his HBO backed documentary with an at times off putting erratic nature, the film flirting between visually strong animation, nightmare like diary writings and drawings flashing and coming to life in a psychedelic manner or intimate and previously private home video recordings and photos that offer the film's most telling insights into who exactly Cobain was and what he was like at his most uninhabited, which is nice as Cobain's notoriously cold and uninterested persona in the public makes it very easy for one to not feel care towards a man that seemed intent on walking a path of self-destruction.Cobain's unhelpful habits and characteristics are what holds Montage of Heck back (and a lack of affiliation of how Nirvana came together) and while we can all feel for someone suffering from inward personal issues, nothing is ever made overly apparent as to why Cobain set about a life that could only but lead to a lonely end, even after becoming a father and vowing to walk the line of sobriety and be the parent he so longed for when he was growing up. A tormented and deep thinking soul no doubt, but if there was ever a portrayal that showed Cobain up as not an overly affable human being, it's Montage of Heck.Cobain and Nirvana's influence on pop-culture and music still lives large today and for die hard long term fans and those with keen interest in the life and times of musical superstars, Montage of Heck will be a must watch. For the rest of us more casual music listeners and movie fans however, Morgen's effort is more a curiosity than and out and out must see due to its uneasy tone and tricky central figure.3 uninterested interviews out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just the mere fact, that Cobain (and others) have filmed a lot of stuff (which is used without further comment and is there for the viewer to evaluate and examine and draw conclusions from), which is used in this documentary, make it really essential. Especially if you were a fan. But even if you weren't or just want to find out who this Cobain was, this is the place to start and find out.It's as conclusive as it gets. I don't think you can get more or better inside ones head, than it's shown here. There's of course foul language and themes that might not be suitable for children. But if you get intimate with a person (I shouldn't forget about the nudity on display here too), you're bound to see and hear things, that some might judge as unsafe for kids to watch.Very thorough, with many interviews and a lot of private time with a man, who seemed to feel doomed ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cobain: Montage of Heck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I generally like the music of Nirvana, but I don't consider myself a fan of the band. Nevertheless, it's impossible to deny the huge influence they had over the music and popular culture. In the early '90s, the "hair metal" had degenerated into an empty spectacle in which the make-up and the fixative spray were more important than music itself. So, Nirvana appeared as an alternative which changed the face of rock and popularized "grunge" movement, lacking of artifice and with a renewed emphasis on the value of music (even though, like any other movement, it eventually became a victim of the same over- merchandising which has suffocated an uncountable number of musical styles). However, like its title indicates, Cobain: Montage of Heck doesn't pretend to deal with the History of grunge and even less of Nirvana, but with the singer, guitarist and composer who became an icon of a generation. This narrow focus definitely intensifies the vision of the documentary... but at the same time, it makes it feel a bit incomplete, omitting part of the historical frame which would seem indispensable to complete the story. On the other hand, director Brett Morgen fulfilled with his mission, deeply digging into Kurt Cobain's past until getting a detailed audiovisual tapestry of his life. Home videos, personal recordings, public interviews and Cobain himself's copious notes integrate with each other into a narrative which is a bit diffuse on its shape, but not less representative of his tortured existence and the traumas (and vices) which probably contributed to his depression and eventual suicide. The result is simultaneously interesting and painful. Maybe too painful. There are passages of the documentary which, in my humble opinion, cross the line of morbidity and feel tremendously uncomfortable. I appreciate the fact that Morgen decided to depict the raw reality behind the legend, but I think he should have invested less time on that. Speaking of which, Cobain: Montage of Heck includes numerous musical interludes accompanied by animations which bring Cobain's writings and diaries to life. These animations might be a bit disturbing (we couldn't expect less in a biography of this artist), and they are always accompanied by songs of Nirvana and other artists. The problem is that I felt them a bit longer than they should; they are visually attractive and they are useful to separate the numerous interviews and "talking heads", but they tend to extend themselves for more than they should, inflating the running time to 145 minutes. Nevertheless, I found Cobain: Montage of Heck an interesting documentary, even though it will definitely have more value to the fans of Cobain's. Besides, this film renewed my respect for Cobain's legacy and generated me unexpected compassion for his tortured spirit (even if part of that torture was self-inflicted).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was interesting to watch .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I would like to start off by saying this was one of the most intriguing autobiographies I have seen yet .Except for the one made for George Harrison. A little window to what was the era of grunge and the band who led it. Nirvana (Kurt Cobain) was truly a very talented soul that was very misguided on how talented he was. Nirvana was never a copy of neither punk nor rock and roll. It certainly wasn't pop music .It was unique .It was a generation's own version of music. Kurt Cobain's voice and singing style was like no other style that was out there before him. Funny how people think it is remembered because he died at 27 . Nirvana is remembered because of the music just like Smashing Pumpkins. Very one of a kind music .... As for a look inside his background it truly hurt to watch it unfold. Hearing from his parents and sister and from Krist Novoselic somewhat felt like the unfolding on Kurt's story. The story behind Kurt Cobain . On the other hand?.. Hearing from Cortney Love, she has contradicted herself and fabricated so much you don't know if anything is the truth. She being the only one having access to the letters and his writings and songs. I hardly think we will ever see the whole truth. Even opening a vault to his belongings doesn't mean that is all there was .I would have like to see Dave Grohl included in the interviews. A band is as close and an extension of ones family per say.A few songs were played that were not originals of Nirvana . It puzzled me why they were in this film . It did show a lot of the material from one album to another was some of his earlier writing that made it on his later albums . I am not from the grunge era but I love Nirvana's music . It is one of a kind and its own style . What courage it must have took his daughter to show the world a bit what she has as a family tree. I like it ...but it was more of the negative on Kurt's part and very little of the whole person . Nothing nor anyone is all bad nor all good .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reflections on Reflections on Refractions (with spoilers maybe!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I title this "Reflections on Reflections on Refractions" This title is in terms of how the director has edited the movie to show his reflections on the reflections people around Kurt had of him and on the refractions from Kurt's work from which the director and Kurt's people are deriving their reflections. It makes sense to me (the title).{Spoilers randomly throughout but nothing I would think would disrupt the film-watching experience} The interviews with his mom are amazing and seem truer than the interviews with his Dad and even step-mom, although she seemed closer to the truth than he did. The images of Kurt painted the picture for his descriptions and his drawings were literally animated (to life) with renditions moving around. The work was seamlessly done and I am tremendously impressed with Kurt's own talent as well as that of those artists bringing it to moving picture (literally). The best parts, though, are the times he's speaking, his mom is speaking, and the home videos. There are a few great moments when Krist interjects something about Kurt's personality that feels more like observation than conjecture, and it's a nice departure from some of the editing the film seems to take liberties with.For example, in interviews the director promotes that it doesn't have anything to do with the death angle, but the movie very clearly emphasizes several writings (with jarring music, no less!) and parts to suggest otherwise. There are more than a few written mentions that could be taken out of context, for example, one writing that was zoomed in on, said "KILL YOURSELF KILL YOURSELF" at least four lines repeated, all caps-- but then right below that, "RAPE IS GOOD RAPE IS GOOD" which is obviously something Kurt didn't believe. So I am very much inclined to say that emphasis, on the "KILL YOURSELF KILL YOURSELF" portion, is beyond out of context, to the extent of being misleading. They half-cut-off the "RAPE IS GOOD" part but you can still see it. Furthermore, they took a few things out of context in terms of timing. While there are general themes of youth to adolescence to growing up to being a father, there are anachronisms throughout, mostly stemming from the aforementioned death theme. Referenced far later in the film, "I hate myself and want to die. Leave me alone" as signed by Kurdt, a name he went by early-mid in his career (as noted in the Bleach release). Let alone that this might have been satirical; even if it was literal, this was far earlier than when he died. With the misplacement at the end of the film, this forges (in every sense) the connection that Kurt felt that way then, when in fact not only do we not know if he did, but when. The film then assumes a sense of forced examples, for the writing to be accompanied by visuals via home video or slowed-down concert footage, as if to prove something. But it's completely out of context and it's bothersome.One thing I genuinely could not stand was the slowed-down images of him, as if to express how he's really feeling deep down, or to say he's sad. It was a series of slowed down glances to the crowd, where we see him looking. I feel for him if he really did feel bad, but the emphasis on it, with slowed down glances, just seems not only fabricated but like grasping for straws.And the sound modulation problems. The film has normal audio for the interviews but everything else, especially the connecting songs, is blasting. Not in the sense of the music Kurt made, with softness alternating with raging, but instead normal volume alternating with covering your eardrums with your ears and fingers until it stops, and still being able to hear everything through them. The difference was that the songs were at least double (2x) the decibels of the interviews. On the plus side, since you can anticipate the transitions, you could cover your ears and still hear and enjoy the music. In fact I'm pretty sure listening through your covered ears is the only way you can both hear and enjoy the music.The movie was fantastic in whole for his mom's interviews and the private moments with Courtney and Frances. They were priceless and so sweet, but also so personal.So on the whole, absolutely go see it if you feel you need to get closer to the home video aspect. And his mom's perspective. But for Kurt's own, I suggest sticking to what he says. I also note that if you're way deep into the stuff on Kurt, you'll have seen a lot of the footage, but the personal things and the interviews are new to this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great biopic! 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: This is a great in depth look into Kurt Cobain's life and his battle against his inner demons. Its the only documentary that has comments from his family and his wife, Courtney Love. It doesn't describe how he took his own life or show the events that happened before the shooting because the director wanted to concentrate on the happy moments of his life, which is different from many other documentaries. There is a lot of footage of him as a child and with Kurt &amp; Love alone in there house and it documents there newborn baby which shows the happier times for the couple. The many drawings which are shown throughout the movie, documented Cobain's troubled frame of mind and how his battle with fame really affected his life. I would have liked to have seen interviews from the band members and how they dealt with Cobain's mood swings because it must have been hard to hold a band together when the lead singer is hooked on heroin, with a self destructive attitude. Anyway, it's a very well put together biopic about a complex entertainer who blew up in the music world. Enjoyable!Round-Up: After seeing a lot of Nirvana DVD's, it's great to finally see a movie which documents his life in true form. The director had access to all of the things he left behind, which included footage of him as a child, many drawings and footage of him with his wife and child, so it's very real and touching in parts. You can't help feeling that it's just a waste of excellent talent, but he really lost the battle against the demons in his mind, at the young age of 27. There hasn't been a rock star, or band, of that calibre since he took his life in April, 1994 but the drummer, Dave Grohl, who isn't in this movie, has become extremely popular with his band the Foo Fighters. Anyway, if your a fan of there music, then this is definitely worth a watch because you really do get to see Kurt Cobain in a different light.I recommend this movie to people who are into their biopics about Kurt Cobain and his fight against his inner demons whilst becoming famous in the music world. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a super Nirvana fan, but the first time i watched it at home i got a little disappointed. I think this film (besides some of the interviews and his beautiful art becoming alive) lacked something, maybe perspective. It made me angry how their parents justify everything, It was Their fault that Kurt became an addict and depressive! how they let that happen?!! how a family can do that to their own child? i don't understand...It made me feel really sad, he was such a fragile and vulnerable person, maybe if he had had psychological treatment, he would be still alive today. The scenes of the home made movies are hard to watch, maybe if he was here he would had felt «violated» again. I just wish i could had help him.I don't know... it was beautifully made, i really enjoyed most of the movie, but i don't think its the «definitive» portrait of Kurt. He is seen as an addict and depressive person with a lot of problems, YES he had some of that but, what about his human side? what about the beautiful creative, artistic and sensitive person in there? The art isn't enough to show it.This movie its really similar to Heavier than Heaven, his stories about childhood and teenage years, the problems, the suicide.Y'now!? Now when i listen to Nirvana i have this melancholic feeling, like when it sounded Teen Spirit in the a cappella version... crap. *goosebumps*.If you're a fan, you're gonna enjoy this astonishing movie, but you'll also feel there's a blank space in there...I give it a 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exploitation and Humiliation of Kurt Cobain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The entire time I was watching this I just wanted to cry. I could not believe not even his daughter (who he adored, there are more pictures of Kurt and Frances than there are with Courtney and Frances, also, the expression on the face of Kurt while with Frances was lit up and beaming with pride, not the case with her mother). How could she allow this humiliation of her father who loved her more than anything on earth?? I felt it was a low down, dirty attempt to make the people who still love Kurt to this day, somehow not love him anymore because look 'he was a junkie' or he was not happy living with his 'wife' and wanted a divorce, so let's turn that into he was 'suicidal', instead of what it was, he wanted away from her and he wanted custody of his daughter. If you are at all a fan of Kurt you will steer clear of this humiliating, exploitation of Kurt. Courtney must be needing money or this was a sad attempt to dirty the minds of people who might watch Soaked In Bleach (the REAL documentary dealing with FACTS only) the one she sent letters to theaters threatening to sue if they showed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie makers nicely direct the movie to be the animation of Kurt Cobain's own mind, at least his mind which is expressed out through his scrapbook scribbles, and early on diary type notes. I really like how the early parts use a bleak and crude animation form to really give life to the story of Kurt's early adolescent life. Yet the movie goes too long in duration. Most of the home videos could have been edited away to cut on duration, just as the scene's idea gets delivered. The other that makes the movie quite weird is that in using all those scrapbook scribbles directly into the screen, the movie really didn't add more clarity so that people can read it. In resorting to maintain the original look of Kurt handwriting, the presentation lacks clarity thus disabling proper reading. The movie should have done a zoom and some kind of rolling marquee on those scribbles so that people can read most of them better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Couldn't get more intimate than this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its hard to find words to express my views on this movie. First of all, i just want to start by saying that i thought it was brilliant. When i first saw the trailers and the review quotes i had an idea of what this documentary was going to be like. After watching it, i can say that it went along the lines of what i was expecting but far surpassed what i was hoping for, im completely overwhelmed by what i just watched. The documentary offers a very personal glance at the life of Kurt Cobain. Many of his family members agreed to give interviews and share their views on his life on camera. Several intimate family clips are also shown in the documentary, through these was can see a little of cobain s early life and his life with courtney. Its quite hard to explain why is it that i find this movie so special but ill give my best shot. I've read many books on Nirvana and the life of Kurt in my teens. Nirvana is one of my favorite bands of the 90s and, like many others, i ve always felt affinity with the things he tried to express, or at least what i thought he was trying to express. Im not trying to analyze kurt or claiming that i knew who he was in any level. I just think, somehow, his struggles resonated with many people who were going through similar issues. For that reason, when you listen to the songs, it feels like you know him. But we didn't really know him. It seems to me even the people closest to him have had a hard time in figuring him out. This is the reason why i think this documentary is a master piece. The movie provides such a close, intimate glance into his life and into his psyche that it feels like you actually knew him, whatever it is about kurt that resonates with you, you ll feel it in a much more personal manner while watching this movie. Its so intimate that it feels strange, in some ways it feels like it shouldn't move you as much because you re not supposed to be in contact with this footage, but thats another reason why this documentary is so Special. To think that the Cobain family agreed to share this incredibly personal material with the people who loved Kurt is truly moving. To imagine Frances Bean, as one of the Executive Producers, having to sit through this footage of her father nodding off on heroin while holding her infant self as courtney cuts her hair... How hard it must have been and yet she decided to share this just so that we would get a more honest look into his life, i don't know what to say.I must say i was stunned by some of my fellow reviewers and their views. It seemed to me like some were expecting a more traditional biography. Its impossible to go into every detail of someone s life in a 2 hour movie, besides, Charles Cross's Heavier than heaven already shows a solid, detailed portrait of cobains life. To conclude: When i was reading heavier than heaven i thought "Wow, how could this guy get so close? Incredible". By watching this movie and seeing many of the things Charles Described in the book in such detail, I felt like i too, for two hours, got quite close as well. Im not interested in facts about kurt cobain's life, whats appealing to me both in his art and persona are the psychological traits that he seemed to share with so many of us. In a sea of generic books, movies, articles and TV specials this Incredible documentary stands out as the ultimate insight into Kurt Cobain as an artist but most of all as a person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look into certain scenes, rather than trying to look into them all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Intimate" is the word to use when describing Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck, a documentary with uncommonly vivid and detailed accounts of the Nirvana lead singer's life, rise, demise, and untimely death. In just twenty-seven years, Cobain accomplished more than many aspiring musicians will capture in their entire lives, speaking to a generation of young, impressionable, disaffected souls with his raucous music and his equally loud personality. Montage of Heck defies typical documentary hagiography; it doesn't stoop to the level of blind praise or idolization of its subject. It finds the most intimate and tender moments of Cobain's life and cobbles them together in a project about as manic as the man it's about.The documentary begins by looking at Cobain's early life, where he was a hyperactive child, who's mother and father couldn't quite handle. His mother talks about having to give him Ritalin at one point to calm him down, as he was constantly moving and exhausting himself, playing instruments, singing, or just being an uncontrollable force of nature. When his parents divorced, Kurt hopped around, staying with his father, his grandparents, and other relatives for no more than two or three weeks because of his erratic behavior. This inconsistent upbringing left him confused and weary at a young age, with his mother describing him as "unruly" following their divorce. He felt that a broken family was bad and shameful enough, and the fact he wasn't accepted by it made him more frustrated.Kurt's adolescence, defined by criminality, drug use, and wayward attempts to have sex, are captured through beautifully animated sequences, reminiscent of the style Richard Linklater used for his films A Scanner Darkly and Waking Life. Kurt narrates the sequence, talking about his failed sexual encounters and his excessive marijuana use, which allowed him to escape looming pressures and the feeling of being unloved by his family. This anarchic approach to live - a "seize the day" approach, if you will - is one of the many biting forces that led to the music of Nirvana being formed.That's where the linearity of Montage of Heck ceases. After about thirty minutes of talking heads, we get most of the abstract material from director Brett Morgen, who compiles Kurt's notebooks, drawings, archival footage, and audio recordings into one big sensory overload. The result is almost impressionistic, where what you bring to the documentary is as important as what you attempt to learn from it. These visuals are expertly animated and assembled, creating a sort of poetry across a large canvas of material.While rarely seen interviews with Nirvana make up parts of the documentary, the real heart comes at the end, when we see home video footage of Cobain and Courtney Love, most of the time, strung out on heroin, nicotine, and alcohol. This is all going on even while Love is pregnant with their child, Frances. This is where the intimacy really takes on a new life; before, Morgen was deceptive, making us think we were in for a talking head documentary about the life of Cobain. However, he pulls a one-eighty by showing us Kurt's unpublished journals and musings on life and love (at one point, we see a letter to Courtney Love that has Kurt proclaiming he'd make himself miserable to make her happy and even "abort Christ for her"). Such intimacy is carried out in the most explicit way, through these home videos, which bear romance, incoherent ramblings, or simple interactions between Kurt and the most close-knit family he ever had.Courtney Love, who is interviewed in the documentary, even opens up about how Kurt was in love with her up until his suicide. She states that all he wanted to do was spend time with her, following his departure from Nirvana, and even told her all he wanted to do was, upon making $3 million, stay in his apartment with her, do heroin, paint, and play guitar. If that's not living life the artistic way, I don't know what is.Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck is edited quite chaotically, and many will struggle to find a central meaning in the film. Per usual, I think such an act is a waste of time and provides for nothing but a headache. The important thing, as with most films, is to see what you can decipher and interpret from scenes, characters, and overarching ideas, and Montage of Heck is a brilliantly structured study into one of music's most enigmatic minds. We see, in a manner that only compliments Cobain's personality and overall approach to music, a manic detailing of a man's life in a manner that allows art and process to take over quite beautifully here.Directed by: Brett Morgen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, I was intrigued by the rare footage and interviews with Kurt and his loved ones. By the end, though, it really hit me, they talk about his personal life and professional success, but nothing, absolutely nothing about the music itself, his craft and its impact on the world of music. There was very little on Nirvana's history as a band. Here's a man/band that created an entire sub-genre of music, and it's all just interwoven background music throughout the documentary. Also, this documentary definitely reinforces the view that the worst thing that could have happened to him was Courtney. I firmly believe that if he wasn't constantly in a drug induced haze, he would have avoided her like the plague.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Montage of Heck: A Beautiful Mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck was an amazing look at Kurt's short life from birth to untimely death.. unlike the other documentaries in the past.. this one left no questions unanswered about his past and family life.. what you see is a mix of live interviews from the people who grew up with him, reenactments of moments that defined his life described and shown down to the T, rare audio/video recordings, notes/journals taken straight out of his original notebook. The biggest thing that makes this a one of a kind film is that it doesn't hold back on anything. It divulges into every reason why he lived the way he did, and did the things he did at the rate he did them at! Besides all the personal lyrics and revealing songs put out by Nirvana, this is probably the closest anyone will ever get to knowing what was truly in his head. The biggest shocker for me was that Courtney Love had no control over the Final Editing process so you get to witness on film the intimate moments of Courtney and Kurt in love, there drug binges, and heartbreaking moments after Francis was born in which Kurt was barely there as a father to her because of his own problems. Watching these things unfold on camera, you get a feeling that Kurt desired as much attention and nurturing as Francis, because he was a very fragile and sensitive soul. Despite all the tragic aspects of this documentary, there is an equal amount of positive things that celebrates Kurt's short life and accomplishments. I admired the fact that Kurt never considered himself the best singer or guitar player, but over time his ambitions and drive to become the best, motivated him to write some of the greatest songs ever... not just because they are timeless or sound good, but because they mean something to a lot of people even 25 years later!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Captivating You Don't Notice the Length</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People are free to love him or hate him, or anything that falls in between those ends of the spectrum, but it can't be denied that Kurt Cobain had a profound and lasting influence on music and our culture in general (at least for the couple of generations that merged around that period in the early to mid 1990s). Watching Montage of Heck served to take me back, in a sense, to the adolescent and teenage kid I was back then, listening to a cassette of Nevermind on a Walkman during the long bus rides to and from school...hoping that my batteries wouldn't die because I didn't want to have to listen to the kids around me, or god forbid be forced to interact with them. This is a documentary that people should watch even if they hated Nirvana or felt that Cobain was junkie trash...because it gives us a glimpse into the life and the mind of a man who really was an artist, regardless of what you personally think of his talent or lack thereof...that's the thing about art, it's subjective and you don't have to like the art someone produces to recognize them for what they are and respect at least that aspect of the person. The animated segments voiced over by Cobain's words were interesting, the old home video footage from his childhood was actually quite touching, the additional home video footage from the pre-success Nirvana performances were a nice addition as well, and the interviews from family, Krist Novoselic, and friends fleshed the rest out in such a way as to make this one of the most well-crafted documentaries I've seen. I could be biased though, because I have loved Nirvana since the first time I heard them, and never stopped enjoying the music...and I won't forget the sense of shock I felt, being at track practice when the announcement came over the radio that he had killed himself. I never knew the man, though I would have loved to have met him when I was younger, but he did play a part in shaping me during those years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film does a really nice job of not over-simplifying anything that happened in Kurt's life, and not trying to really explain it. It also isn't all that interested in bombarding us with a lot of talking heads and facts, and instead relies on many different source materials to try to not just tell Kurt's story, but tell it in a way that mostly captures his life spirit. In that respect, it's really just a mood picture of a kind, and one that needs to be payed very attentive to to really appreciate. I don't think it does enough of anything that is particularly too different from other documentaries of its kind, but it's a very worthwhile experience and one that fans will absolutely love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10 Stars .Perfect film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film goes beyond expectations in allowing the viewer (no matter what generation they grew up in) to go far beyond the limitation in which society perceives Kurt Cobain. Powerfully and Masterfully executed by Morgan in a way that Slams the door shut on years of of numerous Kurt /Nirvana/Courtney investigations and documentaries. This did not show us who did what, when, how ,why an so forth.It Solely is about Kurt,and allows the millions of human beings around the world,many who have been directly impacted by Cobain,to gain unprecedented access into artistic mind and spirit of this mans genius.The film also flaunts Cobain's intelligence,artistry,kindred heart,and words flawlessly to a point in which the viewer can not help but become completely submerged into the mans soul.It is now established factually to millions and to those who may not have liked the man or his music, that his mark on the world has and still to this day permanently stains into the heart an undeniable experience through his creative genius, This film Brings you closer to the elements in which thousands and thousands have yearned and searched for throughout the years as if hoping to mend a wound Cobain created in his passing. Kurt Cobain was and is way more than what he has been perceived as. This film shows you that whatever we thought about generation X 's hero,..is wrong. And that Kurt Cobain did was Underestimated and unappreciated to a fault.Finally the world can see that we in fact did lose The one human being thousands among thousands of people turned to in order to connect and relate.but undeniably lost the greatest all around artistic rock star in our time.Morgan has mastered his craft to a fault.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best documentary I could've wished for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got to see the film in the cinema (quoting Brett Morgen: "as it was intended to be seen") and the whole experience was amazing, from start to finish. The film in itself was created in a way that allows the viewers to look right inside the personal life of Kurt Cobain, and really experience a large part of his life as if it were in first person. It makes one understand things in the way he saw them, and also more about the people around him, as well as his own life choices. In terms of structure, it is, as it is called, a montage, with animated diary entries, old clips, audio recordings and other personal instances of Kurt's autobiographical entries, in which he himself narrates his life, and allows us to see, from his childhood until his death, how he experienced life, all while hearing some of his best songs in the background. Not only was it very informative, the documentary is very enjoyable to watch.Being such a huge fan of Nirvana (and Kurt's person), I absolutely loved every second of it. It is probably the only fully unbiased documentary about Kurt's life, which does not try to push opinions related to his death onto anyone, rather tries (and succeeds!) to portray his LIFE as it was, as well as personal details from Kurt's own perspective. So yeah. All my respect and admiration for Brett for creating this wonderful documentary. I honestly can't understand how there can be people who do not appreciate this. It's my belief all documentaries should have similar levels of detail in them. I also think everyone should watch this, even if they're not fans of Nirvana, because in the end, this is the story of someone's life and gives an all new viewpoint about him.RIP Kurt Cobain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Montage of Heck: The Story Changes Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was great but it only enhances the murder theories as it does not show a man who was suicidal, the one twisting that is Courtney, and its obvious to anyone that shes lying (body language) when she talks about certain things. This film just raises more questions than anything. I will be looking forward to the other documentary 'Soaked in Bleach'. You have to hand it to Courtney Love. The official story of Kurt Cobain's death, that the man was congenitally suicidal and finally committed suicide in April, 1994, has been springing leaks for over 20 years. But this woman continues to work hard, really hard, to plug them up. And Montage of Heck is her latest, and in my opinion, her weakest attempt to maintain the lie.In Montage of Heck. Wendy O'Connor, Don Cobain, Kim Cobain and who knows, perhaps even Krist Novoselic-are all people who have long been under Courtney's thumb. But for me, the most troubling interviewee is Wendy O'Connor.The reality is that Wendy never supported Kurt's music career, which she freely admitted to Azerrad two years before Kurt's death."A lot of people ask me: 'When's he going to buy you a new car? When's he going to buy you a house?' says Cobain's mother. "I couldn't even accept it if he offered it. We could have helped him along if we would have realized that this was really going to be something. We thought he'd get over it. I wish we would have helped him out a little more. He owes us nothing." ["Inside the Heart and Mind of Kurt Cobain", Rolling Stone, April 16, 1992] Apparently Kurt agreed because he never gave Wendy a cent after he became successful and had only occasional (and always reluctant) contact with her. So it should surprise no one that Wendy made no attempt to locate Kurt after he went "missing" in April, 1994.The weird thing is that Courtney quickly cultivated a close relationship with Wendy after marrying Kurt, for reasons that remain unclear. In fact, for years Courtney has been directing Wendy on what to say and to whom about Kurt and his death. For example, when Courtney filed a false Missing Person's Report in Wendy's name on April 4, 1994, just days prior to the discovery of Kurt's body, Wendy publicly went along with the lie. And during the ensuing days and months, Courtney continued to exert complete control over Wendy and even prohibited her from speaking to Tom Grant.In 2001, Courtney issued a press release in Wendy's name viciously disparaging Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl and Wendy went along with it.I don't know what's going on between Wendy and Courtney because they have certainly had their share of disagreements, most notably in 2006 when Courtney foreclosed on the home she bought for Wendy a few years after Kurt's death. But for some reason, they seem to be getting along again.Any good criminal investigator will tell you that innocent people do not change their story much over time, while guilty people tend to alter their alibi often to cover their tracks. In due course, the most interesting thing about Courtney's interview in Montage of Heck is how she changed her story regarding Kurt's alleged Rome suicide attempt on March 4, 1994, and not for the first time.In 1994 Courtney told Rolling Stone that she fell asleep and awoke sometime between 3:00 and 4:00 AM and found Kurt lying on the edge of the bed with $1,000 in his pocket and a note. A couple of months later Courtney told SPIN Magazine that she woke up at 4:00 AM and discovered Kurt lying on the floor with blood coming out of his nostril, holding $1,000 in one hand and a note in the other. In any case, the ambulance did not arrive until 6:30 AM. Why the two to three hour delay in calling the ambulance? It's a gaping hole in Courtney's alibi... a hole Montage of Heck tries to fill by claiming that Courtney woke up at 5:30 AM that day.Sneaky.Moreover, Courtney told Rolling Stone that Kurt had ingested 50 Rohypnols in Rome. But in Montage of Heck she claims that Kurt took between 60 and 70 Rohypnols. Courtney also claims, for the first time, that Kurt attempted suicide in Rome because he thought she was cheating on him and felt betrayed. "I never, never cheated on him, but I certainly thought about it one time in London."Although Courtney never uses his name, that person in London was Billy Corgan, and Courtney most definitely did cheat on Kurt with Corgan in London. She even went on vacation with Corgan a few weeks after Kurt's death, even though she was still playing the grieving widow in public.In fact, we still maintain that the Rome overdose was really the first attempt on Kurt's life, not only because Courtney's entire story about what happened that night remains highly suspicious, but because it continues to change. However, it is important to note that Tom Grant has never once changed his story about his investigation into Kurt Cobain's death over the last 21 years.One gets the sense from watching Montage of Heck that it won't be long before this massive pile of lies comes crashing down on them.Screenshots of a sampling from the MOH review posts on our FaceBook page at: HTTP://www.facebook.com/tomgrantpi</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Did you know" fact is suspect (review of post; not film)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Squirrel Nut Zippers were an influence? A swing-revival band formed a year before Kurt Cobain's death? Really? The other bands, sure. But SNZ? Don't think so. And the, "of course, Velvet Underground." Come on. If you're gonna put your own favorite bands as someone else's, be a little less transparent about it. I'm sure the velvet underground was up there in terms of influence, but the "of course" suggests that EVERYONE worth a damn was influenced by the VU, suggesting the writer is stating an opinion rather than a fact. Where's Melvins? Where's Sonic Youth? Where's REM? All larger influences, all sited in liner notes, all friends of Nirvana. "They were influenced by The Spin Doctors, my dog Fluffy, and Mrs. Sharvette, the greatest goddamn third grade teacher in Erie, P-A!" Sites like IMDb are great and terrible for the same reason: everyone has a voice, whether they deserve one or not.</fullReview>
