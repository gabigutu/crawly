		<shortDescription>Now this is a good movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The overall production was stellar.Ethan Hawke gives a honest performance that showcase his most endearing qualities as a fine thespian. His portrait of Chet Baker is impressive. Hawke and Cameron Ejogo who played his girlfriend in the film had a lot of chemistry between the two of them, which is good because the movie centers on the both of them greatly. I herd her role is more of a mixture of many women Chet seem to be able to pull down, which only makes her performance more important, as she goes from being a coworker in a movie about his life to his love interest, the mother of his child, and most importantly the muse the keeps him going and inspires him to kick his drug habit in order to get better and play better.The imagery of the film was great, it was not too colorful but gave a bright California vibe known in 1960s movies.And it was a well told story about about drug addiction. It was not one of these things where you should feel super sad for the person cause he can't stay off the stuff. It was a honest look about an insure man who could not function properly without heroin in his system. Truly a masterpiece in cinema when you can tell a fantastic and interesting story in a motion picture that does not to use Hollywood clichés in it. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>West Coast Swing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Most biopics aim for historical accuracy with only the occasional stretching of facts for dramatic effect. Within the past couple of weeks, I've seen two that take a much different approach ? fictionalized versions of jazz icons ? legendary trumpeters Miles Davis (Miles Ahead) and Chet Baker. Writer/director Robert Budreau expands on his 2009 short film to deliver a feature length look at the talented and troubled Baker ? with a huge assist from Ethan Hawke.The film begins in 1966 with Baker locked up in an Italian jail cell. Bailed out by a filmmaker who wants Baker to star in his own life story, a flash back to 1954 allows us to see Baker at his musical peak. As he heads into a gig, he asks an autograph seeker "Who do you like best, me or Miles Davis?" The question could be arrogance when asked by another artist, but it's our first insight into the insecurity that Baker struggled with his entire life. His desire to be liked sometimes conflicted with his goal to be great. But like the story of so many musical geniuses, it was the drug abuse that continually sabotaged the talent.Carmen Ejogo (Coretta Scott King in Selma) plays Jane, a fictionalized blend of Baker's lovers through the years. The two of them are good together, though she is as much a caretaker as a lover ? keeping him on track and nursing him through the (many) tough times. Baker received a savage beating that cost him his front teeth and ability to play the trumpet for years. The movie presents the beating as drug-related, but history is unclear on the matter. Still, it's painful and brutal to watch Baker bleed for his art.Baker is credited as the inspiration of West Coast Swing, though it's quite challenging to relate to yet another junkie musician ? no matter how talented. He's just not a very interesting guy as presented here. Talented, yes ? but not very interesting. Additionally, none of Baker's music is actually heard. It's been reimagined, just like his life story.Despite the issues, Ethan Hawke delivers what may be the best work of his career. He is tremendous and believable as both the talented jazz artist and the insecure drug addict. Director Budreau creates a dream-like atmosphere at times, which adds to the "is it real" style. The 1988 Oscar nominated documentary "Let's Get Lost" is probably a better source for Baker's life story, but Budreau's take does capture the man's struggles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully Acted: He Loved His Horn and His Heroin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ethan Hawke stars in this beautifully acted portrayal of jazz trumpeter and singer Chet Baker during his prime. Know that the film treats the facts of Baker's actual biography, as one reviewer said, more like a chord chart than a score and riffs from there. What is true-to-life is that Baker was an only child, born on a lonely ranch in Yale, Oklahoma, and went on to have numerous relationships with women and a long-term relationship with heroin. Musically, he was a progenitor of West Coast Swing, but always had his eye on the New York scene, with the mantra: "Look out Dizzy, look out, Miles. There's a little white California boy coming for you." An accident when Baker was 12 caused him to lose a front tooth, after which he had to re-learn to play the trumpet. That was a mere warmup to the effort he had to put in after his drug dealer pistol-whipped him and knocked out all of his front teeth, destroying his embouchure. Yet, he couldn't stay away from heroin. He thought it made his playing better, and he was all about his music. While Baker had a great talent for improvisation and sustaining a melodic line, he had no talent at all for being happy. After one important comeback milestone, his manager (Callum Keith Rennie) asks, "Would you try to be happy for more than ten seconds?" This line provides the ironic overlay to the choice of title for the film, one of Baker's big hits. Hawke did the films vocals; the trumpet playing was by Canadian trumpeter Kevin Turcotte. Written and directed by Robert Budreau, the movie has an opening scene that shows how a girl he picked up after a performance casually introduced him to heroin, and he didn't say no. This scene turns out to be part of a movie being made about him and whether such a significant life event happened in such an offhand way, we don't know. The insertion of black and white scenes, some of which may be from the movie (which was never finished) or from his memory, plays with the order of events, especially early in the film, an improvisational approach to history that mimics jazz music itself. Although Baker does get clean for a several years as he is recovering his playing ability, a return to heroin remains a risk in the music business. As his parole officer says, "You go into a barber shop and sit in the chair long enough, you're going to get a haircut." Still, his parole officer, his girlfriend?the delectable Carmen Ejogo (playing a composite of several women)?his manager, and many musicians wanted him to succeed, including Dizzie Gillespie and Gerry Mulligan. Miles Davis, notoriously prickly, was not a fan, and we'll get a chance to get his side of the story in the biopic with Don Cheadle, coming soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>even Miles would applaud for this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't go as far as to say that Ethan Hawke was "born" to play Chet Baker (no pun intended to the title), but this is the kind of performance that tends to be talked about for years to come. There's no front put up between him and the audience, and despite the vocal change to be a little more hoarse or whispery or however it was that Baker was naturally from his Oklahoma-cum-cigarette-strewn roots, it feels as if Hawke has slipped into Baker's shoes from the outset and that he just IS him. And though it's mostly set in the time period where Baker bottomed out the hardest - getting his teeth knocked out by a dealer while shooting a movie featuring himself as his own character in the 'Chet Baker Story - with those scenes from the movie in the movie (whether they were filmed or just imagined by Baker from the script written for him) Hawke gets to play multiple time periods and not in a typical bio-pic format.As an actor he gets to have such a complex, vulnerable person to slip into, and at first I wasn't sure how he would do. I think Hawke's a terrific actor, though a lot of the time it seems as if it's just Hawke as... Ethan Hawke on screen, with some exceptions (like Gattaca), and even in the 'Before' films it seems just like it's this cool guy getting in front of the camera. It seems like a lot to keep harping on the lead performance like it means everything but in this case it kind of does - there's no Giamatti or Elizabeth Banks like in last year's Love &amp; Mercy, and also the filmmaker behind this, Robert Budreau, is not making filming it quite like the standard bio-pic: long takes where the actor (also co-star Carmen Ejogo for most of it) has to keep our attention while playing a famous musician who was not someone with a presence off-stage that was immediately compelling.There's a lot to dig in to here thematically, whether it's drugs or race (Baker being the 'white boy' among the black giants like Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie, the former doesn't take too kindly to Baker in the 50's prime by the way), but while watching the movie you don't need to think about that. It's simply about this man who has his own way of going about things, is gentle in his way, and yet there's an intensity, bordering on a rage, that makes him compelling. Is it about addiction as much as the Eastwood Charlie Parker movie (Bird)? Yes and no - yes in that it's always there, as it is for all addicts, and when a scene like after he plays a show at the local bar (where he's trying to rebuild his trumpet playing skills) and a 'fan' slips him some dope (to which he responds "I thought you were a nice girl"), it seems hard not to sort of feel sorry for Baker that he's in a world where it's almost expected, in a way, for the Jazz heroes to be stone-cold junkies.But no in that it's primarily a love story, which is where the chemistry between Hawke and Ejogo is especially crucial and, in this case, kind of strange and awesome in the approach. Many times you simply see a famous musician or actor or whoever in a movie meet a girl and fall in love and they have the ups and downs (Ray and Walk the Line are little else if not that), but here the twist is that Baker meets his love interest as she is playing his *former* lover in the movie-that-didn't-finish in the 1950's. It's a meta touch, but it's not to the point where the director takes us out of the film to any annoying degree; it's cleverly done in the opening 10/15 minutes where we think, the audience trained on clichés of biopics, that we're seeing a black-and-white flashback of this jazz-man's story of playing in Birdland and doing such things as the "first time" on heroin with some local girl. The trick is that Baker is always Baker, whether it's in the 'real life' of the movie or the movie within the movie, it's all a movie, after all! It helps that the music is wonderful, and that's not something that is incidental; I have no idea if Hawke is playing the trumpet (he likely isn't, a handful of actors play their own stuff, let alone well, in these movies), but he does have to sing, and it's remarkable work on songs that require a thin line to walk on. Baker wasn't that phenomenal a singer except in the aspect of ripping-off-skin-to-see-the-insides honesty. It hurts to see Baker sing, and to see Hawke sing as him, and all the more that they're tender love songs. It doesn't necessarily come right away either, as the first passion for this man was the trumpet. Whether he comes to it by himself is something the movie leaves out (though I could surmise it was organic), but the point is that by the time the last third comes we've seen this man live a real life, which is all that Miles Davis asked for anyway.A sincere, heart-breaking and simultaneously uplifting movie that is just a drama about a man working his art (among the giants always in his mind or in front of him), and a true-life story second. That it involves one of the coolest of his form is a bonus, and with an actor delivering a career-highlight work as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another first class picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ethan Hawke as Chet Baker is giving us a characterization of Chet Baker not as the person but surely as what it felt like to be Chet Baker. It is Chet Baker trying to understand himself and how his music was a projection of himself to which he was always striving to make more perfect. No human can do this therefore the heroin was an escape from himself.Carmen Ejogo positively shines as the two women in his life. As his girlfriend Elaine she tries to bring some sense of balance and grounding into his mixed-up life and realizes late into their loveship she will always be second to his music and drugs.This story is fascinating and painful. And this is where the viewer may experience compassion burnout because Baker is forever making the same mistakes. He cannot see this but you the viewer will see it and by movies end you just do not care anymore. Everything about this movie is right but by the end you are just at the point of being bored!Still this is a film worth every minute of viewing time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Baker Act was perfect!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Holy Chet! The Chet Baker biopic "Born to Be Blue" was a whopper of a film. Its suave style is reminiscent of another Baker jazzy film, which is the classic "The Fabulous Baker Boys". Chet Baker was a renowned trumpeter and jazz legend who had a near lifelong addiction to heroin. "Born to Be Blue" focuses on Baker in his 40's. His career has gone down the tubes, he gets brutally beaten by some drug dealers, and he cannot play his trumpet due to his injuries to his mouth. Baker then meets a beautiful aspiring actress named Jane who plays as an inspiration for Chet to get sober and make a jazzy comeback. Writer-Director Robert Budreau plays all the right tones in his direction and screenplay of the picture. Steve Cosens' cinematography was a picturesque mastery that should get him many encores to work in other movies. Ethan Hawke does not blow it at all as Baker; in fact, his Baker Act is the best performance of his illustrious career. His work as Baker is born to be an Oscar. Carmen Ejogo was sweet music to my ears in her performance as both Jane and Baker's ex-wife Elaine who was shown in flashbacks. Callum Keith Rennie manages to do some fine work as Baker's longtime manager Dick. The music of "Born to Be Blue" was a grand piece of Chet. I have no doubt that this movie will be in my Top 10 or even 5 of my favorite films of 2016. I was absolutely enamored with this stupendous movie! True "Born to Be Blue", baby I love you! ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hawke is awesome, the film not so much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Am I aware that substance abuse is frequent in the entertainment business? Yes. From Ray, Walk the Line, and I See the Light, am I aware that some great artists became great while abusing drugs and alcohol. Yes? Is Born to Be Blue, about jazz trumpeter Chet Baker, more of the same? Yes. I just can't believe there is no more to the lives of Ray Charles, Johnny Cash, Hanks Williams, and Baker than abuse. Apparently, filmmakers believe we are anxious to experience these artists' dark abuse sides. For me, NOT! Or rather I more prefer to experience their music trajectories and intricacies than their vulnerable abuse sides. Baker, once the premier trumpeter with his West Coast Swing, fell from grace for guess what? Heroin administered by a groupie and almost in plain sight of his wife. As for his next wife (playing both wives is Carmen Ejogo), Jane takes the clichéd role of loving support with little individuality.Notwithstanding the formulaic nature of Born to Be Blue, Ethan Hawke's performance as Baker is a career high for its depiction of Baker's obsession with music and his poetic, vulnerable side. Never for a moment do we believe he will forsake his calling for pumping gas or Mariachi playing, temporary measures to keep the authorities off his paroled back.When the film comes to an end, we can be pleased that the usual biopic tragic ending is upended by his continued success in Europe. Just as Baker was reborn in a concert before the likes of Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis with the help of drugs, so too did his European gig thrive on the addiction, right to his death. It is gratifying that the filmmakers didn't re-imagine that part and that it at least doesn't follow the usual redemptive path.Although like me, you may shout "enough" at the drug motif, we can both say we enjoyed getting to know one of the greatest musicians of the last century."The thing to judge in any jazz artist is, does the man project and does he have ideas."

		<shortDescription>Chet as many will recognize as accurate and others as the actual Chet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start is necessary to say that this movie wouldn't be half as good without Robert Budreau's vision. Otherwise, it would be just another bio-pic about a musician that people kinda forgot.Burdreau's bold decisions, like using the black and white "footage" of the movie Chet was staring as flashbacks, and by that, having one actress, the lovely Carmem Ejogo, playing two parts, both as Jane and Elaine, or having two actors on one row, like Dick, by Callum Keith Rennie and Joe Cobden. If half of the success was on the decisions of the director, the other half it has to be on Ethan Hawke's performance. He incorporated completely the character of Chet. Everything, from the body language, the gestures, the expressions, the pantomime at the trumpet and the voice. The way of talking was pure Chet Baker, part smooth and romantic, part cynical and hopeless. The insistence with the fake teeth. All of that was pure Chet. Hawke is a hard actor to lose on the character, there's always something that identifies Hawke, that makes you remember "Training Day", the "Before Trilogy" and even "Sinister", that common thing to his performance in those otherwise completely different movies. But in "Born To Be Blue" Hawke vanishes inside the character, maybe for being as cool as the actor, but in no moment I could see other person but Chet Baker. For me, that will be his image, more than any other actual footage of the musician.Talking performances, the co-star Carmem Ejogo was just delightful. And even both parts not being superficially much different, there was nuance. Elaine and Jane had different dynamics with Chet, and most of it pass under the radar, but to make it work as it did in the final cut, it was great. And there was Callum, the eternal Great Ashby, but here he delivers a solid performance as the producer Dick Bock, sometimes a worried friend, sometimes a guy that is tired to trying to save someone who don't want to be saved.The story. Well, that's an unauthorized bio-pic, and its synopsis state already that this is "A re-imagining of jazz legend Chet Baker's musical comeback in the late '60s". How much of what we see in the movie is factual? How accurate is Budreau's script? Does it matters that much? Born to be blue is engaging, not 'cause its a bio- pic, but 'cause it's a good movie, with a good script, a good directing and good performances. What's true or not, we may let it to the next documentary on Chet Baker.This is a must watch!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a great jazz musician, who has an addiction to heroin. He tries to stay clean and get back into the music world, but doors don't reopen easily."Born to Be Blue" tells a heart wrenching story of a man who lives through tough times. He gets tremendous support from his wife, and their relationship is positive and touching. He works hard to make a comeback, and I find it so touching.The songs in the film are very good. I wonder if Ethan Hawke does all the singing, because he has this soothing voice which almost makes him the new Michael Buble. I enjoyed watching the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Born to Be BlueThe key to being a successful musician/drug addict is picking the most lucrative genre in which to perform.Unfortunately, the strung-out artist in this drama chose Jazz.Failing to pay his drug debts, jazz heartthrob Chet Baker (Ethan Hawke) has his front teeth kicked in in front of his new girlfriend (Carmen Ejogo). Unable to play his horn he must now answer to a parole officer who requires him to find a real job.While he agrees to undergo drug treatment, Chet refuses to give-up performing, even though his new affliction leaves him sounding like an amateur.While Hawke turns in a remarkable portrayal of the embattled Baker, the Baker he is depicting isn't the real Chet Baker, but a fictional account of the addict that uses his bumpy history and embellishes it with substantial poetic license. Besides, junkies make the worst fans because they never leave after the concert. Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent movie about a person I had never heard of but became interested as I watched. Hawke is the reason to watch though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Real talent always flourishes, but then there's the type that promises more than they can fulfill." Chet Baker (Hawke) is one of the best trumpet players in the world. He has played with Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis and can hold his own. After getting out of jail he attempts a comeback. Movies and music come back easy to him, until his drug habit takes over and everything he knows and has is threatened. This movie has two things going against it right off the bat. First, it comes out shortly after the Miles Davis movie with Don Cheadle. Second, this person is not nearly as well known as Miles Davis was. That said, I still like jazz and bio-pics so I was hoping this would be good. It is hard not to compare the two movies since I just saw the other one last week. I thought Miles Ahead was a little better, mainly because it seemed to move a little faster and there was more than just this happened to him, and then this happened. Neither of the movies however were amazing or classics along the lines of Ray or Walk the Line. What this movie had was terrific acting. I have never been a real big Ethan Hawke fan, but I really think he could get a nomination for this one. He is the reason to watch. Overall, a decent movie about a person I had never heard of but became interested as it went along. Hawke is the real reason to watch though. I give this a B-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Work of Fiction, not the actual trumpet man Chet Baker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was going to say initially that Ethan Hawke was miscast, but since this is a work of fiction it does not matter. It is a story of a trumpeter addicted to heroin, who together with his lady friend struggles to establish a career. But Chet Baker has nothing to do with it. Kevin Turcotte played all his solos, and I particularly liked the piano of David Braid, who I had seen in Toronto. There is no mention or reference to Chet's association with Gerry Mulligan the baritone sax player and their pianoless quartet which became world famous. The trumpeter in this story was beaten by a drug dealer and his cronies, so badly that his teeth were purposely knocked out and of course we all know this is what regrettably happened to the real Chet. I heard Chet Baker on Music for Moderns on the radio in the 60s in England and I was fascinated by him and his sound. Happily I can say I have much of the important music he created in my CD collection. And today computer to stereo 20 ft away via Apple Airport Express wirelessly.... Russ Freeman on piano, with Chet playing "Bea's Flat"simply blew my mind. I mean the original 1953 recording version with Larry Bunker on drums (not the Boston 1954 later version). Listen to that and you will hear amazing melodic and inventive trumpet at medium tempo with piano bass and drums, and for any trumpeter reading this I challenge you to play it. I am a jazz fan, Chet was a jazz trumpet man I can never forget... from Malcolm Hopkinson in Toronto Aug 2016</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a bad semi-biographical music-drama with a little romance in it, but many of us have no idea of its existence because it is not a Hollywood. For me it was just an above average, because of the first 30 minutes. In those narrations it was very boring, you know a film needs a good opening and this film's first impression failed. But next one hour, till the final scene was much better. Except I hated the whispering dialogues which this film had everywhere.I don't know who is Chet Baker, thanks to this film for introducing him to me. This story is no special compared to other biopics related to music and singing. Like fame and drugs taking over the career where one struggles to rise back from the fall. This is the same old crap, except it is a jazz theme, but everything was lightly portrayed without making much complication. I mean it centres only on the romance and music, everything else was never given preference. Except in parts where the couple seeks support from the outside world like the opportunities and meeting their parents.The film focused only a certain stage of the life of Chet. It is very sad not knowing his earlier life as well as his Europe settlement in the later on which looks much more interesting than what they narrated in this. Ethan Hawke was great as usual and so his co-stars. There's no harm for once viewing, but some people feel it more depressing than enjoyable or entertaining. So the film is for the selected audience and make sure you're one of them before going for it. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think this is a great film, not by a long shot. That may sound critical, but it's how I feel. I think it sidesteps many more interesting directions it could have gone in and instead chooses the safer, more predictable route a lot of the time. More than anything though, it serves as a vehicle for Ethan Hawke. He's always been a very solid, very reliable actor, but he doesn't really get many meaty dramatic roles like this. He does wonders with the role and really makes the lead character as likable as he could be, taking into account the circumstances. Definitely a solid watch and definitely a film for Ethan Hawke fans who wish he would get more parts like this. Some really great music as well.</fullReview>
