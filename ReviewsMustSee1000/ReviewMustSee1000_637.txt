		<shortDescription>Excellent Job of a Difficult Task</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a professional live theatre stagehand. People who are too centered on movies will have a hard time with this picture. If you could see the original first run performance of this play in Elizabethan England you would think you had stumbled into an over-costumed poetry reading. If the movie is hard to follow try &amp; imagine what viewing that play would be like. It is the measure of Shakespeare's greatness that now 400 years later &amp; in a medium born of photography that this greatest of fantasies still rings true. Try to show some respect; Shakespeare defined modern English. In comparing the lines to the original I thought that the adaptation was sensitive &amp; well thought out. Simplified to fit the film medium but not sacrificing any of the truly great lines that actors drool over. The fairy world sets seemed cramped to me &amp; reminded me of Cocteau's Beauty &amp; the Beast. I personally found the setting of the movie in turn of century Italy kind of fun. Resetting Shakespeare in times &amp; places other than he wrote is pretty much standard practice. The bicycles &amp; the phonographs were amusing to me &amp; generated some fun business for the actors. Kevin Kline was excellent as the ass. He got you to sympathize not pity or deride. In fact the whole amateur troop was memorable. Stanley Tucci was the quintessential Puck. Calista Flockhart threw everything including the kitchen sink into her part. Don't accuse her of overacting though; you'll only give away that you have never been deeply in love. Michelle Pfeiffer was radioactive beautiful, probably fatal closer than ten feet. Rupert Everett maintained perfect believability in a difficult part which is essentially support for Puck. As an answer to anyone who thought that things were a bit oversexed. The Renaissance was all about the rediscovery of the fact that people are noble &amp; beautiful, not sinful &amp; ugly. Shakespeare was one of the greatest products of the Renaissance. The movie is true to those Renaissance ideals. To sum up; a class act &amp; class acts are not for everybody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Movie Buff's Opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen criticism of this movie saying that the language should have been changed to our post-modern English instead of being the original late-middle/early modern English that Shakespeare used. But those who say that miss the point that what makes these plays so magnificent IS the language that Shakespeare used, and to change it would be to ruin the movie.Anyways, the acting is marvelous, as it should be from such a cast as this. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the part of Titania with the utmost perfection. Kevin Kline as Nick Bottom is equally as good, and the two end up having a chemistry that is unmistakable (even if he is an ass at this point).The directing is also great - almost as good as the acting, if not as good. Costumes, sets, everything with exception of there being headlights on the bicycles, is perfect. Michael Hoffman truly pulled of a great feat with this movie, and I would recommend it to anyone.Also, on a side note, if you have trouble understanding the language, though it be English, watch the DVD and turn on the subtext.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly faithful adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a general rule, I normally don't post comments unless I have enough time to write a thorough review, and have given it much thought before hand. I'm sorry, but even though it's 2am, I can't bear to go to sleep and let the review before me just sit there. Obviously the reviewer before me seems to have no idea that the complicities that arise from the various plots go back to Shakespeare himself - and it is a great achievement by this film to manage to keep all the plates spinning and all the stories interesting.I am amazed by this film. I am a life-long Shakespeare fan and it's great to see a faithful American production. The British/American cast all worked fantasically well together - Christian Bale, Anna Friel, Dominic West, and Calista Flockheart were all perfectly cast as the four lovers. The fairies and the actors both worked very well to frame the story - and the director has managed to keep it both visually unique and incredibly entertaining.I'm not quite sure why they decided to change the location from Greece to Italy, but in an age where Kenneth Branagh is trying to make a 1940s musical out of Love's Labour's Lost, I say, the changes could be a lot worse. All in all, this is a very impressive adaptation. I'm just happy to see that Shakespeare hasn't lost his appeal to modern audiences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though some critics have dumped on this film, I was charmed by it. The movie literally sparkles. The settings are full of rich colors and magical lighting. The romantic classical music is all well chosen to help induce the hypnotic or dreamlike qualities. And the cast is an utter delight.This is a fluffy cloud of fairy dust -- just as Shakespeare intended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DEELIGHTFUL! YES!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful film and an excellent version of the classic that was done so very, very well in 1935 and 1968. No, this is not the Royal Shakespeare Company, it's Hollywood but damn good Hollywood. Why? How can canned commercial movie-making compete with the Bard's best? Why does this version make that of the RSC three years before PALE? Well, there's the cast, for one. Stanley Tucci is delightful as a drole erring Puck carrying out the directives of Rupert Everett's pompous Oberon. The delightful Cast of Players, including Rockwell, Irwin, Rees, Wright and (tah-DAH!) Kevin Klein as Bottom. The scenes with the lovelier than lovely Michelle Pfeiffer's Titania are wonderful and poignant. It is delightful to see that gentle erotica can be suggested without nudity or slathering tongues, sucking lips as well as the usual grunts-pants-moans, etc. The lovers are likewise delightful with great, fun-packed performances by Christian Bale's Demetrius and Dominic West's Lysander in complete tune with Anna Fiel's Hermia and Calista Flockhart's Helena. Even David Strathairn's Theseus and Sophie Marceau's Hippolyta are wonderful. The story is moved from Athens Greece to Athens, Italy, at the turn of the 19th century with the lovers escaping on bicycles. Stanley Tucci's confrontation with the bike is a delight. This is a wonderful film with some new twists that depart from but do not detract from the Bard. The bit with Kevin Kline's wife, hard-looking but attractive Heather Parisi, works well with the setting of this fun-filled, joyful presentation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit, that I have not read the play, so probably all of the credit for the idea goes to Shakespeare himself. But I was also caught by the magic of the pictures. The actors and actresses were so pretty, the story so nicely recited, and the atmosphere somehow magically ravishing. I got a lot of positive feelings out of this movie, and when I walk through the forest now, I am reminded of them. Well, this film did leave a wonderful trace in my mind. Hopefully, it lasts for a couple of days. I give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm amazed at all of the negative critics out there. I guess there is no accounting for self-styled esoteric esoteric bozos. It is beautifully filmed with an outstanding and sensitive cast(Calista Flockhart has Shakespearian experience, and it shows). We need to remember that first ,last, and always Shakespeare is entertainment meant to be seen and enjoyed, not analysed to death.. When he is stylized into oblivion by myopic critics the very essence and greatness of his genius is lost. This is an extremely pleasant way to introduce yourself and/or children to the wondrous magic of Shakespeare and even better if you do a little plot research. Spectacular performance except for those with scales on their eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning, a little stilted, but a must see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Midsummer Night's Dream is a very complicated play, and can get very silly at times, and this film is surprisingly faithful to the play. Yes, there was an attempt to partially modernise it, therefore the script wasn't as good as it could have been. The film itself is lovingly designed, with lavish costumes, stunning sets(my favourite being the wood set) and handsome cinematography. The music was lovely with clever use of music by the likes of Mendelssohn and Verdi. I thought the acting was very good indeed, Kevin Kline stealing the show as Bottom, most of the time hilarious, especially in the play scene, when we are shown what a bad actor Bottom really is. Michelle Pfeiffer is lovely also, and Rupert Everett is very charming also as Oberon. Callista Flockhart convinces also as Helena, and Stanley Tucci has a ball as Puck. The direction is competent, but my only other criticism is that the film is a little overlong. Overall, I genuinely enjoyed this film, not as good as Much Ado About Nothing(with Kenneth Branagh) or Macbeth (with Jon Finch), so I will happily award it 8/10. Bethany Cox.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read other reviews of this film that whine about the scenery, Kevin Kline, etc., I have to say that I have no complaints.Obviously they do not remember that the sets that are unreal are supposed to be unreal -- this is supposed to be the realm of the fairies.The scenes that are supposed to be set in reality are VERY real -- and quite beautiful.The scenes that are set in unreality are VERY unreal --and quite beautiful.Calista Flockheart did an admirable job as the always forlorn Helena.Stanley Tucci as Puck was an absolute delight.Rupert Everett as the King of the Fairies..... well, it isn't exactly a stretch.Kevin Kline did NOT steal the movie -- he was but a part of an ensemble.With the exception of Michelle Pfeiffer every one in the cast knew what their lines meant and delivered them appropriately.Titania's first speech is simply words being repeated by rote -- could have been better.I truly enjoyed this film -- it is a good introduction to Shakespeare for those that are not familiar with him.ENJOY!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gorgeous film not bad Shakespeare adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been many adaptations of Shakespeare plays over the last decade or so, most of them aimed squarely at younger viewers. You know the drill: The director picks out rocking, hip tunes to spice up the soundtrack and some hot, young stars to broadly interpret the Bard's work.That's not the case here. Kevin Kline gets to ham it up as Nick Bottom, the base mechanical with delusions of thespian grandeur, and Michelle Pfeiffer gets to show off her own acting chops as Titania, the Queen of the fairies. Okay, so maybe a little knowledge of the play itself would help the average viewer, but if you're not a fan of the play, you can still witness some absolutely sumptuous camerawork and some funny, funny scenes - many of them dealing with the spellbound Bottom, who's been turned into a jackass. Stanley Tucci underplays (somewhat surprisingly) his role as the mischievous Puck, and even Callista Flockhart turns in a solid performance as one of four human (non-fairy) lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Patchy but fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a rather muddled production, with an erratic tone and (in the video version I have seen) poor sound mixing. Michelle Pfieffer in particular seems uncomfortable making long speeches, and David Strathairn as Theseus seems to be in a different movie. Also, Dream has always been a hard piece to film, being over long with many subplots and changes of pace (plus that Shakespeare favourite, a play within a play).That said, there's much to like here. The sets and camera work are sound - there's a nicely judged fun and sexy undertone to the whole production, the fairy scenes being particularly aesthetically pleasing. Stanley Tucci plays Puck tolerably well, neither too comic nor too ironic. Rupert Everett makes a powerful, sensitive Oberon, and Kevin Kline aquits himself well as comedic support (and he would be well advised to stick to such part rather than embarrasing himself in straight pieces like The Ice Storm). The minor players make a good fist of things, and the surprise of the piece is Callista Flockhart who is unexpectedly convincing and winning as Helena, especially considering that I can't stand her portrayal of Ally McBeal.Not great, but not at all bad either, and it's easy to do this play very badly indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good and Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with, I confess that in any production of MSND I see I'm focusing almost entirely on the Rude Mechanicals (here, Kevin Kline and co.) For the most part, I thought they were great. But I, like many others, was put off by the focus on Nick Bottom. This is not supposed to be a three-dimensional character, let alone a sympathetic one. He was designed to be a joke, even his name (Bottom. Ass. Donkey, get it?) Where it went right was showing just how out of their league the poor slobs were. From the cutaway to the "Green Room" where these few men in street clothes are surrounded by acrobats, fire-eaters, etc, to the huge Opera house audience.Then the play itself was masterfully executed. I was a little put off by Peter Quince shouting out the "right" lines from offstage, (that's not in the play), but it did help make clear some jokes. I loved how they made the Moon's part improved. Most of all, I loved what they did with "Thisbe" at the end! I've never seen it done that way before and if you asked me, I would have said it wouldn't work. But it was great! My only problem was that they should have then cut the Duke's derisive line "Wall and Lion are left to bury the dead." It detracted. As for the rest, nothing that hasn't been said already. Calista Flockhart was appropriate, Stanley Tucci was amusing, Michelle Pfeiffer delivered her lines with feeling, yet the feeling seemed disconnected from what she was saying. The bicycle theme lost me, and I'd like to see at least one production of MSND actually set in ancient Athens. Overall a good film. You should see it, but maybe wait till it's the second-run theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The screen or not the screen, that is the question</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are basically two things that this movie proves, and that is that Shakespeare does make more sense when it is acted on stage (or on screen) and that the Royal Shakespeare Company production that I saw years ago is still the best, and funniest, performance of this play that I have seen (though including this movie I would have to make that count to be two). I hope that most people who are actually reading this already know what the plot of A Midsummer Night's Dream is all about as I don't really want to waste anytime going over it again, but I guess I will have to.As can be expected with most Shakespearian plays there is no one simple plot, and in fact this play is notorious for not actually having one single plot, but rather a collection of minor subplots that finishes up with a rather absurd performance of Pyrimus and Phisbie. Basically the king and queen of Athens (Theseus and Hippolyta) are getting married and stage a competition for the person that can make the best play. However, there are four younger people, Demetrius, Lysander, Helena, and Hermia, who are also major characters. Demetrius (I think) is engaged to Hermia, but Hermia and Lysander are in love, and Helena loves Demetrius. Then there is the faerie world where Titania and Oberon rule, and the Faerie king and queen are having a spat over possession of an Indian baby.Anyway, the four younger ones decided that they do not like the civilised world of Athens so they flee to the forest, and Oberon happens to spy Demetrius fleeing from Helena and finds that to be rather immature, and decides to work his magic, through his servant Puck, to make Demeritus fall in love with Helena, but Puck gets it mixed up and magics Lysander instead, and Lysander then falls in love with Helena, and thus we have a huge mix up where the four are running around everywhere and everybody is confused as to who loves who. Meanwhile, the four working class men sneak off into the woods to practice their play, and also end up under the spells of Oberon.One interesting thing that I picked up from this play, and I have mentioned it elsewhere, is the contrast between civilisation and nature. It is believed by the human characters that while under civilisation there is law, under nature there is freedom, however this turns out to be quite the opposite. Lysander and Helena flee civilisation to the forest to be free of the law of the civilisation, but end up under the law of the forest. As it turns out, by fleeing to the forest they are not escaping to freedom, but a new ruler and a new law. The theatrical version that I saw had the same actors playing Titania and Oberon as well as Hippolyta and Theseus (which adds to the weight that there is still law, and rulership, in the forest).Another interesting aspect is the nature of the dream. Once again I have mentioned this elsewhere, but the entire play in and of itself is a dream which we, the audience, are experience, and Puck outlines this at the end. However, the entire episode in the forest is also a dream for the characters, and we see that after they enter the forest they all fall asleep, and before they leave the forest, they are also asleep, so the entire episode in the forest, particularly the mix up, is bracketed by two episodes of sleep, and thus this whole escapade in a sense is a dream. Bottom says so much when he wakes up and discovers that he is no longer an ass.Further, we note that the dream world does have an impact upon the civilised world, as Demetrius falls asleep despising Helena and awakes loving Helena. What the movie managed to draw out more is the sexual nature of the play, which once again does not come out well in the written word, particularly with the language that is used. For instance, in another play I saw one of the actors, using demonic language, speaks of the man's horns and the woman's cloven hoofs, which, as it turns out, is a reference to their sexual organs.I did enjoy this film, but it was not as good as the play that I had seen. I was disappointed that they had shifted the setting to Italy, because the use of Greece in the play distanced the action of the play far back into the mythological past to add further to its dreamlike nature. Theseus and Hyppolita are both Greek myths, and exist the the time before the more historical period of Socrates, Leonidas, and Xerxes. Even the character of Lysander, named possibly after the Spartan Lawgiver, is also quite a mythological person. However, I did find the use of antique gadgets such as the bike and the gramophone to add something to the film, and added a newer dimension of how modern technology is beginning to intrude into the dream world, and in doing so, destroying the magical nature of the dream world. In the end, both Oberon and Titania leave the forest, possibly never to return, as reason begins to override faith.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shakespeare knows best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could have been a great version of MSND. It has a lot of good things in it. The cast is excellent and the director got great performances out of them (especially Anna Friel,Kevin Kline and Calista Flockhart). But it doesn't quite satisfy. Why?A Shakespeare play is like a Beethoven Symphony. No conductor would think of adding or deleting notes, let alone bars, from the 9th Symphony. The orchestra plays it as written to the best of their ability and their performance is judged on the level of excellence they achieve. It should be the same with Shakespeare's plays.Shakespeare was writing film scripts 300 years before the invention of the movie camera. He knew quite a lot about construction, pacing, characterisation and dialogue. If a screenplay changes any of these things it will probably diminish the effectiveness of the work. That is what has happened in this case. When will producers learn to put their trust in Shakespeare? This film starts with some nonsense about bustles and bicycles and then introduces a new character ( Bottom's wife ).What on earth made Mr Hoffman think he was improving Shakespeare with these interpolations? But even more damaging than the interpolations is the lack of any insight into what MSND is about.It seems to me that Shakespeare wanted audiences to think about 2 things after experiencing MSND ; 1. To what extent is our life shaped by our will and to what extent is it shaped by unseen forces we are not even aware of? That is why Hermia,Helena,Demetrius and Lysander come under the power of Oberon/Puck. Who has never fallen asleep firmly believing one thing and woken the next morning believing the contrary? Why? What has happened in our sleep? Shakespeare puts it down to fairies. Until someone comes up with a better explanation fairies it is! 2. The importance of self delusion in the pursuit of happiness. Philosophers say that to ," know thyself" is the path to happiness but Shakespeare knew better. His players are ecstatic at the end of the film because they think they have put in a performance that has dazzled the Athenian Court. Would they be happier if they knew the truth? Does this film stimulate its audience into thinking about these issues? I don't think so. That is another reason why it fails to satisfy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie visually attractive and the reinterpretations of some of the principle characters (Flockhart's over-the-top Helena most notably) to be rather charming additions. I also really enjoyed Rupert Everett's presence in this movie as a sexy, brooding Oberon, and Anna Freil's moving, and very convincing performance as Hermia. However, this movie was too clunky and seemed to run on for hours... I wish the plot had concentrated more on the young lovers than it had on Bottom and his troupe of actors; what had originally been a sub-plot almost overtakes the movie in this interpretation. Because of this the ending seems to have very little to do with the rest of the movie, and comes across as only incidently relevant to the drama involving the young lovers. Then again, I've only seen this movie once, and it may take several viewings to understand exactly what connection the director saw between the last 15 minutes of this movie and the first hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've never seen "A Midsummer Night's Dream," this is probably as good an introduction as any.But it's a bit heavy-handed, not particularly funny, and downright ponderous at times. Rupert Everett and Michelle Pfeiffer are most successful and seem to be having a terrific time as the king and queen of fairies; elsewhere the likes of John Sessions, Max Wright, Sam Rockwell, Roger Rees and Gregory Jbara make the most of their limited screen time. The lovers are a bit bland (and a miscast Calista Flockhart would have made a much better "Hermia") and Stanley Tucci is..uh..puckish (if nothing else) as "Puck" but the real disaster is the "Bottom" of Kevin Kline. It would appear to be the perfect match, but it is a wearisome, uninventive performance. This is supposed to be FUN!</fullReview>

The director apparently decided to challenge himself - but not the audience - by using Shakespeare's words, extracting every possible innuendo and making each one graphic; no subtlety is permitted. As a result, many significant elements of the resulting story are done in pantomime - since they were never in the original script (sort of an inversion of the "What's Up, Tiger Lily?" experiment). Almost every spoken line is an exercise in melodrama. Only Puck - naturally the sprightliest and most off-beat character - is pleasantly mild. Calista Flockhart manages to make her character highly appealing despite the high tragedy that pervades her every word, while romantic male leads Christian Bale and Dominic West remain thoroughly unlikeable throughout. Kevin Kline oscillates from hambone to buffoon to romantic dreamer - all of which he does well, but they don't add up to a single coherent character. Finally, the filming takes a story originally set in ancient Greece, with a small cadre of 17th-century English clowns, and transposes it to turn-of-the century Italy - without any effort to reconcile the resulting inconsistencies. The pace remains suitably frantic until the last fifteen minutes, which appear to be an attempt at sentiment but fall flat. A visually attractive film, but overall reminiscent of "Finian's Rainbow" without the advantage of interesting music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sleepy Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lush, dreamy, expertly acted, sluggish as hell... What the? That's right. All the magic, cast, and production value in the world cannot stop lead material. While I, like many people, have a soft spot for Shakespeare, this new version of "Midsummer" just doesn't move at all. Director Michael Hoffman has a real eye for lush production design. One of his earlier films "Restoration" was a triumph of set construction and costume design. "Midsummer" is the same way. It's fantastic to look at. All the departments that worked on the film construct a very believable fantasy world. The technical aspects I have no problem with. Working with massive talents like Michelle Pfeiffer and Kevin Kline (among a huge cast) Hoffman seems to have trouble making the very familiar material entertaining. The jokes don't shine through like they should, the lusty nakedness of the setting is hampered by the PG-13, and the score is almost transparent. With "Much Ado About Nothing", Kenneth Branaugh built a rousing epic with a Tuscan backdrop. Hoffman (working with the same raw materials) can only muster a few scenes that feel right. The rest of the movie is quickly forgotten. ------------ 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Genteel Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember being pleasantly enchanted by this rather winsome film version of Shakespeare's romantic comedy/fantasy when it first appeared, and it certainly looked beautiful on the big screen with its gorgeous, warm cinematography, composition and production design. It created a pleasant, warm feeling in the audience, delivering a comforting experience, and drawing a few chuckles here and there; smiles rather than belly laughs. For here the comedy is fairly genteel, and often also quite melancholic ?there is always another dimension to each moment of laughter, a story beyond, especially with the band of craftsmen who put their heart into performing, despite their lack of any real talent. Their preparations for and ultimate performance of "Pyramus and Thisbe" is where much of the comedy of the play lies, but in this film the traditional comic moments are toned down a great deal. I admire the restrained performances of both individuals and the amateur group as an ensemble, because it is so easy to go over the top with their part in the story. Here we smile affectionately rather than laugh mockingly, and our smiles are warm and sympathetic, as they sometimes are when someone in the family performs at a wedding or similar despite a lack of talent. Kevin Kline as Bottom naturally takes much of the limelight, and gives his character a whole deeper life than is normally seen, as does the very underrated Roger Rees as Peter Quince ?he gives an immensely dignified and rather beautiful performance here, full of subtle details that I only really appreciated upon viewing the film again. I found many of the magical scenes with the fairies to be quite mesmerizing, and the careful use of special effects was just right in creating moments of fantasy and wonder without overwhelming the picture. Much of the beauty of the play lies in the lines spoken by Oberon and Titania and Puck, and Rupert Everett, Michelle Pfeiffer and Stanley Tucci give great respect to the language and poetry of Shakespeare, without falling to the traps of prettifying it or making it bombastic ?it's poetry, yet living dramatic interaction too. By and large, I think most of the cast do quite well with the text, making it alive and personal, and I certainly am not one of those who despair at American voices uttering Shakespeare; quite the contrary. Here, there is a nice mix of American and British voices, and it is to the film's credit.If I were pushed to criticize the film it would be for its lack of "edge" or danger ?passion, if you like. This applies both to the two pairs of young lovers, and the fairy characters and their escapades. Everything is a little too mellow and tame, so that we are lulled more than provoked. A little more spice or audacity would have perked things up considerably, and the story certainly gives room for and even suggests this.But the director has his own vision of the play and is at least consequent in his presentation of that, and it's perfectly acceptable. The interesting thing is that A Midsummer Night's Dream may be tackled in many different ways, and the "world" that is presented here in all its lush, green, dream-like beauty is no less valid than other more provocative versions of Shakespeare's magical comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a charming adaptation. loyal to the play, using few modern pieces, beautiful cinematography, perfect cast. a film who reminds the colors, the flavors, the joy, the humor of a lovely masterpiece. all is fresh. all is seductive. and, in few scenes, almost perfect. a film who seems invent again an universe but, in fact, only impose its true nuances. Kevin Kline's work is gorgeous and Rupert Everett seems be the perfect Oberon. the wood, the story of the two couples, the delicate story of Tysbe, the grace of atmosphere of an Athens who seems between periods, all does the film a seductive adventure. and that is not surprising. only admirable because the simplicity is not easy to create in the case of A Midsummer Night's Dream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a commendable attempt that fails</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a worthy attempt at adapting Shakespeare, but unfortunately it fails. For the record, i have no problem with setting in late 19th century, or the nudity; Shakespeare would have used mud wrestling if allowed. Failing is due to other reasons.Movie takes itself far too seriously, for a play that is extremely funny that is fatal. In Shakespeare, comedy comes from absurdity, changeability, and arbitrariness, of love, even when it is intense and passionate. Love and Reason do not indeed keep company. But screenplay, instead of laughing at absurdity, presets tragedy, and almost forgets to laugh. Play within play results in tears, and not from laughter. Bottom at the end gets a lovers' farewell from Titania, instead of loathing disgust she expresses in text.Generally actors are well cast, and give competent performances. Problem with Kevin Kline's Bottom is the screenplay which underplay the absurd juxtaposition of Bottom with Titania, not him. Pfeiffer, who has proved she can act in other movies, fails to convince here as fairy queen. Even though she she looks great for the part, we see her reading lines and acting. Calista Flockhart does well as Helena.Italian town sets and costumes are excellent but wood looks fake. Bicycle obsession does not contribute anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, if not necessarily faithful adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying that this is a beautifully acted, filmed and produced version of one of my two favorite Shakepespeare comedies. the other one being "Twelfth Night." That being said, however, I have to caution against anyone regarding this as a totally faithful adaptation. Having performed in and directed "A Midsummer Night's Dream," I think I am on fairly firm ground when I ask, "Where the Hell did Bottom's wife come from?" She is not in Shakespeare's script, and the inclusion of her only serves to make Bottom an even more pathetic character than he already is. Kevin Kline provides an tender, touching portrayal, but the character is not Shakespeare's.I have seen other criticisms and comments and I must take issue with those. I know it is easy to denigrate Shakepeare's language saying it is antiquated, too old, but to replace Shakespeare with a modern translation would be to lose the beauty of his words, and the wonder of his symbolism. I suggest these critics and reviewers get a little more education. I enjoy clever plays with scenery or time. Transplanting the time of the story to near turn of the century 1900, was effective. Changing the setting from Greece to Italy was convenient for filming and didn't detract from the story, but didn't necessarily add anything either.In conclusion, this is still an enjoyable film. But it is no more William Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" than Coppola's "Bram Stoker's Dracula" was Bram Stoker's.</fullReview>

Rubert Everett was a wonderful (and visually perfect) Oberon, but oh how I wished for Emma Thompson as Titonia...(not that Michelle Pfeiffer wasn't gorgeous in the role but wouldn't Emma's voice and inflection have been just that much more perfect?), Kevin Kline was good as Bottom but Stanley Tucci as Puck? What were they thinking? Puck is (in my mind at least) young, a young impish, prankish youth.... it totally destroyed the feel of the movie for me with him in that role. I suppose I was spoiled when I saw the Royal Shakespere Company's version several years ago (fairies in doc marten boots *S*)... so it was slightly disappointing to me to see this version. However, I enjoyed it overall and delighted at the play at the end and I think the cast did a stellar job of what is a difficult play to pull off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saved by the magic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie "a midsummer night's dream is based on a story by William Shakespeare. It is set in Toscana, Italy in the 1800s, and describes a few days in some people's, and fairies' lives. Shortly, the theme is desperate love and illegal romance, spiced up with small conflicts set by the elves. Instead of turning this cute story into a romantic film, the conflicts and their rather predictable solutions are described in too long and boring scenes. The characters are not introduced too well, and as they are many it is not easy to identify with them. But as I am weak for magic with fairies and overwhelming beauty, I must say that I, at times, was convinced by the existence of such a fairy land. The special effects are very good, and the picture made of the fairy land is magically beautiful, with inspiration from the old Greek culture in the presentation of the elves. The female actors did the best job in my impression, next to Stanley Tucci, who created the only suspense in his role as Puck. All in all "A Midsummer Night`s Dream" is a charming movie, and I enjoyed it - mostly because it was good enough for me to dream away into.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought it was pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Midsummer Night's Dream is the only real work of Shakespeare's I've seen, on film or anywhere else. (Shakespeare in Love doesn't count.) I've seen this version and the old one from the '30's. I preferred this one. The performances were all pretty good, the scenery was fine, (It never crossed my mind that the forest was a set.) and the direction is pretty good, too. Even though the focus keeps going from one set of problems to the other, I never got lost. There was a debate on this site several months ago about whether or not Nick Bottom should have become a more major character in the film than he was in the play. I think it was a good idea; if I'd had to watch the four lovers chasing each other for twenty straight minutes, as I did in the old one, I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much. It helps that Kevin Kline is good as Bottom himself, and makes a good companion to the lusty, sexy Michelle Pfiffer. (sp?) Thankfully, Stanley Tucci is much quieter as Puck than Mickey Rooney. The whole production really did have an aura of enchantment about it. The only real flaw was that at the end, every scene seemed to be the last, but then they tacked another one on. This went on for about ten minutes, and got annoying, but really they shouldn't have cut any of the scenes; all add to the story. I do recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Midsummer Nights Dream Is Magic for the Dreamers in all of us!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie, "A MidSummer Nights Dream" the 1999 version was exquisite. A lot of fun for me to watch, I enjoyed it immensly. Some of my enjoyment may have come from the fact that I had just watched it performed at my old school as their school play, and the performed it 50's style. With a hot 50's soundtrack, while keeping the same shakespeare script. So it made me quite interested to see the movie. I LOVED the movie, being one that is the MASTER Of dreams, and imagination. I love that kind of stuff...faeries...magic...love...it all is the BEST kind of story imagination. Go see this movie...The cast does a BRILLIANT job in their roles. Rupert Everett does a remarkable performance as "Oberon" the king of the faeries. Michelle Pfeiffer shines wickedly as "Titania" the queen of the Faeries. Christian Bale (The ladies favorite, ask them if their a fan and they may spout out the word "Balehead") does an astounding performance as "Demetrius" the man who is to marry "Hermia" (played by newcomer Anna Friel) by her fathers demands. Hermia is, however, in love with "Lysander" (Played by Dominic West), but her father does not approve of this love. So Lysander and Hermia want to runaway together and marry. Demetrius finds out, and tries to stop them because he wants Hermia...however, Lysander and Hermia aren't the only ones being chased...Demetrius has a someone on his tail, and quite in love with him, but Demetrius does not love in return..."Helena" (Played by screen star Calista Flockhart) is the woman who cannot stop from being quite infatuated with Demetrius. This is where the faeries come in...they use their magic to try and make the right people fall in love. To make Demetrius love Helena...However, the Faeries fall into some problems and mishaps themselves. Other cast performances include, Kevin Kline as "Nick Bottom" , Sophie Marceau as "Hippolyta", David Strathairn as "Theseus" , and Stanley Tucci as "Puck", Oberon's Faerie helper. Don't worry about having to understand the shakespeare language, this is quite an easy one to catch on to, and VERY enjoyable. Don't miss this. I'm 18, and if I can catch on, then most adults can...this movie is beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entrancing telling of this sweet dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing is better on screen or stage than good Shakespeare, and this film will take its place as one of the best. Lush, beautiful Italian scenery and sets; great music including some well-placed opera arias; strong direction and camera work; and a natural dreamy tone that tops it all to make a wonderful adaptation. And with all that, the "hard-handed" "players" are a scream! We laughed along with the Duke at their most lamentable comedy, "very notably discharged." (That must have been a lot of fun on the stage of the Globe Theater, too.)Some actors must be mentioned, and it was a nice blend of British and American talents, too. Michelle Pfeiffer outdid herself as the sensuous Fairy Queen, and was matched by her powerful Fairy King in Rupert Everett--these two aren't cute little fairies by any means! Stanley Tucci wasn't over-cute as Puck, either, but caught the necessary impish quality instead. Calista Flockhart was quite appealing as the hapless, love-struck Helena. But of course the amateur players are the stars; particularly the great Kevin Kline, still one of our most under-rated American actors. It's not fair to compare him to James Cagney in the first version, but it's hard not to, since he under-played it rather than over-playing it as Cagney did so well. (That's still well worth watching!) He interpreted the part as a bit of a rouge rather than a buffoon, and it comes off great.Again, it's a wonderful production, a real treasure. This is the way to do Shakespeare.</fullReview>

Tucci's performance was superb!While many believe that Shakespeare put complex messages into the play, I think the major lesson is that funny things can happen when some try to interfere in the romance of others. As an added minor lesson, Titania falling for Bottom, who has the head of an ass, shows that anyone can fall in love with a jackass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like A Midsummer Night's Dream. It reminded me of my many errors and infatuations with certain others. I noticed a few scenes were not in the original Shakespeare production. I suppose they were put in because actions going on later in the play hinted them and the movie had them brought to life. Kevin Kline's acting was intentionally over-the-top to indicate how much of an "ass" he is to others. Calista ironically takes on a similar role on the Ally McBeal show. In both roles she playes someone who is constantly searching for love. In this movie, the search is more successful. The movie seems to be a large metaphor saying love conquers all and what goes around, comes around.</fullReview>

But Calista Flockhart is wonderfully ditzy and put-upon as Helena, Kevin Kline is a remarkably three-dimensional and tragicomic Bottom, and Stan Tucci is positively brilliant as Puck.

		<shortDescription>Thank you Kevin Kline.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Kline's 'Bottom' seems to be the linch-pin here (no coincidence that Kline takes top billing) and that's both a plus and a very big minus. Bottom was never intended to be the primary focal point of the play, but here, Bottom (and Kline) top out to become both one of the only reasons to see this laconic meander, but also the reason the film drags out far longer than it should. The completely unnecessary and un-Shakespearean Bottom bits with bottles of wine poured on top of him to humiliate him, an unhappy marriage and a lot of gooey mood lighting in a lonely bedroom designed to show that this particular Bottom once had dreams(npi)of being far more than a weaver, are Hoffman/Kline conceits designed solely to pad Kline's presence.For the rest, with the exception of a luminous Michelle Pfeiffer as Titania, once the film is over, Kline is all you remember. The casting is so bland, (in plucky Calista Flockhart's earnest case, so ill advised) that everyone else retreats into a mildly pleasant melange of faces, costumes and decor.Obvious characteristics, spelled out clearly in the play, are ignored even as they are spoken: the magic flower is called 'purple' innumerable times, but the flower Puck picks is bright red. Helena is supposed to be the physical opposite of Hermia--tall, and insecure about her height, as opposed to a dainty little doll (in Peter Hall's version: statuesque Diana Rigg versus petite Helen Mirren). But here Helena and Hermia could swap clothes in a nanosecond and if anything, Hermia would have the tight squeeze; so the protracted insult swapping (while mud-wrestling no less) about their vastly different statures is meaningless.Granted the production is "pretty" but even it's prettiness is belabored and inconsistent. The movie opens with a long shot of a Tuscan villa and its valley, proceeds to the outdoor preparations for a wedding feast and then, when the meat of the play should be set outdoors, it shuts itself up in a very theatrical set with fake foliage, foam monuments, bogus boulders, and paths so fake and unmanageable that the lovers would've been ill advised to take them on foot let alone on rattle trap bicycles. (And whose dopey idea was it to practically dedicate the entire production to the invention of the the very un-Elizabethan bicycle?)You end up witnessing a very stagey play on an obvious set, and the result--far from the magical, ethereal other-world of fairies, is claustrophobic, heavyhanded, achingly artificial. The scale of everything is out of whack. On stage, you have to have life size human beings portraying fairyfolk, but Hoffman seems to have forgotten that film is a magical medium. Here all are obviously earth-bound humans, ungainly, leaden, in some cases, gross. You're better off renting 'A Fairy Tale' for a portrait of believable fairies.Even the excellent Stanley Tucci is obviously a male actor in his forties pretending to be a sprite. And Rupert Everett, who does deliver a decent Oberon, has been so 'out ' in his public life and most of his prior roles, that having him demand Titania's little boy added a nuance Shakespeare never intended. It doesn't work.Hoffman never gives you the sense that Oberon, Titania and Company are anything but homosapiens (do fairies pee?) in glitter and gauze, then poof, when Bottom finally wakes, his golden asses' crown barely fits on his thumb and we're asked to believe his bower with Titania was a tiny birdnest.Better that this version had been called 'Michael Hoffman's and Kevin Kline's Midsummer Night's Dream' than Shakespeare's. There are far too many contemporary liberties taken, clunky additions and omissions made here, and every one of them would've made Will wince.</fullReview>

I can sum up this film in four words: comedy full of errors. William Shakespeare's venture takes the audience through one misunderstanding after another. After a while, I got tired of seeing this; I was waiting to see the crux of film , which was the love stories between two couples. I enjoyed the love story aspect of this film and the play that the players put on for the Duke. I also enjoyed the way that the scenes were set up. It was almost as if they were on the stage of a theater where one set of actors leave the stage and another set come on without either knowing of the other's presence. I won't go far as to say that this is the worst film I have seen in 1999, that honor belongs to John Travolta's bomb A Civil Action; however, this film is a nice relief than the films I've seen that contain violence, sex and a lot of profane language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been so much better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like someone else said, I really wanted to like this movie. My middle school class put it on &amp; we all went to go see it together. As we left, our thoughts were the same- we did better. And if a middle school drama class can do better, you know you're in sad shape. Michelle Pfeiffer &amp; Rupert Everett deliver flat performances with no depth or enjoyment possible. Calista Flockhart gave a performance that reminded me of how Ally McBeal would act a couple hundred years ago- melodramatic, whiny, and annoying. All four of the lovers gave performances that would suggest none of them had any clue what they were saying, with the possibly exception of Anna Friel's Hermia. Kevin Kline's performance of Bottom was the only saving factor, making it highly enjoyable. However, they turned his performance to the central factor, making the others seem like secondary characters, which I don't believe. The costumes &amp; effects are very nice. But you could see a heck of a lot more at your local theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few observations: Will Shakespeare thot the time and place for AMSND should be Ancient Greece. The Producers felt it should be 18th Century Italy. I think Will was right! This is one of the few films where the critics liked it better than the public. I think that is particularly true with Shakespeare where aural acuity is so much more relevant than in the "run of the mill" flick which the public rates higher than critics generally do. Lastly, am amazed that Anna Friel didn't cause a greater critical reaction. This young,active actress more than held her own photogenically against Marceau, Flockhart, and Pfiefer. No small feat and worthy of much more attention than she received.If Friel is properly managed she could become one of Hollywood's major new faces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can I say, it was one of the worst films I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I attended the advance screening of it and had to force myself to sit through it with hopes of it getting better. But, it never did. About a dozen people left halfway through the movie, and the ones that remained commented on how awful it was as they left. I was, however, amused at how the time period was not kept consistent. For example, the fairies were playing with plastic RCA records with conspicuous labels which I think was a bit futuristic for that time period. Also, the bikes were pretty sophisticated for just being invented. Everyone was traveling on nice mountain bikes with headlights which were just a little too modern for the recently invented bike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I generally don't put any trust in people's opinions of movies because they're usually way too harsh and critical. I was in the play A Midsummer Night's Dream (I played Hippolyta) and I personally found it just a cute, funny, silly play.It's certainly not considered one of Shakespeare's best, although I really like it. It's not like they're trying to do Hamlet or King Lear for this movie; plays that should be taken seriously. I think that the movie MSND, because of the style and purpose of the play, shouldn't be criticized so much. No one's really certain of how to interpret the play; it is silly and funny on the surface, but how much is there underneath? Suffice it to say, lay off being so harsh on the movie; there is no *one* interpretation of this unusual play.As an English major, i enjoyed watching this version of the movie as a different perspective from the play.</fullReview>

The performances were all solid with Kevin Kline's performance reaching the level of truly inspired. (His role is truly the best written of the bunch). There were moments of absolute, non-stop hilarity, but the rest were only fine. It's too bad that the pacing didn't keep an effervescent quality at all times. As much as I love opera, some of the arias used as interludes and subtext actually slowed down the momentum of this movie. The choice of setting was superb and the special effects never overwhelmed the actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW! A remarkable retelling of A Midsummer's Night Dream. Rupert Everett's Oberon has a brooding to him that I have never seen which makes that role work for me in ways it has never before. Stanley Tucci is delightful as Puck - impish and coy but not over the top. A wonderful non Ally McBeal performance from Calista Flockhart - she nails Helena's love craziness. Dominic West plays Lysander beautifully you believe how much he loves Hermia, and then you equally believe him when he hates her. But the stand out performance is Kevin Kline as Bottom! The Play within a Play has never been so funny. And Kudos to director Michael Hoffman - the introduction of Kline's character is beautifully constructed with the donkey!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1999 movie was Hollywood's take on one of Shakespeare's most popular plays. It boasts an impressive cast ? Michelle Pfieffer, Rupert Everett, Anna Friel, Dominic West, Christian Bale, Calista Flockhart and Stanley Tucci among them.Until fairly recently, I did not enjoy reading Shakespeare's work ? it seemed very 'dry' when written on a page (to me, at least). However, when his words are acted out on stage or screen, it all falls in to place, and it's much easier to appreciate the wit and intelligence of Shakespeare. In this case, I would suggest that some knowledge of the storyline of the play is helpful before watching (it does cover three interlinked stories), but it is certainly not necessary to have studied or read the play in any detail.Briefly, Egeus (played by Bernard Hill) wants his daughter Hermia (Anna Friel) to marry Demetrius (Christian Bale). However, Hermia is in love with Lysander (Dominic West). When she is given the choice of marrying Demetrius, being sentenced to death, or living as a Nun for the rest of of her life, Hermia and Lysander decide to run away together. Hermia's friend Helena (Calista Flockhart, in a fantastic turn) is in love with Demetrius, but he loves Hermia.Meanwhile, King of the Fairies Oberon (Rupert Everett) is estranged from his Fairy Queen Titania (Michelle Pfieffer); she has taken over the care of a changeling boy, after the death of the boy's mother, who was one of Titania's worshippers. Oberon wants the boy to work for him. He summons his mischievous but loyal fairy servant Puck to sprinkle a magic flower on Titania's eyes while she sleeps ? the spell it casts causes the sleeping person to fall in love with the first living thing they see upon waking. Oberon believes that Titania will fall in love with a creature of the forest (where the fairies all live) and while she is distracted, he can take the boy.After seeing Demetrius and Helena arguing, Oberon also orders Puck to sprinkle the magic flower on Demetrius's eyes so that he will see and fall in love with Helena. Puck however has never seen Demetrius and when he stumbles across Lysander asleep in the forest (he and Hermia have stopped there for the night before continuing with their escape), he sprinkles the magic flower on Lysander instead. Helena then comes across Lysander and wakes him, and Lysander falls in love with her immediately. When Puck's mistake is discovered, he also sprinkles the magic flower on Demetrius's eyes, and Demetrius too sees and falls in love with Helena. The two young men argue over who should be with Helena, while Hermia accuses Helena of stealing Lysander's love.While all this is going on, a group of workers in the village are practicing a play to put on at the wedding of the Duke Theseus and his bride to be, Hippolyta. During their rehearsals in the forest, Puck sees Bottom (Kevin Kline) and casts a spell giving Bottom an ass's head, which naturally terrifies the fellow performers. They run away, and Bottom falls asleep. And then he is the first thing that Fairy Queen Titania sees when she awakes?The plot sounds complicated, but it all plays out beautifully. The action is moved from Ancient Athens to Italy at the turn of the 19th century. The reason for this is not made clear (and the script retains its references to Athens), but it doesn't matter ? Italy looks lovely ? the film was shot on location, large in Tuscany. The fairy forest is enchanting, and even the cast are beautiful ? in fact the whole film looks as though it has had its own sprinkling of fairy dust!The cast are all terrific. Stanley Tucci ? always under-rated ? excels as Puck, and really seems to be having fun with the character. Kevin Kline also makes the most of his part and gives a great performance. Puck and Bottom are probably the two funniest characters in the script, and I thought Tucci and Kline did great justice to the roles.The script is actually very very funny ? I laughed out loud on a number of occasions ? and very romantic and sweet too. The interlinked stories tie up together well and the ending is perfect ? well, there must be a reason that Shakespeare is so revered centuries after his death.Overall, this is a very amusing, and beautiful looking film. Even if you're not a fan of Shakespeare, I'd recommend giving this film a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Midsummer Night's Dream has always been one of my all time favorite plays. I thought this movie did a slam bang job. I thought that Stanley Tucci was refreshing as Puck. Most of the time people envision Puck as a young happy-go-lucky fairy. I loved it. It reminded me to always look at a different point of view. The best choice for the film was Kevin Kline as Bottom. Bottom is one of my all time favorite characters. Kline's performance was spot on. Rupert Everett was a superb choice for Oberon. I believe this to be one of the best adaptations for a Shakespeare play that I have ever seen. That includes Mr. Branagh, whom I respect very much.I recommend this movie to any Shakespeare lover.

This is one of the most entertaining adaptations of Shakespeare I've seen on film. Most films of a Shakespearean play are boring, but this one was beautiful and hilarious. I rented it, but then purchase a copy so that I could enjoy it over and over again.The soundtrack was perfect, the setting was elegant, and everything worked together.Puck played by Stanley Tucciin was superb. I think he should get much larger movie roles then he has in the past. I also really enjoyed Kevin Klines interpretation of Bottom.If you love the Dream, you'll love this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sumptuous, sensuous &amp; ethereal Shakespearean adaption!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film adaptation of William Shakespeares 'A Midsummer Nights Dream' is not without its failings...I don't, for instance, believe it was necessary for Puck to get drunk and then go and urinate, or for the four mortal lovers at the conclusion of the film to all be found in the nude (however, there is something very Pre-Raphaelite about that particular scenario, which I love) yet these small things are in no way destructive to the films beauty. This independent film is exquisitely beautiful; it is, visually, a banquet of Pre-Raphaelite imagery and whimsically elegant Edwardian etiquette, and the faeries are amongst some of the most beautifully attired creatures to grace the screen.The Bard's comedy is originally set in Grecian times, but by moving the narrative to the 1890's/1900's it is easier to understand the motive of Oberon and Titania, who as spirits of the earth have grown elder, and are beginning to end their bond with humankind; they wish to give the highest ranking group of mortal lovers a sacred, almost heavenly blessing. It is also a poignant farewell, as we see during the finale when Oberon, the faerie king, eloquently says to Titania "Come my Queen, in silence sad trip we after the moons shade; we the globe can compass soon, swifter than the wandering moon..." This film, as well as being beautiful and bittersweet, also fits the plays original purpose, which was to be amusing. Nowadays comedy has to be rude or dirty to amuse the masses, sadly enough; the comedy in A Midsummer Nights Dream is innocent, but wonderfully amusing without being based on sexuality or human waste. Its exquisite. The actors portray Shakespeare's characters effortlessly; never once in the film is there the mood that these actors are reciting. I have never heard anybody, in fact, speak Shakespeare's intricate poetry with more grace and understanding than Calista Flockhart, Anna Friel or Michelle Pfieffer. Rupert Everrett makes a fine Oberon, putting divine handsomeness with an appropriate air of cunning and wisdom. Michelle Pfieffer commands the audience with her stunning speech and her acting performance, which is filled with grace and passion. Kevin Kline is adorable as Nick Bottom, and I think one of the most shining parts of the film is when the thespian playing Thisbe removes the costume aspects that make him seem female during Pyramus's death scene, and thusly the audience takes his acting more seriously. Purchase this film for its beauty and its elegance-it will move you, and you will want to watch it again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really enjoyable adaptation which conveys love and humour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The adaptation is faithful to the spirit of Shakespeare. The timeless relevance of what he says is emphasised by the variety of settings in which his plays work - in this case 19th century Italy. The cast play the parts with love and look as though they are enjoying themselves. The American accents are irrelevant. They matter only if you feel that only traditional upper class British accents are essential and, of course, the accents of Shakespeare's time were very unlike British "received pronunciation!". The staging is engaging and clever without being intrusive. You don't find yourself thinking "that was a really clever effect" and, as a result, missing the next bit of text as a result. Sure, bikes weren't invented in Shakespeare's day but they work as a device in this film. The interaction of the faeries and mortals is cleverly done and the mechanicals play is hilarious. The music - 19th century Italian opera and Mendelssohn's Midsummer's Night Draem - works wonderfully. I just wish there had been movies like this around when I studied Shakespeare at school!</fullReview>

The tragical beginning and comical yet meaningful ending made it quite possibly the best revival of a Shakespeare play I have ever seen. With it's outstanding cast I'm surprised anyone couldn't find someone who they thought acted brilliantly in their role. The plot was wonderfully panned out and made me look at the script in a much different way than when I had read it. I watched this film when I was in High School and it got me intrigued in the plot again. Though this is no tragical play in terms it starts and ends with a real heart-tugging note. I feel it worked wonderfully as a play and even better as a film. I hope more adaptations of Shakespeare's work take place but I doubt anything can top that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a funny, well acted, beautifully photographed film version of the play. Kevin Klein as Bottom the Weaver was super as was Michelle Pfeiffer as Queen Titania. I read (before seeing the film) that Calista Flockhart was not up to the material but she plays her part (the ditsy Helena) spot on. I've seen a better performance for Puck, however the sight gags (such as riding in on a giant turtle) are priceless and Mr. Tucci does maintain a suitably impish expression.Two scenes with Mr. Kline are especially noteworthy, first when he tries to convince the playwright (Peter Quince) that he, Bottom, can play every part in the play. This is a ham actor which doubtless William Shakespeare knew well. The second is when Kline wakes from his dream and thinks about what happened. There is real thinking going on behind his eyes and Kline acts this out with a clarity which is lovely to watch.All in all, a joy to watch, well worth the spending of two hours time on the "foolish antics of these mortals (and immortals)".</fullReview>

I didn't even want to get up for a minute, even with pausing it. I was totally enraptured in the total wonder of it. I had watched this film in 2000 when it first came out, and I didn't appreciate the total value of it at all.

		<fullReview>Although the scenery was beautiful, did anyone else find it a little odd that they set it in Tuscany, rather than Greece like Shakespeare wrote it? And did they really need to screw around with the time period? It just confused people, especially since, if Theseus was only a duke, why would Egeus go to him to make his daughter marry Demetrius? Plus, the fact that Hippolyta was mistakenly referred to as the queen in the hunt scene...anyway, this would have been a great movie if it wasn't for the five million things wrong with the time period. For example- What Victorian woman would run around in a corset- especially talk to a MAN while she was half-dressed? And what Victorian man would run around naked in the middle of the woods and actually be seen undressed by a lady [referring to Helena- I understand the Hermia thing]? UGH! All that being said, I have to also add that I liked the actors, I liked the way Puck and the rest of the fairies were done, and the set was lovely. :) Good movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthwhile , despite the lack of magic and poor casting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is much to recommend this "Midsummer Night's Dream" ? it's beautifully filmed, well acted by a starry cast and of course ? it's Shakespeare, full of humor, wit and insight. (As always with Shakespeare, you would do well to read the play before watching the movie, preferably with an edition that explains the subtler points of the dialogue.)While wholeheartedly recommending this film for the above reasons, I would have to acknowledge that the overall feeling, despite its merits, is that this is a version seriously lacking in magic. Magic plays a large part of the proceedings but despite the special effects, this "Midsummer Nights Dream" is not nearly as uplifting and enchanting as it is intended to be.Zefferelli's fantastic success with "Romeo and Juliet" was a one off, in that the principals were unknowns. Without big names, it's doubtful whether a lavish production such as this would ever have been made. It's often been stated by film makers that the crucial stage is that of casting. A film well cast will in effect cause the pieces fall together as they should.The casting of this film is way off mark. Signing up a group of stars, both well known and talented, may be good for the box office, but they are a haphazard and motley bunch. There is no "cohesion" at all. Rupert Everett as Oberon may be a fine bit of casting, as may be Stanley Tucci as Puck; but not in the same production ! Pfeiffer and Everett too are uneasy, but the worst paring must surely be Calista Flockhart and Christian Bale. In a play where chemistry is everything, this glaring lack of chemistry between the players is a huge drawback.Far more successful are the amateur players, headed by Kevin Kline in fine form with beautifully crafted performances by Roger Rees, Sam Rockwell and the others. Their scenes reveal what this could have been.Still, enough remains to make this a worthwhile experience.</fullReview>

A lot of these reviews seem to be complaining about the language, that it isn't in Standard English. I'm afraid these people may have failed to realise that this is a classic play by the greatest writer of all time. I wager there would be far more complaints had they 'translated' the script. I am a Shakespeare enthusiast, so I found the language simple to understand but I have watched many plays with friends who have little knowledge of Shakespeare and they have always managed perfectly well. The key is to approach with a broad mind and listen carefully to what they are saying. It isn't a different language, merely a different pattern of speech than we are used to. If you really try to understand the words, you will. Maybe it would be an idea for some of these reviewers to watch it again, with their minds open.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow... that person who gave it "zero stars out of ****" is a little confused... though not without entertainment value. His comment "Shakespeare would have been apalled" is laughable. why? Because most of his whining was about the plot itself. Does he not realize that Shakespeare WROTE the play A Midsummer Night's Dream, and that that makers of the movie followed the original play TO THE WORD, except for a few dialogue cuts that didn't affect plot? And then he went on to whine about how frivolous and silly the plot is...you know what? All of Shakespeare's comedy plots are silly and frivolous. That's the point. Remember, in his time, he wasn't an intellectual mastermind... he was an entertainer for the masses. He gave the playgoers what they wanted in his plays, whether comedy, tragedy, or history- and what they wanted was love, mistaken identity, gratuitous violence, a few laughs, and to be entertained. Yes, he was a great playwright. One of the first, in fact, to really give changeability to his characters. Most writers of his time used purely stock characters. Good guys, bad guys, drunk guys, slutty chicks, virtuous chicks, idiots, smart guys... but never 3-dimensional characters. This is what Shakespeare changed. He created 3-D, CHANGEABLE characters.And don't start on "Oh, you are being shallow". Shakespeare DID put a lot of deeper meanings and metaphore into his plays- but that DID come secondary to entertainment. And even his great plays like Hamlet and Macbeth, with some serious psychological "WTF???" going on, were pretty contrived. I mean, the end of Hamlet involves four dead bodies on the stage, mostly due to mix ups (Hamlet gets stabbed by Laertes' poisoned sword, they keep fighting and manage to switch swords, Laertes gets stabbed with his OWN sword, the queen drinks the poisoned wine meant for Hamlet, then warns him, and he stabs the king AND makes him drink the poisoned wine. Nevermind Ophelia's previous suicide because Hamlet was pretending to be insane, Polonius getting stabbed by Hamlet because Hamlet thought he was the evil king, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern dying in Hamlet's place when they were sent to get him killed, and of course, the death of Hamlet's own father by having poison poured in his ear) So don't start bashing the filmmakers. You said the only good thing they did was the atmosphere... but really, that's all that was left up to them- the presentation. The play was already written, the characters already created, the plot already silly and Chick Flick-y. Sorry. That idiotic "Shakespeare would be apalled" thing just bothers me. I mean, he wrote the fricking thing. So, the only conclusion I can draw from this inane and snooty review is that, like many others, the complexity of the play and its many subplots confused the hell out of you (May I say something about attention spans here??), so you tried to turn it around and blame it on someone else because you're too much of a dolt to figure out what's going on.Ok, having ranted- I'll make this brief. A Midsummer Night's Dream is like a comedy-chick flick with the added advantage of a cool atmosphere and Shakespeare's poetic dialogue. It's a funny romantic comedic fantasy. If you like that sort of thing, see it. If you don't, then don't. And for God's sake, if you can't understand that dialogue, don't blame it on the filmmakers. There ARE people out there who DO understand it, you know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it is unfair for me to review this movie because I walked out well before the end. That's odd, because I usually like Shakespeare on the screen and I enjoyed Midsummers Night's Dream once, many years ago, when I saw it on the stage. I think that two things did me in: that squeaky twerp with the Shakespearian name, Calista Flockhart, and Michelle Feiffer sitting in a giant clamshell. Well, I suppose you could say it supposed to be a comedy -- but when the scenery is funny and the actors aren't, I'd say we have a bad movie on our hands....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visually aesthetic, especially with the faeries but very little in terms of a plot apart from the very barebones of Shakespeare's masterpiece.Rupert Everett brought depth to Oberon's character by retaining an air of nobility while expressing a more pensive/boding nature. Stanley Tucci and Kevin Kline gave strong performances as the mischievous Puck and Bottom respectively. However, Calista Flockhart was horrendously miscast as Helena. I've never seen anyone jerk at her hair more while spitting out words in an overdramatic manner that totally ruins the effect.Michelle Pfeiffer looked lovely with the body glitter but her speech did not flow very well. I thought it was rather lacking. The first hour was good, especially as the love problems developed but it seemed as if the film was running out of juice once the mortal romances were fixed up.Film is good as eyecandy but not much else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps I'm jaded.I've seen funnier performances of Midsummer. I've seen deeper performances of Midsummer. And I've definitely seen better-paced performances of Midsummer. This movie seems to suffer from "Much Ado" syndrome, that the setting is more important than the play.Midsummer deserves to be celebrated, to be rushed through at a frightening, breakneck pace. Here, we see none of that. A case in point would be an early encounter between Puck and a bicycle. While definitely a chuckling-point, it doesn't move the movie along.Midsummer deserves to be played over the top, with energy. This adaptation merely plods through the script with attempted melodrama. Many a young acting troop has been truer to the play and more entertaining than this Midsummer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This mumbled adaptation of Shakespeare's A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM is a snore from beginning to end thanks, once again, to the poor direction of Michael Hoffman -- truly one of the most tedious directors working in film today. As with Hoffman's other films, the emphasis is on lush settings and not much else. The performers -- many of whom show up expecting to do good work -- are left languishing in Hoffman's unimaginative stagings. Several of the "big laughs" that Hoffman concocts involving Bottom and the mechanicals are obvious and labored, drawing no laughter from the audience.Cheers to Anna Friel and the rest of the young lovers for doing their best to keep this one afloat, along with Kevin Kline and the mechanicals. Curses on the head of Rupert Everett who does nothing but mumble. A big shrug for Stanley Tucci, who is tries not to appear horribly miscast as Puck.But the real curses are aimed at Michael Hoffman for bringing his leaden touch to one of Shakespeare's lightest plays -- and, it must be said, one of Shakespeare's sexiest plays (the action is all about sex, after all). Shakespeare is always battling for attention with the garbage that Hollywood passes off as entertainment -- and A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM deserves a far better production than this dreary effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needing of the hand of Kenneth Branagh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a gallant attempt at staging one of William Shakespeare's most famous works. But ultimately it fails. It has everything going for it, almost. The casting here is all A-list. Names such as Kevin Kline (who steals the show), David Straithairn, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sophie Marceau (the latest Bond babe), Calista Flockhart, Christian Bale, Rupert Everett, and Stanley Tucci light up your screens. But what is really lacking here is the director's touch. Michael Hoffman is not Kenneth Branagh, and those who expect this film to live up to Mr. Branagh's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING will be severely disappointed. While Mr. Branagh also assembled a motley crew of decidedly un-Shakespearean actors (Denzel Washington, Michael Keaton, Keanu Reeves), he managed to direct them in such a manner that they at least seem to have fun, and in such a way that the Bard's lines merely drip off of their tongues (okay, maybe not with Mr. Reeves). Mr. Hoffman's cast, with the exception of Mr. Kline and Mr. Tucci, seem to work too hard to have fun doing all of what is required of them, and this cripples the work. Also, one can tell that most of the forest scenes are shot on a soundstage, and when some are shot on location, this combination ultimately leaves a bad after taste and the audience with the ultimate question of "why?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I noticed that before this movie came out today)reviews were already in...very intresting since i doubt that they saw the same movie that I did. If you haven't read the play, read it before you see the film. The acting is good overall, but the beginning moves slowly and continues to move at a snail's pace untill about halfway though the film. The film is set in Italy, and it is confusing when the players continually refer to the town as "Atheans". The acting of the players is good after the beginning and only gets better as the film progresses. Flockhart and Klien give a great preformances as does almost the entire cast. The exception is Pfieffer, who is only believeable around the time when Bottom becomes the object of her affection. Overall...this is a good film, but first at least know about the story before you see it, and if you can get past the first hour or so, and the fact that the bikes look as if they were made a couple of days before the sceens were shot, you will enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Among the many theatrical and movie versions of Midsummer Night's Dream I have seen this is one which could be close to the original vision of the great author. (It is a rather hopeless enterprise to surpass that.) Thanks to the director Michael Hoffmann and the nice performances by many good players (e.g. Michelle Pfeiffer as Titania), this movie well reflects the magic of a summer night in a forest and the complexity and confusions of human emotions, especially, about love. The three main components: the high society, the workers' class, and the fairies are all nicely represented and are blended well in this film. It contains a few deviations from the original play, like the place is moved from Athens to Tuscany, Puck rides a bicycle, etc., but these did not disturb me at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although difficult to translate, has some nice touches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There probably aren't that many films that break most of the rules and succeed, but this one makes a strong effort. Let's see...1) It's wordy. Of course, it's Shakespeare.2) It has too many characters. See above.3) It has no clearly identifiable main character. Huge defect in the eyes of Hollywood. How did it ever get produced?4) It's arty. With Shakespeare, it's either arty or PBS/BBS drab. Let's settle for arty in that case.Despite all these "handicaps," some of the directorial touches actually succeed. First, the translation to Tuscany circa 1900 takes advantage of that era's interest in fairy lore, romantic music, and the technology (like bicycles and phonographs) that was rendering fairy lore quaint. We are invited to see the fairies themselves encounter the technology that would obsolete them. Despite the translation of setting, the textual references to ancient Athens remain, and the viewer is--it is implied--requested to accommodate.More importantly, this version contains the most sensitive treatment of the "mechanics," the common working men staging a play for the Duke, that I have ever seen. Nick Bottom retains his buffoonery, but a more sensitive side is brought out as he rejoins his fellows after the "dream." The production of "Pyramus and Thisby" contains a huge surprise that I won't spoil here. Certainly worth the price of admission for any fan of the bard who's seen most previous film versions of the play within the play.The casting has its pluses and minuses. In general, the Brits fill their parts well, but the Americans are a step behind. Calista Flockhart wrestles with her words as if speaking a foreign language, and Stanley Tucci, although a great actor, does not give the impression that he can travel 50,000 odd miles per hour. We need more contrast between Puck and Rupert Everett's subdued, thoughtful Oberon. Finally, Michelle Pfeiffer, although a beautiful woman, does not give the impression of a force of nature. Rich housewife is closer to the mark. The exception to the rule is Kevin Kline, who distinguishes himself even above Robin Williams as a comic actor with the potential for serious depth.Definitely worth checking out as the most accessible and competent Midsummer on film.</fullReview>

I would love to see at least a few films on the market that are 100% true to Shakespearian scripts but this adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream is visually excellent, far surpassing theatrical limits. The original play is not one of my favourites but this film does more than pleasantly surprise me.Being a visual delight, especially when compared with the alternative of going to the theatre, A Midsummer Night's Dream is an enjoyable film.

I have seen 12 year old Titanias and Helenas who understood and delivered their lines better. Pfeiffer throws almost everything away. Flockhart has one note and two expressions. Have a look at the way actors in a Branagh, Olivier or a McKellen adaptation communicate the sense of the verse with gesture, tone and expression and compare that with what goes on here - or rather doesn't go on here.The totally reliable David Strathairn as Theseus looks like the captain of sinking ship, standing on the bridge, amazed at the dismal failure of his crew and I swear that glint in Stanley Tucci's eye at the end is saying "Wait till I get hold of my agent". It's not all bad and I've seen worse (though certainly not from Michelle Pfeiffer) but whimsy is not the same as humour, and if you're acting Shakespeare and you don't understand what you're saying, then neither will your audience.Not for scholars.

		<fullReview>An intolerably poor movie. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this. Hoffmann has no vision here, except for the nonsensical concept of the "bicycle," which has no place in this story. Hoffmann has been quoted as saying that he chose to "embrace" the theatrical aspects of the piece, rather than actually bothering to adapt it for the medium of film, which is painfully obvious. Ignoring the satirical and dramatic aspects of the original play, he instead turns this version into a drudgingly long piece of slapstick about a troupe of actors led by Bottom (Kevin Kline), here inexplicably elevated to the story's central role. Kline played a major part in getting this vanity project off the ground, and it shows. The play's principal roles of Lysander, Hermia, and Demetrius are reduced to indistinguishable supporting characters who deliver stilted, "Shakespearean" performances that they clearly do not understand. Even worse, the "magical" world of the fairies, shot entirely on a very obvious soundstage, comes off as wooden and contrived. How Searchlight convinced so many A-list actors to appear in this film may go down as one of the mysteries of the ages. Of all the film adaptations of "A Midsummer Night's Dream," including the awful 1996 British version, this is by far the poorest. If you plan to stand in line at the movies over the next month or two, then for heaven's sake, see Star Wars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe that this film version of William Shakespeare's classic, "A Midsummer's Night Dream" is better than the 1968 Royal Shakespeare film version. Now I am not saying that the acting is much better, it could fare better with this cast like Kevin Kline, Michael Tucci, Calista Flockhart, Michelle Pfeiffer, David Straitharn, and others to mention. The quality of this film is superior to the 1968 version starring Dame Judi Dench C.H., Dame Diana Rigg C.B.E., and Dame Helen Mirren. The quality is shown by the location, costumes, and the expense it took to make this film look first rate. It tries to be faithful to the text and I believe it is more than satisfactory. I hope this film version is shown in schools because I believe that if you are going teach Shakespeare that you should do both comedy and tragedy. His comedies like "Much Ado About Nothing" and "A Midsummer's Night Dream" shows Shakespeare's sense of humor and playfulness with the living as opposed to watching a tragedy. Most high schools are working on the tragedies like Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Macbeth, and Julius Caesar but I think they should also do one comedy for each tragedy than maybe students would not cringe with distaste over doing Shakespeare at all. I gave it a 9 because I think the acting could have been better or improved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I somehow managed to get through high school without being forced to read most of the classic stories that so many students dread and fear based on hand-me-down horror stories from siblings and friends. Later in life, natural curiosity drove me on several occasions to force myself to enjoy the great works of literature. Usually I was so lost in trying to translate the jargon or the author's intent, that I could never enjoy the story. My choice of watching A Midsummer Night's Dream was inspired by a recent trip to Barnes &amp; Noble. As planned, I met my 14-year-old daughter at the checkout line carrying my usual stack of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Mystery stories, while she had chosen for her reading pleasure several Shakespearean works. I told her that I was very pleased with her fondness of reading. Regardless of the material, reading is generally better, i.e., thought provoking, than watching a movie. This delightful movie, however, made it possible to enjoy the Bard's magnificent story telling ability without a translator. There was sufficient Shakespearean dialogue to make me pause the DVD a few times for thought, but generally the story flowed with enough vitality to entertain as the thoughts and inspirations of human foibles were driven deeper into my subconscious for later analysis. The only shortcoming is I can't say, "I liked the book better than the movie."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999): Dir: Michael Hoffman / Cast: Michelle Pfeiffer, Kevin Kline, Calista Flochhart, Rupert Everett, Stanley Tucci: Gloriously stunning fantasy that underlines our desire for love. Case in point, Calista Flockhart peddles after a frustrated male who is in love with another woman. Actors assemble for a play and Kevin Kline auditioning for all roles. Sighting all this are the fairies who live in the forest enchanted by a Queen. When the actors draw near to the forest twilight in preparation for their play, the magic begins thus leading to a quiet night of mist and stardust. Very funny with exquisite production and visual delight directed with wit and charm by Michael Hoffman who previously collaborated with Michelle Pfeiffer in the mediocre One Fine Day. Michelle Pfeiffer is stunning as the fairy Queen and Rupert Everett fools her with enchantment that will bring bewilderment and focus. Kline takes a strange transformation hair and donkey ears but will enact his true hilarity on the stage. Flockhart is hilarious in her na?ve hopeless state. Stanley Tucci is hilarious as Puck who ends up screwing up all the romantic ties when sent out on his orders. Themes regard blind love that we often fall victim too. Appropriately moves from scene to scene is Shakespearean stage fashion, it is an enchanting masterpiece with a ravishing sense of wonder. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

But thankfully this is the kind of film that you can watch many times over mostly because it is not a drama. Or rather the drama in this film is softened to the point of seeming like a harmless interlude. The film after all is a tame love comedy and simple at what it does. Towards the end of the film you realize that wondering and dreaming is more important to the pursuit of happiness than having or owning. An antidote to everything else in life.Also recommended: "Bringing Up Baby" (1938)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent version of a Shakespeare classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999) was directed by Michael Hoffman. who also wrote the screenplay. This is an excellent version of MND, a play that has been filmed many times. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. This version worked for me.Some of the casting was excellent--Michelle Pfeiffer as Titania, Stanley Tucci as Puck, and Rupert Everett as Oberon. Calista Flockhart was miscast as Helena. In the play, Helena is supposed to be tall. (There's an entire scene where the fact that she's taller than Hermia is discussed.) However, Hoffman wanted a marquee name, and he chose Flockhart.Kevin Kline plays Nick Bottom, the weaver. Kline is a superb physical actor, but he looks too handsome and intelligent for the role. Director Hoffman got around this by making him a dandy. When we meet Bottom on screen, he's dressed in the height of fashion, flirting with all the women who gather around him. Bottom is supposed to be a working class rustic, a "rude mechanical," and that's not Kline. However, once you accept the fact that this is how Bottom will be portrayed, Kline's excellent acting skills carry it off.This film will work better on a large screen, but we enjoyed it on DVD. Production values are excellent, and, more important, Shakespeare's concept shines through. This is a fine film if you are a Shakespeare expert, but it's also a great introduction to Shakespeare for someone unfamiliar with his work.For some reason, this movie carries a dismal 6.5 IMDb rating. It's much better than that. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

Trying to retain the nature as a play, the dialog retains the old English grammatical and vocabulary, though I don't think that it is the exact dialog from the play. What I like better is that, still in the spirit of retaining the feel of the original play, the main part of this movie is shot on a set that seem to be made for a stage, not shot at an outdoors location as what it would be inferred from the story. The costumes and props also hold this true, having them elaborate costume just as eye candies without having them interact realistically. For instance, the wings on the fairies looked just as glued parts on the costumes without having any complex effects on them. It's nice to see many great talents acting here. I like how this is one Christian Bale's previous works before the bigger titles. Other names as big as Pfeifer, Flockhart, West, and Marceau also did a good job, and for sure pumped the hype for curiosity over this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shouldn't this be a Shakespearean comedy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting in general was not very convincing, especially not as is required for a good Shakespearean rendition. Most lines are uttered without real feeling and with clichd emotion, facial expression and gesture. Calista Flockhart (Helena), Sam Rockwell (Francis Flute; especially in the play-in-the-play) and Kevin Kline (Bottom) were best, my favourite being Calista Flockhart who brings Helena's emotions convincingly with great authenticity. I have read that "this was Kevin Kline's play", but I disagree because the character of Bottom has a lot of potential as a funny Shakespearean stereotype (but this was probably acted out under the director's guidance). Only in the end did he really show himself in the play-in-the-play. Michelle Pfeiffer (Titania) and especially Rupert Everett (Oberon) show us that the failing fairies' relationship was not only due to adultery and jealousy, but also because of the lack of emotional depth in their relationship - which speaks out of their performance. The biggest disappointment is that I don't see the Shakespearean stereotypes played out on screen, Bottom is supposed to be the idiot with a carpe diem lifestyle, but he is portrayed too gravely, which stifles a lot of potential humorous approaches to the character. Puck also didn't come to life as the witty and mischievous knave he is. I also feel that the director could have done more with the mute characters on screen, their short scenes are there to set a mood, but they seem superfluous.The soundtrack was nothing spectacular and the sound-effects and background noises were cheap clichs we see everywhere nowadays (cf. forest background sounds). Most of the actors' voice-acting was also uninspired, and does not do homage to the verbal virtuosity of Shakespeare's play.I sincerely wonder whether the director knows of the potential comedy that lurks in the play, because I did not have the feeling that I was watching a comedy at all. The play-in-a-play was in it's 10-minute totality more funny than the whole 100 preceding minutes. There were no genuinely funny situations, and the movie was absolutely not original in creating these, Instead, it relied too much on the inherent comedy of the incompatibility of some characters and emotions in certain situations, and so took a too passive and unoriginal approach. The movie lets a lot of very obvious occasions of potential funny situations slip by, even the potential very comic situation with the chink in the wall slip (hint: "I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all"). The only scene that comes closest to a comic situation is when Helena runs away from a chasing Demetrius and Lysander, but even this scene was more dramatic than funny. Bottom's lying with Titania too was also disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent effort with reservations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed a great deal about this production. The music was a plus, it was colourful, and happily not to much in the way of special effects. All the actors did well although I thought Rupert Everett was miscast. Oberon should be an older more macho presence in my view, Mr. Everett seemed too young and as a gay man didn't bring enough to the part. (Although he may have chuckled to himself playing as he was, the king of the fairies.)Kevin Kline was terrific as bottom. Stanley Tucci good as Puck, and Calista Flockhart showed what she could do as Helena. Sophie Marceau, a luminous Hippolyta not given enough to do. I could have done without the bikes, too modern they seemed out of place. All told, a pleasant watch that could have been a lot better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rounding out Shakespeare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being an English major in college and an English teacher for high schoolers, I have seen my fair share of people's renditions of Shakespeare. And I must say, I do appreciate this rendition.What many people upon first experience with Shakespeare do not realize is that his plays have absolutely no stage direction accompanying them. Every movement, every formation of a scene must be completely created by the production's director. (This is why we see so many examples of Shakespeare's plays taken out of their Elizabethan context and "updated" into another time period.) Thus, what we as an audience see as a "finished product" is greatly dependent upon a director's interpretation of a given scene or act.In this case, I believe that Michael Hoffman has done an admirable job. He has "rounded off" some of the unanswered questions within the script itself, and given reason for certain lines that otherwise would not make sense. For example -- take the final Pyramus and Thisbe scene. Many times I have seen troupes try to get around the "this is my dog" line, with limited success. By proper staging and unscripted (and thus unspoken) interactions, the dog finally makes sense within the scene.My only criticism of the movie, in fact, is the way that Calista Flockhart portrays Helena. I understand that her character is hopelessly lovestruck and heartbroken because the object of her affection won't return her sentiment, but she's simply a little too overwrought for my tastes. The way that she gasps between almost every line of dialogue quickly becomes distracting, and her distress verges on one-dimensional.Yet all in all, the movie is a wonderful retelling of probably my favorite of Shakespeare's comedies -- and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the Bard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comparing to the 1930s movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not see all of this (1999) movie, but I enjoyed comparing it to the 1930s movie which had Mickey Rooney as Puck. Tucci's Puck was quite different; I did not see Tucci screech at the top of his lungs constantly like Rooney. I rather enjoyed Rooney/Puck, too, however. I always like Kevin Kline, and of course I thought of James Cagney as Bottom in the earlier movie. Both men as Bottom were totally hilarious, and yet fuzzy and lovable to the Queen of the Fairies.The earlier movie was black and white, but it still had similar fairy magic and beautiful special effects. The earlier "Dream" had Victor Jory as Oberon, and a menacing and handsome Oberon he was. Jory/Oberon commandingly led all the fairies out of the forest toward daylight, and in this 1999 movie I was waiting for Everett/Oberon to do that but I did not see it. I like Michelle Pfeiffer as Titania, and I thought that the glitter on her skin was beautifully dazzling, and her blue and gold costuming so awesomely wonderful and divine. Of course, in the earlier movie, I really liked Anita Louise as Titania -- she was also divine for her day and time.And then there is Thisby -- played in the earlier movie by Joe E. Brown, and boy was Brown hilarious!! Wearing that dress, he was just as wonderful as was the actor who played Thisby in the 1999 movie. Both presentations are totally hilarious and darling. The long girly wigs are so cute on these men, lol.And again about Kevin Kline: I just adored him in "Pirates of Penzance" (when he was the Pirate King) and the more recent "Prairie Home Companion" (when he was Guy Noir). He is a good singer, dancer, comedian and actor, and not hard to look at.The fairy-lights reminded me of the forest scenes in "Peter Pan" (2003). Perhaps the Peter Pan fairy ideas were taken from Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream. And I hear that many Shakespearean stories were taken from yet other authors. Oh, well, these are great movies and plays for our enjoyment.15/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Misummer Night's Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen a cartoon version of this William Shalespeare tale, but I had always wanted to see a live action one, and this star filled version is almost perfect. It is the story of a group of four partners, Helena (Ally McBeal's Calista Flockhart), Lysander (Dominic West), Demetrius (Christian Bale) and Hermia (Anna Friel), and complications with their love situations. Oberon (Rupert Everett), King of the Fairies was originally getting the love juice flower only to make a fool of Queen Titania (Michelle Pfeiffer), but he also decided to get his servant Puck (The Terminal's Stanley Tucci) to put the juice on the eyes of the four people, getting their identities mixed up. But it is the group of performing actors' "main man", always fun Kevin Kline that is best as the ass-turned Nick Bottom. Also starring David Strathairn as Theseus and Sophie Marceau as Hippolyta. There are some funny moments, but it is the pantomime type format that is just the slightest bit annoying. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oddly uneven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THis movie is a sort of modernised version of the original Shakespeare play. From the scrip a lot of the loose text from the original play has been dropped out (and hence many of the characters have been marginalised), but those changes actually serve the text pretty well; even though it is delightful, Midsummer is not the Bard's best work and is in places outdated.This adaptation has a nice basic idea. It has been transferred into early 20th century Tuscany, and Theseus has been made a local nobleman of high rank. Most of the scenes in this "real" world work well, even if the cast isn't ideal. Pair Strathairn/Marceau is spot-on and West/Friel works well too. Bale/Flockhart... not so sure about them. Kline as Nick Bottom is a bit over-the-top for my liking, and the rest of his merry men stuck behind his shadow.In the fairy world, everything goes awry. The setting changes from the beautiful Italian countryside into cheap, badly done studio set. All the rather nice costumes are drowned by this mess of a surrounding. Of the actors, Pfeiffer is not too bad. Everett is a wonderful idea for Oberon, giving the role credibility and smoothness. Tucci...? Ah well. This is what happens when a character is detached entirely from what the writer had in mind. My idea of Puck never was that he is a wise, benevolent man.All and all, this is not all bad but still rather sloppily done. The basic questions this play is probably intended to raise are not pressed forward as much as they could have done, but generally, this works as entertainment. But if you have got a college paper to write about this play, look for other sources.I would give the movie a 6, and the extra point for David Strathairn, who never fails to get me going :D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Homework =\</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is apart of my homework, don't laugh at me! Might as well make this useful! ^^; Michael Hoffman's film adaptation of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" is effective in that it depicts the astonishing passion and quirkiness of the 1594 Shakespearean play by casting the most nostalgic characters who portray a distinguished performance of acting and comical relief. Also, the delightful taste of costume selections and props avail elegance and grace. Michael Hoffman insightfully and accurately follows the play. Well done, Michael! Additionally, the cast of actors are better known for their famous names rather than their notorious acting: Rupert Everett, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christian Bale, and Calista Flockheart. A certain pretentious expectation is made that is sadly is not met. In other words, their names overwrote the true meaning of the comical Shakespearean play written in the mid-1590; superficially, this restitutes for their mistakes and lack of dramatic, influential acting. The costume and art directions are splendid, however it may be obvious that it was not set up in the correct era and location: In Shakespeare's play, "A Midsummer Night's Dream," it was clearly stated that the play took place in Athens, Greece during the 14th century. On the other hand, it was much more appealing that Hoffman change the setting to Italy, in the early 1900's, which illustrates a compelling sensation of a classical theme. I wouldn't recommend any changes to the director; I deeply believe that this is an excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit, right away, that I haven't read the Shakespeare play (horrors!). But, going on what I have read of his work, I think that this version was really delightful! I disagree with anyone who says that the casting was poor! And the chemistry some say is nonexistent? Are you blind, man? I was actually most pleased with Calista Flockhart! I really didn't like her style (nouveau-skeleton) and never watched Ally McBeal, so I was prepared to laugh at ineptitude. Instead, she threw everything into this performance. Although Hermia was perhaps prettier, especially according to standards of the time (turn of the century, you know, the 20th, not the 17th), Flockhart's Helena had PERSONALITY! Wow! Rupert Everett was quite gorgeous as well as wonderfully mischievous. Although I couldn't abide wearing as much glitter around as all the fairies did. They were slathered in the stuff. After the happy reuniting of true lovers, with a little help from fairie-power, comes Bottom's best part. The play. I seriously could not stop laughing. This was the funniest bit. Poor Thisbe! If you're looking for fun, romance, and a seriously comedic take on men playing women on stage, check this movie out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...this is still a very game and bright,cleverly paced and light-as-air film! The cast is pretty well-suited for this offering from the BArd of Avon,one of the more "trippy" works(I'm no expert on all of Shakespeare's plays,but "Tempest" would seem to qualify the most trippy of them all!). Kevin Kline as the fanciful dreamer-cum-donkey Bottom,Rupert Everett as the coolly calculating OBeron and Satnley Tucci as the instant comic relief in Puck are particularly notable in this film. The contributions of Christian Bale,Calista Flockhart(not nearly as bad as some would have you think),Anna Friel,Dominic West and Michelle Pfeiffer are fine,if not extraordinary here.The pacing is almost a little TOO airy,and one might be driven to distraction watching this,especially if you're not watching this in a movie theatre,since it would seem to lose out in a battle of distractions in a "normal" home or non-cinematic setting. To echo the sentiments of a previous commenter,Director Michael Hoffman for the most part pulls off bringing to the cinema a story that seems much more suited for the stage. The choice of lush,19th century Italy as the backdrop of the film(replete with opera arias and classical music as its score) was a pleasant element of note. Whatever you do when watching this film(and I cannot stress this enough),BLOCK OUT AS MANY DISTRACTIONS AS POSSIBLE. You'll be well-served for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good, as far as Shakespeare goes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's with mixed feelings I'm going to recommend this movie, though it's probably only my nature as a nitpicker (and a really bad one) that is causing me grief.First off, I was very impressed with the settings in "Midsummer". They were very lavish and beautiful and well-used in most cases (though there were a couple of scenes with the fairies where I thought I was watching Clive Barker's 'Nightbreed'). The acting on the whole was very strong, though too often I found the action and setting getting in the way of impressions that should have been left to the character's themselves (did we really need to see Michelle Pfeiffer doing the donkey?). And here I'm actually going against popular opinion by saying that Calista Flockhart impressed me most out of everyone. She, along with Puck, seemed the only people in the movie aware they were acting in a comedy, and her over-the-top behaviour brought a welcome dose of absurdity. Too many of the actors came to the film way too serious. Especially horrible was Theseus, who if I'm not mistaken was supposed to be a heroic character, and not a weakling with poor delivery.So where was I? Oh yes. A common complaint has been how the movie is hard to follow. Well, it is, unless you are familiar with the play itself. But this is the problem whenever a director decides to do Shakespeare. Hoffman actually does a better job than most of making the characters sound natural, though the downfall of this is that they begin talking way too fast to be altogether comprehinsible. For the most part he has preserved the playful mood of Shakespeare's, and the final play-within-a-play is worth seeing the movie on its own.All in all, I enjoyed this movie only because I enjoyed the play. And in that regard, it is one of the better Shakespeare translations I've encountered.</fullReview>

Also, I've never seen Michelle Pfeiffer look so gorgeous. I bet she's got a couple of stills on her wall somewhere!Some people have commented on Calista Flockhart's performance as being too "whiny" - but hey! it's a whiny character, and I suspect this is just the usual "anti-flockhart" brigade, whining on as usual. Get a life people!Personally, I feel that if you view this movie as an amusing entertainment, in the same way that the original play was intended, then you won't be disappointed.

		<shortDescription>Good adaptation, but slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot I like about this production. The beautiful 1900ish Italian settings work, Theseus as an aristocrat (perhaps with Mafia connections that explain his power over his colleagues), and the depiction of the fairies drawing on pagan Roman/Italian images of satyrs and fauns. As others have said, the Mechanicals have been reinvented, not as buffoons but as competent and resourceful working men; Nick Bottom is charming but ineffectual, a would-be dandy stuck in an unhappy marriage. The difficulty was that despite all this, and being visually perfect, for me it lacked 'magic', and only picked up in mid-film from the point when Bottom was transformed; the highlight was the Mechanicals staging their play-within-a-play. The ending was very downbeat; there was an ideal point for closure when Bottom returned home triumphant, with a medal and pension, but we never saw how his wife reacted. One would like to think the fairies had visited and sprinkled the love potion in her eyes too. Overall, it is very worth seeing, but I still prefer the 1996 RSC film version, which doesn't cut the text, is more clever theatrically (doubling up roles in human and fairy realms), and has a wistful Englishness that I always associate with this play.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a reasonably accurate enough translation of the play (take it or leave it), but the main draw here is the lush Italian settings and a rather interesting cast. Of all the players, only Kevin Kline delivers the Shakespeare speak with any real gusto. The rest of the cast is basically eye candy, perfectly suited for the teasingly sensual nature of this teasingly contempo version of the farce. No one turns out to be an embarassment (as in many Hollywood Shakespearian efforts), and the widescreen compositions, lush classical scoring and various pretty faces make it a lively enough indulgence for those wanting to handle something from the Old Vic. I would have sexed it up a lot more and gave the fantasy elements greater orgiastic flare, offering up a much more controversial version of an oft-filmed play. Decent enough, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the play, i read most of Shakespeare's stuff just because my mother gave me two volumes featuring most of his work. I think this movie deserves better criticism because it's not easy turning a play by Shakespeare into a box-office hit. Reading his work I couldn't stop thinking how timeless his work realy is, imagine that Shakespeare wrote A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1594. Do you really think that any of the themes he took care of would still be 'nsinc with our context and time? I can assure you, it doesn't take that much effort to see that it actually does.So, if you feel like enriching your life with a spray of culture and you recognize the occult expression by an age old genius: read the play (about 20 pages) and watch this movie with open eyes. You'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A BAD summer night's dream!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern filmmakers call it `paying homage', some call it a lack of originality. Either way, it is spreading like wild fire. After seeing the many Shakespeare films that Hollywood has produced, since Mel as Hamlet, I was curious to see Michael Hoffman's take on `Midsummer Night's Dream'. Aside from the obvious chronological flaws (i.e.: there were no bike lights till the later 1900's) where should I begin. Fellini, Bertolucci and Hoffman...I don't think so. While he does try hard to mimic the Italian directing greats, he loses the vision. Perhaps better casting would have helped. Calista Flockhart (Ally Mc-needs-a-meal) should stick to sitcoms. Who's idea was it exactly to put her in this? I suspect name power was needed. She was so whiny and self-hating, there was little to like about her portrayal of Helena at all. Tucci, an actor whom I greatly admire and will watch in anything, was so lost and mis-used in this I wanted to cry. The character of Puck was written almost like a child, hich is what was needed for that role. Maybe even a teenager would have worked. Too bad Haley Joel Osment wasn't around yet. Tucci would have been better to replace Everett as Oberon. Everett, another fine actor, should NOT have been Oberon. If anything, he should have had the role of Theseus. While Stratharin is a wonderful actor, he seemed to stumble over the language and did not fit among the better actors of the film. Marceau, whom I loved in `Lost and Found', was a fine choice for the smallest female lead Hyppolyta. She was basically seen and not really heard. Anna Friel was perhaps the sweetest Hermia I had ever seen, however, she failed to capture the true self-centeredness that Shakespeare had written. Bale and West are two of the finest young actors I have seen a long time. They were perfect and truly likable as the male mortals. Bale has such a detest for Flockhart's character, that you really believe he hates her (almost as much as I do). Kline and the other `actors' are made up of some of Hollywood's best kept secrets. Actors like Jbara (snug/the lion), Irwin (Snout/ the wall) and Wright(Stravling/ the moon) really make this a most fun movie. But perhaps the performance which suprised me the most, was that of Sam Rockwell, best known for his roles as bad guys (`The Green Mile', `Charlies Angels'). He blew me out of my seat with his acting ability. I had thought he was just another hot young Hollywood type, little did I know under that type casting there lied a sweet and talented actor. His final speech as Thisbee truly is perfection to watch. I look forward to seeing more of his work. Finally, and most disappointing for me was Michelle Pfeiffer as Titania. Why is she even in this film? Where is Emma Thompson? Where is Susan Sarandon? Where is Angelica Houston? Where are the actresses who could have played this part better. Half the time Pfeiffer is on screen, she is lost and searching her mind for her lines. She did not belong here. That being said, onto direction. Hoffman, better known for light hearted fluff like `Soapdish' (one of my all time favorite films) and `One Fine Day' bites off a lot more than he can chew. There is so much to convey on film, too much gets lost. His direction is spastic and hard to follow. He jumps around too much with little reason. The camera work, while beautiful for capturing the landscapes, does little for the movie other than make the actors and actresses look feathered and angelic at times, an effect not needed for the WHOLE film. Perhaps Hoffman was trying to convey the mystical and heaven like feel of the fairy kingdom, but alas, after seeing it for an hour, it loses it's luster and becomes annoying, as you try to focus on the screen. As far as script adaptation, it was close. The 1935 Reinhardt/Dieterle was a much better adaptation and if you enjoy this play, it is by far, the only version to see. All in all, a great disappointment and I think Hollywood should leave Shakespeare to those who know how to handle it. All hail Kenneth Branagh!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Film that Attempts The Impossible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always maintained that Midsummer Nights Dream is unfilmable.It is also in my opinion,unstageable. Thats not to say its a bad play,in fact its so fantastic and magical I have never been convinced the fairies are walking amongst us except in my head. The magic conjured up by the fairie folk, to me,cannot be translated convincingly on screen.That said,this film is a good effort. It never succeeds in making the fairies magical,but really helps bring out the lover's plight and succeeds in reinventing the mechanicals.The film starts off strong with likable performances by David Strathairn as Theseus,The Lovely Sophie Marceau as Hippolyta and the ever enjoyable Bernard Hill as Egeaus. As the Young lovers go Anna Friel is miles ahead of the others as Hermia.One of Britian's best kept secrets,the pretty and talented Miss Friel knows how to handle the characters romanticism as well as her toughness. Christian Bale and Domanic West are perfect as the young men,each handling the egotisim and romantic foppery well. The only young lover that does not measure up is Calista Flockhart's rather spastic and twitchy Helena.She is just too modern and quirky to fit the mold the other three have cast.Kevin Kline makes a pompous and vain Bottom,in a rather unique twist on the role,while Bill Irwin and Roger Rees lend fine support as two of his theatrical co-horts. But the problem of the fairies still remains.This particular film tries to solve the problem by making them more human in look and nature,regretably this takes away much of their magical qualities and puts few barriers between the magical worls and the world of Theseus. Rupert Everett,Stanley Tucci and Michelle Pfieffer ar thus also regulated to the background as much as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is unabashedly romantic! Having read the play, when it was first released, I was not too happy about the fact that they set the film in a much more modern time than it's supposed to be set in. Perhaps that was the reason why I postponed watching it till now. But after watching it I feel the "modern" setting actually works in its favor! The dialogue for one, is much more livelier. The constant banter between the lovers is funny and enjoyable! I give a hands up for all of them, especially Christian Bale and Calista Flockhart. They immediately liven up the film just when you are starting to get a wee bit bored with Rupert Everett's mumbling Oberon. Christian Bale is always a treat to watch(right from his 'Empire of the Sun' days). He's an incredibly talented actor. He's played roles as diverse as Laurie in the adaptation of Louisa Mae Alcott's 'Little Women', the role of Jesus in 'Mary, Mother of Jesus' and the psychopath in 'American Psycho'! Calista Flockhart can't really shrug off her Ally McBeal mantle. When she's arguing furiously with Demetrius, you immediately remember her doing the same about a hundred times in 'Ally'. And yet, I must say, she's real fun to watch. Her sure-fire Shakespearean dialogue delivery is not only amusing, it speeds the tempo of the film and makes the banter more natural and modern. Both Dominic West and Anne Friel are good, especially the latter. Michelle Pfeiffer and Kevin Kline, after all the diverse characters that they have played, were made to play these characters! I really loved the sets. The woods were beautifully created and Titania's fairyland was imaginatively evoked. Altogether, a really enjoyable feel-good film, a lot in the Bard's vein!! Its modern setting works to its advantage and may appeal to the otherwise non-Shakespearean lot!  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Altogether under-rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must stress that I'm a huge fan of William Shakespeare, so when I knew "A midsummer night's dream" was playing in theaters. I ran to see it. I was amazed seeing this gorgeous movie. It's beautifully filmed and very well acted out. The cast is stunning. Calista Flockhart is amazing. What a tremendous actress!. I don't understand why many people said through the comments she wasn't as outstanding and plausible as Helena, she really was. She was wonderful. I'm certainly a fan of her. As for Christian Bale, Kevin Kline and Michelle Pfeiffer, What can I say? I think they were unfathomable.This is a comedy full of fantasy, dreams, and love affairs. The forest is the place where lovers confess their desire to love and show everything they feel. It's also the place where they betray their betrothed with magic beings who make them dream of in an intense midsummer night in which nobody wants to wake up. "A midsummer night's dream" not only exhibits bold contrasts and divergent elements of plot, atmosphere, and character; it also illustrates the unifying power of the spirit of comedy and the poetic imaginations. This movie take us to the creation of an atmosphere full of illusion, wonder, and strangeness, which is completely worthy for me. Nevertheless I don't get why it was so under-rated. At least it should have won an academy award for best costume design. The costumes and the cinematography were better than expected. As for the vocabulary used in this movie I just say it was very proper for something written by Shakespeare.Overall, this is an entertaining movie. I really enjoyed the entire movie but it was a shame it was very under-rated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I loved the casting of this movie, my only criticism is of the mish-mash of accents. We have all manner of different American accents, we have French, and then another range of British including London girl Anna Friel, who is hilarious because of it, incidentally. Once you got over the accents it is a magical film, a gentle fantasy which picks you up, whirls you around, tickles and delights, and then gently takes you back to earth so you don't land with a bump.I've rarely seen anything so gorgeous to look at, and if you've read any of my other reviews you'll see I always go for the beauty of things. Michelle Pfeiffer and Rupert Everett were just perfect, both of them looked delicious enough to eat. Although I can sympathise with the desire for Emma Thompson in the part of Titania. The accent and intonation would really have made it fantastic.Callista Flockhart was fantastic; 'Oh, SPITE! Oh, HELL!' She does the giddy masochism of Helena to a 'T'.One of the things Shakespeare does best is insults, and in this film it is a field day of insults! I can't remember any of the good ones unfortunately but there is nothing funnier than seeing an actor deliver passionately and with all the venom they possess, some word which is completely nonsensical!What with hectic chase scenes on bicycles, ridiculous magical mix-ups by Stanley Tucci's (twinkling and devil-may-care) Puck, a consummate Bottom played by Kevin Kline, and all kinds of visual jokes I'm sure Shakespeare did not put in his stage directions, this film is an absolute picnic, just the thing if you're feeling down in the dumps.</fullReview>

The acting is, however, very good, but the ideas and portrayal of these ideas are poor. There is no surreal and deeper meaning to the film and it is clear the producers wanted only a box office hit... which they didnt get. There is nothing to think about in this movie, however it is very true to the text and is successful in making the works of Shakespeare more accessible to the public. Overall, not very imaginative but still worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautiful visually, wonderful costuming, lush scenery, and very good acting. The only dark spots are Ally McBeal - I mean, Calista Flockhart - who manages to make Helena identical to her sitcom character, and surprisingly, Kevin Kline, who while usually wonderful unfortunately plays Bottom much too flat in many places. In contrast, Stanley Tucci, an improbable choice, was wonderful. His approach to the character was refreshing and very effective. The many comments disparaging his performance can only be chalked up to bias, because his Puck is admittedly quite unusual, but the interpretation is a very interesting one. I also wonder about the director's choice in inserting the silent scene in which Bottom is confronted by his wife - simply because it doesn't seem to add much to the storyline.But all in all, it was a wonderful adaptation, and certain to delight any fan who approaches it expecting something interesting and different.</fullReview>

Kevin Kline is a wonderful Bottom, and Stanley Tucci as Puck and Rupert Everett as Oberon also shine. Writer/director Michael Hoffman struggles to create a dreamlike atmosphere of fairyland, but he never really brought me in. He does, however, do fun things with the Pyramus and Thisbe production, especially with Moonshine. And although Calista Flockhart took a bit of getting used to, I did accept her Helena.

		<fullReview>This adaption was ah, weird. A lot of the fairies looked pretty messed up, like multiple faces and other stuff that i think was beyond the scope of a magic forest. Since the movie comes from a play, the story is character driven and therefore the most important part is the acting which varied a lot. Michelle Pfiffer was the best part, she was pretty much perfect as Titania. Rupert Everett got the job done. I thought Stanley Tucci was a great pick for Puck, I never imagined Puck aged (40ish and balding), but I though he was excellent. Calista Flockhart was pretty good, although as a unit I thought that the four main characters (especially the other three) were pretty lackluster, I mean I can't even recall anything they did. I thought that Kevin Kline was amazingly piss-poor as Nick Bottom. What a lousy job, and what was up with the raspy voice? David Strathrain and Sophie Marceau (by far the most talented actors in the cast) were fantastic as the stately Theseus and Hippolota. They were in far too little of the movie considering their great chemistry; they really glow on the screen.So what was up with the bicycles? They were used with astonishing frequency throughout the movie to the point were I was wondering what was up with the director, like does he ride bikes around without the seat or what? **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tired of foul language, this movie was a nice change. I'll watch any movie with Kevin Cline in it. For starters, he looks like Errol Flynn, and into the bargain is such a talented versatile actor. The acting of Michelle Pfeiffer, Calista Flockhart, and Stanley Tucci was outstanding. Watching Michelle Pfeiffer as Titania, the fairy queen with sparkles on her face and long red hair brought school memories back. The expressions on Stanley Tucci's face as the mischievous Puck, spoke volumes. Was this the same man I had seen a few days before as an assassin in John Grisham's "Pelican Brief?"Kevin Cline was hilarious when he finds out he has turned into a real "ass" complete with large ears. It's not good to give everything away, but by the end of the movie, we were almost on the floor laughing at the actors putting on their play within the movie. It's hard to convince some people that watching Shakespearian movies can be a lot of fun. Sometimes better than some of the rubbish we watch. Next time you come cross the "Taming of the Shrew" with Liz Taylor and Richard Burton; "Much Ado About Nothing" with Emma Thompson, Kenneth Branagh and Denzel Washington, ... take a chance and watch them. You're in for a treat! You'll be surprised at the number of familiar acting faces you'll see. Many of the best actors in the business have all been Shakespearian trained.</fullReview>

I was a little afraid to watch this movie since I wasn't sure it could live up to my expectations, but I was very impressed! All the acting was good, but I was especially struck by Calista Flockhart's Helena! I have NEVER watched Ally McBeal, so I wasn't sure what to expect from her. But I felt her acting seemed very natural and real. Sometimes I get the feeling that actors doing Shakespeare are more concerned with just getting the words out than with actually ACTING them, but Helena was great, showing all the emotion that was needed for her part. It seemed coincidental that she was speaking in verse.Kevin Kline was great as usual, and I loved Stanley Tucci as Puck (which was hard for me to imagine before I saw this movie!) The play within a play was wonderful, and had me and my husband laughing out loud, and the ending of Pyramus and Thisbe even brought a tear to my eye! I liked this movie very much!</fullReview>

You will bandy about references to Bottom and chinks in a wall and everyone will nod in agreement. It's all so familiar. So why bother with this incarnation? Well it has an impressive cast. (We must also question why they bothered.) It had been said that Calista Flockhart demonstrated her breadth in this film. I, like so many others, remain worried about Ms Flockhart's dimensions. It has quirks like bicycles - which did nothing for me. It has effects like sprites disappearing with a sparkle - which were cute. It has that Greek tragedy as an epilogue in the sense I remember from when television stopped. Polite applause.RonVideo review</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this film on the big screen, I was somewhat less than impressed. The production values seemed skimpy, Stanley Tucci wore on me a bit, Michelle Pfeiffer's voice lacked the command one would expect from a Titania (never mind her California cadence) and Calista Flockhart seemed clumsy with the dialog and too much like her TV character. But we recently rented it and showed it to my five year old, and she is absolutely fixated on it. She speaks along with the dialog, adores the fairy sequences, thinks Bottom (Kevin Kline) is a riot, loves the music -- in short, all the magic that seemed to be lacking for me is there in spades for her. Additionally, now that we've watched it approximately twenty times (no kidding) I find myself appreciating Michael Hoffman's direction very much, little things like the introduction of Bottom, the foreshadowing of Titania and Oberon's arrival, and I also think the text was judiciously edited, which isn't easy. Anna Friel is also absolutely lovely and so easy with the text, she's a joy to watch.I still hate the mud bath cat-fight, however. It makes me cringe every time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Delightful. A feast for eyes and ears. Kudos to Director Michael Hoffman for seeking a balance between the image and the text. Sometimes the balance tips a little to the scenery, but that is excused as it helps to maintain an atmosphere of magic. It's not easy bringing elves to the screen these days. Rupert Everett delivers a sulking yet empathic Oberon. Kudos also for daring to play the pauses that are the salt of a good play. Kevin Kline's Bottom is a jewel in its own right. The play within the play is superb. Strathairn and Marceau do not strike me as warlord and Amazon, but they make very elegant rulers, which works in the context of the setting (1900 nothern Italy, not antique Athens). Some of my favorite monologues were cut (love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind). But I'll let that one slide. For when the players are all dead, there needs none to be blamed. Well done !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shakespeare's Comedies are hard to do as 400 year old jokes tend not to be too funny. But the magic and playfulness of this play gives a clever director scope for a good adaptation. This version is superb. Shakespeare fans will not be disappointed, and even non-Shakespeare fans can walk in off the street to watch this with no prior knowledge and love the movie.All the characters are given a very lifelike rendering - some of the tinges of sadness to characters like Bottom and Hermia are especially effective - and the 1900 setting works nicely. The playfulness and magic are preserved intact, and the story is moved along nicely by terrific acting and direction. The verse dialogue, which is always supposed to present a barrier to the modern viewer, was no problem and preserved the meaning of the original without needing a degree in English Literature to understand it. The more theatrical and contrived aspects of the original are left out without losing anything, and all the key elements of the story are brought together into a cinematic and very entertaining movie.Every opportunity to make the audience laugh with nice little touches is taken superbly, and the final set piece had me doubled over in laughter. Especially good was the way a lot of scenes or speeches were turned into voiceovers or given a visual spin which ensured that the source material was used to make a film, rather than the medium of film being used to present a theatrical production.But finally, the biggest reason to watch this film is for the wonderful scenes of the fairies, led by Puck, Titania and Oberon, which conjured up a magical world of strangely innocent decadence and mischief. The colour, atmosphere and fun of the magical forest were superb.I am a big action blockbuster fan even though I like a bit of culture as well, and this is up there with The recent Romeo and Juliet as an example of accessible and entertaining films of the Bard's work that not only do justice to, but surpass the original in a way old Bill would have thoroughly approved.</fullReview>

The most wonderful moment occurs at the end of the rustic's presentation at the Duke's wedding celebration, the riotously fumbling "Pyramus and Thisby". Sam Rockwell,portraying Francis Flute, portraying Thisby, follows the farcical line through most of the skit, but, then, at Thisby's final monologue bemoaning Pyramus' death, he turns sorrowfully serious with such great skill that I found tears in my eyes. It greatly enriched the ending of the film, and, indeed, strengthened the entire theme of the joys and sorrows of love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Version Yet, but not the Ultimate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since Max Reinhart proved that Hollywood can do Shakespeare with this play, it has been one of the most popular Shakespeare plays to film, notwithstanding its weird structure and content.For example, the fairies. How can you even talk about fairies in this day and age without causing acute embarrassment? This film handled this difficult subject excellently with fairies who are neither cutesy nor silly but who can still be magical.Or, on the other hand, there is Helena. Hermia is easy to play (a bouncy, upbeat little person) but Helena should be strongly contrasted with her (whiny and without much self-esteem) and too often isn't. Calista Flockhart gets this perfectly and the contrast between the two women is well-drawn.One of these days, someone will be able to play Demetrius so that he and Lysander don't look like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Someday, too, someone will show us a Theseus and Hippolyta who are more than stage dressing.There are many areas where this movie could have been improved but hey! though this isn't perfection it is very good. Casting Puck with someone who can act instead of a child was great; Stanley Tucci's epilogue is marvellous and his scenes with Oberon hilarious. Having him nearly mix up Demetrius and Lysander when applying the restorative was a nice touch. Playing the mechanicals as having more depth than the usual Three Stooges interpretation and having them treated with some dignity by Theseus also deepened their roles.The much-debated question of the setting doesn't really count for that much. Shakespeare wasn't writing history or a travelogue--his Athens bears little resemblance to the one in Greece at any time: the people have such un-Greek names as Nick Bottom, there's a forest nearby and it's full of very un-Greek mythological creatures. If you can live with these incongruities (to say nothing of the existence of fairies), you should be able to imagine that there's an Athens (or Monte Athena) in Italy like there's one in Alabama.So, let yourself be drawn into this pleasant make-believe world. This will be the benchmark Midsummer's Night's Dream for quite a while yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am NOT an authority on Shakespeare. I watch a movie for the movie's sake. I simply like them. Keeping that in mind, I can't say that this was the best adaptation of a Shakespeare play that I have ever seen. There is no doubt in my mind that Kenneth Branagh is the best friend The Bard ever had in the last 40 years as far as Hollywood is concerned. But it is an enjoyable movie to watch. It gets the basic storyline across as to what happens to the 4 young lovers (and one overly earnest wanna-be actor) lost in the woods. I couldn't find fault with any of the performances. In fact, Calista Flockhart surprised me with her ability. True, the role was "yet another girl griping about the lack of a man", but I saw no sign in "Ally" in her performance. All in all, if you aren't looking for "technical perfection" and just want to know the story of Midsummer Night's Dream, I do recommend this movie. As for all the other reviews, well... no director can please every movie goer; especially when it comes to Shakespeare.</fullReview>

Christian Bale acts the role perfectly as does Dominic West as Lysander. The girls are good, but Anna Friel is better. Calista Flockhart just tries too goddamn hard. Everytime she spoke, I thought she was gonna blow up.Tucci is great, as is Pfeiffer and Kline. But the real winner here is Rupert Everett as Oberon. He steals every seen he's in. This seems to occur in every film he makes. There are no bad actors or bad scenes, but there's an overall feel to it that I can't put my finger on.The only way I can say it is this: Midsummer is supposed to be a laugh riot, it's supposed to be filled with happiness and rich characters. Some of the film felt as if I was watching the actors in a production of Death Of a Salesman. Midsummer is a brilliant play with zero faults. "Midsummer", the film is a good movie with some rough spots.See the film, don't see the film. That's the question. If you have already done a production of it or seen it performed, then you'll probably be disappointed, if your walking through the video store and say "Heh, Honey, It's Ally Mcbeal!" then, you'll really enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trite yet enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a lover of Shakespeare like myself, I viewed this movie with some hesitation. But despite a fairly lackluster performance by Calista Flockhart (her acting ability does seem limited to her popular TV character), the movie was thoroughly enjoyable, especially the portrayals of Puck and Nick Bottom. A pleasant movie to watch on a lazy afternoon when you don't want anything too deep while at the same time you'd prefer a viewing experience with some measure of class and historicity. This movie is certainly not a hacked over version of Shakespeare that films like the recent "Romeo and Juliet" (a la Claire Danes) bring to mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite possibly the worst adaption of Shakespeare ever put to film. The only reason I can't say for certain it is the worst is because I haven't seen all of them yet.I blame this movie on the director. Through silent scenes, he turns Thomas Bottom into a sympathetic character when he should be little more than a buffoon. What a waste when you have a fine comic actor like Kevin Kline in the role!Two characters that are supposed to be different heights are almost exactly the same. In a scene that is usually hilarious, they insult each others heights, but the camera shoots the "short" one from below and the "tall" one from above, making each look exactly the opposite of what the script states. Shakespeare's words are had enough without the director working to counteract them.Go see Brannaugh's "Much Ado About Nothing" if you want to see Shakespearean comedy filmed well. See this film if you need a nap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Altogether a fine job. True, there were some details that made me raise an eyebrow (Why Italy? Why 1890's? Why bicycles?), but then I realized the director had used these for a comic effect. The bicycles and records added a unique touch the Bard wouldn't have known about. There is also something to be said for adapting a play for the screen. To re-work a novel is one thing, but a play already has the dialogue set. To the director's credit, he did not modify the original words; he merely incorporated the 'modern' touches into the plot and abridged some of the excessive dialogue to keep the story rolling. The costumes and acting were enjoyable as well. Calista Flockhart, especially, seemed well cast in her role as the jilted lover Helena. Whether the characterization resembles Ally McBeal is irrelevant to me; I don't watch the TV show, so I judged the movie on its own terms, and Ms. Flockhart nailed the part. Fine performances were turned in by Michelle Pfeiffer, Rupert Everett, and a wonderfully over-acted Bottom in Kevin Kline. I would have preferred a younger actor in the role of Puck, as I see him more as a childish sprite, but Stanley Tucci gave a more mature and thus more mischievous persona to the role. In other words, one could understand a young prankster; an older fellow should know better and is thus more cunning. But hey, in the immortal world, what does age matter? In conclusion, I believe the director kept true to Shakespeare's original intent while adding his own personal touches, and that, in my opinion, makes this film a success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dream Cycle Built for Two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Variations wrung on Shakespeare's plays are many and various. Hamlet in a brewery, Petruchio in High School, and King Lear as Old MacDonald. Now Bottom and Company (fairies and mortals alike) have been re-located from Ancient Athens to late 19th century Italy. Sporting an international cast with more accents than a UN meeting, this Bard banquet succeeds more often than not - but you've got to forgive a lot of license.A pre-credit crawl explains the scene-shift and notes the emerging significance of the bicycle. I wonder, however, if the then new inventions were ready-made in bright red and yellow complete with battery-operated lamps. Surely clunkier black bikes would have been more the norm. No matter. You're probably still too confused trying to reconcile the filmaker's new Italian setting with constant references to the characters living in Athens. In fact Athenian betrothal laws are cited as the plot point upon which our dizzy tale is spun. In a theatrical stage production we wouldn't think twice. But cinema is a more literal medium and when a character says they are in Athens we more or less want to take them at their word - no matter what the scenery and titles may tell us.Quibble a bit further why Bottom's wife (a character not in the original play) searches the town square asking for her wayward spouse in untranslated Italian while all around her are speaking English? She seems like a confused villager who's town has been beset by a troupe of British thespians.All thespians, by the way, are in fine form, even those with Hollywood roots. No surprise that many are stage-trained talent. Even Stanley Tucci (an unlikely casting choice for sprite Robin Goodfellow) does well - though I question whether even drunken fairies need to relieve themselves. What's the point of being magical if one has to endure the mundane mortal pain of a full bladder?"A Midsummer Night's Dream" is a welcome addition to the late spate of filmed Bard. Fantastic in plot (with a troublesome overlong ending that goes on a full half hour more than it should) it is perhaps most at home on the stage. But turn a blind eye and mount your tandem - you'll find it's not such a rough trip.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a Shakespeare fan, and one who's particularly fond of the Midsummer Night's Dream, I was quite disappointed with this film.The casting was done based on popularity rather than on talent, and it showed--the only acceptable work was from Kevin Kline and Stanley Tucci, both of whom can do no wrong anyway. The special effects were overblown, the sets were very fake-looking, and the setting was conspicuously ambiguous (are we in Italy? Greece? England? Plains? Forest? Jungle?). Finally, the director's pretension showed clearly in his choice to add back-plot--since when is Bottom married, let alone unhappily? I heartily recommend AGAINST seeing this film, if you value any literary sensibility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am so proud that I have watched this movie. The place is certainly one of the most beautiful ever. The forest, the city, the grass field... its all beautiful. They justify why does the movie take place in the nineteenth century instead of the fifteenth. Its all because of the wonders of the world shown in this movie that didn't exist in Shakespeare's life. But I think that Shakespeare himself would choose this place to record the movie.The story (just like the women in the movie) is beautiful, a classic love story that gives us a lesson of "how should a beautiful, marvelous and perfectly written story be?". The acting is satisfactory and the direction is very well done. The result? Its a must! It makes Titanic, Notting Hill and many other love stories look just like plain dull.My rating: Take a wild guess. 10, of course!!!P.S.: Parents everywhere: this movies contains very, REALLY little "nudity" (well... you can see "it" only a little)and sex. But you can be sure this isn't any kind of heavy metal porn or something! Its a must for all the kids (well... kids under 10 may not like the story)and a masterpiece of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really expected a whole lot of "movie magic" when seeing this film. I was looking forward to it ever since I heard Sophie Marceau, Calista Flockhart and Kevin Kline were playing. But after the movie, i was not exactly disappointed but not blown away as well. Why was this?Well, I thought the "magic" part about Shakepeares Midsummer Nights Dream was not emphasized enough. I thought the focus was on the loving couples in the forest, and so I felt that characters like Puck or even Michelle Pfeiffers Titania somehow lost weight. Though Stanley Tucci did well in his performance, his Puck somehow did not seem "Puck" enough, which might be because of all the other Hollywood Superstars running around.The transfer of the setting into 19th century Italy was certainly no big innovation. Except for bicycles and records, we did get no new ideas from Mister Hoffmann.But the movie was still entertaining (due to the fantastic original version) and hilarious. Calista Flockhart did great mimic work, and Kline was wonderful especially in the final sequence. A nice movie to watch, but missing the one final "kick".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A big bunch of simply perfectly acting stars, including four(!) really beautiful women(!), a script with a superbeautiful language, even in its translation, from the master of all scripts, an environment which fits the original intentions of Shakespeare, and a director which cares mainly about his actors and uses effects for the decoration of the story, not as the story itself. Do I have to say more ?Ah, yes, I think there has been a big new star born in this picture, this *goddess* Calista Flockhart, which plays Helena's sad love so wonderfully that its really hard to understand why Demetrius needs some additional magic to fall in love to her. But all the other actors play so gorgeously, too, one more gorgeously than the other, I in fact don't know who I should mention first. Maybe Kevin Kline and Stanley Tucci got the most thankful, interesting, funniest roles, and yes they played them very, very well.Its wonderful ! Even if its finally only light entertainment, as it was in the original, there is really none of these typical Hollywood faults in it - this movie has a soul !

		<fullReview>I have seen a lot of Shakespeare plays, and even studied them at university. Except for the loud chaotic teenaged frenzie of the recent Romeo and Juliet, I have loved the modern Shakespeare film adaptations. But this one was flat. Not even Michelle Pfieffer's beauty helped. Some of the other comments on this imdb page refer to the olde English as being awkward to the point of not understanding the dialogue. Now this is odd, since although I did not like the chaotic Romeo and Juliet film, I could at least understand (most of) the dialogue. Not so with Midsummer's. Why oh why doesn't someone have the courage to produce a Shakespeare film with better English? It is like we are all forced to read the King James Bible (no, I am not a Christian) or (egad!) forced to cope with only DOS based computer programs! And yes, I really DID fall asleep, twice, during the film. My wife liked the film, and even remembered some of the lines from when she acted in a drama production decades ago.

Rupert Everett, Stanley Tucci and Kevin Kline were brilliant, Calista Flockhart was good as Helena and some of the others held their own.

At least there are no motor cars! Only bicycles! Having said my piece I have to admit that in this version the change of period did not detract overly much from the 'feeling' of the play and did add a couple of jokes.It takes about fifteen minutes to get your head around the original Shakespearean language (my friend calls this, "kicking in the universal translator") and fortunately this is just the intro' and is not difficult to follow. After that one hardly notices the dialogue.Overall..Great fun.Competent performances all round. Michelle Pffiefer holds her end up with ease.Er. Did that sound right?</fullReview>

But, this being one of the Bard's best-loved works, with shining dialogue and winning characters, it is very entertaining.The casting is a good start with Calista Flockhart perfectly cast as, you wouldn't believe it, a lovelorn romantic chasing after her dream man. Rupert Everett and Michelle Pfeiffer are also superb, but Kevin Kline takes the trophy for his appearance in the traditionally hilarious final play-within-a-play scene.Anyone feeling romantic should go and see this film, it is the perfect date movie and a sure sign that old Shakey's work is still as fresh as it ever was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This latest version of Shakespeare's most popular comedy, A Midsummer Night's Dream, is in fact the only version I have seen. And compared to the other Shakespeare plays I have been yawning my way through, such as "Shakespeare in Love", I find this magical fairy tale brilliant!The entire cast is doing a magnificent job, but I have to honour some of them that are distinguishing themselves by superb acting, charming and dazzling manners. My favourite, Stanley Tucci is wonderful as Puck, the mischievous trickster, running errands for Oberon, the king of Fairies. I also found Calista Flockhart's interpretation of her role figure Helena, as a neurotic mess, very interesting and amusing. Although it sometimes was frustrating to see her drooling over Demetrius and desperately nagging "I want to be your Spaniel," I had great fun during all the complications caused by Oberon's love-potion.The bicycle, a relatively new invention at the time, played an important role as a comic conveyance for both fairies and mortals.The enchanted forest is where most of the action takes place, and this forest is one of the most fantastic sceneries I have seen in a movie in a long time. And the amazing part is that nothing of it is computer-generated. This gave me a genuine impression and it strengthened my feelings about this wonderland.This film was a thoroughly enjoyable experience that does credit to its director, cast and writer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something's Rotten In /D/e/n/m/a/r/k/ Italy....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Shakespeare had been a cinematographer, this version of A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM would rate very high. Unfortunately, the film's visual lushness can't compensate for a great number of flat performances, and Shakespeare's language too often doesn't get the treatment it deserves from the players.One severe problem is that it's much too hard to tell the actors apart -- an important consideration in a crossed-couples comedy. Lysander and Demetrius look too much alike, as do Hippolyta and Helena. This would make less of a difference if the roles were acted or spoken distinctively, but that's not the case here; too many lines are simply tossed off with little thought. Of the assorted lovers, only Calista Flockhart's Hermia is consistently identifiable at a glance, and not surprisingly emerges as the strongest presence among the romantic cast.Kevin Kline as Bottom, however, is outstanding -- at once broadly comical and carefully nuanced. His fellow mechanicals are easily more watchable than the various lovers (if you last saw Max Wright in the TV sitcom ALF, you're in for a pleasant surprise).The faerie folk are a mixed lot. Stanley Tucci's Puck is an above-average turn, and Titania is played fairly well, but Oberon is a cipher -- not least because he's almost always shot from the neck up, while lying flat on something or other. Not the actor's fault, this, but a truly bizarre cinematic choice that makes no sense whatsoever.It *is* mostly a good-looking film, the weird close-ups and some unnecessarily odd-looking faeries notwithstanding. But the ensemble can't come close to matching the energy of SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, and that's a near-fatal problem for genuine Shakespeare. And it's telling that Kline's Oscar-caliber turn arguably ought to be nominated as Best Actor, not Best Supporting Actor -- he's that good, and everyone else is that tepid.It's worth matinee prices for Kline, or a video rental for the chance to use stop-motion and ogle Titania's court, but that's about all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a mess. I HATE when a director decides to change the time period of a Shakespeare play, unless his change makes a big difference. This one doesn't. We're looking at Tuscany in the late 1800's. Why? Well, I think I know, but it doesn't work. He's got bicycles figured prominently in it. They're treated as new-fangled contraptions. We know this because the director insists on telling us that at the beginning of the film, in print. I suppose he had some sort of concept of the turn of the century, the onset of modern mechanization, symbolized by the bikes. The lovers ride them into the forest, but once there, the so-called modern world takes a back seat to some good old-fashioned magic. The bike becomes a plaything for Puck. Sound good? It ain't. It doesn't work. And the motif is irritatingly insistent. Michelle Pfeiffer and Calista Flockhart should avoid Shakespeare in the future. They have a few moments of inspiration, but they basically come across as college students who need a LOT more familiarity with making the bard's language come alive. One point where the director scores is in his notion of Bottom. He throws in a subplot about an unhappy marriage, and uses it to reinforce Peter Quince's comments that Bottom must play Pyramus because "Pyramus is a sweet-faced man, a proper man as one shall see in a summer's day, a most lovely gentlemanlike man." Instead of Quince usually telling Bottom this just to shut him up about Bottom's desire to play every part, he's speaking the truth. Underneath the bluster is a sweet, gentle man, a man prone to flights of fancy just to give a lift to a less-than-happy life. It's a defense, all this bragging and egomania. As a result, Kline needs to sacrifice comedy for pathos in places, but he's swell, and it works just fine for the film, especially because there's a comic gem besides Kline to take up the slack: Stanley Tucci as Puck. I have never seen a Puck I've liked in my life. I've seen Peter Pan imitations, and punks, mimes, athletes, dancers and hyperkinetic idiots. But Tucci does what only he could do with this role, takes it unexpected places and succeeds wildly. It's a fine turn. The rude mechanics? Well, they aren't exactly given much good business until the play-within-a-play at the end. Even that's nowhere near as funny as, say, the videotaped production of Joe Papp's production in Central Park, but it IS funny. Come to think of it, Calista Flockhart would have been wise to have checked out Christine Baranski's performance as Helena in the same Papp production. It's the best I've ever seen. She's hilarious. Then again, it's an hilarious role. You'd never know that from this movie, though. Throw in another typical "serious" performance of Oberon (when are actors gonna realize this character is FUN???) and terrible special effects mixed in with the good ones, and really embarrassingly bad costumes for some of the fairies (they look like SCTV doing Fellini's "Roma") and you've got a movie that, except for Kline and Tucci and a few rare good directorial choices, just doesn't need to be seen on the big screen. But one place where the director and Kline and Tucci all come together to work wonders is the end of the film. I think in every version of Midsummer's I've ever seen, there's always been at least one good thing to take away from it. And the end is this version's beauty. It works. After all the erratic stuff that's gone before, this end really works. It's just lovely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Hoffman Is No William Shakespeare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Shakespeare's _A Midsummer Night's Dream_ is a funny play with some serious themes, lightly handled; Michael Hoffman's A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM is a slow and pretty somber affair that misses much of the comedy and almost all of the seriousness.In English stereotypes ca. 1595, Thebes was the city of passion and Athens the city of Reason. In Anglo-American stereoypes ca. 1585-1999, Italy is a land of romance and passion. Setting the play in a fairy-tale Athens, once upon a time (when legendary Theseus was a medieval duke), was Shakespeare's serious joke: Athens, city of Reason, is the general setting for this passionate nonsense; eminently sensible Theseus won't believe in "antic fables" when he bloody well *is* an antic/antique fable! Setting the film in 1890s Italy gets rid of all that.Hoffman runs on and on with the opera and crowd shots and giving Kevin Kline's Bottom a wife and a psychology, and cuts almost all the lines that make _MND_ a serious look at love and reason. Most notably, in a key moment in the play, Titania declares her love for the ass-ified Bottom and Bottom replies that she has "little reason for that. And yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together nowadays. The more the pity some honest neighbors will not make them friends. Nay, I can gleek"--make satiric comments--"upon occasion." And Titania responds, "Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful." Bottom is ugly and stupid, but he says very wise things here, and to Titania he looks good. So ... --So we have an important speech. Hoffman leaves in the "gleek" line that few will understand and cuts "The more the pity" line: which is a very bad decision on Hoffman's part since life would be better if reason and love *did* go together.Similarly for Duke Theseus's lines on "The lunatic, the lover and the poet," where "poet" includes playwrights; Hoffman cuts most of the speech. And that's a bad idea 'cause that linking of madness, love, and art justifies the Pyramus and Thisbe playlet as more than mere farce. But in Hoffman's MND Pyramus and Thisbe isn't even good farce.It's a shame; the cast is good, and God knows Kevin Kline can do very funny serious comedy. And Hoffman at least understands intellectually that _MND_ is an erotic and disconcerting dream, even if his direction doesn't make the film very sexy or even a little scary.Well, Shakespeare's play will survive. Maybe Hoffman should try _Coriolanus_ or some other Shakespearean work that hasn't been done to death.</fullReview>

But the worst casting this year is Stanley Tucci as Puck. The normally endearing actor is so out of place in this role, and he mistakenly plays the role as a mellow, lazy sprite. The best performance comes from Anna Friel as Hermia. She is the one person who really captures the spirit of the play. Stiff, stiff movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I was scared to death that the open credits "fairy lights" were going to lead to a "Wonderful World of Disney" approach for the film, I was happy to be wrong. The film does many things well, from acting, design, and directing to editing.Strong performances from everyone from Sophie Marceau to Kevin Kline help make it work. And while Calista Flockhart was a bit too upset as Helena, I found her overall performance fine. It was interesting to see a Puck looking older than Oberon, but Stanley Tucci has a nice take on the mischief of the character.Some weak points included an over devotion to the bicycle motif and some woodland sets that looked too much like movie sets. And I found it surprising that we did not see Bottom's coming back to see his wife at the end of the film. -There was effort made to set this up, and then it wasn't shown. I found it odd, and I hope it wasn't cut to save time.I went with a group who had mixed feelings, but most felt positive about it overall. My summary: if you like the play, and you're not fixed on one interpretation, you'll probably enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>beautiful mix fantasy and real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not read Midsummer Night's Dream since junior high school which is more years than I care to think about, but this film once again brought it to life. I know artistic license was taken with the setting and scenes not in the play were added, but Mr. Hoffman who (co)wrote and directed this film did a marvelous job at embellishing the story for film. The cinematography of both real world (Tuscany) and the fantasy were beautiful and add to that a powerful classical soundtrack. The ensemble cast includes many notable actors of which I will not mention all. I was particularly impressed with the young lovers of which I would've liked to have seen more. Especially good were the two young suitors, Dominic West (Lysander) and Christian Bale (Demetrius). They were both convincing in their love and hate. They delivered the difficult dialogue in both a natural ad passionate manner as well. Of the young women Calista Flockhart was very good as the confused and emotionally tortured Helena. Stanley Tucci defines the term "puck"ish with impish look, and the chemistry with the brooding Oberon, very well played by Rupert Everett is a highlight of the movie. I would also like to mention Sam Rockwell for his scene in the play within a play where he plays the woman, Thisbe. A small role but one that stands out. This 130 minutes flew by. Good entertainment. Three and a half stars!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the better Shakespeare movies I have seen, and I am a HUGE Shakespeare fan. It beats the hell out of MTV's Romeo and Juliet, for example. Michael Hoffman's direction was excellent, he added some wonderful little touches to the show (especially in the Pyramus and Thisbe part), and brought out the fact that this play is REALLY funny -- something people often miss with Shakespeare. The visuals were very nice, the sets and costumes were perfect. The acting was excellent, especially Stanley Tucci, who was a lot of fun as Robin Goodfellow, and Kevin Kline is still absolutely the man. He was stunning. I really hope he gets an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for this part. His speech about his 'dream' brought out a huge level of depth in it that I had missed when I read it because of its humor. I hope Mr. Hoffman does more Shakespeare movies in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great cast and a good director come up with a pretty good adaptation of Shakespeare's play. It can't hold a candle to the 1935 film, but, on it own terms, it works. The problem is not all of the cast can recite Shakespeare's dialogue with meaning. Surprisingly, the younger actors pull it off, while the older ones have trouble. Kline and Pfeiffer are both wonderful actors, but this is not their best work. Kline is incredibly annoying (and unfunny); Pfeiffer looks breathtaking, but every time she talks her face is a blank. She's just reciting, not acting. On the other hand, everybody else is great. Everett is perfectly cast as the the King of the Fairies (get it?), and knows how to recite Shakespeare AND act. Also Bale, West and (surprisingly) Flockhart are just great. They seem totally comfortable with the dialogue. As for Stanlet Tucci...really BAD casting choice. He's at least 30 years too old to play Puck, and is just boring in the role.The film looks good (just good, not great) but it's not as magicial as it would like to be. Also there are flashes of male and female nudity...but it's Shakespeare so it got through with no problems. All in all, a decent movie. However, see it on a big screen...the scenery won't work at all on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems a lot of people are expecting this to be THE interpretation of Shakespeare, and they are sadly disappointed. But, if you're looking for a reasonably good version of one of Shakespeare's most delightful plays, with much of the language intact, and few mis-steps by the actors, this movie works well. Stanley Tucci is brilliant as Puck, and, with Rupert Everett, delineates beautifully the relationship between the brooding Oberon and his scheming servant. The lovers work well together. The mechanicals are an excellent troupe, and Kline is, of course, a stand-out. Where problems appear are in the direction and the production values, which are tremendously mixed, giving us lush Tuscan hillsides with beautifully costumed characters, and then transporting us into the magical woods, which are stagy and peopled with fairies costumed with fake Walmart Halloween costume pieces. Hoffman attempts to add some different concepts to his interpretation, then fails to fully realize them (the wife of Bottom sub-plot), or botches the direction of them (notably the attempt to have Flute deliver a truly moving performance as Thisby). However, if you're willing to sit back and enjoy the ride without expecting the ultimate Shakespeare (which is what, anyway??), you should be rewarded a lot more than by the rest of the fare that's beginning to hit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen a better production of this play. The depth of Kevin Kline's character in particular stands out as a touch of excellence. The addition of a wife for his character, Bottom, gives new dimension to an otherwise largely slapstick role, and Kline's Bottom is whimsical and wistful, capturing the imagination and the hearts of the audience. The two pairs of lovers, lost in the woods, are all remarkably convincing in their very changeable moods and roles as the love quadrangle undergoes its twists and turns. Christian Bale is, as usual, gorgeous and eminently watchable, while Rupert Everett as Oberon is sultry and fascinating as he lounges in the greenery and directs the goings-on. Everett's relationship with Michelle Pfeiffer, as Titania, underlies the plot of the play and also carries the movie. As a beautiful, aesthetic piece of art, this movie fits the bill and pleases to no end. I recommend this movie in every way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember that when "A Midsummer Night's Dream" came out, many critics considered it a weird version of Shakespeare's play. I didn't see anything particularly wrong with it. Granted, they did change some things (namely moving the setting about 300 years ahead of the original play's setting), but there's nothing bad about that. I probably should admit that one thing which I've never quite understood about the play is whether or not one of the stories portrayed is supposed to eclipse the others. The one that most sticks in my mind is Nick Bottom getting turned into a donkey (especially thanks to Kevin Kline's neat interpretation of the role).So, while I wouldn't consider this movie the ultimate masterpiece (particularly in a year that saw "The Sixth Sense", "American Beauty" and "Being John Malkovich"), it's a fairly edifying experience. It's a little strange to see Calista Flockhart as Helena, given that she's best known as Ally McBeal, but she still does OK with the role). So overall, I do recommend the movie. Also starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Stanley Tucci, Rupert Everett, Christian Bale and David Strathairn. To paraphrase the cast: the "Fish Called Wanda" thief, Ally McBeal, Catwoman, Walter Winchell, a certain character actor, Batman and Edward R. Murrow.To think. After Bottom gets turned into a donkey and has a fling with Titania, she says that she was enamored an ass. No matter how you look at it, he always sounds like a posterior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty film that doesn't make it easy for the uninitiated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A tale of gods and mortals and that most confusing of subjects ? love. With relationships confused on earth, things become very simple when Puck is given reign to cast love spells on several people to create a complex tangle of love that shows that love never runs straight or true.I'm that I will be seen as some sort of idiot for not liking this film but, in some vague sort of defence, I'd like to point out that I have seen and enjoyed many other Shakespeare adaptations on the screen and enjoyed many of them. The problem I had with this film was that more time had been spent on the visual presentation rather than the presentation of the story. For this reason I though the film looked really nice and had real imagination and flair behind it ? but the plot was not given as much work.I like to think that I am not stupid, but, were it not for the fact that I had a rough knowledge of the story prior to watching this version, I would have really struggled to get a hold of what was going on, as it was I still found it difficult to keep up with. I would have appreciated it more had the film been a little kinder in helping me understand the characters and the plot without relying on me to catch and understand every word (which I couldn't).I can read Shakespeare and understand the dialogue fine, however when it is coming at me at machine gun pace, I'll struggle and need the visual aspect of the story to help me out a little bit by making the film free to clutter and easy to understand. I'm afraid much of it was lost on me as I struggled to keep up, and the film suffered as a result. Visually of course, it is great and it has it's witty moments but it didn't really do it for me.Which, considering the great cast, was a shame. Kline stole most of the scenes he was in and was the best part of the film for me, Tucci was an enjoyable Puck, but with many others I found it difficult to find the characters behind the famous faces. Pfeiffer and Everett were both good but I didn't get much from Flockhart, Friel, Bale or West. The cast is deep in faces but this distracted me even more and served to remind me of how much window dressing this film seemed to have when all I really wanted was good story telling.Overall I didn't enjoy this film simply because I found it hard to get into. I fully intend to watch it again in the future as I feel it may have been partially my fault, but I must say that I did expect a little help from the film. If you look at some recent adaptations of Shakespeare for the cinema you'll see that many have their own touches (visual, not dialogue) and that many of these help to deepen the characters and add understanding for the audience. This film had none of that ? the fact that it was a film was used to make it look good and bring in a strong famous cast, it should have used the media to also make the story more accessible and fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Hoffman's production is certainly good-looking, with all that lovely Tuscan scenery to play with. But the performance of the play itself is every bit as uneven as Hollywood's last go at this work back in 1935.The acting kudos go to the delightful Anna Friel as Hermia. Friel is a captivating young actress who should be as well known as her compatriots Kate Winslet and Rachel Weisz. Let's hope that situation changes quickly. Christian Slater and Dominic West (now doing a fine job as a Baltimore detective in HBO's The Wire) are close behind as Demetrius and Lysander. The talented Roger Rees shows up as one of the "rustics" Peter Quince - given that he's an RSC veteran, it must have been a little galling for him to appear in a small role while lesser talents (see below) had more screen time. As Puck, Stanley Tucci is acceptable, but no more.It pretty much goes downhill from there. Calista Flockhart is annoyingly ditsy and whiny as Helena, Michelle Pfeiffer can't handle a speech longer than 2-3 lines, Rupert Everett barely bothers to act (a habit of his), Sophie Marceau struggles with her accent, and the talented David Strathairn seems ill at ease as Theseus.As for Kevin Kline, he's perfectly good, but not nearly as funny as he tries to be (or perhaps thinks he is) - and nowhere near as wonderful as Paul Rodgers peerless performance as Bottom in the 1968 Peter Hall film. But he does have some touching, human moments in a film that looks better than it plays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I'll bite: why late 19th century Tuscany? Even if Hoffman had no particular reason to suppose that his change of setting was for the worse (and I think it is, if only because it renders the fairies' references to `the Athenian' completely mystifying), he should PRESUME that his change is for the worse, unless he has good positive reason to think that it's for the better. Shakespeare's original setting is always the default setting. When will twentieth century directors, stage AND screen, get this through their thick skulls?Now that I've said that I should add that the Tuscan photography is lovely. But the midsummer night's dream itself is all studio work, and it looks cluttered, and confused, and ugly, ugly, ugly. Any HINT of enchantment has been removed. To make matters worse, this is clearly an accident - they were so obviously TRYING to make the forest look beautiful, or at the very least striking, by night. I spent most of the time trying to suppress sympathetic embarrassment. To make matters worse STILL, the forest the characters see during the day is manifestly NOT the same forest they spend the night in. This is a more serious flaw than you might think. We never see a commonplace forest transformed: instead we see a commonplace forest, then a lousy studio set, then the forest again.We're never allowed to forget that this is taking place in the 1890s. Bicycles and phonograph records litter the landscape. But I'm glad to see that this Tuscan town is so conservative a backwater that everyone is still whistling the music from `La Traviata'. Period opera music would be Puccini and Mascagni - but why bother with those two, when we have Verdi?This is, as I've said, a weak and rather odd play of Shakespeare's, and I'm not sure Hoffman knew why he wanted to bring it to life. I get the feeling he doesn't know what to do with either his cast or his material. Kevin Kline does very well, mostly, although he needed to be tamed; but Calista Flockhart - bah. Still, I don't quite have the heart to say that the resulting movie is bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful scenery in the opening few scenes and glorious opera and classics throughout. Sadly the acting is more in the old ages of Laurence Oliver's "passionate wood" school of acting. For those viewers who have been spoiled with Shakespeare as directed by Branagh, Polanski or Baz Luhrmann, this offering of Midsummer Night's Dream hardly comes up to scratch. The great exception is Anna Friel. Except when her Northern accept seeps through, she shows herself to be a very gifted actress. The rest of the cast seem more like they're "doing Shakespeare" for the fun of it or to have it on their CVs. Flockhart's Ally McBeal character doesn't sit well, , and the rest are thrown together in what looks like a Dr Doolittle meets Danny Kaye. The film almost comes alive though towards the end in the "play within a play" - the performances then at least seem a little more sincere and we don't have to be continually distracted by the mishmash of various English and American accents. Nice effort, but that's all - except for the fact that Shakespeare can be enjoyed, if enunciated well (as it is in this movie), even when the acting isn't up to standard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was gutted to see such a brilliant, witty and multi-dimensional play wasted in such an elaborate way. There was evidently a lot of money thrown at this production, but it was not wisely spent. There were some scenes that raised a laugh, but the average school play could do this with such a sparkling script; most comic twists and jokes felt drained of humour, and many completely ignored.Shakespeare's work always leaves room for interpretation and new ideas around the existing script, but I gained the sense that the director was adding new plots lines for the hell of it, especially a (necessarily silent) tangent involving Bottom the Weaver's wife.There were some excellent performances from Pfieffer and Kline, but Flockhart just stomped around being Alley McBeal. The soundtrack was quite uplifting, but shonky editing and post-production took the edge off this side of things; one computer imposed background was particularly obvious.I really wanted to see a good film version of this fantastic play, but after about 30 minutes I could not convince myself that it was anything but a poor effort. Elaborate, but poor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good grief. OK, so it was a really pretty movie (despite some of the forest stuff looking like a kid's playset) but what did they do to Shakespeare? Hello, this is supposed to be slapstick comedy? Bottom is not supposed to have a private life. What really irritated me, though, was what they did to the Pyramus and Thisbe play at the end, where Thisbe pulls her/his wig off and gets all sincere and makes the audience teary-eyed. That is NOT supposed to happen. It absolutely ruined one of the funniest lines in the play, the "Thy lily lips, thy cherry nose, thy yellow cowslip cheeks" part. The Pyramus and Thisbe scene is supposed to be a disaster from start to finish, which is what makes it funny. Also, the social/economic difference between the players and the lovers was not clearly enough established. The players looked pretty darn rich, especially the costumes they managed to find for their play. Where did they get all that fancy fabric and the nice wigs? If they could afford that kind of costumes, why were they so excited about the money the Duke was offering to the winners? One thing that was very distracting was the way Shakespeare's scenes were broken up. Like how a scene would jump to a different scene in the middle of a speech- the same guy would still be in the middle of the same speech, but all of a sudden would be in a completely different location with different people. The only things that saved this movie from being a loss were: a) they managed to salvage a bit of the play's natural humor, b) the mudfight, and c) it was pretty. It was a nice movie if you try to forget that it's supposed to be related to the Shakespeare play. If you go expecting it to be Shakespeare, you'll be disappointed.</fullReview>

Someone at some point must have hadthis thought, because this is one woefully miscast film of a play.The one exception- Kevin Kline. His "Bottom" is one of the best inrecent memory. Everyone else strains and struggles with thelanguage, which should have flowed 'trippingly on the tongue', butinstead trips up their tongues and falls flat against our ears. Poorlyshot, with music so loud and constant that you want them to turndown the volume, this is not a good version of this play. Go andsee your community theater do it, they'll probably do it better-provided they don't try and immitate this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring! AND Calista Flockhart is a shining star.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie "A Midsummer Night's Dream" directed by Michael Hoffman was just about two hours long, the average length of a movie, but it was the longest two hours of my life. This misguided attempt at a classic uses many lines from the play, but the way the actors struggle getting the language down-pat changes the interesting, fun, and engaging script to a boring mess. In the book, Bottom (portrayed by Kevin Kline) thinks he is something extra special, as he does in some moments of the movie, but as they tried to add some depth to his character, we saw moments where he felt dejected, which didn't really flow with the character Shakespeare originally intended Bottom to be. It is also worth mentioning that although Titania did have a train of fairies in both the book and the movie, Shakespeare wrote them as male and Hoffman used female sprites. Oscar nominee Michelle Pfeiffer is a talented actress with a lot of experience, but perhaps not the best casting choice for Titania. Although she has the beauty and grace of the fairy queen, she seemed uncomfortable making lengthy speeches. On the other hand, I was surprised to see Calista Flockhart do a great portrayal of desperate Helena and use her frog-like facial features to entice the audience to watch the scenes. Unfortunately, Calista Flockhart provides some of the only star quality in the entire film. There are some strange contradictory moments; for example, when Robin says he will "Put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes", just like it is written in the play, he uses a turtle (a notable representative of slow movement) to get around. The plot of the movie is crucial to a story like this, and although it usually stays on point with Shakespeare's play, there are momentary lapses that don't fit in- like the use of the bicycles, which is just silly. The complex love quadrangle between Hermia, Lysander, Helena and Demetrius is recognizable, but not quite as tragic and confusing as you can picture when reading the book. This play is supposed to be a comedy, but the only laughter comes a brief moment at the end of the movie where a dog (which isn't in William Shakespeare's version) comes running onto the stage during the tradesmen's performance. Other than that, the humour is turned into boredom. Another reason why I found this movie boring was because it was not aesthetically pleasing. The set looks extremely unreal and there is not much more to elaborate about it. Likewise, I found the costuming to have little excitement, and I was especially disappointed with Bottom's ensemble. I had pictured an actual ass-head when reading the book, but all he had was donkey ears and some excess hair. The type of music was passable, but the sheer volume of it was unsatisfying. The only part of the setting that was identical to the book was which scenes took place at night and which scenes took place during the day. I would not recommend watching the 1999 film version of A Midsummer Night's Dream to anyone that gets confused easily, or any students having a test on the play. Instead of understanding the play more because of watching the play and getting to see the set and characters' body language, I am more perplexed than ever. There are obvious similarities, like many parts of the script and the relationships between the characters, but there is a dictionary full of differences- one huge one being that it takes place several centuries later in history. If you are in the mood to see a dramatic, romantic comedy, I suggest watching Enchanted, which brought in double the laughs, smiles, gasps and money in the U.S. Box Office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magical 'Dream'!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood's continuing love affair with William Shakespeare is well-served in this excellent 1999 adaptation of one magical night's revelry 'twixt Faeries and Mortals. Released shortly after the film adaptation of the Royal Shakespeare Theater's revival, this production is less literal, but offers dazzling special effects, a terrific score, borrowing heavily from classical sources, and performances ranging from the sublime (Kevin Kline, Rupert Everett, Stanley Tucci), to the surprisingly good (Calista Flockhart, Michelle Pfeiffer), to 'Window Dressing' (Sophie Marceau), to laughably bad, but so what? (David Strathairn).This is a film that will draw you into a world where Magic lives, where Romance is ignited by whim, and where Happy Endings may take a while, but are as certain as tomorrow's sunrise!Certainly, Shakespeare's text has been edited heavily, and the settings have been changed, but one reason the Bard works so well cinematically is that his themes are universal, and timeless ('Richard III' has been filmed as a '30s Nazi-like drama, 'Hamlet' in a dozen time periods...Recent adaptations have placed 'Romeo and Juliet' in 90's California, and 'The Taming of the Shrew' and 'Othello' at suburban high schools). This latest adaptation, while changing the locale and century, sacrifices none of Shakespeare's intent!If you're a Dreamer, who still sees the Fantastic as desirable, and believes in a world where Love makes ALL things possible, THIS is the film for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have just watched this again on video and was again enchanted. The imagery was just right and the sense of the formal and the more instinctual and darker underside being somehow brought together by the play within a play worked very well, especially as the bubbling swamp into which the girls were drawn hinted at the magic of love. It brought out aspects of the play I had not thought of properly before. Oberon had just the right qualities of jealousy and possessiveness while Titania was very beautiful and voluptuous and Puck beautifully impish. There wasn't a weakness in the film as far as I was concerned. Bottom was in turn irritating and entrancing and all sorts of little touches (eg the drunk fairy) made the whole thing a complete delight. How nice to be entertained without violence. ET</fullReview>

Stanley Tucci was lovely like he always is and Rupert Everett was so funny in Oberon's character!!! But, the most remarkable, delightful character was, no doubt, Michelle Pfeiffer's one - Titania.

		<fullReview>The village of Monte Athena, Italy, at the turn of the Nineteenth Century is the setting for this delightful version of William Shakespeare's `A Midsummer Night's Dream,' directed by Michael Hoffman. Bustles are in decline, and a new invention, the bicycle, is rising in popularity; and on this one particular night in the forest, mortals and fairies come together for a mirthful interlude rife with mischief, unsolicited intercession and the pursuit of love. This is a most engaging production, highlighted by a number of outstanding performances, beautiful photography and a wonderful score by Simon Boswell which features the talents of Cecilia Bartoli, Luciano Pavarotti, Renee Fleming and Roberto Alagna. Kevin kline gives an especially noteworthy performance as bottom, while Rupert Everett (Oberon), Dominic West (Lysander), Anna Friel (Hermia) and Sam Rockwell (Flute) are also exemplary. Michelle Pfeiffer is absolutely stunning as Titania, Queen of the Fairies, and Stanley Tucci delivers a nimble Puck. There are some wonderful moments in this movie, and one especially memorable scene in which Bottom and his troop perform `Pyramus and Thisbe' for the Duke (David Strathairn) and Hippolyta (Sophie Marceau); it is hysterical. Rounding out this superb cast are Calista Flockhart (Helena), Christian Bale (Demetrius), Roger Rees (Quince), Max Wright (Starveling), Gregory Jbara (Snug), Bill Irwin (Snout), Bernard Hill (Egeus) and John Sessions (Philostrate). Extremely well done, `A Midsummer Night's Dream' is a comedy that will lift your spirits and keep you smiling for hours. A great addition to anyone's video collection, this one is not to be missed. I rate this one 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good enough...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie, retelling William Shakespeare's original comedy, is a journey through magic and adventure. The exceptional use of costumes, makeup and other effects, such as glimmering fairies and disappearing shadows, enhances the movie experience, and takes us into the Shakespearean world. Most of the story takes place in great settings, perfectly directed to fit the plot.There is nothing negative to say about the performance of the actors either.Setting all these positive features aside, I still feel somewhat disappointed as the film fails to deliver the desired effect. Making such a famous play into a movie is very demanding, and the director has done a fabolous job with all the little details. However, looking at "the big picture", it was not good enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first: A Midsummer Night's Dream is a wonderful play, exceedingly clever and very funny. It's hardly Young Will's best work, but it's not far off the best of them. This film, however, fails flatly to bring the magic of the play to life. Yes, it's beautifully shot. Yes, there are smart tricks (I think Puck's introduction is imaginatively handled). Yes, the play at the end is funny (it would be hard not to wring laughs from such a brilliantly written piece of madness). But too often it's dark and brooding where it should be light and frothy. The key word for the play was FUN; this movie chooses not to recognise that, and aims for complexity and depth where Shakespeare quite blatantly didn't intend any. This is a meant to be a comedy, for crying out loud, yet Hoffman seems to think he's directing one of the tragedies! And while Kline and Tucci are good as Bottom and Puck (which actors of merit wouldn't be?), the pair playing Demetrius and Lysander are as wooden as the trees of the forest. No version of Dream can be a complete failure - the source material will transcend the feeble talents of even the most limited adaptor - but this one is sorely lacking and will do nothing to increase the play's popularity - or Master Will's!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Self-enchanted rendering of the Bard! Shakespeare's play is transported to a 19th Century Italian village, where uptight lovers learn to loosen up with assistance from the King and Queen of the Fairies. Subplot about a village play comes off much better than the wafty fantasy elements, and only Kevin Kline and Stanley Tucci seem comfortable with their roles in this lightweight treatment. Everyone looks to be having a good time, but it's pasted-together frivolity. Director Michael Hoffman's handling is too coy, with many movie-star close-up smiles which continually rob the picture of freshness. This work was previously filmed in 1935, 1966 and 1968.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is inevitable that a Shakespeare movie will be slow-moving and become boring at times, even more so if you're not into his writings in the first place. I thought this was a decent story though extremely weird at times (keep in mind Sir William was a very twisted individual to begin with). This newer film adaption was a fair effort to modernize it though I didn't really understand why they changed the location at all. And why was adding bicycles so important??? They only used them during the forest scenes but who rides bikes in the woods? Puck did move it to shine the light on someone he was talking about during a small speech but other than that they shared no real significance that I can find. I did however adore the cast and thought they were superb. I forgot Christian Bale was in it, I still can't help but keep relating him to his Patrick Bateman character but I'm sure he gets that a lot. The ladies were really pretty and I'd be proud to date any one of them...well except Calista Flockhart as she's too annoying and anorexic. A perfectly average movie and good for a viewing or two.Final Potion:Movies: No, not really.DVD Purchase: Couldn't see myself watching it enough to make it a worthwhile investment.Rental: Quite possibly more than once!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the years worst movies. Zero Stars out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, Blake French, never walk out of movies. Never because the movie is offensive, not because the movie is repulsive, not because the movie is bad; I strongly believe that no matter how poorly a movie begins, becomes, or concludes, it always deserves the benefit of a doubt that it might just get better. "William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream" is an exception to that rule. I waited with eager anticipation for the film to get better, but the long I waited, the worse it became. I walked out in the films last half hour, only to walk back in ten minutes later due to guilt and hope that the filmmakers were saving the greatness for the grand finale. I was once again incorrect. This is one of the years worst films."William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Nights Dream" is not a movie in my opinion. For it destroys all rules, all regulations, all concepts and morals of movies themselves. It does not have a single positive element beyond the splendid atmosphere, which I give no credit for. Shakespeare would have been appalled. What story I could follow takes place in an enchanted forest where a variety of mismatched characters fall in love with each other due to a magic love spell that individuals with little horns on their head deliver to the sleeping the victims. One couple includes a man turning into a donkey and a woman who looks like the fairy godmother from "Cinderella." Another has a man who doesn't love a girl, but on the other hand does.I tried to explain the plot to you to the best of my ability, but in reality, nearly each and every individual scene in "William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream" has its very own problem, and conclusion in itself, thus a mini plot constantly evolving. Exactly how do the filmmakers expect an audience to pursue this.The film goes on and on. Although it only runs 116 minutes, it seems like a week. If ever a movie needed an editing job more than this allow it to be crowned king of badness. The characters are developed with bland words and little action. The dialogue itself is as hard to understand as languages are. As I watched the film, I pondered to myself about the reason they didn't have English subtitles at the screen's bottom; for this Shakespearean language is incurably confusing.Included in the movie are wasted the talents Kevin Kline, TV's Calista Flockhart, Michelle Pfeiffer, Stanley Tucci of "The Impostors," Rupert Everett, Sophie Marceau ("Lost and Found"), Christian Bale, Anna Friel and Dominic West. These actors and actresses are potentially able to save a movie with their performances, but "A Midsummer Nights Dream" provides them with no personalities or interests. The cast should not be blamed for the film's failure, however. For they tried their hardest to indulge into their characters, and succeeded. I am sure glade the filmmakers found these characters interesting.So, after all that I have explained and tired to convince you not to see this movie, are you going to take the trip to the theater to see it? To my unpleasant surprise, the film opened to some positive reviews, which I have a hard time explaining why most critics are finding "A Midsummer Nights Dream" to their liking and I very much did not. However, I have quite a fun time making fun of audiences that do indeed waste their time with the movie who fault for the film's box office success as I chant to myself for every dollar it profits: "What fools must these mortals be, to even desire seeing this movie."</fullReview>

I was unlucky enough to catch a preview screening of it with several other people, about half of whom walked out after the first 45 minutes. The directing is amateurish, the sets fake, the acting WAY over-the-top (Calista Flockhart sets an all-time record for bad melodrama), and the interpretation of the story from a Shakespearean literary perspective is downright laughable. Can we PLEASE have something a little hipper, a little more intelligent, than this recycled old interpretation? (And what's the deal with all the bicycles? What does that have to do with anything?)

		<shortDescription>A Midsummer Nightmare?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Hoffman's film adaptation of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" was an ineffective adaptation which lacked the passion of the 1594 Shakespearean play by casting a variety of characters that did not portray or parallel the original roles; the costume and set design failed to engage the audience and the art direction was overly extravagant and unnecessary.In Shakespeare's original play the setting of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" takes place an orderly and prestigious Athens, Greece. In Hoffman's poor attempt at originality, he creates a fictional world that lacks substance and reality. The original Athens which was masterfully preserved by Shakespeare is undermined by a disgusting and incoherent disaster that belittles the concept of the serious atmosphere conveyed by Athens within the play. The setting appears Italian, which then turns the fraudulently English speaking actors into anachronisms. Due to Hoffman's choice of setting the introductory scenes of the play version appear insignificant and irrelevant. Theseus is portrayed as a wealthy knit-wit who rules on a whim and Hermia then becomes a promiscuous, rebellious teenager gallivanting around with Lysander. The image of Athens that was developed trough Shakespeare's play conveyed an image of power and strong rule; Hoffman undermines the play with his "stab at" creativity in setting, with an inaccurate modern twist.The cast of actors appears to be better known for their names than their acting, With famous names such as: Rupert Everett, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christian Bale, and Calista Flockheart a certain pretentious expectation is made in a preconceived notion, sadly what is preconceived fails miserably to deliver. On a superficial level the film as a whole appears decent because it's masked by well-known names, however their performances lack depth and true understanding of Shakespearean prose. The message of unrequited love that underlay the romance between Helena and Demetrius is lost with in a self deprecating and loathsome Calista Flockheart who plays Helena. Flockheart's performance makes it absolutely apparent why Christian Bale(Demetrius) does not reciprocate any emotions toward her. The Ingenuity of Helena's character is faltered by Flockheart's poor acting skills and inability to express emotionally what Shakespeare conveyed in writing. The mysticism of Titania's character was lost within the massive size of Pfeiffer's hair and her 1980's Barbie doll attire. The few actors that were able and capable of reciting Shakespearean prose were tight cast and "back seated" by the Hollywood all stars.The costume and art direction were tacky and took away from the overall atmosphere that should have been amalgamated with in the film. The argument between Helena and Hermia that created a more concise meaning of the characters within the play was turned into a tasteless mud wrestling scene. The crude scene was not only tasteless but also misogynistic and a cheap attempt to engage the perverted male counterparts within the audience at the expense of the objectification of women. The scenes within the woods appeared unrealistic with the well done architecture and the lacking vegetation, once again belittling another aspect of the original play. The film's set design disparaged the overall primitive mysticism of the woods. The fairy kingdom as a whole was portrayed less like a kingdom and more like a brothel. With Hoffman's occasional "American Humor", scenes such as the dialogue between Titania and Bottom were destroyed by tactless and crass implications such as the implied erection of Bottom.Michael Hoffman's film adaptation is a disgraceful attempt at draining a masterpiece of any meaning it could have potentially conveyed. With Dreadful art direction, poor acting skills, and tasteless costume design Shakespeare would have surely writhed in his grave.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That is what the movie sounded like to me. There should have been sub-titles to this film because those of us that lost interest in Shakespeare in the tenth grade would at least understand what they were mumbling about. And here's a suggestion/point. As much as I didn't like Shakespeare In Love, I enjoyed in ten fold compared to this pie of garbage. And the reason for that is because it was in ENGLISH! They may have been characters from good ole Will himself, but at least they spoke so we could understand them. When you make a certain type of movie because it is the "in" thing to do, then try to make sure you emulate what made the previous films a success. If you take Shakespeare In Love and 10 Things I Hate About You, they were based on Shakespeare stuff, but they were updated so that any audience could enjoy them. Midnight Summers Dream talks and I can't listen. I can't understand thus I hate it and I walk out. Plus, the humour is so stupid in this film. Are we supposed to laugh at childish antics like Kevin Kline having stuff spilled on him? Isn't this humour that would entertain a three year old? Is that what Hollywood has done? Treat us like three year olds?Movie execs, " Let's make another Shakespeare film, the last worked."Other exec, " Good idea old chap. What shall we do? "Movie exec, " Who cares, they'll eat anything up that we put out for them. After all one successful film means that every film like that one will be a success."Exec one and Exec two, " Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. AAAAH hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. "Then when it fails at the box office they wonder what went wrong with their strategy. After all SIL won best picture this year. My answer, " This movie sucks, that's why it failed. Because a casual fan of movies ( key word here ) does not necessarily enjoy Shakespeare. So change the damn thing and maybe we'll seeit. Let the Stratford productions in Stratford Ontario and England deal with the honest interpretations of the damn thing. But for the rest of us, how about entertaining?**** I wonder how many people on the IMDb that gave this film a positive review are true Shakespeare fans. My bet would be most or all of them. And for the rest of us that aren't, there is almost no way that we can enjoy this stuff.I hated this movie. Hated. Hated. Hated.Hated!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of time, DON'T BOTHER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was horrible. I am reading the play in my English class, and the movie is FULL of mistakes. First of all, if they are going to change the era and setting of the movie, at least do it right! I thought that they were supposed to be in Athens, but they had English accents and they played opera! The bikes just confused me more!People in those times didn't ride bikes with lights. Don't bother with this movie. It's corny and a waste of time. There are way better ways to spend your time. The movie was really badly cast, I thought that Puck should have been younger, since i associate a mischievous attitude with being younger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Midsummer Night's Bore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"William Shakespeare's" A Midsummer Night's Dream??? Like what other Midsummer Night's Dream is there??? Duh! Obviously made to capitalize on Kenneth Brannagh's "Much Ado" this "Dream" is more of a "Snooze". It looks beautiful but it's as dull as dishwater. The American actors - who were obviously drafted in to get the film financed - were, for the most part, dire. Anna Friel looked fabulous but then she moved and, worse, opened her mouth, shattering any pretense of the upper-class character she was meant to be portraying. And Rupert Everett's one-note performance was mind-numbing.As for Kevin Kline? Shakespeare wrote the part of Bottom for a comedian who featured in his plays - not a comic actor. Kline is not broad enough, lumpy enough, or funny enough to play Bottom. A case of terrible casting. Truly terrible. Once again we have a case of financial considerations triumphing over all. Still it could have been worse, I suppose; It could have been Jim Carey!I ended up fast-forwarding through most of this. A "Dream"? Hardly! More like a Midsummer's Cup of Cocoa And An Early Night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>impossible to understand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high expectations of this movie before I watched it. The cast was totally glittering, with so many famous stars in one movie! When i watched it, I was disappointed. First the actors tried to speak a British accent but failed badly. Also the mannerisms were modern American mannerisms, not 18-19th century mannerisms. I could not imagine a 18-19th century gentleman would point a finger at someone and laugh out loud.Then, the movie itself was impossible to understand. It was partially because of the old English, and partially because of the complicated plot. There were so many people in the woods that I completely lost track.The only thing I was impressed by the movie was the colourful images in every scene. That's the only thing that kept me watching the film.</fullReview>
