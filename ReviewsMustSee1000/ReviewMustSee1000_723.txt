		<shortDescription>Bias is downfall of this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would not consider myself to be an ultra liberal, but I am somewhat knowledgeable about what has been going on in South America for the last 100 years, and Che Guevara is a part of it. Going into this movie all I knew about him was that he is on a lot of t-shirts, and that "che", despite what ignorant people think, is not his name, it is what Argentinians say to each other like in the US saying "dude".I am also a big fan of the purity of movies, not this Spider-man crap that is all over the place, but the true art of films, and I am fairly serious when I go into a movie for the first time. A part of this is that I watch the movie throwing all bias I might have out the window and watch it as if I had never heard of it before. That said, I believe this movie was excellent because it had superb cinematography of the beauty of South America, had excellent acting, great chemistry between the two main actors (despite Ebert saying they did not), and an overall political theme.This movie did not get great reviews in the US, and I haven't seen reviews from Latin American countries, but I am guessing they are better. This is because many people either shied away from the movie once they heard the word Che, and if they did see it, through the whole movie they were probably thinking "commie, commie!".I have since read up on Che Guevara, and he is actually a fascinating person to study because he began as a rich boy who through his journeys learned how much people were suffering beyond his imagination, and part of this was how he got to be so rich, by suppressing the native people. The movie does an excellent job of showing this transition from his carefree exploring until later having an epiphany about his destiny to help the people. Yes, he got extreme after a while, but the study of him is compelling nonetheless.It is interesting to know that coffee and bananas that say "Guatemala" are still grown today by slave laborers on farms, and that the US does not mind the slave labor because they were the ones who sponsored a coup in 1951 to install a dictatorship that in history books says it was an ousting of communism, which makes it okay. This is a much bigger and important example than the movie, but it is the same bias involved: People in the United States (I don't say America because that refers to every country from Argentina to Canada, not just the US as people in this country like to think) not only don't care about the suffering of people in other countries (unless it's mentioned on Oprah or involves economic rewards) but have the nerve to call them evil when they try to better themselves, which at the time was the communist movement in South America. This is not the communism of Castro or even of the later Che Guevara, but simply to give more to the starving and suppressed that are today suppressed to make your bananas and Starbucks coffee.Because of the biases people have towards the people of countries they know nothing about, this movie has been extremely underrated in the wake of films that comparatively suck ("Ray", way overrated) yet have been rewarded because of their popularity and appeasement to the ignorant people that attend theaters in the United States.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting, direction and story - Oscar worthy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is based on the true story that took Ernesto Guevara (Gael Garcia Bernal) and Alberto Granado (Rodrigo de la Serna) on a road trip all across and along South America in the 1950's. The script/direction elegantly avoids any politics or similar. Its focus is on the human transformation of two young Argentine professionals, a turning point in their lives, who decide to see their continent with their own eyes. This movie only covers Che Guevara's life BEFORE he became the famous Che Guevara. Most of us would agree with Che's goals but less, I guess, would agree with his means. However, the movie concentrates on how the world changed Ernesto which in turn led him to try to change the world. The movie ends at the end of their road trip. I understand that there is another movie in the making (with Benicio del Toro) which will show the rest of Che' s life, with politics and flying bullets included. The acting of the movie is first class: Gael Garcia Bernal performs at his best; however it is Rodrigo de la Serna's performance the one that is simply outstanding; not only he represents Granado's as a funny, outgoing character, but he also highlights Gael's characterization of Guevara. Great photography, humor, action, and drama are all ingredients of this movie. If you want to watch a movie that deals with reality and that contrasts with Hollywood's fantasies, this is your movie. You'll laugh, may be cry, but for sure you'll leave the theater thinking about a few things. Finally, this movie ironically represents Che's ultimate goal, a unified continent: the director is Brazilian, the main actor Mexican, the main actress and supporting actor Argentinean, the script writer is from Puerto Rico and the producer, Robert Redford is American. And, the movie was filmed in Argentina, Chile and Peru. Length: 2hs 04 min.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sorely needed window on South America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Motorcycle Diaries does a great job of sketching out the character of Ernesto Guevara de la Serna, without any pandering to our knowledge of who he will become. There are no cheap shots and only one 'Che' joke-to explain the origin of the nickname, which is a play on the Argentinian accent. It's a deeply felt examination of the events that inspired the development of a political consciousness, with only a few touches of the hagiography that has developed around 'el Che' and those not until late in the film. Gael Garcia Bernal is completely believable and very human in the role, and there's real chemistry between him and Rodrigo de la Serna (any relation?) who plays his friend Granado, leading to a lot of funny moments-important, as ther are many stretches of the movie where it is just them and the scenery. The cinematography is truly gorgeous, and reminded me how little of the South American landscape we ever see on film in the U.S. The cinematographer has pulled off a major feat in shooting a period film in slightly grainy, sometimes shaky hand-held. No crane shots or sepia tinting here-the film quality immerses you in Guevara and Granado's experiences and makes them feel very immediate, without sacrificing any sense of history. A film like this is long overdue, and it deserves wide distribution. While the plot revolves around Che's awakening to the social struggles of South America (which are ongoing) there is a rich sense of place, and people, and beauty here. It seems to me that this is the first South American film in a few years that is not a world-weary documentary about social or political problems (and U.S. involvement in them), to open in the U.S. market. It's about the life of Che, yes, but it doesn't forget the people and problems that lead him into political activity, and will hopefully inspire viewers to pay more attention to what is going on around them, not only in Buenos Aires, Cuzco, Havana or Chiapas, but right next door.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humanism, Awareness, Coming of Age: The Soul of Revolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES is certainly one of the finest films of the year - a daring, compassionate re-creation of the journey of two young, well-to-do Argentinean lads who leave their privileged positions of biochemist and fourth year Medical student to follow their idea of traveling by motorcycle from their native Buenos Aires down to Patagonia, up through Chile, Peru, Colombia to Venezuela. Sounds like a light hearted Trip Movie, but instead this journey, factually made by one Ernesto (aka 'Che' and 'Fuser') Guevara de la Serna and his close friend Alberto Granado ('Chubby'), is one of the most touching and sensitive passages into self acceptance and awareness of the world as a place where equality of people is a microscopic speck of illusion that is revealed by a carefully constructed script by Jose Rivera based on the diaries of both of these men made during and after their journey. Walter Salles ("Behind the Sun", "Central Station") once again proves himself a director who can infuse his vision of a story with uncomplicated directness of approach, having the sensitivity to allow his well-chosen actors to create wholly believable, three-dimensional characters, whether the actors are the leads or simply minor roles that hold the camera's eye for seconds.Taken as simply a movie to enjoy, THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES is as beautiful as a National Geographic Magazine feature on the Amazon and the deserted and populated lands of South America. But given his re-creation of Che Guevara's and Alberto Granado's meaningful excursion into manhood this movie goes far beyond entertainment and enters that rarefied arena of psycho biography. Traveling on an old motorcycle, the two lads encounter hunger, accidents, lusting after women at every stop, ingratiating panhandling, and the gradual revelation of the quality of life of the indigenous peoples of South America. They are touched by the plights of the people, the people in turn love the boys, and they eventually spend three weeks living and working in a leprosarium run by the nuns, adding their knowledge of medicine to helping not only the physical needs of the lepers but finding ways to break the psychosocial ostracism that historically curses the 'unclean'. Breaking down these barriers, forming strong relationships with those tending the lepers as well as the lepers themselves, lays the seeds of 'revolution' or Change in the minds of the lads, especially Ernesto or 'Che'. The film does not begin to preach or to make the Che Guevara of Cuban militancy fame a hero: it doesn't have to, as the transformation in the mind of Che is so beautifully subtle. The journey has given him the insight that he must devote himself to changing the inequality and poverty of his America. The events that followed this Motorcycle journey are provided in voice over, black and white footage of people's faces, and a final scene in Havana at the ending of the film. No more need be said.Gael Garcia Bernal gives an incredibly thoughtful, stunning portrayal of Che, saying so much more with his eyes, his body language (especially as he suffers through his own physical demon of asthma attacks), and his perfect embodiment of the spirit of a man who becomes enlightened by the peasants he comes to love. Bernal is already a brilliant actor and a magnetic screen presence, and if he is not nominated for an Oscar for this unique, artful role it will be a major surprise. His is a career to watch! Likewise Rodrigo de la Serna is completely immersed in his role as Alberto and shows the same quality of quiet growth as a character as the movie progresses. ALL of the many extras in this huge cast are memorable: the leper colony abounds with some of the most touching human beings ever captured on film. The camera work, the musical scoring, the obvious commitment on the part of everyone involved in this glorious picture - every aspect of THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES is exactly right. Ten Stars for this one! In Spanish with English subtitles</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>REVALATORY A REVOLUCIONARY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES (2004) ***1/2 Gael Garcia Bernal,Rodrigo De la Serna, Mia Maestro. (Dir: Walter Salles)Che Guevera is sadly best known today as a mysterious icon for a pop culture ironic t-shirt sported by the supposedly hip and political. Few, including this reviewer, really knew much more about the firebrand revolutionist who was a comrade in Cuban arms with Fidel Castro in a crusade that led to his eventual capture and execution by the CIA as a notorious fly-in-the-ointment career criminal.However new insight ? albeit a few shades of grey and free styling dramatic license intact ? depicts a twenty something medical student named Ernesto Guevera da la Serna, a South American native (memorably portrayed by the ever soulful Bernal, in a truly outstanding breakthrough performance) who partners with his best friend Alberto Granado (strongly supportive De la Serna) on a trek by motorcycle (a battered 1939 Norton to be exact) an 800 plus mile quest from Argentina up thru the upper regions of Peru with nothing but a few provisions and even less dinero.Relying on their bonhomie, make-shift surroundings and clever improvisation the odd couple manage to get to Ernesto's girlfriend's nouveau riche family where he tells the lovely Chichina Ferreyra (the fetching Maestro) that he wants her to wait for him but knows in his heart this is more than likely never to be.After several humorous encounters along the fray the duo finally have to give up their trusty vehicle after many hardships and torrential weather obstacles to go on foot then finally on ferry to their destination: an internship with a leper colony. Along the way the duo meet many disenfranchised and impoverished fellow countrymen and their women and families and with each soul-crushing pit-stop you can feel the stirrings of ire catching fire within the young man who will become Che Guevera.Salles, who directed the exceptional CENTRAL STATION, smartly allows his two fine actors plenty of room to get into the skins of their funny, fighting and deep souled characters while enlisting the picturesque surroundings of the lush and jaw-droppingly beautiful playas, mountains and countryside (exquisitely rendered by ace cinematographer Eric Gautier) and underlies the proceedings with a hauntingly stirring score by Gustavo Santaolalla. But it is Bernal who is most powerful in his implosive, soulful and heartfelt turn as the young impassioned man just about to break for greatness; the same can be said of this talented actor's star bursting career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film, Deserves Award</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Motorcycle Diaries is a tale of Che's life prior to becoming a revolutionary political figure. We follow Che and his friend on a cross-country road trip, a journey into the unknown. The film was beautifully filmed. It really makes you want to travel and go to see some of the South/Central American countries. The acting was superb. Gael Garcia Bernal is not new to the screen. He has delivered amazing performances in both Amores Perros and Y Tu Mama Tambien. He does not disappoint in this movie. Newcomer, Rodrigo De La Serna, also gives an excellent performance.Regardless of your politics and personal views of Che, you will walk away from this movie feeling a bit better about humanity. I'm hoping this pulls Best Foreign Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Politically Thoughtful and Pretty Grand Tour of South America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Motorcycle Diaries" (Diarios de motocicleta) works more effectively as a bio-pic than on its own as a road movie. The scenery throughout Latin America is beautiful and the two leads are very affecting, especially Gael Garc眼 Bernal as Ernesto Guevara de la Serna when "Che" is still nascent. But it's surprising how undramatic what happens that turns a sweet, middle-class med student into a revolutionary. He was already a liberal who wanted to help leprosy patients, so what happens isn't a complete turn-around -- even when they are broke, they can wire home for more money. Rather it sets off an internal thoughtfulness that is difficult to catch on film. Mostly just leaving his sheltered life, particularly being dropped by his wealthy girlfriend, and seeing the continent, especially his first exposure to the indigenous peoples who suffer the most in every South American country even while tourists are visiting the ruins of their ancestors, becomes the nexus of his pan-continental political ideals.He is mostly an observer and inconsistent protester of injustice, not a victim -- it's startling that his culminating noble sojourn at the leper colony, where he can put his skills and indivisible warmth to specific good, is only for three weeks. So there's no eye-opening "Grapes of Wrath" conflict, though he is always contrasted with his carefree companion, Alberto Granado. Their close camaraderie is well-captured and Ernesto has a profound impact on him, as we learn in a final biographical summary. It is amusing that Ernesto contradicts the stereotype of the Latin male sensualist and is a terrible dancer to the lovely soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A personal journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why a film about Che now? Why suddenly a revival of a revolutionary hero?Apathy, political blandness and complacency are the characteristics of today's world when compare with the 60's generation, and any left revolutionary dogma seems, for many reasons, to have been put at rest for the time being and until further notice. The relevance of this film today has many different facets and its success is particularly interesting at a moment of change, when wars, political and economical crisis and their global effects, are starting to provoke some reaction suggesting that involvement might just be around the corner. Wisely the film concentrates on following Guevara diaries before becoming radicalised and in the process of gaining knowledge and awareness of the struggle of the Latin American unprivileged classes and prior to breaking up with his middle class ties. The film has had many viewers that have criticized the lack of a stronger political definition in the portrait of the lead character, a more radical view of Guevara and of its political stand even at that early stage in his life. The film makes his image more digestible for a general audience, showing him in a sympathetic light and from a softer perspective. In my view this is exactly what it makes it relevant and interesting for today's audiences. Although the film grows in the memory as being a touch more political than what perhaps Walter Salles aimed for, it doesn't intend to preach politics or even try to be a full-blown biopic of an historical and controversial figure. What makes the message strong is the fact that we actually know who the character eventually will become after the story of the film finishes and the end titles start to run, that makes it rather more poignant. We only witness the beginning of his personal journey and know how much he will travel. The film is more about personal choices, experiences and decisions that eventually might change the course of a life, and particularly about the spirit of being young. The film recreates the freedom of adolescence, a time for absorbing and experimenting, the start of a trek where we discover the world and where justice and a hope for change is strongly embedded with the attitude of the young. Or at least that happen in the 60's generally and particularly in Latin America. The real quality of the film is that through a subtle, engaging, fun tale allows the audience to connect with a period where change, personal and internal, was possible, and where there was hope for a fairer future.For anyone like myself from Argentina, part of a generation that were there and young at the time, the film evokes just that starting point. It is a rather emotional journey that takes back a whole generation that had firm beliefs in these ideals, as relevant today as they were in 1952 where the action of the film ends and Guevara flights back home shaken by the whole travel experience. It is rather significant that not that much has changed for the better in the Latin America of today, where the gap between the 'haves' and the 'have nots' has, if anything, grown wider. The film is simple and straightforward showing the real talent of Walter Salles for avoiding patronising his audience as he conveys an accurate portrait of the landscape and its people. There is perhaps some excessive 'under acting' on the approach from Gael Garcia Bernal to his performance [ ...was Che really ever such a "softie"?] but still, it is great to see him growing as an actor and as Che through the film. To counter balanced such a restrained interpretation, Rodrigo de la Serna projects the right dosage of charm and Argentinean street wisdom that gives the warmth and humanity the film exudes. The music of Gustavo Santaolaya adds a layer of depth and intensity whilst rightly avoiding, like the rest of the film, most of the traditional clich乶 of the South American image.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From director Walter Salles comes a very moving road journey which had me completely spellbound by the end and I'm sure would gain many viewer's hearts as the infamous director dives deep into many different issues. The story centres around two young doctors going on a motorbike journey around the world, not for personal gain but for the experience. This idea was completely outstanding. It gives the audience an understanding of young people's desires, not for personal gains such as money but for an experience into real life issues and wishing to know more about the world around them. These ideas I'm sure would make viewers aspire to be like the central characters to go out and explore the world and that was a reason why I personally loved this drama, because it gives inspiration to the audience and really moves them in a way which will leave you completely spellbound. The film centres on many issues but one which stuck out for me was the heavy ideologies of health. In the year 1950 there were many health issues present in the poorer counties such as Peru and this Oscar winning drama is able to capture these issues magnificently. The two central protagonists are doctors and are wishing to help others with their knowledge and expertise as they explore the less fortunate countries to help with the many depressing health problems the countries are experiencing. There is a very highly emotional driven scene when the lead character tries to help a very ill woman who is refusing to be treated. Tensions are always running high in the latter stages of the film when many issues are wishing to be resolved and the central protagonists are putting themselves on the line to help the ill residents of the poor countries. Having changes in situations was a very powerful technique. The characters experience a poor life and a rich life. Audiences will see different perspectives of life in the 1950s when seeing there are poor and rich countries and are divided by the smallest differences, such as illnesses. We also see more joyous moments and highly emotional driven scenes which also gives a sense of how life is, the good and bad sides are both expressed in equal amounts which in my opinion was a fantastic move and will capture your heart as it did mineCentred on the 1950s the film captured the essence of the politically driven time beautifully. Audiences see job issues, money problems and country matters which all juxtapose perfectly to capture the essence of the time and crate a high realism in context of the timeThe acting by everyone involved is absolutely outstanding and it confused me when not one received an Oscar nomination because Gael Garcia Bernal and Rodrigo De la Serna are remarkable as the two travellers. Both dealing with their own issues we see different types of characters but similar characteristics to which made the film more believable of society where opinions are divided but also shared. Bernal plays a character who is always saying what he feels and is never wishing to back down from anyone or anything and he pulled it off tremendously. The passion he creates as the central protagonist Guevara is utterly astonishing as he deals with asthma problems, love lives and money issues. It's a lot for him to take as he realises how serious life can be. Serna to also pulls off a classic performance as the older more experienced of the two who is always looking for that little bit more than his fellow traveller. Using different countries such as Peru, Venezuela, and Spain allows viewers to gain an insight into the vastness of life. Using poor countries as well as rich countries allows viewers to see different sides to the world in the 1950s and was pulled off greatly. The characters can therefore experience what a posh life is like as well as what life in the fast lane gives them. The camera work is astonishing. Shooting from Venezuela, Peru etc we see different perspective of the countries. The scenery is always beautiful with shots of the towns in a poor state and the general background of the countries is to be admired. The shots of the bike on the roads are to be admired. The camera moves adjacent to the bike giving the realistic effect of the bike moving fast along the empty roads, gaining a sense of freedom and enjoyment. From watching this film I can say I have been inspired to get on a motorbike and explore the world. Seeing what the central protagonists saw will inspire many as it has inspired me and I have no hesitation in recommending this Oscar winning drama to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a quiet, unassuming, sometimes deeply moving look at a young man, who just happens to be Che Guevara</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got home from seeing this movie. I'd have to say first of all that reading some of the negative comments about this film being "clean" or "boring" or "childish" astounded me.The plot has been summarized numerous comments before, so I'll just move on to my comments.If clean is hearing the word "motherf*cker" every 20 or so words, seeing a 30 year old man trying to get into numerous girls pants, or listening to young men talk about a woman's anatomy, then this movie's clean.It is not clean. The images aren't clean looking either, but rather I'd say they're realistically unclean. Many things happen to the men which make them dirty first of all. The terrain is rustic, and harsh, and takes a toll on people in the movie. The people look hard, and filthy, and well, unclean.If childish is a conscientious young man trying to make a positive difference in a world lacking fairness, writing emotionally stirring but also thoughtful, compassionate, and amazingly wise words, and lovingly wanting to close the gap between the haves and the have nots, then this movie is childish.No, this movie's not childish. I was in fact deeply moved to tears seeing such a man as Che. These days, young men seem to want to be players. They work out, and make themself beautiful by going to tanning salons. They want to sleep with a lot of women and tell their player friends about it. Gone are the days when you see a young man who doesn't care about that, those things which are so unimportant. Che in this movie has heart, integrity, and ultimately, something players lack, individuality. This is why he became the revolutionary that he did, and you see it at the end of the film. His player friend sees it too. He dared to care so deeply that at times, it was painful to watch in the film. It changed people. It challenged the rules. It was inspiring to see the way he affected people with his quiet, genuine demeanor.But and this is where the movie is so subtle that I bet many people missed it, it doesn't judge Che. It doesn't preach to us about who he was. It doesn't even tell us what Che found so inspiring in this journey that made him want to change things. The director and/or writer leaves that up to the viewer. The movie could've been about a couple friends on a journey, just as the quote at the beginning of the movie and the end of the movie says. That's beautiful, so generously unassuming, so gracious.I don't know the history of Che Guevara. This movie made me want to find out more though. Still, I'm amazed at the similarities between Che and Christ now that I think about it. Che seems, in many ways, a Christlike figure to South Americans. That could start an entirely different tangent, of which I'll not expound.With that, the end of Indiana Jones "The Last Crusade" comes to mind. Indy's got to decide which cup is the Holy Grail. Most Hollywood movies are the first cup that is chosen. And while this one may not be the Holy Grail, it's inspiring of things Christlike, humility, tenderness, generosity, intelligence, and forgiveness. Why? Because these things are important, they inspire people, and change the world.Che Guevara. Martin Luther King, Jr. Ghandi. (the list goes on)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, that was one excellent flick. It's about Ernesto "Che" Guevara and his best friend, Alberto Granado as they go on a 10,000 kilometer motorcycle trip all across Sudamerica. As they depart their homebase in Argentina, they're just two boys, Ernesto nearly finished with medical school and Alberto a newly-minted biochemist, wanting to see the world and get laid as much as they can before they get old and tied down. But after passing through heights and valleys, mountains and deserts, they emerge as men.If you're looking for a communist propaganda film, this isn't it. The story of Ernesto's self- actualization, however, does resonate with many similar mythical/religious figures. It's almost Buddhist as you watch him leave the stately boulevards of Buenos Aires and come in contact with the vast ethnic diversity of Latin America and share stories with a thirsty couple whose only option is to toil in a mine in the Atacama Desert after being evicted off their grandfather's farm for being communists, indigenous Incan descendants who are left with little money or livelihood, and Peruvian farmers who organize to save their land from the Lima bureaucrats.After witnessing these hardships forced upon the common people, he reaches his final destination, the Brazilian San Pedro leper colony. The Amazon splits this colony into two, with the doctors and nurses living on the north bank and the lepers on the south bank. There, the Che/Buddha figure, on the eve of his 24th birthday, proclaims his wish for the unification of all indigenous peoples to the stunned nuns and then swims across the Amazon to the leper side. As the doctors and nuns call him to come back to their side, he nearly drowns from the self-baptism but reaches the cheering leper crowd. Ernesto, as Christ resurrected, declares he has "a lot of thinking to do," and, as the epilogue reads, within ten years becomes el commandante of Cuba. The CIA then assassinates him in the Bolivian jungle. It's rather surprising that Che, with his prodigal journey, never quite became the leader of a new religion, but one could argue that his iconic stature affords him the same respect from his followers (particularly since socialism/communism frowns on religion) as Christ receives from his believers. Alberto goes on to found the Santiago School of Medicine and and his eternally loyal friend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Youth will have its fling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SpoilersThe movie is about Ernesto the middle-class budding young doctor on a "youth will have its fling" tour, rather than about "Che" the revolutionist that he became later in his life. Although the tour indeed has a lot to do in determining the future course of Ernesto's life, we must not let that fore-knowledge distort our vision of the movie.'Motorcycle Diaries' is exactly what it says it is, the diaries of an eight-month adventure of two young men, although to be exact, the latter part of the journey was actually on foot, after their beloved motorcycle's well-earned 'retirement.' What we the audience proceed to discover, after sharing with them their joys and woes on the trip, is the profound effect it has on their future. While starting out in Argentina, the goodbye scene with Ernesto's family would be no different from what you might see anywhere in the US, when a middle-class family says farewell to their fresh college grad embarking on a, say, hiking trip in Europe before starting his career. We would also tend to give credit to the parents for not giving Ernesto too much hell for not having finished his medical degree first.With crisp, fast paced shots, director Walter Salles (Central Station) takes us through the early part of the carefree adventure, through breathtaking South American landscapes. We see how the buddies experience, probably for the first time in their lives, sporadic spells of poverty, until receiving the next installment of funds remitted to them. In the process, we also get some insight into the markedly different characters of the two amigos. Alberto is extrovert, charismatic and could sometimes get a little unscrupulous in order to get what he wants. Ernesto is shy, attentive, and unflinchingly honest. Like the best of friends, they often do not see eye to eye in things, though friendship always prevails. I, for one, find myself empathizing a little more with Alberto, because of the innate rascal in me.The frivolous mood starts to change after the demise of the Norton 500. The dogged determination of Ernesto starts to emerge as he takes the lead in forging ahead on foot, while Alberto also shows signs of maturing. At this point, you can't help but remember the allusion to the Quixotic aspect of the journey in the beginning of the film and subconsciously recall the lyrics of 'The impossible dream'. After witnessing poverty and injustice, along with endurance and perseverance, through various parts of their beloved continent, Ernesto Guevara and Alberto Granado finally reach the last part of the journey that will change their lives forever. The story of their three weeks' service in a leper colony deep in the Peruvian Amazon is told with simple honesty by director Salles, touching directly your heart without unnecessary harassment of your emotions.Director Salles' process of making the film includes meeting with Alberto (at 80) and Ernesto's family (widow and three sons), as well as tracing the journey extensively through Argentina, Chile and Peru. Blended with the structured screenplay are improvised material of the actors mingling with the local people as Alberto and Ernesto would have done fifty years ago. In Salles' own words, Motorcycle Diaries is, among other things, a 'coming of age' movie, and a journey that would define 'on both an emotional and a political level' who these two young men would become.I'm not going to say how marvelous Gael Garc眼 Bernal and Rodrigo De la Serna are as Ernesto and Alberto respectively. While they deserve all the praises being heaped upon them, what they deserve even more is to be seen by people who are skeptical about these praises.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie That Deserved Many Nominations to the Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just watched this wonderful movie, and I really believe that it deserved the nominations of best picture, best lead actor, best support actor, best cinematography and best soundtrack. The story of the romantic process of consciousness of Ernesto "Che" Guevara de la Serna of the situation of Latin America, ruled by injustice and exploration by the great nations, through a road trip with his best friend Alberto Granado, is spectacular. There are right doses of action, comedy and drama in this movie, supported by an outstanding direction, two magnificent actors, wonderful landscapes and a stunning music score. The ridiculous decision of the academy of using Antonio Banderas as a singer in the ceremony of the Oscar was outrageous. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Di痙ios de Motocicleta" ("Motorcycle Diaries")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>En Route To Destiny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely does a film convey such great thematic depth as in "The Motorcycle Diaries", a true-life story about two twenty-something, idealistic guys from Buenos Aires who, in 1952, embark on a 5,000 mile trip through five South American countries, "to explore a continent (they) had only known in books".Alberto (Rodrigo De la Serna), a biochemist, is jovial, rascally, fudges the truth a bit, and talks too much. Ernesto (Gael Garcia Bernal), known as "Fuser", is honest, suffers from asthma, and is a bit shy; Ernesto is a medical student. Both are clever, daring, and resourceful.Their journey, partly on a creaky, 1939 Norton 500 motorcycle, starts out lighthearted and fun, but turns serious and somber, as their funds run out and as they experience the grinding poverty of local peasants, miners, and farmers. Yet, they constantly are greeted with kindness from strangers, however humble, and their perspective shifts to a deeper understanding of the pain and suffering of others.Enhancing realism, the film sports dialogue in Spanish with English subtitles and ambient sounds sans music in many scenes. When music is present, it communicates a restless, galloping quality at the beginning, then quiets to stoic minimalism in the second half.Scenery ranges from quaint to truly spectacular. Color cinematography is acceptable. Yet, given the historical setting and the story's fatalistic quality, I could have wished for B&amp;W to soften the tone, consistent with the haunting B&amp;W images and still photos at the film's end.Sometimes a physical journey can foster an emotional journey of discovery about oneself and others, which in turn alters the trajectory of one's life, as it does here for Ernesto. We can only speculate how his life might have evolved had he not taken that motorcycle trip.But history cannot be changed. And Ernesto's travels, as documented here, seem all the more haunting as a prelude to destiny.</fullReview>

From every point of view this movie is very good: actors are great, location are *wonderful* (I want to go to Cile!!!:)) and the shots ("riprese" in italian) are very original and help to completely involve yourself in that spectacular world. I have very appreciated interpretations of the two protagonist that have alternated moments full of pathos with nice moment of relax. Maybe the real protagonist of the film is all the America Latina and especially the inhabitants. All the appearances ("comparse" in italian) have rules of great thickness and especially one (the miner with his wife) is fantastic!

		<fullReview>Whatever your preconceptions about Che Guevara going into it, this movie portrays him as a young man who, in the event of leaving his home town indefinitely for the first time, develops a strong social conscience. Whether it stayed that way the more power he found himself wielding is highly debatable and ultimately a moot point for the journey of discovery in which the film immerses us.The movie is not so much about the completed ideals that so many who have studied history will be familiar with, but rather studies the process of how travelling away from one's natural environment can shape those thoughts and influence the choices it will cause them to put into action for the future. This is a universal experience that will apply to WHATEVER moral persuasion you find yourself aligning with.This film shows that freedom is a gift, opening up new opportunities to us. If only everyone got the chance to indulge in it, but unfortunately, that depends on finding the luck to be able to sample it yourself before you choose whether or not you're going to bestow it upon others...Forget poring over what's to become later; for now just enjoy that feeling of being able to take in the sights at your own pace, that wonderful exultation of liberty that the film conveys so well. Easy Rider on The Mighty One with the wind in your hair. Embrace the possibilities before reality eventually shows up and sets in!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what to say about this new fantastic movie, based on the story of the top symbol of revolutionary issues in the world? I can start saying that Gael Garc眼 Bernal is a fabulous actor which has in this movie one of the most spectacular performance ever played. The supporting cast is no less than marvelous, and led by Salles (which I, as a Brazilian, think is the best movie director Brazil's ever created) they take us to places and feelings that only a movie that goes near perfection can take. The story is not only about a journey through Latin America, but mostly about a spiritual journey, about how Che Guevara found his place in the world, and how he realized how important he could be in many ways to many people. At last, I recommend this movie to anyone how enjoys a terrific film, made with great passion by passionate people. I hope I can be such a great Movie Director like Salles one day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Portrait: Those Halcyon Days of our Youth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, had to set aside my prejudices to view this film. If you're like me whenever 'Ernesto Che Guevera' is even mentioned en passant, I found myself conflicted. Yes, I too have many preconceived notions as to who the 'real' Che was. But from the film adaptation of the novel by Guevera's own hand, we learn that Ernesto started out in earnest (scuza the pun): Guevera studied to become a doctor. Quite the noble calling. And far flung from his later political activist career where his life was cut short: he died in a hail of bullets; called for by his Bolivian captors and eventual executioners.Let me set that all aside for now. Ernesto or 'Fuser' as he was affectionately known to his side kick and co-adventurer, Alberto, who is slightly older but still in his twenties plans the adventure of a lifetime. Together the 20 year-old idealists riding two up in the saddle atop an oil bleeding but still functioning single cylinder 500 cc Norton affectionately named 'The Mighty One' set out. They envision seeing and experiencing the length and a good part of the breadth of the South American continent.The intrepid explorers begin their journey in their native Argentina. From Buenos Aires, they ride south. Then they plan to head north: hug the Pacific coast and follow the roads all the way up from the tip of Chile. Their destination: Venezuela. Once they reached Caracas, Fuser and Alberto would celebrate the latter's 30th birthday. The entire journey was to take no more than six months.En route, the explorers experience everything from the forever changing landscapes such as the towering Chilean Andes to the gamut of human emotions. Even at their tender age, I doubt if the lads were prepared or even welcomed their encounters with fellow 'average' Latin Americans. Especially poignant is their visit to a Leper Colony. Fuser is moved from the very first encounter. Moreover, he cannot hide his indignation at the suffering of the sick but also for the oppressed peoples that they encounter throughout. Alberto, on the other hand, is all too consumed with his amorous side of the adventure. For certain, he is not one to morph into a deep thinker. Not if a loose skirt or unbuttoned female tunic beckons nearby.Late in the film, Alberto though does have his epiphany; sort of. In Venezuela,the two pals who were almost inseparable but at times insufferable; part ways. Fuser now filled to the brim with memories of the social injustices he's experienced everywhere on the continent is resolute: he vows to change the world. Or at least the Latin American contingent. Alberto,not of the same persuasion, disavows himself from that laudable platitude. But not before the two exchange tear filled hugs. Then Alberto returns to Venezuela. Fuser doesn't join him; he sets his sights farther afield: Cuba.Throughout this film, I was drawn to their journey. Many times I felt transported to each scene: I was right there, alongside the two Latin musketeers. And along with the ethos and pathos themes there was plenty of humor to draw from as well: such as their harrowing escape from the local dance hall after Fuser tried to romance the drunken mechanic's wife. The benevolent tradesman who just hours earlier had offered to repair the 'tired' Norton for free, sobered up just in time: a friend caught the two tryst makers escaping into the Chilean night air; almost certain they would christen their chance meeting.Both director Walter Salles and producer Robert Redford deserve many kudos for making this stirring and moving film. Despite what your views now are on how Ernesto Che Guevera turned out later, if you're like me, theFuser character as portrayed brilliantly in the film by Gael Garcia Bernal is one to emulate at any age. To wit, it's never too late to show compassion on those that society has forgotten. Makes no difference where you live either. Or what your political affiliations are. How can we remain silent when so much injustice still abounds in the world? I remember Fuser saying the exact same line. Many times; still needs to be said even more.Good on all those who helped make this film a reality. Because the reality is this: much social injustice exists around the globe even today; still seems to be a topic that is to be avoided at all costs; especially by the 'haves'. A pithy but needed observation...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A subtle portrait of the birth of an idealist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1952 Ernesto "Che" Guevara was a shy, middle class medical student in Argentina. Within a few years, he had become the world's most iconic revolutionary, a personal journey that begun with a physical one, a trip undertaken with a friend around South America. This was an age before budget airlines and backpackers hostels, so the expedition was a hard one, even if it could only have been contemplated by a child of (relative) privilege; and in Walter Salles' film, 'The Motorcycle Diaries', these travels are sympathetically and understatedly recreated, with the story of Guervara's political development the underlying (but subtly handled) theme. The movie showcases the beautiful scenery of Chile and Peru, and convincingly portrays a perhaps more austere age than our own, in which Guevera and his companion might be honoured and humbled by the people they met. The two are presented as appealing characters, in no way heroic but open-minded, human and compassionate; based of Che's own writings, it may not be neutral but although the pair start no revolutions (except for a minor revolt against the nuns in a leper colony), it's still an inspiring story. A world of immense inequality and suffering would be a better place today if more of those fortunate enough to be able to travel were to do so in the spirit of Che.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An important movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many movies exist these days to entertain. You tell a story, throw some laughs, drama, thrills, you're sold and have a good time. But the Motorcycle Diaries includes something important: the education of Ernesto "Che" Guevara as he travels across Latin America with his friend Alberto Granado. That in itself should be reason to watch this movie, to see through the eyes of one who would become a revolutionary. My applause goes to our two leads, Gael Garc眼 Bernal and Rodrigo De la Serna, for creating a wonderful performance.Guevara de la Serna puts it best from the beginning: "This isn't a tale of heroic feats. It's about two lives running parallel for a while, with common aspirations and similar dreams." A four month journey to discover Latin America, on a lark essentially, becomes much more between two friends. For one in particular, it opens his eyes to what Latin America means.The wit and charisma between the two leads do nothing less than compliment the movie throughout. One of the more clever scenes involve the two wooing the Chilean sisters. Or Granado's taunting of the Peruvians at the Blackjack table. You'll feel Guevara's pain during his asthmatic bouts, not to mention Granado's when the fate of 'The Mighty One' is determined. Though I felt Lima's comparison to Macchu Picchu was harsh, The Motorcycles Diaries is a beautiful story of a real journey with impassioned men who really had nothing to lose and gained everything when all was said and done.</fullReview>

Of course he would not have been able to portray this role as well as he did without the excellent script and a very strong supporting cast but I still believe that he was the perfect choice for this role, so well done to the people in casting who worked on this film.A genuinely touching, unique and quietly brilliant film detailing one of the most beautiful friendships I have seen on screen.

Not too harsh, neither too naive. He doesn't act as if he wanted to impress. Guevara doesn't spread over the screen with his powerful shadow. He goes to your heart as a boy, a student who discovers America. The Chilean and Argentine views are beautifully taken. The sense of humour and laughter are far beyond everybody's expectation. It's definitely funny. Salles showed that it's possible to make a piece of art without having to blow heads and cut throats, trying to be funny at the same time, and supposing "I'm a genius", as a certain president of the last Cannes Festival usually does, although I don't doubt of his talent...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent cross-section of Latin American culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the film The Motorcycle Diaries is based on the controversial revolutionary figure Che Guevara, the film is successful in giving a depoliticized rendition of the man in his youth. The film follows Ernesto Guevara de la Serna and his friend Alberto Granado in their trek across South America in the 1950's. On the back of a beat-up old motorcycle the two young Argentines set out on a journey to experience South America. The film is interesting because it catches Ernesto Guevara at an age before he was known as 'Che'. At the outset of the film, the men are simply boys trying to experience their lives and figure out who they really are. Their trip across South America offers a fascinating display of the natural beauty and cultural diversity of the continent. It is interesting to see the young men experience and interact with the locals in the various countries of Latin America. The film offers a real human drama that deals with the issues of youth, conviction, and transformation.I found it really interesting seeing Ernesto Guevara at such a young age. Before seeing the film I did not know very much about the character. After watching The Motorcycle Diaries I felt compelled to do a little more research on the man. One thing I found particularly interesting was the fact that he grew up in a wealthy family. I felt that the film conveyed this part of the character very well. Knowing his background makes viewing the trek across South America all the more interesting. Guevara set out on his journey with all the youthful excitement of exploring a new continent. As the trip went on, however, it was fascinating to see Guevara and Granado come into contact with the people less fortunate than themselves. With each stop on their journey the men came across many impoverished and disenfranchised South Americans. It was interesting to see the characters' youthful excitement become mired with the knowledge of poverty and suffering. The characters' final stop was a medical internship in a leper colony. It was really fascinating to see the young men at a crossroads in their lives come to experience the reality of the human condition. Clearly this would be a pivotal moment in any person's life, but it is even more interesting knowing the course that Guevara would ultimately choose to follow.Another thing that I found really interesting about the film was the cross-section of Latin American culture. As the two traveled along the highways of South America, I truly got the feeling that the various countries really do share a common cultural identity. Seeing the characters move from Argentina into Chile, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, and knowing the Guevara would eventually go on to Cuba as well as Bolivia really gave the sense of a connected cultural identity. The film reminded me of Simon Bolivar and his vision of a united Latin America. I think that this film did an excellent job of communicating what might have been the birth of Guevara's belief in the Bolivarian dream. It was also very successful in making the case that the states of Latin America are truly a single nation that has somehow managed to remain divided. The thought is enough to fill the young men with excitement and youthful idealism.Perhaps my favorite thing about the film is that it never once begins to "preach". In making a film that features Che Guevara, one runs the risk of falling into a faceless political debate stoking tensions regarding economic theories and nationalism. The situations presented in The Motorcycle Diaries, however, are very human and true to life. There's nothing preachy or condescending about showing people who are experiencing poverty and sickness. Faced with these real-life situations, the subtle changes that take place within the characters are beautiful. The film's depiction of Guevara's coming head-to-head with actual human suffering gives insight into his famous battle against inequality and poverty in Latin America. Regardless of your political feelings concerning the character, one definitely comes away from the film with a new understanding and empathy as to why he believed and did what he did.</fullReview>

While I haven't read the source material for this movie, I suspect that these people miss the point. Guevara wasn't a revolutionary, or even anyone particularly significant, at the time that this took place. He was a kid reacting to the world around him. By de-emphasizing his politics in favor of the events that formed them, I think the filmmakers allow us, as viewers, to react not to the man, but to the influences that made the man. It's a difficult undertaking to leave such a substantial piece of the movie implicit, but it's a testament to the skill of the filmmakers that they were successful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a well made biographical movie, which works well in parts, but as a whole fails to deliver. The film looks good, without being stunning. The acting is flawless, without being inspiring. The story told here is fairly inoffensive. What surprised me was how tepid this was, considering the nature of the character it focuses on.One major problem I had with this movie is it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be - it starts as a light-hearted buddy road movie, with considerably less edge than, say, Easy Rider. It drifts on in this way, with Guevara at times too-honest-to-be-true (hint hint - he's going to be a revolutionary leader one day). Half way or so he discovers he cares about the injustice of third world poverty. He goes round with some lepers looking concerned, swims a river, everybody's happy, then end.But where was the conflict? Where was the internal struggle as Guevara's new beliefs lead him against his old way of life? Is this a bio-pic about one of the 20th century's most notable revolutionary leaders, or about two likable students bumming around South America on a motorbike. Both and neither.What was missing was a complicated character with dark and light sides, good and bad, internal struggles - eg: Lawrence of Arabia. What you get here is a watered-down Jesus-figure.Like Guevara, I have suffered from asthma since I was 2. The movies never get it right - and this one was no exception. Asthma is not like that - I know they have to dramatise it but all these loud choking sounds actors make are silly. When you have asthma you wheeze, you struggle to draw in a breath - so you either have to breath very very slowly, or with quick short breaths. I'm sure one day I'll see a movie where they get it right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes a movie comes with so much excessive praise weight that I wish I could've tackled it by itself, without knowing anything about it.I say this because this average, run-of-the-mill movie about the young years of Ernesto "Che" Guevara was sold to me as the eighth wonder of the World, and it doesn't come even close. Based on Guevara's diaries relating his journey with his close friend Alberto through South America, it focuses specifically on Guevara's acknowledgement of political problems and lack of justice. However, it's far from being a political movie, and it works better as a genre piece, a combination of "buddy" and "road" movie with a real background. Of course, the latter half of the story focuses more extensively on Guevara and not on his buddy, and attempts to show the inner transformation on his soul. It's not bad, it's just too clich to seem really important.So, does it work as a genre piece? For most of the time, kind of. It's always entertaining enough to keep you on your seat waiting for something better to happen. Unfortunately, nothing really groundbreaking or important happens. The movie follows its formulaic route until an ending which cleverly cuts from the movie Alberto to the real Alberto, who is still alive and living in the same place where the movie ends and supposedly still has fond memories of Ernesto.So, a big, fat "meh". Maybe it didn't work for me because I've never been part of the people that worship "Che" Guevara, despite respecting him quite a bit. But good historical movies concern you with the characters, even if you don't really have a well-formed appreciation for them. This one, perhaps because it favored traditional and safe storytelling too much, fell flat on that regard.</fullReview>

If you read the diaries Che's own portrait of himself is much less impressive--he basically comes across as a self-important prig with grandiose dreams but little in the way of guts. This makes him at least a far more honest man than the film makers. You would have thought that after all these years the left would be able to come to terms with the contradictions and shortcomings of its heroes. How did such a bright and idealist young man turn into such a flawed adult? The clues are in the diaries, but you'd never know it from this idealised and idolised portrayal.This is the film of the Che the bedsit poster, not Che the man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just think it's important that people remember Che was a murderer responsible for the death of hundreds, perhaps thousands of Cubans who disagreed with his Communist ideology. Though it's trendy to wear Che shirts amongst Americans wanting to seem cool, we should not forget his victims. It's amazing to me that people love to characterize Che is this wonderful guy, when he was known for his use of mass murder and terror to advance a political agenda. It's a wonder why Hollywood and the media don't do more to educate people on this very disturbing history of Che. To treat him like a hero is sort of like treating Hitler or Stalin like one. For a good history of Che, I would direct people to: http://bureaucrash.com/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=17</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit Hollywoodish, but not too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The topic is interesting, the quintessential "road movie" with social and political undertones (or maybe the quintessential social and political film with road undertones) and, all in all, fairly well realized. The Latin American natural and human landscape is, as always, stunning in its beauty and variety. All in all a decent film. Yet, one can't help but comparing it with the film it could have been and it wasn't, mainly due to a certain Hollywood sappiness that, maybe under the influence of the American portion of the production, percolates through the whole film. Some defects are subtle and, all in all, venial: the way facial expressions are edited in here and there in the film, certain semi-comical moments whose placement and frequency are too predictable not to arouse the suspicion that they went directly from the pages of a production manual into the film, etc. Others are more evident: the river-crossing scene is absolutely unforgivable (and this whether Guevara really swam through the river or not), the political and social aspects of the film are downplayed and, when they are played at all, they are with a naivet that borders with a populist "good feeling" (what the Italians used to call, some ten years ago, "il buonismo.") Gael Garcia Bernal is a solid actor, and this film confirms it, but we are far away from the performance in "El crime del Padre Amaro." One can even glimpse the early symptoms of Tarantinism (a disease that I named after Quentin Tarantino: a great director who is, however, so busy being Quentin Tarantino that his life seems not to have much space for anything else.)But, as I said, all in all, the story is good, the film keeps moving, the South American landscape is beautiful, the Argentinian accent is deliciously musical. Not a masterpiece, but worth the price of the ticket, which is more than you can say for so many films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Reason to Believe in a Latin America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts with a quote from the book on which the film is based - that this is a story of people and not heroes. Ernesto and Alberto, a biochemist and a medical student, leave their native Argentina to explore South America. They are going to make a trip on motorcycle south and west to Chile where they will turn north through the Andes, across the Peruvian jungles, and on into Venezuela until the Caribbean. They're doing the trip to experience the continent first hand and not just through the literature and film they're used to. The journey starts well as Ernesto visits his girlfriend and Alberto has his own sexcapade. As the journey continues north, the two (and the viewer) see the amazing Chilean Andes. The two run into and get to know locals throughout their journey. They run into motorcycle problems a couple of times. The first time leaves them leaving the town quickly and in hot pursuit, while the second leaves them without a motorcycle completely. The two have encounters on their journey with local farmers, poor boat travelers, and exploring the land of the Incas that show the poverty. They see how many are mistreated due to race, class, and political beliefs. Their exploits in a Peruvian leper colony help bring them the confidence, especially Ernesto, to deal with this inequality.The story is a classic Bildungsroman that leads them from a bourgeois and carefree attitude to one of action and dedication. Its setting in South America and in the 1950s sets it apart from most, and the use of a historical character legitimizes it.There are certainly few films that I truly admire. To witness the transformation of a hero of the common man is one thing. To see the faces of the poor and oppressed and to see the landscape they call home are something else. The movie alone can be seen as a documentary, a portrait, of a continent that I do not know. I see their faces and homes and learn a lot. The plot, this coming of age, really thickens the soup. The handsome and well-acting Gael Garc眼 Bernal really bring a fresh image to Che. We see him as a man instead of just an image. We are reminded, through the tragic stories of those he encounters in the movie, of why communism, or more poignantly fighting, is a vital action. The film revitalizes the soul through its intimacy and through its full and medium shots of the people often oppressed or forgotten but never at their end. It's a very inspirational film and best appreciated by those willing to leave their comfort for the great beyond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Roadmovie exploring the birth of an ideology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSFashion must be up there as one of those truly irritating topics. For a long time people have bought items, less for their appearance, but more for their social status. One of the most obvious examples of this has been the obsession with that one image of Ernesto "Che" Guevara. Guevara was a revolutionary who dreamt of a better life for so many people. Whether love him or hate him, he is a figure to be respected. With this in mind, to have some random student walking around with his image on their chest, whilst they don't know anything about him (some even being unaware of his name), feels insulting and offensive. In "The Motorcycle Diaries" we are introduced to Guevara as the boy slowly becomes a man. Looking aside from the politics of the story however, this film is a well made story of two friends who remain close through adversity."The Motorcyle Diaries" tells the story of Alberto Granada (Rodrigo De la Serna) and his young friend Ernesto Guevara de la Serna (Gael Garcia Bernal) who together travel on the road aboard "the Mighty One", an ancient bike which is obviously destined to collapse. Traveling around South America, first by bike and later by foot, these two encounter 1960s countries full of suffering and poverty.Perhaps the one key problem with this film is that there's little way of knowing how accurate it is. Based upon Guevara's diary, and with Granada's blessing, this film shows how Guevara develops from a young Medical Graduate through to a doubt filled, potential revolutionary with notions of how the world should be. The film shows us this notion with superb skill, but ultimately there's no way of really knowing just whether this is the truth or not.Aside from political ambition, "The Motorcycle Diaries" is a brilliant film. Showing us how two friends interact through adversity, this film is primarily a road movie with a sense of companionship. With superb performances from Bernal and Rodrigo, the two main characters are shown to us to be people to bond with. Rodrigo De la Serna is particularly superb as the thirty year old Granado, a man who is as close to Guevara as is possible, but who slowly drifts apart from him as he evolves from boy into man.Ultimately, there is little else which can be said about this film. Showing the young Guavara and Granado as they develop as individuals, "The Motorcycle Diaries" sends us a clear bond with these two young men. With absolutely beautiful scenery and stunning acting, this film is destined to succeed on all levels. Whilst unlikely to be nominated to be nominated for the Best Oscar Category (the first foreign nominee ever?), there's no doubt the film will be nominated and probably win the best foreign film category. Politically "The Motorcycle Diaries" is questionable, but as a road movie in it's own right, there are few better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that make me empathize</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Che Guevara was one of idols in post-war generation like me. However, I did not know anything about his real life and character. Even today, some people see him an idol, but they do not know him well.According to this web site, this movie describes a motorcycle travel of two youths, based on Guevara's autobiography. Guevara himself recalls that in this travel, something has changed inside him. It was nothing more than an adventure until the motorcycle was broken in a collision with a bull, but it seems the latter part of the travel on foot was decisive for him. The story rather goes simply, but the audiences can't help having empathy.Not all youths change on a travel. Only those of strong sensitivity and open mind can change. What he knew on the travel were serious situation of oppressed people and his attitude and capability to face them straight. That anywhere in South America, people can communicate in Spanish, the conqueror's language, was a big advantage for him. If he traveled Asia, he must have had completely different experiences.The scenery pictures of plants, mountains and rivers are beautiful. It was very impressive because we don't see such places on movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With so many new movies somewhat repetitive showing us nothing new this one is one of the best in its kind. It is not just adventure, but it shows deep insights into Che Guevara's life that not every biography tells us about.The movie shows what kind of person Guevara was. We can see how from young , shy and unsettled in life person he becomes the kind of person that people still greatly admire. This film is a fascinating adventure of Ernesto and his friend, it emphasises on the fact that Ernesto was very responsive and that he was touched by all people he met on the way. All those portraits of the people he saw established his lifetime opinion about the destiny of Latin America he fought till the last second of his life...This dramatical movie, in my humble opinion, cannot be measured in the scale from 1 to 10. It is simply an invaluable piece of work!</fullReview>

Characters are vividly and naturally portrayed by the two protagonists, Gael Garc眼 Bernal (Ernesto 'Che' Guevara De La Serna) and Rodrigo De La Serna (Alberto Granado). These two actors really bring out the differences in character of the travelling friends. While the former is more introvert and thoughtful, the latter's joking side gets the best of him. One can almost sense, through Garc眼 Bernal's eyes and facial expression, the change that is slowly taking place in him as he meets several examples of injustice along his voyage. One must not forget to mention the amazing scenery in the film (the ruins of Machu Picchu is a fine example) and also the brilliant soundtrack that accompanies most memorable scenes in the film. Brazilian director Walter Salles has succeeded in delivering a masterpiece. A gem of a film!</fullReview>

As the two progresses into this trip, they see many things both good and bad, that will shape them into the men they will become.This film, is awesomely shot and filled with many cultural undertones. I think Director Walter Salles did his job nicely. The acting was also excellent. Rodrigo De La Serna, turned in a beautiful performance.

		<fullReview>The motorcycle diaries is not a political film. Although it has been rated R because of language, this movie does not show violence or nudity. The story is the journey of Ernesto Guevara and Alberto Granado through South America. The adventure begins in Argentina with "La poderosa" (the powerful/mighty one) Granado's motorcycle. They start in Buenos Aires and go through Chile and Peru and finally end their journey in Venezuela. This movie shows the life of two humanitarians with great ideas for the unification of the people from South America. The great deal about it is the fact that both characters are not shown as future revolutionaries but simply as a doctor and a biochemist helping people along their way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this wonderful adaptation of Che's book this afternoon and I came away with a profound respect for the writing credits as well as the direction-to say nothing of the great screen presence of Bernal as Che'.Having said that, I was more than a little puzzled by the storyline because it was not exactly what I had read several months ago when I read the Diaries. The book highlighted many parts of the journey and skipped over many other parts that were major pieces of the film or at least that is what I felt. Of course that is the film maker's right but it was nonetheless disconcerting for me because I watched a movie with which I thought I had no connection.At movie's end while the Credits rolled I realized that Che's companion on the journey, Alberto Granado, had also written a book of his remembrances and that therein might lie the source of all my frustrations with the movie I watched and the book I read-Alberto, naturally, remembered different things than those Che' remembered.I thought the cinematography was superb-the feeling of the early Fifties was carried forth seamlessly as were the costumes-nothing that I saw betrayed the feeling of the times.I would commend this beautiful film to any person with the slightest curiosity about the Twentieth century.</fullReview>

And this movie has touched me deeper than any other, I never ever felt so proud of being a part of America, the big America. You don't need to be north American to be 'American'; and you don't need to be a communist to understand how unfairly things go for most of Americans, specially for the poorest ones. What the rest of the world ignores is the fact that us latin Americans rarely recognize how familiar we are with each other, despite nationalities or accents. Latin America is not Ricky Martin, is not Fidel Castro, is not Paulina Rubio, nor exotic funky dances or Mexican soap operas. You want to know what latin America is like? go see this movie, you will have a great time too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Diarios de motocicleta is a wonderful film. It doesn't try to be more than it is, which is, an excellent adaption of Che Guevara's diaries. It contains a lot of the details from the diaries and it follows the story rather precisely. The emotionally touching parts of the story (i.e. when Che is enlightened little by little and realizes the terrible living conditions of the poor and lower class peoples of latin America) had even more impact on me when I watched the film than they had when I read the book. The actors are doing a great job, and I especially enjoy Gael Garcia Bernal in the role of Che. He really captures the nature of Che, and portray him very realistic I think. Bernal has become one of my favorite actors since I first discovered him in Amores Perros. On top of all this, the film has a stunning visual side in some beautiful locations. This movie just made my urge to travel in latin America even bigger.All in all, an excellent and touching film, therefore: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The awakening of a continent and not just a man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a movie, I think it does a very good job of narrating the story of socialawakenings...1952 is a year of awakening not only for Che and his friendAlberto, but also a moment of awakening for Latin America as a continent. Even though this is the story of a particular man, what is really being told is the profound changes that were boiling up in Latin America. It is a great cinematic choice. My main formal critique would be structure, which at times loses pace and momentum. The cinematography is just breathtaking and it made me missmy home country immensely. I am very curious to know more about theproduction process of this film: the fact they had local units and actors in each country, a Brazilian director, a Mexican actor... Truly a Latin American film in its form and content.I am surprised to find very few comments that really focus on the movie as amovie. Many of them simply reveal what the authors think about Che and hispolitics, while their analysis is forgotten. Of course, this is to be expected, since Che and what he represents will always generate strong and passionateopinions. In general, these comments confirm the fact that the people of the US and other English-speaking countries know and understand so little about thecomplex idealism of Latin America when it comes to social issues. Those whohave a rigid black and white view of the ideologies of the 60s, who weresurprised to read connections between Marxism and Democracy, Communismand Catholicism, etc, will really never be able to grasp the real legacy of Che Guevara and many others that remain very much alive throughout the continent, not just political activists, but also artists like Neruda to priests like Monse?or Romero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film about the young Ernesto "Che" Guevara and his buddy Alberto Granado may inspire people to commit to do something that matters at some point in their lives. From a privileged background in Buenos Aires, both buddies set out on a fun trek-adventure. Through meetings with the poor and sick of various countries of South America,Che's future life as a revolutionary in Cuba is formed. The cinematography is stunning, varying from the desolate Atacama desert to the awesome Machu Picchu to the jungle of the Amazon basin. All the encounters with various poor and hopeless people at some points seemed a bit too slick and not genuine. However, it did portray the then(1950s) and present gap in standard of living among the peoples of that continent, especially divided along the lines of indigenous versus European backgrounds. The leper colony sequence seemed dragged out somewhat but it showed Che's commitment to a cause in which he believed. The shot of Alberto as an old man today living in Havana was a great parting shot before the credits. All in all, the film was entertaining and an interesting insight into a man whose memory is revered in today's Cuba.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a great accomplishment for Director Walter Salles. He, in a very simplistic way, portraits the very nature of south America in the 50's, its inhabitants, its dreams, their hopes. The script develops the story of 'Che' Guevara, from an innocent student to a man who realizes ? and confront - the injustices that surround him. He's a regular guy, like many of us, but the one who experiences the unbalanced fairness of the society ? like in today's Sudan, India, etc? It's also a tale of two friends, a common place in time when we were younger, sharing adventures with our best childhood's friends. A quite nostalgic memory in our present. We learn that these 'revolucionarios' are not a bunch of terrorists, but a bunch of idealistic people ? real Christians in essence ? that are just in search for justice and peace. The photography is stunning, showing us the incredible beauty of the natural landscapes ? a theme for Pablo Neruda's poetry's ? images in the snow, the forests, the desert, Machu Pichu, the lakes, the jungle? all parts of this magnificent South American continent, masterfully shown with its people as the very product of its landscapes. The actors portrait the two main characters in the most sincere, simple, human, truthful and likable way. This is one of the very few films in where the people of each country are portrayed just like they are in the way they talk, behave, smile, think, etc. We don't see the Hollywood's clich乶 of the Latin world, in where Latinos are portrait in one single way, leaving their human essence to the imagination of others. This film is a tale of friendship and the true spirit of sacrifice for the ones who need our help. A MUST SEE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Salles' (Central Station, co-produced City of God) new film tells the story of the young Ernesto 'Che' Guevara's voyage around South America with his friend Alberto 'Mial' Granado, and the discoveries and personal journey made during the 12000km+ trip. I'll start with the negatives, or negative (for there is only one). I haven't read Che Guevara's diaries, on which the film is based. Nor, indeed, do I know much about his life or his work as a revolutionary. Nonetheless as a 'Great Man's Origins' story, in which category this film definitely sits, the whole thing feels a little too convenient; the influences too obvious, the references too direct. You know throughout this film exactly where it's heading. Having said that, maybe it was foolish of me to expect anything else from a biopic of such a passionately adored character. But that is my only gripe. Set aside the above issue, and what you are left with is a beautiful, beautiful tale well told of two friends sharing an extraordinary experience. I was surprised at Salles' ability to differentiate the characters so clearly despite their almost identical reactions to most situations and events. I was half anticipating de la Serna's Mial to become the antagonist to Garcia Bernal's 'Fuser' (Guevara's childhood nickname) at some point in the film, but that never happened. Instead, Salles' chooses to use Mial as the engine, bouncing off Fuser's introspection to keep the story moving along. In doing so, Mial might be in danger of becoming little more than a plot device, but Salles carves him into a character of equal standing to Guevara, the oil to Fuser's vinegar. De la Serna's performance brings out the quality of the writing of his part; the vices and foibles of the young man, his humour, insatiable appetite for women, and silver tongue are all delightfully handled. By contrast, Bernal's performance is one of introspection. The odd melodramatic asthma attack aside (I'm an asthmatic myself - if you were that hyper during an attack, you'd be dead in about 30 minutes), his performance is spot on. From his leaving his family behind at the start of the film, through his first moment of violent rebellion (throwing a rock at an abusive mining company truck), to his explaining to his friend at the end why he needs to spend a long while alone, Bernal is not overcome by the magnitude of the man he is portraying. He plays him as a kid on his first real adventure away from home, much like any pre-college teen in the UK on his GAP year. The beauty is in the subtleties, and through nuances he suggests that what he witnesses and experiences over those thousands of miles will stay with him and shape him for many years to come. Not much to be said about the rest of the cast. The supporting players do well, even if not a one of them is on screen for longer than about 5 minutes through the whole film. The diversity of locations is astounding, Salles' giving a real sense of what South America might have been almost half a century ago. He finds indigenous Peruvians who still speak Quechua, he shoots in an unspoilt Amazon of timber huts and rafts, he even gathered a skeleton crew (I'm guessing here) and got genuine footage of his two leads in Machu Picchu. This is all ably, and at times beautifully, shot by Eric Gautier (Intimacy). It being about a week now since I saw the film, it has had a chance to settle. The strongest feeling I have for the film now is wonderment. I want to read Che's diaries, I want to go back to South America, I want to meet all these extraordinary people. But above all I want to see the film again, see a young man to whom I can relate, not a revolutionary giant whose name perhaps holds more significance now than his deeds, whose face is emblazoned on more posters and t-shirts than James Dean. Fuser is just a kid like any other. In this film we come to understand how he became Che Guevara, a man unlike any other. If this isn't a shoo-in for a best foreign film Oscar nom, I'll eat my hat. It's gorgeous. The film. Not my hat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Diarios de Motocicleta" shows you the trip that would turn the man into the legend. Che Guevara is not recognised as Che throughout the film, as he was given that name when he met up with Fidel and Ral Castro in Mexico some years later, as an urine extraction (piss take) of his Argentinian speech. *factoid* the word "che" comes from the Italian emigrants that moved to Argentina in the late 1800s and early 1900s.* The subtle poke at the American's (people from the USA) exploitations comes in a variety of shapes, like "The American Mining Corporation". The reason for this being that the film is seen from Ernesto's perspective. Being a student of Hispanic culture, I have acquired a great deal of knowledge of South America, and this film sums up all the worst (and most interesting) atrocities that come to pass in this seemingly forgotten corner of the globe.Ernesto Guevara's compassion is well portrayed throughout the film, and shows the side of him that is a huge contrast to his stereotypical image; the evil communist that was ruthless in his guerrilla warfare. Take this film with a pinch of salt, especially if you're not used to seeing things from a different perspective, as although not shocking, it punches a huge hole in western culture and capitalism. Although the emphasis is on Che, "Diarios de Motocicleta" has an underlying message to follow your dreams, stand up for what you believe in and question the justifications of the world's more subtle crimes.With the right mind-set, this film can be incredibly enlightening. Top notch.</fullReview>

It is rather dry, with little if any meaningful dialogue, and perhaps most importantly one does not get a true sense of what Che was becoming. The transformation from Che the student to Che the idealist is not apparent in the film, and ultimately I found the only positive aspect to be the cinematography which included some beautiful scenery. A film should be judged for the effectiveness with which its message is delivered, not for the nature of its message. In other words, people should criticize the film more than they criticize Che and communism. This was not a film about communism, but a film about Che's personal transformation, through his travels as a young Argentine. In my opinion, the film was not effective in showing this. I would like some feedback from other people, but please refrain from making this a political debate.</fullReview>

It regards two energetic males who set out on their motorcycle in hopes of encountering adventure and are overcome by one setback after another. The bike takes its share of abuse before finally dying down but they continue their quest via other resources until they eventually come across a leper colony. Using their medical knowledge they bring hope to those they encounter as well as a sense of purpose within themselves. Director Walter Salles previously made Central Station and he makes great use of locations and weather conditions. He also lends to the film a great documentary style in its presentation, which heightens the themes. Gael Garcia Bernal plays the young yet serious doctor who himself must take medicine for a condition. Rodrigo de la Serna is hilarious as his womanizing buddy. While they are terrific together, the supporting roles could have been broader. They are observed only through the leads and lack further detail. This unfortunately deducts the film from what it might have been had further personalities been established otherwise themes demonstrate persistence and endurance of those having courage to move forward. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was a very well constructed chapter for one of the most famous leaders from contemporary America.I begun the movie based on recommendations from peers and did not have an inkling of what the theme of the film was. I also never noticed this fact from the name of the protagonist Ernesto Guevara. This little fact helped me understand the story from an unbiased viewpoint and I could actually imagine the feelings and emotions of the young 20 something youth traveling &amp; seeing the world for what it is. At many points within the movie I felt the strength in personality of Ernesto who had undertaken a life changing journey with the cheerful and happy-go-lucky Alberto Granado. Halfway through the movie I did begin to understand the socialist undertones of the movie and very late I realized that it was a biography outlining the birth of the purpose of one very popular "Che" (facepalm). And suddenly I could relate the underlying message which had been playing throughout the movie.I was glad that I viewed the story as a art project, a story of an anonymous youth who got to see the live documentary of silently suffering America and his own struggle through the darker side of the world which led to his ideological awakening. Ernesto was what many of are not as an individual, smart, good-looking, intelligent, well read, pensive, strong, adventurous and the list would go on. Most of all he was brutally honest but empathetic and could see the underlying truth of the situation. This is probably the most important quality that endeared him to the suffering masses and promoted his rise as a socialist leader.Apart from the future political controversies for Che, this was a very heartwarming account of his journey into adulthood and the kindling of his future ideological foray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A biopic on Che Guevara, The Motorcycle Diaries traces his famous journey on his friend's motorcycle across South America that kick- started the rebel in him. The movie explores the benign side of Che when he was a medical student, kind and affable with a disarming smile. Much loved by his family and friends, he was a dutiful person unwary of what the future beheld for him. A dear friend Alberto, talked him into covering vast expanse of the continent on his rusty motor cycle for sheer adventure and thrill. They started off from their hometown heavily loaded with supplies and adrenaline. Starting from the visit to Che's girlfriend, they traveled across the periphery of the continent, frequently punctuated with unexpected hiccups such as motor cycle breakdowns, minor conflicts and occasional starvation. Soon, they realized South America was more than what they had seen. They met a large number of oppressed farmers on their way. Each interaction is portrayed to have significantly appealed to Che's conscious until they reached a leprosy health camp as medical doctors. His stay at the camp completely transformed him into a man with solid intent and infallible purpose to fight against oppression, fight for a better America. The movie inspired by his letters to his relatives throughout this journey, wonderfully captures the free-lance spirit of two guys, their funny yet deep camaraderie, their travails and their self- realizations. Evenly paced, emotionally stirring and humorous, Motorcycle Diaries is a holistic yet concise account of genesis of one of the greatest revolutionaries the world has ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A road movie about the political awakening of a future revolutionary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Motorcycle Diaries is a "road movie" about the journey of a young Ernesto "Che" Guevara and his friend Alberto though South America. On the trip they are deeply impacted by the social and economic injustices they witness, and Che is transformed by the experience that would shape the rest of his life. It's a film about poverty and exploitation, and it's filled with a love for the poor and the masses of people. The film doesn't get into how Che became a famous revolutionary, but rather focuses on his gradual political awakening as he comes to understand the nature of capitalism as a fundamentally oppressive system in which the wealthy benefit from the suffering of the poor. Everywhere Che and Alberto go, in town after town, country after country, that basic formula of oppression is consistent. The Motorcycle Diaries stars Gael Garc眼 Bernal as Che, and his expressive yet subtle performance keeps the audience engaged in the moment while also giving a hint of the future charismatic revolutionary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came to "The Motorcycle Diaries" not knowing anything about Che Guevara other than his connection with the Cuban revolution and his face on T-shirts and posters. I enjoyed the film. The travelogue aspects and the adventures of the young men were interesting. The characters were quite likable and often amusing.It became increasingly clear in the second half that Guevara was being offered to us as a kind of secular saint. Even so, when the movie was over I said to myself, "a good picture." In fact, it stimulated me to find out more about what Che Guevara did in his later life.Then came the disillusionment. Apparently he oversaw the execution of hundreds of people when he came to power with Castro. He was for a time strongly pro-Soviet and was instrumental in arranging for the installation of nuclear-armed Soviet missiles in Cuba. In fact, he detested the United States so much that, based on his remarks, he would not have been opposed to seeing New York and other American cities reduced to radioactive rubble.And there was much more to discover about his later life, none of it commendable. In the end, as was stated at the end of the movie, he was killed with the help of the CIA.Still, it was a good movie. You just have to remember that it was only a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Endearing film that could have been a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that wants to paint the picture of Che Gueverra's epiphany. It wants to be important. Brazilian Director Walter Salles (Central Staion) knows the basic approach of telling a chronological story, filled with visuals which tell the audience as much as the dialog. The idea of two friends embarking on a journey that could never be completed on its original terms (travelling South America on an old motorcycle with hardly any funds or plans to earn their way) makes for the small bit of drama we get. And that's the problem. The future history is irrelevant to the movie experience unless you are told otherwise, and we are not. Our lot is an expressed realization of inequity and injustice through roadside interviews, nothing first hand. That's not drama. Our boys struggling to get along despite their circumstances and ideals (one wants justice while the other comically wants women) seems to be what we are left with. Our two leads, Gael Garcia Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna are compelling and keep our attention as the ultimate road trip duo. The music enchants the scenes bringing you into these travelers shoes, but their minds would never accept events this way. They came from family money and protected upbringings. It is an endearing movie at times but the change that is supposed to be taking place on screen is still somewhere in the writers' screenplay, you would have to believe. And here that's what you have to do.</fullReview>

Having spent a lot of time working in Chile and Argentina, this film really evoked lots of memories for me and although set in 1952, some things have barely changed down in Tierra del Fuego and other parts of Patagonia. Moving on up through the continent, the two encounter interesting people and get into some terrible scrapes. What would Ernesto's mother have thought!!!

		<fullReview>it is not only an adaptation. or a political story. so, different by expectation, it is more profound, beautiful and touching. because it is a map. a travel. and the realities of a land. adventures and bricks for a manner to define reality. an universal subject who has the chance to have a splendid team who knows use it. Garcia Bernal does a splendid work. and the essence of this virtue is the art to transform his character in a image who can be Guevara or Kerouac. a wise science to explore each nuance of story and characters possibilities. for viewer, far to be only a show, it represents a form of experience. because it is a travel in heart of things. a lesson but out of didactic circles. remember of an age spirit, it is a homage to youth and definition of innocence in a special way. a film as a question. or, not only an artistic experience.</fullReview>

I felt like I traveled across South America through this movie, the scenery of Latin America that I saw though this movie is beautiful. Gael Garc眼 Bernal (Ernesto Fuser Guevara) was at his best and so Rodrigo de la Serna (Alberto Granado). They never came out of their role in any part of the movie. The movie shows the real situations that people of Latin America faced during that period. The movie is not a serious one also had some funny moments that really makes this movie more enjoyable.

		<shortDescription>Regardless of one's politics and personal views of Che, this movie makes you 'feel' the life in Latin American countries...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I watched this movie because of the fact that it's based on 'che'. Not that I am his greatest of fans or greatest of critics; so much so that I earlier used to co-relate him more with the 'bearded guy on the T-shirt' seen in Hollywood movies with inscriptions 'Che' (more like a campaign for resurrecting a revolutionary - like the 'I Love NY' T-shirts campaign). The persona of the man is sufficiently 'larger than life' to overshadow a movie which is very 'un-Che' like in its content and approach. Given this, the movie scores greatly in the manner in which it is handled ? a road trip and a backpacking adventure documentary feel of Latin America. To be honest, even if it would have been totally unrelated to Che, the movie still would have clicked (though not having that 'worthy of archive' feeling you largely associate when it's more of a biography of a strong public figure ? Che in this case). The movie is excellent because it has superb cinematography of the beauty of South America, great chemistry between the two main actors, and an almost underplayed political theme. The visuals are as beautiful as a National Geographic Magazine feature on the Amazon and the deserted and populated lands of South America. The crisp use of shaky hand cameras without the much widely acclaimed panoramic sepia views associated with Hollywood (Lord of the Rings.... though I like that movie) when it tries to depict nature is noteworthy and makes you feel going along the road trip. The film does not begin or end with Guevara and Cuban militancy: it doesn't have to, as the transformation in the mind of Che is shown subtly (black and white footage of people's faces, and a final scene in Havana at the ending of the film.) The movie shows this transition of a 'boy' to a 'man'; from the carefree exploring youth to later having nostalgia about his destiny to help the people. (He may have got extreme after a while, but the study of him is compelling nonetheless.) The movie is based on the true story that took Guevara and Granado on a road trip all across and along South America in the 1950's. The direction cleverly avoids any political intent but focuses on the human transformation of two young Argentine professionals, a turning point in their lives, who decide to see their continent with their own eyes. It concentrates more on how the world changed a person who in turn tried to change the world. The movie ends at the end of their road trip ? which was more of 'abrupt' but a great decision to keep the pre and post 'che - life' at a distance. This movie ironically represents Che's ultimate goal - a unified continent: Brazilian Director, Mexican and Argentinean actors, American Producer; and, the movie was filmed in Chile and Peru as well!! It is one of those movies which 'stay' with you after you are done with the two hour session in front of the screen ? for some as an inspiration; for others as an experience? 8/10 definitely. PS: I may not be a supporter of the communism of Castro or Guevara, but the US as known today still feeds on Starbucks coffee made by the starving and suppressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Motorcycle Diaries is a film about Ernesto 'Fuser' 'Che' Guevara's travels around South America with his friend Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old bio-chemist. They plan to travel through their native Argentina before going Chile, Peru, the San Pablo leaper colony and Venezuela. They plan to drive the whole way by going on a 1939 Norton motorbike and they hope to finish the trip on Alberto's 30th birthday. Both men are from middle-class backgrounds with leftist leanings. Both are also doctors with a moral and social conscious. They go and meet up with Guevara's girlfriend and her family before continuing the trip. The early part of the trip is slightly comedial. The bike keeps breaking down and they end up broke, so have to do a number of thinks to make sure that they can live, including offering free medical advise, using the press and chat up local women. They start out the trip just as way to have a good time do some work at the leaper colony. They end up having to walk and hitchike for a lot of the trip after their bike breaks down completely. This is when they see harsh poverty that affects the indigenous populations of Chile and Peru. The ideas that affect them include mining, political arrests, land seizures, education, the list goes on. This harden the men's views. They are also hostile to the regime at the leaper colony, refusing to follow the rules set by the nuns and befriend the leapers. He develops a strong Marxist, pan-American view.The film is a good character study of the famous revoltuary and you can see how his views are developed. It is very well acted by its two stars Gael Garc眼 Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna. You also get a look and a feel of South American culture. It also has great cinematography, seeing some of the lovely scenery and the ruins of the Indica city Machu Picchu.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take a note, The Motorcycle Diaries is very impressive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several months ago I saw a really disgusting and downright nasty film called 'And Your Mother Too'; but Y tu mam tambi輹 is probably how most will recognise the film I'm talking about. The film was Latin American; in Spanish and was primarily a 'road movie'. But the film insisted on characters we could not relate to; grotesque and unnecessary scenes of nudity and sex not to mention weakly constructed plot points involving Maribel Verd's character and whether she will stay on the road trip or leave the immature boys to their own devices. And now, about a year later I see this: The Motorcycle Diaries. A film that is Latin American; in Spanish and one that adopts a similar 'road movie' approach ? my faith in these Latin American; Spanish speaking films that adopt a single route narrative has been well and truly restored.In short, The Motorcycle Diaries is brilliant. It's a tail of friendship and trust; but not between two horny teenagers in a car but two much more mature men on a bike. Hell, even the motorbike itself in this film is given more substance and character than the two boys are throughout the entirety of 'And Your Mother Too'. That is how good this film is in comparison. The film reminded me of 2002 effort 'Max'; an interesting and somewhat appealing film about Adolf Hitler in the years shortly after World War One and how he came to be the person with the big ideas and visions that we all now know him for. But while Ernesto Guevara (Garc眼 Bernal) is not portrayed with any sort of reference to the politician he will become, the film remains an artful and insightful look at a man in the days before they were famous (or perhaps 'infamous').But as a film on its own, The Motorcycle Diaries works and an engaging, uplifting and thoroughly interesting piece. The camera work twinned with the cinematography often gives off a dream-like state for the audience but adds that documentary feel it has going throughout whilst simultaneously contributing to that aesthetic of realism that South American films carry in heavy quantity. It is interesting to notice the elements that The Motorcycle Diaries carries in relation to American films and in relation to going against American tradition. The 'road movie' is, from knowledge, an American genre made popular with films such as Easy Rider and the two characters of Alberto Granado (De la Serna) and Ernesto himself play off one another for comic effect for most of the time al an American 'buddy'-film. But the interaction is brilliant and the screenplay involving.This is at its heart a journey of self-discovery between two people but there is an example very early on it will not allow itself to be polluted by American films and certainly not in the way And Your Mother Too was. Ernesto is with his female partner just before he leaves for his journey and a scene is set up during which sex seems almost obligatory, but the film avoids such unnecessary sequences and allows them to part ways. This sets Ernesto up for the journey in the sense he will feel frustrated on his trip and often he will find himself denied of what he really wants but it is for the greater good. Alberto on the other hand will find it difficult to resist his urge and I think this is where the film tries to separate the average person from true greatness and fame (infamy?). Today, Ernesto is relatively well known and a figure of somewhat but who is Alberto? He is a mere friend who was although loyal, gambled and took sex when he could not resist any longer. He took risks and perhaps put the guys in awkward situations.Films like these actually promote travel and travelling in general. They promote going abroad and finding oneself on journeys of discovery with friends and so forth. They do not demonise the places they visit like other films, particularly the American horror genre, whilst portraying people and places abroad as either evil monsters or places of terror. The Motorcycle Diaries encourages travel and culture whilst promoting the little things like keeping a journal of the travels and managing the money you have. The tell you to keep your eyes open when you are abroad; talk to the locals if you can speak the language and discover what they're local situation is. There is a couple looking for work about half way through the film who are startled when they discover Ernesto and Alberto are travelling just for the sake of it: "Bless you" one of them says.Then there is the political message that arrives within the film. The film likes its establishing shots of 'Chile, 1952' or 'Peru, 1952' with small towns that look less than desirable to live in to say the least. Then you realise nothing much has changed and it's not as if they've dressed the towns up to look like it's fifty years ago because it was all shot in 2004 and remains the same now. The scenes to do with unemployment and particularly the salt mine employment scene are more than enough to suggest the characters will have at least seen something humbling on their journey. The scariest thing is when you ask yourself the question: 'How many of these people are actually playing themselves? Be it 1952 or 2004.' Be it either, the characters still seem to be talking to the camera and The Motorcycle Diaries still makes its point while delivering on top of a great film experience.</fullReview>

My issue is more with how Hollywood has portrayed Ernesto 'che' Guevara. They've romanticized the idea of Che and I'm not really sure if people get the full picture of who he really was. I will say this much, this film did a wonderful job at barely hinting at who Che really was... I give it a 5. The film was well made but in the end idealizing this murderer of thousands of people unnerves me. Idealist? Revolutionary? I disagree.

		<fullReview>Ernesto and Alberto are two young men setting out on a hazardous journey that will test their friendship, maturity and beliefs. This coming-of-age road movie is less a study of one revolutionary's life and more an account of one man's journey to his life's calling, a man who happens to become a revolutionary. There is humour, pathos and humanity in all its glory and pettiness. Salles said he wanted to focus more on the relationship between the two young men than take a hindsight view of how Che Guevara came to be. That decision alone is a masterclass in biographical film-making. This is a film to revel in even with no knowledge of who one of the protagonists will turn out to be. Episodic, insightful, affecting, moving, very funny, and shot with breathtaking panache revealing glorious South American panoramas. An instant classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Think of it as the ultimate Road Movie set in 1951-52, with increasingly wise and serious intentions. This is apparently the true story of two best friends, who decide to take off on an old 39 Norton motorcycle and travel their continent of South America. They begin as young men out to have a good time, party, and explore until its time to return home, finish their educations, and become responsible adults. We are privy to their slow, accidental, mile-by-mile growth towards wisdom and their humanity. It's a beautiful, insightful, funny, sad, politically-charged film about events that can change a person forever in this case, Che Guevera. I suspect the story is at times very romanticized, especially since it is a Latino film about an established, Iconized hero of "Revolution", and, in its epilogue, makes it clear suspicion and anger remain about the U.S. CIA, though nothing in the film has any links to these later years. The bottom line is it's a GOOD story, using "the road" as both literal &amp; symbolic representation of emotional and intellectual maturation in the spirit of Siddhartha but grounded in earthly involvement instead of detachment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walter Salles jumped on screen with his simplistic piece "Central Station", a personal, humane gem. "The Motorcycle Diaries" is mainly a vibrating road trip with the figure of El Che Guevara (a simple and quiet Bernal, who doesn't fit into the spirit of the revolutionary) and a his friend Alberto Granado, a dynamic Rodrigo De la Serna.The script doesn't present the figure of Guevara as good or bad, and doesn't apply on historical accuracies or into ideological streams. "El Che" and his companion Alberto Granado are just friends traveling, friends in the dry yet breathtaking paradises on Southern America; and on their trip they share genuine friendship values. Talk about a good message.It also has some excellent comedy moments, that are stimulating to the story. The photography seems antique but is just classic, showing all what is needed to envelop us into the story.A beautiful story, zero political. You will feel touched, just hop on the motorcycle and enjoy the trip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good travelogue, simplistic biography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Che Guevara was a year away from his medical degree in 1952 when he and his friend Alberto Granado decided to mount an old Norton motorcycle and head off from Buenos Aires on an 8000 mile road trip to Venezuela via Chile, Peru, and Columbia. Their motivations were no more significant that those of thousands of young people seized by wanderlust. Along the way they encounter many examples of hardship, poverty, and sickness, most of which are presented as the result of the rich victimizing the poor. These experiences had a powerful transformative effect on Guevara and led him to have an early vision of a unified South America to be accomplished by armed revolution.The movie is supposedly based on Che's diaries so we assume that the basic facts are correct. However, Che is presented as your typical idealistic young man with not much to distinguish him from millions of others. And young people the world over encounter injustice and abuse of power but are not moved to foment armed revolution. I wanted to know what personal qualities that Che had in his formative years that set him on his path, but we don't get that here. He was obviously intelligent and must have been powerfully charismatic but, as good an actor as Gael Bernal is, I never got a hint of what made Guevara special. There have been many non-violent revolutionaries, so why armed revolution? What led Guevara to that? Even his speech on leaving the leper colony was less than rousing. Maybe I am unfairly judging this film based on some knowledge of what Che was to become, but absent that knowledge this movie is about nothing more that a couple of buddies taking to the road.We are treated to some beautifully filmed sequences along the way that make for a good travelogue and the musical score by Gustavo Santaolalla provides appropriate emotional content.There are a lot of bothersome details. I doubt that the motorcycle, beat-up to begin with, could have withstood the number of crashes we see and, in particular, I don't believe it would have started right up after being immersed in water. Che and Alberto may have been strong young men, but their pushing a heavy motorcycle for miles through foot-deep snow while being dressed rather sparely was a bit of a stretch. There was no indication that attention was being paid to personal hygiene which I believe would have made the pair a little less attractive to the women than portrayed. And Che's swimming across the Amazon while suffering a major asthmatic attack was hard to believe. These are minor details, but if such events are exaggerated, what are we to believe of the story itself?The quotes from Che's diaries are quite eloquent. One always wonders how much to believe what one with such talent writes - autobiography is often self-serving and this film certainly gives us a pristine and idealistic image of Guevara who must, even in his youth, been more interesting and complex than what we see here. I would like a sequel to this film, since it would almost certainly have to be more interesting and insightful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tell me why this film is rated "R"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to see this movie with my grandson, aged 14? Would this be inappropriate. It will soon be leaving my area and he has expressed some desire to see it. I'm not too concerned with the language but how much sexuality is contained in this? Is it graphic? Please help! I don't know anyone who has seen this movie. I do know something about the later years, when he was a revolutionary. I'd like to discover who he was before this occurred. I've read the reviews on this database and can't find any reference to why it is rated "r". Is there violence? Would someone get back to me asap since I'd like to see it tomorrow. If it is unacceptable for a 14 year old, I'll try and find him something else to do while I go see it. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moving and effective road movie....(not commie propaganda!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a shame that some people cannot allow themselves to enjoy this movie because Che Guevara later in his life became a "Commie", etc.This is a wonderful road movie, a true journey is all senses of the word. It's utterly beautiful, the scenery alone is enough to want you to grab a backpack and travel to South America.You could just as easily block out who's in the film and focus instead on it being a funny and moving road movie about two young men, who start off as fun and fancy free kids and end up as thoughtful adults. The most effective part of this film, though, is that you can see the seeds of Che Guevara's later ideas and energies being planted in his head. You can see his growth and transformation from kid to adult before your eyes and kudos to Gael Garcia Bernal for his terrific performance.It's so naive to dismiss this beautiful film because your own McCarthyist politics won't allow you to.This is one of the best films I've seen in ages. And I'm no Communist. Just a lover of good movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly Entertaining Road Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the injustices observed during a lengthy trip from Buenos Aires to Caracas profoundly changed Ernesto "Che" Guevara, there is little evidence on screen of what caused this shift in his outlook and destiny in the film "Motorcycle Diaries," which is based on both Guevara's account of the trip in the early 1950's and that of his traveling companion. Although a sequence depicting the treatment of miners and several scenes in a hospital for lepers illustrate the lives of the downtrodden and outcast, most of the film concentrates on the difficulties of the trip. Ernesto and his friend, Alberto, struggle with a decrepit motorcycle, snowstorms, lack of food, forbidding terrain, and a shortage of money as they cross Argentina, travel north through Chile, and into Peru. However, rather than focus on the injustices that apparently affected Guevara so deeply, the film spends much time on Alberto's ongoing goal to bed a girl in each town that they visit. Alberto appears to have been a fun-loving, skirt-chasing, charmer who was in love with life, which makes his eventual choice difficult to accept. Guevara, on the other hand, consistently comes across as the more serious of the two traveling companions, although his conversations with the people that they encounter rarely go deep enough to convince the viewer that he has been moved by their words or their fates. Unfortunately, the movie, which has been filmed against some of the most spectacular scenery in South America, does not work as a travelogue either. The cinematography, at least in the print seen by this viewer, was mushy and dull at best. South America appeared to be consistently cloudy and gray, and even Machu Picchu, easily one of the world's great sites, failed to look enticing. Having traveled through South America and seen many of the film's locations, this viewer was particularly disappointed with the visuals, which did not evoke any interest in return visits to this places. Although the cinematographer does not deserve a bow, the art director should be given credit for dressing the streets of several South American towns with vintage cars, costumes, and posters to convincingly evoke the early 1950's. However, despite the unconvincing politics and personal motivations and the lack of visual excitement, there are two good reasons to see "Motorcycle Diaries," Gael Garcia Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna. The two leads are attractive, talented actors who make the most of a mediocre script and bring the two young men to life. Without these two performers, "Motorcyle Diaries" would be laborious to sit through; with them, the film nearly overcomes its deficiencies and is well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought provoking presentation of the early adult life of both men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was a moving reconstruction of the stories set down by Ernesto and Alberto. Dramatizations such as this are useful in tempting all of us to investigate the facts that surround the story and the production. Depending on your political biases these two men can surface in history as heroes or villains, so personal perspective might influence viewers to cast both characters in the light of such prejudices. I lived through the later period when Ernesto became a watchword for Marxist-Leninist revolutionary movements around the globe. His press, at least in this country,was less than flattering and our fear of the Red Menace was a daily precept of US life. This movie's sympathetic portrayal of the men and their ideals, will encourage me to give their lives a new inspection and, perhaps, to view both of them in a different light.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is superbly shot, and the whole atmosphere of the surroundings and locations used are enough to make this movie watchable the whole way through. What adds to this is the superb acting by both bernal and la serna. This film is both funny at times,..and also quite sad and makes you reflect on what Che was thinking about when he travelled the diverse land of South America. This film feels real and fresh, and makes you believe you are on this road trip with them. It shows the beginning thought patterns of che Guevara, and shows how this trip planted the seed which turned him into the revolutionary he became. the only thing that drags the film down a bit is the the fact that perhaps not enough things happen, however this is a minor complaint considering it is based upon the actual diaries of Guevara and his mate. Overall, good solid acting, Bernals best i believe, superb direction and cinematography, and a well rounded film. 4/5</fullReview>

Ernesto (Che) Guevarawas an interesting and influential man - this is about his political development, from innocent medical student setting out for adventure on a motorcycle with his friend, to a more mature and wordly activist with more revolutionary ideas about the way the people should be treated.The time passes quickly as the story is told. It's sentimental but not overly so. The fact that it''s based on a true story is also a hook.

		<shortDescription>Though superbly acted and beautifully shot, "The Motorcycle Diaries" hits all the same political buttons we've seen before.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Motorcycle Diaries" has been one of the most lauded films in recent months, and the majority of that praise has bearing. Its story is a risky, questionable one; it details the early days of Ernesto (later, Che) Guevara's life and his coming to feel for the poor. But it is handled expertly by acclaimed director Walter Salles with a style that is unique, creative, and inviting.Friends Ernesto and Alberto, both medical students, embark on a long excursion of a journey from Argentina to Peru on a 1939 Norton motorcycle to help at leper colonies and aid the very ill. As with many road trip movies, their means of transportation becomes a definite partner for their trip. They drive at breakneck speeds, crash in mud, holler obscenities, repack their belongings, and start again. We get a sense that these men are tied together by the motorcycle and by their cooperative visions for a better future.The film is done in a slice-of-life, episodic fashion that is not completely necessary yet never superfluous. Salles uses this technique to great advantage; whenever the two adventurers make a stop at an inhabited location, words at the bottom of the screen tell us how far they have traveled, the location they have reached, and the date. It makes us feel like we are part of this expedition; that careful attention to money, time, and belongings can't simply be discounted, and that these factors are actual, necessary characters for the film to work. But even more importantly, Ernesto and Alberto learn something about their world, each other, and themselves every time they sit down and contemplate.Many critics, including Roger Ebert, have stated a belief that Ernesto and Alberto are 'flat,' 'undeveloped' characters. While the theme of enlightenment during long-distance travel has been done before, and isn't something terribly new, we can look beyond that aspect and examine the young men on their own. Alberto is a sight to see; he is charismatically foul-mouthed, funny when it is appropriate, and an all-around schemer. In one of Ernesto's many voice-overs, he says the success of their trip and their continual source of food, gasoline, and shelter was largely due to 'Alberto's impeccable B-S'ing'. (It is worth noting that Ernesto's voice-overs comprise some of the best aspects of the film; they are real excerpts from his letters to his mother while on the road and fill us with poetic imagery.) Naturally, Ernesto is far more intriguing. After all, his is the grizzled, blazing-eyed mug we would see on countless T-shirts after he had been assassinated. Stories about the 'early life' of famous pop icons are popular and ubiquitous: why else would Biography still be playing on A&amp;E and have such an enormous patronage? But what makes this different is that we don't see the same character at the age of 20 as the one we all know about at forty. Ernesto possesses an eloquent tongue and an ability to connect with people, but he's a mess with the ladies (and with his starved-for-attention girlfriend), he suffers from awful asthma attacks, and he argues with Alberto over all sorts of things. If we were to watch a special on, say, John Travolta, we would observe a young boy who had always loved the theater and who always wanted to be an actor and those sorts of things. Films like "The Motorcycle Diaries", in which an experience produces all the change or makes all the difference, interest us much more."The Motorcycle Diaries" is absolutely gorgeous. Some of the cinematography and landscapes are stunningly breathtaking, but Salles employs useful techniques on small scales, as well. The natives whom Ernesto and Alberto help are often shot in black-and-white photography, suggesting a state of memory. They stare at the screen for almost too long and cause us to meditate on their shabby conditions. It is in these scenes that "The Motorcycle Diaries" takes an overtly political stand, a commentary on the painful abuses that can come from uninhibited capitalism. These hardened faces are portraits of these abuses.Only in the film's final minutes does it become boringly pro-Che and pro-Communist. We can't blame Salles; this is liberal Hollywood and whenever Hollywood makes social statements it makes such errors. Upon a black screen, blood-red text defends the wonderful Che Guevara and the cause he fought for after he and Alberto had parted ways. This, of course, is absurd; Che was a guerrilla leader who loved the idea of a unified America but didn't care for the rights or individuality of those who inhabited it. Just look at what Castro has been doing for decades in the name of 'the common man.'This is the film's only blatant fault. And, impressively enough, it stays relatively far from glorifying Che himself, never worships his violent future, and keeps distant from pathetic, ultra-sentimentalized themes. Rather, "The Motorcycle Diaries" is concerned with the people, the actions, and the changes involved in Che Guevara's life, and delivers in flying colors.My star rating: *** (Three out of four possible stars.)</fullReview>

Che guevara grew up on this trip and changed him forever. He was a person trying to stand up for the poor. This film is great filled with comedy and drama. This is a perfect mix of the two it was great i loved it. I loved the performances of the two actors besides the fact that Gael garcia played cheguevara and he is Mexican me as a argentinean he had me believing that he was argentinean with a perfect accent. De La serna has a great heartfelt and comedic performance and almost steals the show from his co-star. Can I say Oscar best picture actor supporting actor directing and adapted screenplay.

		<shortDescription>A Well-Portrayed Friendship (minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Motorcycle Diaries is an all-around great film. It's a revelatory look at the people and landscapes that make up South America. It's absolutely gorgeous, and I loved the soundtrack as well. The heart of the film is the relationship between two great friends, a young Che Guevara and Alberto Granada. It is a beautiful relationship to watch unfold over the course of their journey. They joke to each other about getting laid and they get in spats about trivial matters. But you come to understand the deep trust between these friends, which is vividly portrayed in the silent moments they have alone with each other in the latter half of the film. They can communicate without speaking, which means when they do speak, it is in the trusting monotone that only close souls can share. At one point, Che rhetorically ponders the horrendous poverty they have seen on their journey. Alberto just looks him in the eyes and says "yes," his face communicating the understanding, not the word. This film does a better job of capturing the nuances of friendship than any film I have seen in a long time. Some people may complain that it glorifies Guevara, but I think dir. Walter Salles is rather deft. Guevara is honest (sometimes to a fault) throughout the entire film (with one humorous exception), so it doesn't seem preachy when the film ends with a breathtaking montage of all the people Guevara has met on the journey. In other circumstances, this might be considered corny. But thanks to Guevara's honesty, we KNOW that these people have changed him, so we see them through his eyes. As a result, the effect is quite powerful. One final note: this movie is very funny, especially the first half of the film, as the two novice travelers bumble around Patagonia and Southern Chile. The emotional honesty at the end of the film makes the comedy all the more satisfying. I left the theater with a warm feeling in my belly -- a feeling like I got to know two new people and the place from where they came. I don't know if a film has ever made me feel that before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, MOTORCYCLE DIARIES is a right good film (reserving judgment about "superb) but it is more than a "road movie" as fascinating as it is, filmed "on location(s)" most of which I have never visited. The film is a decent attempt to relate an important episode in the young lives of both Granado and Guevara destined for important historical roles.A few years ago I read the new door-stopper of the latter's biography. All the incidents/ places were in it, although I cannot recall the night time incident in the Amazon. There were so many witnesses that it must be true. The book was also "shy" on Guevara's insecurity with the opposite sex while young, that part no doubt coming from the more wild Granado. A coupe of pretty amusing incidents were left out, one in particular about their accidentally voiding from a second storey window on a farmer's peach drying platform. They bloody well had to run for it!In any case, this is a fine picture and not just for those consumed with the cult of "Che" or those of tender years who wonder about the man behind the famous revolutionary portrait. They were odd, crazy lads and those males of us far into middle age are bound to be a mite humbled by their adventures and big dreams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: mild spoilersMotorcycle Diaries contains some thoughtful and vibrant writing, although a few spots are a bit weak or overly sentimental. The cinematography is evocative, beautiful, and treats the landscapes appropriately. But there is an underbelly to this movie: it strives too much to be fashionable, as a corollary to the current popularity of the "Che" brand. With it some of the intellectual opportunities in this film are lost. There is little exploration of actual history, current events, or political discourse. Ernesto's character is similarly kept above a certain depth; he doesn't have as much human personality as that of his buddy Alberto. I can think of a couple of reasons why this might have been so: mainly, they hinge on the idea of "accessibility" to an audience caught up in the Che-wave. A less developed personality allows a broader cross-section of fashionably progressive liberal-arts-college students to "relate" to Ernesto, therefore enjoying the movie *that* much more.Also, parts of the plot do not resolve themselves, as though the viewer is supposed to infer that the characters have decided one thing or another for such-and-such a reason. Because Ernesto and Alberto presumably undergo profound character changes throughout the course of their journey, this is particularly important. And I'm scratching my head about the subplot involving Ernesto's relationship with Chichina. I'm wondering whether it was played up for effect, and I'm also wondering why Ernesto's "undying" love for her did not carry through to a conclusion. Oh well.Despite these gripes (many of which are minor in the larger scope of things), I liked this movie. I'd recommend it to almost anyone: whether artistically or through its statement of respect and equality for the poor and indigenous, it is a movie from which just about everybody can take away something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful road movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Diarios de Motocicleta" is a basic road movie. You see the characters and their friendships develop as the road takes you. The difference here is the main character is -now pop-culture icon- Ch Guevara. The objective of the film is to take us to a journey where we see young Ch transform from a naive medical student to a revolutionary leader. It is a very simple, but pretentious objective that can't be fulfilled entirely with a movie like this.Where the movie succeeds is in the journey itself. As we see the world of this film, the audience gets the transformation Ch is supposed to have. Every scene is beautifully shot, and actually makes you fall in love with South America. The story is tender and as unpolitical as it can get when it comes to Ch. Rodrigo de la Serna is a scene stealer that deserves an Oscar nomination. About the film? I don't know if the U.S. as a country can participate in the Best Foreign Film category (this movie is American produced), but it'll be a good contender along with "La Mala Educaci蚤".There are some scenes in this movie I can see where Ch is coming from. His ideals were a bit ahead of his time. Then again, several years after his dead, when Chile's Salvador Allende became the first communist leader democratically elected (yes, readers, communism and democracy in the same sentence) it seemed Latin America was ready for a change. The change never happened. Allende was killed in a C.I.A.-backed military coup that put dictator Pinochet in power. The same America that now preaches the joy of democracy in the Middle East backed brutal dictatorships in Latin America.That saintly Ch, who couldn't lie (and couldn't dance) had the ideal of a Latin America off the shadow of its big neighbor from the North. It's true that in order to defy the U.S. he helped settle an oppressive government in a Caribbean nation, but look at Jesus H. Christ who, like Ch, walked among the lepers. His ideals spawned the Church that has been responsible of countless atrocities throughout history. In that perspective, Ch may have been the Second Coming of Christ.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Innocent in it's political intent. In fact, devoid of everything you might pre-conceptually believe this movie to be about. In essence, what we have here is one of the best road movies ever made. Exploring the common themes of road movies; Journey (would you believe?), adventure and self-discovery (often found at it's greatest in road-movies, that stark contrast to external discovery exemplifies the discovery of ones self, I suppose).The film is a subtle one, yet emotional. The film doesn't once try to manipulate drama or emotion in even the most obvious scenes. Instead, Gael Garc眼 Bernal, one half of the terrible twosome that sexualised everything they did in 'Y Tu Mama Tambien', is given the burden of carrying the dramatic weight. And doesn't fail for a second.As the credits rolled, I realized that I was surprised by what I had witnessed, this film, a film that was likely to be very good but with indulgent touches of preachiness and ugly amounts of pretence, was in fact a VERY good film that had the power to move me without obvious conventional manipulation or the political corruptness at hand.The film was made in the best possible way. It cannot be more than 8/10, but that is more to do with the limitations of this type of story. However, I'd still consider this (alongside 'Eternal Sunshine OF The Spotless Mind' and the US/UK release of 'Hero') to be one of the films of the year.</fullReview>

He reminds me of a young Giancarlo Giannini, not only in looks but also for the character Giannini played so memorably in "The Seduction of Mimi" and in other films that followed.

		<shortDescription>Interesting look at the travels of a young Guevara</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen this film and your expecting to walk in and view an accurate depiction of a young Che Guevara than please note that this is not what you'll see. Instead, this film offers some truly indelible images that would make an impact on Guevara's psyche and lead him on the road to being an infamous revolutionary. Story starts in Argentina where in 1952 Ernesto Guevara de la Serna (Gael Garcia Bernal) and his friend Alberto Granada (Rodrigo De la Serna) have packed their bags onto an old 1939 motorcycle with a plan to travel through South America from Argentina to Peru. Ernesto is a medical student while Alberto is a biochemist and while on their travels they use this to get jobs and/or food and shelter.*****SPOILER ALERT*****As the two travel they stop in and see Ernesto's girlfriend Chichina (Mia Maestro) who tells him that she loves him and will wait for him but not for long. They continue to move on and their motorcycle crashes several times until it ultimately becomes useless and now alternate uses of travel must be used but the two of them are broke and ask for help from the kindness of strangers. They take a boat, they walk, and they hitch rides on trucks until they end up staying with a doctor who puts in a good word for them to work in a leper colony. There they help out the medical staff and nuns that run the facility and Ernesto makes an immediate impact on everyone there but what really affects him are the stories of workers that are mistreated from one country to another.This film is directed by Walter Salles (Behind the Sun, Central Station) and I can't think of a bigger compliment than to say that as I watched this I was at times thinking I was viewing a film by the great Werner Herzog. The purpose of the film is for the viewer to witness the haunting images that Guevara saw for the first time as a young man because what he saw shaped him into becoming such an infamous figure in history. The strength of the film comes from not only the poor faces from different countries but from the lush and harsh terrain that they travel through. The part of the film that clearly doesn't work is the uneven portrayal of Guevara that is played by Bernal who is just to sympathetic and warm. Bernal is actually very good in this film if your not thinking about the person he's portraying but it's hard to imagine that the real Guevara was anything like what Bernal is playing. Luckily, we can oversee some of this as this story is supposed to take place before Guevara became a historical figure and we can concentrate on the beautiful shots and visuals. This is an incredible film to view in terms of cinematography and scenery and Salles and his crew have splendidly brought to the screen a part of the world that is rarely seen. Though the film doesn't work in terms of a biography is does serve it's purpose to make the viewer understand why Guevara was forever changed with what he saw and encountered in his travels and that's the primary reason I'm recommending it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall I liked this movie but the lack of realistic representations of the subjugated people Guevara and Granado encountered on their journey through South America left me unsettled. Glossed over identification of the evil doers didn't help either, "rich people", "The Spaniards" were not poignant enough to convey the true weight of their influence. At no point were any governments mentioned which at the time and still today is the achilles heel to freedom and justice of most countires in Latin America. I can understand why this movie did not delve into politics but not mentioning it at all in the seminal story of "Che Guevara" is unacceptable.Great acting however, and wonderful imagery of some of the most beautiful landscape and people on earth. My only guess as to why this movie lacked an edge to it was to appeal to a much larger audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Become a spiritual companion on the ride of a lifetime.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cocktail of motorcycle, youth, idealism, and the open road is spirit altering even for the most densely macho man. But that 'drink' in the hands of 24-year-old Ernesto 'Che' Guevara (Gael Garcia Bernal, 'Y Tu Mama Tambien') and 30-year-old Alberto Granado (Rodrigo De la Serna), the former an almost medical doctor and the latter a pharmacist, is transformation to shake the world. Most notably, in 'Motorcycle Diaries,' a new film based on his recollections, the introverted Che gradually sees in the 7500-mile trek from Argentina to Venezuela the 'injustice' to peasants, culminating in the insight that 'life is pain.'This picaresque through South America is exhilarating: sometimes you see the motorcycle tumbling amid the beauty of mountains and desert and other times you linger with hand-held tightness on the changing landscape of Che's beautiful face. This is, after all, the boy who would be rebel, the future iconic leader of the Cuban Revolution, who was subsequently assassinated in South America with the help of the CIA. I now anxiously await the film with Benicio Del Toro as director Terence Malick's 'Che.'Director Walter Salles ('Central Station') doesn't apotheosize Che just yet; he lets the boy survey women and miners and all sorts of peasants and lepers until their plight becomes his, until he forsakes the pleasures of youthful abandon for the nobility of service to humanity. When he refuses to wear symbolic gloves in the leper colony, that small rebellion is emblematic of a leader who will not compromise the integrity of the people he serves. However, Salles never lets his characters slip into caricatures of sacrificing humanists, for Alberto remains a hedonist who won't fully find his altruist self until he founds a hospital in honor of Che years hence, and Che himself narrowly escapes the wrath of a husband who realizes Che is after his wife.That's the inevitable scenario for any lengthy journey of a young person. My own 6000-mile round-trip motorcycle tour from Ohio to Alberta by way of Montana revealed landscapes and kindnesses I never believed existed, and they remain in my imagination. 'Motorcycle Diaries' is only half about the challenge of riding and losing 'The Mighty One,' as the cycle is called; it is mostly about becoming mighty for yourself, finishing your life's journey by foot among people whom you change forever. The name 'Che' today echoes with sacrifice and a journey well taken. No one should be surprised to see Robert Redford's name as executive producer-there's another name of someone who cares. Go with them in this movie and become a spiritual companion on the ride of a lifetime. Wordsworth, a wanderer himself, knew the conjunction of wisdom, humility, and humanism: 'Give unto me, made lowly wise/ The spirit of self-sacrifice.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully populist, lamentably Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film cannot decide whether it wants to be a piece of gritty populist verit or a Hollywood style hero-as-boy pic. There are some wonderful scenes of young Ch and Alberto among the people, and some great montage sequences in which the common mestizo is front and center. These moments are punctuated by short bursts of Hollywood (e.g. a scene where Ernesto swims the Amazon - shot and cut in a very Hollywood fashion with rapid cuts back and forth across the river, closeups of Ernesto struggling, etc.) All in all the screenplay is just a little too Hollywood for a film about the quintessential revolutionary. The film also lacks any clear trajectory on the part of the characters. They don't develop. They realize things, but they don't appear to change. The fault lies in the screenplay. It wastes too much time cobbling together simplistic narratives and devotes too little time and effort into providing the actors with a way to show the characters en route from one state of mind and heart to another. Che would soon become the archetype of the angry young revolutionary, yet the Guevara we see is something like a dark and sexy St. Francis. The only anger we see is a single stone tossed at a truck picking up day laborers. The only thing that seems to change from Buenos Aires to Caracas are a few ideas and the landscape. This is nonetheless a very good film for the job the actors do with the script they have to work with, and for Salles's and his editor's great pacing. It's a gorgeous film with beautiful landscapes and beautiful vignettes of the common man. It's a great feel-good piece of populist film-making. It is just not a very searching or profound look into the life, mind or soul of the icon at its center. It's good, but it could have been so much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film to be easy going, enjoyable and beautifully shot at times. However, I could never fully believe that Gael Garcia Bernal was Che Guevara, he just did'nt achieve it for me. I could'nt suspend my disbelief as I watched him, perhaps still remembering his excellent performances in Amores Perros and Y tu mama tambien. But for me he just did nt seem right for the part. I expected someone totally different to play Che. Despite this his sidekick, played by Rodrigo De La serna, was incredible he performed his role of the affable ladies man extremely well.As someone who has read some of Che Guevara's political writings I felt betrayed by the 'mainstream cinematic' way his political development was dealt with. We did'nt really see the immense building up of his social consciousness and beliefs that would lead him to dedicate his life to aiming at changing the inequalities of South America. It was all very tame and appeared to be made to appeal to a wide spectrum of cinema audience who did nt want to come out of the movie wanting to know about inequalities, poverty, and Che's political thinking, but instead to have a smile on their face and a feeling of satisfaction.I'm sure his motorcycle diaries included many political thoughts and ideas which this film ignored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Motorbike Memories, or the Unbearable Lightness of Being Che</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The young medical student, Che Guevara and his irrepressible biochemist friend do the latino tour. The journey on motorbike and foot through South America is based on diaries and a book. The harshness of inequality and oppression and a leper colony are deftly muted by the constant comedy of De la Senna's infinitely optimistic Granado and the awe inspiring photography - both moving and still. Those seeking an understanding of Che's early years will be disappointed. Although, with its combination of plausible characterisations and visual images (which sometimes put National Geographic to shame), this is a Latino road movie with a heart and soul.Salles' editing of black and white stills to convey the magic and pain of those situated along the route are exquisitely accompanied by scintillating percussion - used as a prime mechanism for conveying political images and poignancy. In contrast, the script is generally light and easy and fails to provide much substance for the formation of 'Fuser's later political awareness. The leper colony scenes only convey a sense of his warmth and opposition to barriers. Similarly Che's only speech is a brief treatise on South American unity. The movie had the audience I was with smiling and convulsively laughing with human warmth throughout most of its length. Some of the scenes are unforgettable. The backing of Robert Redford and the curious fusion of Brazilian talent result in an accessible if lightweight movie which remains contagiously enjoyable, heartwarming and occasionally moving. Perhaps a little more appropriate darkness and substance with less superficial humour might have conveyed a more significant set of memories.</fullReview>

It's a story about a friendship, about two young men who explore the world. At the end of this adventure and after traveling throughout South America, both choose their own destiny.Actually, I would say that this independent film is more than a road movie. There are moments of deep analysis without being a boring opus, there is a big space for dreams and aims...The film has a very good cinematography and excellent performances of the two actors.

		<fullReview>How long I have waited for a film starring this legendary man... Ernesto 'Che' Guevara.He is the face that covers many a tee-shirt, often worn by people who have little or no knowledge of his life, ambitions and accomplishments. However, I'm not going to go into the details, just that I respect the guy.The film is extraordinarily well acted, which in my opinion is the foundation of a good film. But thats all this seems to be; a foundation.The language and subtitles didn't bother me, but the lack of insight into Che's true emotions is definitely lacking and that does bother me. For anyone interested in this tale of Che and his buddy's journey through S.America on a Motorbike and their many experiences in poverty stricken towns, then I suggest that you read the book, written by them so the emotions and tales are accurately portrayed. The film shows absoloutely stunning places, as well as less attractive but accurate Shanti towns. The landscapes alone make the film worth seeing. I'm glad I have seen this film but still prefer the book I'm many ways.Anyone with an interest in this film or Che should take note that it is his life-altering journey and not his fighting alongside Fidel Castro that is in the film. Anyhow, Id recommend you see it anyway and see what a kind and talented young doctor he was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Motorcycle Diaries is a beautiful film shot against the stunning visual backdrop of the South American continent. It is not only a story about the young Che Guevara on a motorcycle adventure with his friend, Alberto Granado; it is also about the social awakening of the famous revolutionary as he travels from Argentina, into Chile and up into Peru and Colombia. To say that it is shot and directed beautifully is only half the deal. The story is so compelling that even if you know little of Che Guavara's later exploits it still strikes a powerful note. The director, Walter Salles, also makes effective use of still shots of the people who helped stir these passionate feelings within Ernesto de la Serna, as he was named then. It is difficult not feel empathy giving you some understanding as to what drove him on to lead the life he did.And for people who know all there is to know about Che Guevara or nothing whatsoever, it is just a movie about a man with passion and integrity, discovering a bit more of the world around him whilst trying to make a contribution in the only way he can as a trainee doctor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feel-good film about a revolutionary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most dramatic element of this film is the scenery. What the 'The Motorcycle Diaries' achieves is to produce a glossy travel brochure of South America. If this was the aim of the Director, then he should be content. I wanted more.The film follows Che Guevara's journey through South America. He is portrayed as an idealist, his integrity never in question and his goodness almost sickening at times. This is contrasted with his older and more pragmatic friend, Alberto Granado. The struggle between the good and the slightly less good, and the emergence of a social conscience (which Che Guevara clearly already possessed at the onset, making the whole premise of the film thus futile) is displayed in both of the men through comic encounters with the people. Poverty is incidental not tragic. Ordinary people, though poor, are happy. Oh yeah?The excellent acting is spoiled by the weak script and direction of this film. What a missed chance!</fullReview>

It's not just about two young men on an adventure, yes there is that, but I think the script makes it quite clear that there's a lot more to Che than your average middle class backpacker slumming it. And there's a lot more to Latin America than pretty Inca ruins. Now for the fluff - I hate to say it because I always go to see his movies (much to my boyfriend's disgust) but I'm not convinced Bernal is much more acting wise than a nice face.

		<shortDescription>The film as Emotional Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Motorcycle Diaries" (2004) directed by Walter Salles Based on books by the two main characters Che Guevara and Alberto Granados.This film tells the story of two best friends Ernesto Guevara, a medical student with one year still to go, and Alberto, a biochemist and their 8,000 mile trip from Argentina to Peru. The trip was by motorcycle, raft, truck and towards the end mostly by foot. The movie makes viewers encounter many different events with the two main characters that give a very powerful emotional experience. Viewers start of as not knowing much about the characters at the beginning of the film, but as it goes on, the viewers see their real personalities and see them evolve as people, see their lives being shaped and changed by all the events that happen along their trip.All of the elements in the film combine together creating emotions, in most cases touching the heart strings giving feelings of sorrow, sadness, happiness, and understanding.Throughout the whole film you find yourself wrapped around and involved in its reality. For example in cases like the alarming number of times their motorcycle turns over, skids out from under them, careens into a ditch or in one case broadsides a cow. Viewers also get involved by how the camera follows them past transcendent scenery that leads us see forests, plains, high chaparral, deserts, lakes, rivers, mountains, and many, many other spectacular places.The events that occur to them along the way also connect the viewer to reality because they not only show all good stuff happening, or all bad, in fact with the characters you get involved and get to see them in their different personalities like being mad, sad, happy, in love,etc. Their different personalities gives you a chance to connect to one of the other more on the actions of both. For example on how along the way they depend on the kindness of strangers because they're basically broke, and while Ernesto believes in being honest with people, Alberto gets better results by conning them.That shows the reality and the differences of people which happens through our daily lives. The elements in the film such as the acting, the music, the angles the shots, all combine to give you more emotions. For example the close up of the faces showing emotions when they meet a farmer and his wife, who were forced off their land by evil capitalists.Also, the low angles of the sadistic foreman of the day laborers showing his power over his laborers. Within the film the director has poor workers, farmers, miners, peasants, beggars, who pose for the camera, not in still photos, but standing as still as they can, and he uses black and white for these tableaux. This, he says "happens so that we understand they represent memory, and has the effective technique, that we are meant to draw the conclusion that the adult Che would help these people." The most powerful emotional connection you have is probably when Ernesto, weakened by frequent asthma attacks, struggles to swim across the Amazon to spend his 24th birthday with patients at the San Pablo leper colony. The whole movie, all of the elements, the actors and everything combine to make this film one of the most intense films emotionally.Which can lead you to conclude that the director was successful when he said he wanted to find and show "the person behind the icon."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A road trip buddy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoiler/plot- 2004, It's a road trip scenic film across South America that follows two friends, Ernesto (later to be fanatical political "Che") Guevara and Alberto Granado. These two medical school friends travel on the back of an old English Norton 500 motorcycle for a breathtaking and scenic trip experiencing the length and breath of their home continent sites and people.*Special Stars- Gael Garcia Bernal, Rodrigo de la Serna. Dir: Walter Salles. Prod: Robert Redford *Theme- A Communist mass murderer was once an idealistic boy who turned himself into a fanatic revolutionary by experiencing South America's rigid colonial class society and it's poverty.*Based on- Book of the same name.*Trivia/location/goofs- Foreign film. English Subtitles. Shot entirely on locations of the book. The real life Alberto Granado(Still living in Cuba, now deceased) was interviewed and contributed to this project.*Emotion- IMHO: The film is scenic and well made. I wanted to see this film because of all the liberal film hype it has received. It is really a road trip buddy film traveling in South America that involves two upper class immature boys; one an easygoing lovable pharmacist braggart(Granado) and a brooding spoiled medical school drop-out ideologue(Guevara). The venerable motorcycle is scrapped in the first third of the film and the film plot turns to 'class and political' matters. I have many Cuban friends. I am aware of the sick murderous political legacy of "El Che" Guevara. I only wish more people were. I wanted to see how his evolutionary character was treated in this film. This film is packaged to the public in sad dis-ingenuousness and naive hypocrisy. This film and it's plot is advertised without a political mention to "Che" Guevara character being showcased, but in all the live press interviews everyone connected to this film(Including using El Che's living daughter and Alberto Granado) are trying to canonized Saint "Che". I found that extremely dishonest. A man' legacy is his total life, not just his early immature boyhood years. If we do that, Hitler was a nice painter and artist. I don't think so.</fullReview>

It is clear that the making of this movie was quite arduous as the scenes from each new place they visit are real. The viewer is able to truly feel involved in the journey as the men travel we see each new place. A favorite scene is at the Incan ruins in Machu Picchu. Here we see a young Guevara in a beautiful place beginning to develop into the future revolutionary Che that we all know today.

		<fullReview>After the hoopla-hype for this film, I was expecting something really moving and worthy of the historical impact of Che Guevara. While the scenes of the countryside and the mountains were beautiful, and the encounters with people mostly believable, I had a very hard time believing the change in the main characters. Mostly, I didn't believe the star, Gael Garcia Bernal, who seemed way too callow and charismatically inconsequential to handle this role. Throughout the film I kept wishing that the fellow who was playing Alberto Granada, Rodrigo de la Serna, were playing Ernesto.Throughout the film Che and Alberto meet, cheat, eat, dance, and heal the sick. Many scenes are moving, and effectively convey Guevara's sympathy for the indigent, as well as his evolving image of a "just", mestizo pan-America. Nowhere do we get a glimpse of the fire and organizational skill (never mind the charisma) that would propel Che Guevara to revolutionary super-stardom. This is a fault both in the screenplay and in the casting.Much of the film is superficial, with the final, overly long black-and-white takes of the ostensibly miserable proletarians (the clown-eyed drunk with the horse was WAY over the top) sploshing the icing on this ridiculously over-hyped and often boring travelogue-torta. Someone could and should do better with this material. Also, Robert Redford needs to brush his hair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Motorcycle diaries directed by Walter Salles, tells the story of a journey up the South American continent by 2 men, and about the way the people and events that happen, change them both.On paper, this plot sounds like one of those American teen comedies. However this movie is so much more than that. For one of the men will eventually become Che Guevara.The movie, based on books written by Guevara and Alberto Granado, is very well acted by Rodrigo De La Serna as Granado, and especially Gael Garcia Bernal as Guevara. It's easy to see from this, how he's become a respected actor working in Hollywood.The director Walter Salles, and his director of photography Eric Gautier do a wonderful job showing of the the continent, with some stunning imagery. And the music is nice through-out the movie.The reason the movie works is that as the journey progresses you can seen the change happening to both men right up till the end. Unlike most movies of this type, there is no one thing that changes Guevara from young trainee doctor, into the man he will become. The change is the result of the trip itself, as he sees the way the various peoples of the countries suffer, yet still find a way to keep going.Although the 2 leads dominate the movie the supporting cast do very well. I'm not sure how many real actors were used as locals in some scenes, or if they used real people, but the performances are all good.Guevara is a figure I don't actually know that much about. Everyone probably knows the t-shirts or posters of him, but not many may know the man. Although the film doesn't reveal everything about him, it's a fascinating look at a man about to change his destiny, and others around him.A very impressive movie.</fullReview>

I may even purchase, rather than rent, this DVD, my ultimate praise for any movie.I have read many reviews of TMD; although the vast majority are favorable, I am nonetheless surprised and saddened by the tone of the few who did pan it. I think these negative views must be confusing their preconceived notions of who they expect Che Guevera to be, or what a conventional movie must be.TMD is anything but conventional. As it progressed, I had an eerie feeling that every scene, indeed almost every _frame_, was a true work of imaging artistry. I am a professional photographer. I have rarely seen such photographic quality condensed into a movie lasting a couple of hours, as TMD has done. And the music was a beautiful accompaniment to this cinematic / photographic art.All this is totally aside from the political history which forms its backdrop, from the quality of the acting, from the continuity (or lack thereof) of scenes. To me, all this is almost totally irrelevant.As a work of cinematic art, this, in my opinion, is one of the greats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Portrait Of The Revolutionary As A Young Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's doubtful that there's anyone, especially anyone who would go to see "The Motorcycle Diaries", who hasn't heard of Che Guevara. As one of the architects of the Cuban Revolution, he's been praised and pilloried, and his face has been emblazoned across T-shirts and posters throughout the world. But much, if not all, that is generally known about him pertains to his image as a revolutionary, and little else is popularly known about his life, at least in this part of the world. "The Motorcycle Diaries", based on Guevara's journal of a South Ameircan cross-continent trek, offers some, if narrowly limited, insights into this enigmatic man.In 1952, Ernesto Che Guevara, (Gael Garc眼 Bernal), with one semester still to go in medical school, along with his friend, biochemist Alberto Granado (Rodrigo De la Serna), embarked on an 8,000 mile journey of planned-for fun, and unexpected self-discovery. Riding together on an overloaded, underpowered, oil-spewing 1939 Norton 500 motorcycle, their goal was to see as much of the South American countryside as they could (much of which was on foot, after the motorcycle--despite their best efforts at providing mechanical life support--died.) What they found, however, was more than just scenery, as their trek's carefree beginnings gave way to more serious and life-changing events.In "The Motorcycle Diaries", director Walter Salles presents us with a view of Che Guevara which bears little resemblance to the popularly perceived, infamous revolutionary. Instead, we are shown a Guevara who is characterized as a man of principle and ethics; a thinker and devotee of the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda; an asthmatic who shook hands with lepers; a man who acted on his convictions. Young and idealistic, he was struck by the world's injustices that were heaped on the poor, not unlike many others who are empathetic to the plight of the economic and social underclass, and who, too, offer their aid and assistance in all manner of ways. But few have made the emotional, physical and irreversible leap that Guevara did.Certainly, the film may can regarded as a bit of a propaganda piece, and one with a decidedly southern hemisphere spin, as if it were affected by the Coriolus Force. But it's understandable what Mr. Salles is trying to do here. However, were it not for the fact that this diary was that of Che Guevara the film would be little more than a buddy/road film: a South American "Easy Rider", or "The Wild One" without Johnny's rebellious "Whaddya got?" attitude. It's only because of what we know about Che's later life that the film gives any meaningful context to his early years, and without which, the film would be far less interesting.As an early biographical look at Che Guevara, the film does sufficiently well, but it fails to offer a truly complete look at the whole person as it maintains safe distance from the man who is still steeped in controversy. So while the film is purposely and narrowly confined to the events recorded in the diary, it presents a difficult problem for the viewer, who will, I think, try to discover some nugget of information as to what motivated the radical change in Guevara's life. Some of that may be inferred through the stark imagery and haunting faces in a scene of itinerant mine workers waiting--hoping--to be picked for a daily crew despite the known dangers they will face, but the question, though intentionally unanswered by the film, will likely persist.As a stand-alone work, "The Motorcycle Diaries" does offer a rich, visual travelogue of South America; its mountains...its cities...Macchu Pichu; and a wonderfully lyrical musical score as well. And an added bonus is the inclusion of some original photographs of the pair's excursion, shown during the closing credits, and worth staying for. 2004</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>uneven but often fascinating film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1952, a promising young medical student named Ernesto Guevara de la Serna set off on an epic journey that would take him and his buddy, Alberto Granada, from their home in Buenos Aires to the northernmost tip of Venezuela. The things Ernesto saw and the people he met along the way would wind up changing not only his life but the lives of the countless people who were soon to become his followers. For that man would become known to history as 'Che' Guevara, the Marxist revolutionary who, to this day, for good or for ill, remains an iconic figure to many downtrodden and oppressed peoples of the world - and a symbol of Communist tyranny to others."The Motorcycle Diaries" is based on Guevara's own writings about the trip. Even so, the film is never totally successful at showing how this rather modest young man became one of the world's leading revolutionary figures. Although the movie is extremely well made from a technical standpoint, the first half plays like any other road trip movie, chronicling the boys' encounters with various people and their mishaps with the motorcycle. In the second half, however, we begin to see the stirring of a social conscience in Guevara that would become the focal point of all his future activities. As he encounters more and more indigent people suffering at the hands of an indifferent ruling class, Guevara becomes acutely aware of the great divide that exists between wealth and poverty in the world and the great human and social injustice that such a gulf leads to. As a result, the second half of the movie is more interesting than the first. However, even here, something seems to be missing. Is it that we just don't see enough real suffering on the part of the people Guevara encounters? Or is it that Gael Garcia Bernal, fine actor though he is, is simply too passive, too much an observer to convince us that his character would later go on to become such a key mover of world events? This is not to say that "The Motorcycle Diaries" doesn't have moments of great beauty and power, only that it never reveals much to us about the interior workings of the man who is its subject. In addition to the confident directing by Walter Salles and the fluid editing and camera-work, the film has a rich musical score, filled with flavorful Spanish rhythms, provided by Gustavo Santaolalla, who recently won an Academy Award for his even more beautiful work in "Brokeback Mountain." Even 46 years after his death, Guevara still remains a lightning rod for controversy, with as many people lining up to despise him as to honor him. Certainly the Castro revolution in Cuba, in which Guevara played so prominent a part, hardly led to a land of plenty or a life of freedom for the horribly oppressed people there. "The Motorcycle Diaries," because it only covers Guevara's pre-revolutionary years, is able to bypass all that messiness and paint the man in largely glowing and positive terms. Thus, the movie fails to catch the irony of a man who began as a defender of oppressed people eventually helping to install a system in which his own group became the oppressors themselves. A movie on that subject might make for a more searching and pointed film than this one turns out to be, but "The Motorcycle Diaries" still has much to recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not particularly a fan of Che Guevara, I respect his beliefs but I have my own. This movie is entertaining because it is the first time that this part of Che Guevara's life is shown. We had always heard about a trip he made, which marked the beginning of his beliefs, but we never really heard much about it. This movie does a good job at portraying his relationship with his friend, and how his views of the world changed as he traveled further north of America. I only have a few complaints, and those are that even though Gael Garcia does a good job I wish they would have casted someone who was actually from Argentina and didn't have to fake the accent. There is also a very strong biased in the movie. These reasons are why i gave the movie an 8 out of 10. But it is very entertaining and you get to see beautiful landscapes and learn about Che Guevera's life, therefore I suggest everyone to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Youngs Ernesto Guevara and Alberto Granado start a travel around South America with intention to have an adventure experience before Alberto is 30 years old. The trip that starts in Buenos Aires takes two years long, in which they take conscience about the poor and miserable people of the countries they cross. Unexpectedly for them, their travel changes them in a very deep way; making Ernesto to become, some years later, the world-known "Che" Guevara. The film tries to stop and point the main situations that make Ernesto change and become a hero. With a delicious photography and music, we can get astonished by the beautiful places that these adventures arrive. In addition, the interior travel is also well finished, as we can see how the characters change during the film. Touching and interesting, the film is able to approach ourselves to the far figure of the "Che" as a human person, which is difficult, but, as we can see, possible. On the other hand, despite Gael is a good actor, I think he was not the best for the part and this has disappointed me a little, in the same way, much times the film results a bit slow, which has made that I could not enjoy the film at all. The film is good, but I miss something (a bit more rhythm, maybe), so I have not liked it at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The origins of a revolutionary heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early 1950s two young Argentinians venture on the road on a very shabby motorbike. Both young men are medical students. The film follows them as they unveil the rich and complex human and social topography of the Latin American continent With a highly romantic sense of adventure, they both leave their familiar surroundings in Buenos Aires on a motorbike that eventually breaks down. But they press onward hitching rides on the way as they begin to see a different Latin America in the people they meet on the road, the diverse geography they encounter begins to reflect their own shifting perspectives. They continue all the way to far out Machu Picchu, where the majestic ruins and the extraordinary significance of the Inca heritage have a profound impact on the young men. As they arrive at a leper colony deep in the Peruvian Amazon, they both begin to question the value of progress as defined by economics systems that leave so many people beyond their reach. Their experiences at the colony awaken within them the men they will later become by defining the ethical political journey that will take place later on in their lives. Based on the journals of both Alberto Granado and his friend Ernesto Guevara the man who would later become 'El Che'. The Motorcycle diaries follows a journey of self-discovery, tracing the origins of a revolutionary heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can you make a movie and pay respect to so a charismatic character? A character so loved and hated, so intense, so... Che. First of all -before making a more complete comment- the music of Gustavo Santaolalla is magnificent, brilliant part of the movie never mentioned, important to the movie and great. Now, not having a political stand is great for the movie, 'cause it attracts people with practically any political ideology. Che inspires everything a human being should be (regardless of his ideas and whether you think he was too extreme or centered), compassion, rage to injustice, and above all solidarity. Gael is not perfect, but who can blame him he's Mexican and Che well Che is from Argentina, so about the accent... cut the crap he did the best he could. The movie has a nice rhythm, I never got bored at least. The essential part of the movie for me is to see the transformation of a man driven by injustice and creating in his head an idea of what is right and what is just wrong. Finally, since the movie doesn't take a political stand, it's message is that you can be a revolutionarie no matter what your ideology is, if you could see injustice in front of your eyes, there's a lot that you can do to change it. "Prefiero morir de pie, que vivir de rodillas", (I'd rather die on my feet, than live on my knees), famous quote of Ernesto Guevara, reminding everybody that we got to fight for what we believe in till' the end.

You say 'no change' and accept the consequences and live with the knowledge that you are that type of person - or you can direct your life in such a way to make things better.You might not agree with communism as a political method, but with this film - you have to be a particularly cold-hearted individual not to empathise with at least some of the principles which forms its basis.I have watched many, many films in my life - and this ranks no. 1. Not since 'Sophie's Choice' have I been so moved by a film. This is one film everyone should watch - it should be taught in schools. Not that the US would ever allow such 'radical' philosophy be taught.

		<shortDescription>Che - from 50s backpacker to revolutionary via a wondrous motorcycle trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Walter Salles (Central Station), The Motorcycle Diaries is a visually and emotionally striking film which follows the young Ernesto Che Guevara and his friend Alberto Granado in their travels around Latin America in 1952. Just six years later, and partially inspired by this road trip, Che would lead Cuba to revolution. Adapted from the book "Con el Che por America Latina" by Guevara and Granado (who remained lifelong friends), The Motorcycle Diaries begins in Argentina. Ernesto is an idealistic final-year medical student and Alberto is a hedonistic biochemist. Together they clamber on a dilapidated motorcycle and attempt to circumnavigate South America ? the journey of a lifetime.At first, the two are reprobates ? charming food and motorcycle repairs out of the locals, and sleazing on the women. (It's here that Ernesto's first called Che ? a name given to Argentineans by other Latin Americans.) But as their journey continues and their pace slows, Che and Alberto begin to see more of the injustices perpetrated against indigenous South Americans. One of the most powerful demonstrations of this is their boat journey in Peru. While our heroes socialise in relative luxury with other passengers of European origin on the ship, a rusty barge follows which carries the indigenous passengers ? crowded on hammocks beneath an open canopy. Although the two's transition from rascals to socialists is well handled, the film becomes less subtle in its latter stages. The 126 minutes running time also becomes noticeable at this time, particularly at the leper colony. Charismatic young actor Gael Garc眼 Bernal (Y tu mama tambien) is well-cast as Che, and the humorous rapport between him and Alberto (Rodrigo De la Serna) gives the perfect foreground to Eric Gautier's stunning cinematography. I particularly liked the grainy photography and the heightened use of colour, though the footage did get a bit choppy at times. While you can appreciate The Motorcycle Diaries simply as a travel film, it's more than that. It illuminates the apartheid existing in Latin America at the time through Che and Ernesto's encounters with market sellers, impromptu tour guides and disenfranchised families. Screenwriter Jose Rivera is also careful to differentiate between the various ethnicities which comprise Latin American indigenous culture ? which is highlighted by the final montage of black and white images of all that fuelled Che's revolutionary fever. 3? stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike some movies which I keep looking at the time to see when it will actually end, this movie is almost two hours long, I did not get bored sitting there for such a long time.It is like a working class movie. It got my particular attention when the young guy suggested that there should be a united America which is quite interesting. Now these days, Europe has EU, probably one day, there will be indeed a United America.it also made me wonder if anyone can make a similar movie about someone travel cross country in the US? That would also be interesting to watch. US is also a diverse place.I have heard about the old movie with the same title, but it was an old movie. So I never got the interest to watch the old one. I think that this one is probably at least as good as the old one.After watching the movie, it made me realize that we are all just people. No matter we are, we all have feelings, what a small world.At last, even though this movie is more about working class people, the two main characters are actually typical well educated guys with some money in the pocket.</fullReview>

This movie was like a first episode of Ernesto Guevaras life, hopefully some producer sees this opportunity and makes a follow-up with same actors. Myself got so interested after this film, about how this good lad Ernesto became a fearful Che Guevara, that I had to buy a book about him. And after that I now have read the book, I like the movie even more! I believe that the movie describes the events like they really happened. Guevara was a person that took to action when normal people only had a dream about doing something. That was something that was seen also in this movie, how many would make a trip around a continent, without having a penny in your pocket?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but flawed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this film were about anyone else I would have happily given it a 10 rating, but since its subject is about Che Guevera, I must protest (but only mildly). This film is an adaptation of his chronicles before he became a revolutionary: it is about his becoming a revolutionary. He and a friend travel from Argentina to Peru on a ramshackled motorcycle. Ernesto (Che) sees many things about South America that disturb him. Mostly the Catholic Church, the power of capitalism and its exploitation of the poor, and the sorely oppressed people. At one point a Peruvian points at a church and says,"There's Jesus Christ Inc." It is a beautifully made film with winning performances and beautiful scenery, but there's something just not right with it. I have a feeling if the real Che Guevera knew Universal/Focus Pictures were releasing a film based on his writings, he would hurl mightily. He would have wanted nothing to do with a capitalist production, and that's the thing that bugs me. It doesn't offer any real insight, because its the product of something he hated. To quote Abby Hoffman, "Revolution is more than just smoking weed and putting a poster of Che on the wall." So there is more to the real Che than just a couple of hours could show, so the film kind of cheats. Still kind of like it though... Recommended with caution, after all, I myself am a capitalist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Agreeable and educative, but not top-notch cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is a well-constructed, entertaining and educative effort by Walter Salles. The film provides insights into Meso-America to non-American viewers, their heritage, their history, and their lifestyles. The transformation of Che's attitude to life is dealt with charming finesse--a stone thrown at a truck, a dare-devil crossing of the Amazon, touching lepers without gloves, etc. The criticism of the nuns who refuse to give Che and his friend lunch because they did not attend mass, and the lepers stealing food from the same nuns to provide food are evocative actions that would make any Christian look inwards.A weakness of the film is that the various incidents that affect Che to transform his life are glossed over while his actions are underlined. Salles presents the reaction of Che, not so much the reasons why he reacted so.The best part of the film was the closing shot of Che's companion as he looks today in Cuba. Without this shot, the immediacy of the story would have been lost. While I look forward to Terrence Mallick's script for Soderbergh's "Che", Salles deserves credit for having directed this film with Robert Redford as an executive producer and making this film in Spanish when Salles is a Brazilian, where Portuguese is spoken. And the main actor is Mexican. The effort is truly Meso-American.</fullReview>

For those of you who expect his ideals to change completely by the end of this film will find that is not the case. In fact Ernesto doesn't actually have all his ideals until after his second trip, which in this movie is not shown, only the first trip. The film does a great job in casting in which all actors give it their all. The scenery shots on the film can be breathtaking at times but never falls short of beautiful. The movie shows the irony in which Ernesto is rejected by his "people" in the sense of their economic stature, while he is accepted by the people who are descriminated against by his society. Ernesto can be seen as he transforms from a small boy into the man we can only dream of, while the movie at times can be somber the movie never fails to deliver a few light hearted moments. All in all even if reading subtitles through out the movie can be a hassle it is worth the sacrifice.</fullReview>

Everyone has tried to take some type of road trip or journey or long adventure and of course, many good and bad and tragic things can happen on them and they can change you forever. The characters of Ernesto and Alberto are full of life and hope and joy and lust and you feel everything they feel as they try and ride a beat-up motorcycle across their continent. Extremely well-shot with a lovely score - the film is emotionally powerful, quite funny and actually moving. You don't even need to know anything about Che Guerva to enjoy the film - because that's the power of the story - they are just two friends going on an adventure - never quite sure what is up around the bend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Diarios de Motocicleta is a quite good film, even if not great.It's a good, believable portrait of the 50s in Latin America. A good, believable psychological portrait of Guevara and his friend Granado. Even if Garc眼 Bernal is a good actor, De la Serna (as Granado) steals the movie.I agree with those who say that it's more of a road movie than a political film. It's also entertaining, specially the first half.For people interested in this terrible and fascinating character, the film makes you understand Ch a little better.It makes you think about Guevara's individual virtues, and about how reason nurtures monsters when virtues become compulsory. It also makes you think about the Christian roots in Ch, and in many Latin American left-wingers (the idea of visiting a leper colony, so biblical!). Guevara seems more inspired in St. Francis of Assisi and the Spartan morals than in Karl Marx. I do believe he was (or rather that he re-interpreted the bible with a tinge of Marxism).At a certain moment, you see Guevara devouring the best known book of Jos Carlos Mari磬egui, and notice that the early reading of the most radical Latin American theoretician (the ideological father of Shining Path), in the context of the trip to Peru, made a great impact on the future of the rebel turned fanatic. The film makes you think about the place he chose to die (after leaving Cuba, at a time where his differences with Castro were open, since Ch was more radical): Bolivia, the center of the Andean social nightmare.Of course it makes you think about how little have things changed at their root. A similar voyage would have today better roads, a little more riches, but the very same social injustice. Finally, Granado's character is a great portrait of the kind of macho, socially conscious, easy tongued, very corny, adventurous, romantic, lyrical Latin American of his generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In its merry way,"The Motorcycle Diaries" rolls along just fine until it crashes in the second act (where else?) into a sump hole of poppycock, masquerading as social and political consciousness raising. It's an episodic tale of a long motorcycle trip around the spine of South America actually taken by a young medical student, Ernesto Guevara, before he became the political firebrand called Che. The fine Mexican actor, Gael Garcia Bernal, gives a terribly earnest performance which is one-dimensional in its rendition of an emerging saint/icon. Accompanied by his buddy, a bio-chemist, played by the wonderful Argentine actor, Rodrigo De la Serna, who steals the show, the boys cavort through a series of amusing misadventures (Che the straight man) along the road to enlightenment until Che begins to see The Light -- the cruel exploitation of the proletariat and the indigenous peasants along the way, somewhere in Peru. As soon as the film gets "serious" it loses it's bearings, offering scenes of surpassing banality, with no dramatic or comedic impact, involving romanticized, one-dimensional characters, climaxing in a leper colony where Che literally and metaphorically (swimming across a river) plunges into awareness of the necessity of active resistance to the bourgeois status quo, and ultimately into "sainthood."

		<fullReview>Every now and then comes a film that changes the way you think about film and it's relation to the people who watch it. Very few manage to get under your skin and stay there and slowly affect you as a person. Yes, The Motorcycle Diaries is most certainly one of them.I'm not here to write what I though was great and what was not. I will leave it that to the pundits on this site to do that. But I'm here to tell you what a sincere and truly heartfelt film Mr. Salles has made. He could have easily got caught up in the whole political undertones of Che, but instead it was restrained and truly masterful in it's handling of a young man who would one day become the greatest leaders of our times. It made Che human again.The DP did a brilliant job. His references to Spanish photographers through the p eople shots were stunning. Che today is an urban and misunderstood pop icon. But the film truly gives us a glimpse, back in time and history and makes us learn what prompted men like him to think like the way the did. We might not like or agree with many things the Cuban revolutionaries did but the greatest lesson the film gives is behind all great men lies a moment of realization what they are destined for, and perhaps we all have those moments and it all depends on which road you choose to travel further.An ironic message given the times we are living in.Thank you Jo?o Moreira Salles for reminding us that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgic overview</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been born in Rosario, Argentina, I have always been interested withChe Guevara's origins. In Argentina, the word Che usually means "hey you" and is used with friends. It is usually considered an insult to use the term with a stranger. This comment is non-standard in that I have not seen the movie yet. However, having read the reviews thus far, it seems as if the movie will meet my expectations. Primarily, these are nostalgic. A unique aspect of Che and this movie is the concept of a road trip through South America. In Argentina, this concept or dream is ingrained in all Argentine youths and becomes an obsession as you reach 50. I once saw a car in San Lorenzo (just outside of Rosario) with a map of South and Central Americapainted on the car door. The map had the route which was taken by the owner on one such trip. In my own mind, the dream was to make the trip on horseback. This idea actually originated with San Martin and his horseback route throughout South America in therevolution against the Spanish (circa 1810). One of my uncles actually retraced this route on horseback in his 50s with several other hyper-enthusiasts. This link is also interesting and I hope to see some references to San Martin in the initial part of the Movie where the concept originates for the trip. It would certainly be consistent and a great foreshadowing of Che's revolutionary future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A stunningly interesting and captivating movie.I didn't know much about Che before seeing this movie but I am somehow nowprompted to go and buy his book. Overall I would say that this film is aninsightful and intelligent moving story of two men growing from adolescence into adulthood. You can see in a subtle way, how ideas are formed and how truly life changes you if you let it. The acting is so strong- a really internal performance well done. Oscar worthy. It is just well crafted, writing, directing even the camera work and art direction, production design it is all so well done. I am betting this film will win an Oscar for best foreign language film. And it should.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you see this film you will not be disappointed, it is not overtly political, except in its focus on the lives of the people Ernesto and Alberto meet on their epic journey. The film does not seek to glamourise the young 'Che', but he does come across as a charismatic figure, whether or not one believes in his views of the world. There are many humorous arguments and incidents along the way, and the friendship between the two young men is an excellent way to contrast the way the journey influenced them in their later lives.The photography is magical, the parts set on the Amazon particularly so, and the human stories contained in the film will stay with me for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very different, very superior, road movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very different kind of road movie: South America instead of North America, Spanish language instead of English, political consciousness rather than sexual liberation. It is the tale of a 7,000-mile trip made in 1952 by Argentinean friends Ernesto Guevara (Gael Garcia Bernal), then a 23 year old medical student but destined to become a revolutionary communist in Cuba, the Congo and Bolivia (where he was killed in 1967), and Alberto Granado Rodrigo de la Serna), then a 30 year old postgraduate in biochemistry and now (as the film shows in its final moments) an 83-year old still living in Cuba. The journey starts on a 1939 Norton 500 motorbike (hence the title), which they dubbed "The Mighty One", but the vehicle proved to be something less than almighty, necessitating less personal forms of transport.The central performances are wholly convincing and the dialogue is crisp, credible and at times quite humorous. The film looks wonderful: shot largely in a documentary style, it features location shooting in Argentina, the Andes, Chile, and Peru and cinematographer Eric Gautier evokes a wonderful sense of time and place, while the use of non-professional bit players with marvelously expressive faces creates a real sense of authenticity. Above all, Brazilian director Walter Salles and writer Jose Rivera have ensured that the political messages are subtly understated. The viewer is left to observe the grinding poverty, yet quiet dignity, of the migrant workers, the itinerant miners, and the leper victims and sense - as young Guevera obviously did - the acute sense of injustice.This is a movie which had resonances for my wife and me. She identified with the seriously asthmatic young Guevara, since her brother died of asthma when he was 21, and we have visited several of the locations featured in the film, including Cusco, Machu Picchu, and Lima. If this deeply impressive and memorable work has a fault is that that it treats its subject a little too reverentially. Guevara is portrayed somewhat one-dimensionally as uncompromisingly honest and almost saint-like in his concern for others and there is no hint of the ferocious rages and utter ruthlessness which was to mark his revolutionary leadership.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gael Garc眼 Bernal and Rodrigo De La Serna star in Walter Salles adaptation of Che Guevara's journals written while travelling in South America in 1952Uniquely, Ernesto 'Che' Guevara stands as an icon of both politics and pop, that ubiquitous headshot by Alberto Korda a symbol of dissent from Camden Town to Caracas. Indeed, so much mythical baggage surrounds Che-the-revolutionary that Ernesto-the-man has almost vanished.Walter Salles' magnificent adaptation of Guevara's 'The Motorcycle Diaries', and his travelling companion Alberto Granado's memoir 'Travelling With Che Guevara', vividly humanizes the legend while honouring the life - or at least a version of it. Part road-movie, part rite of passage, this is a film that avoids noisy rabble-rousing in favour of a funny, subtle and poignant tribute to friendship and burgeoning idealism. It begins in Buenos Aires in 1952 as 29-year-old biochemist Alberto Granado (De La Serna) and asthma-stricken 23-year-old medical student Ernesto Guevara De La Serna (Bernal) prepare to embark on a mammoth road trip through Latin America. The objective: girls, beer and self-discovery. The means: a 1939 Norton motorbike nicknamed, with some irony, 'The Mighty One'. "The method," says Ernesto, "improvisation." Early scenes are full of the romance of the undertaking, Alberto good-naturedly conniving his way to a meal and a bed while Ernesto moons over Chichina (Maestro), the girl he's left behind. But by the time they reach Chile a new reality is emerging, far removed from the comparative luxury of middle-class Argentina. With the bike written off in an accident Ernesto and Alberto continue hitching until they enter the Atacama Desert. There they encounter a poverty-stricken, homeless couple, thrown off their land because they're Communists. For Ernesto it's a pivotal moment, an introduction to inequality that offends his sense of justice. Salles responds by darkening the tone as Ernesto and Alberto begin to look into and beyond themselves. In Machu Picchu in Peru, then in Cuzco and Lima they meet whole communities disenfranchised by progress. Finally, at a leper colony on the Amazon, they find some practical use for their medical skills, but even here Ernesto refuses to recognise the division between the sick and the well.Spectacularly shot on location in Argentina, Chile, Peru and Cuba, Salles vividly summons a Latin America that's simultaneously exotic and harsh. Bernal, so effective in Amores Perros and Y Tu Mam Tambi輹, finds in Ernesto quiet dignity and a growing sense of purpose, his graduation from awkward student to nascent revolutionary negotiated with charisma and conviction. Perpetually hungry and horny, Alberto stands as Ernesto's comic foil, yet tentative encounters between the pair and the people they meet on their travels - improvised by the actors in the spirit of the original trip - have the naturalness of documentary footage. Unavoidably, Che's legacy hangs over the film and the final scene, in which Ernesto and Alberto say goodbye, is laced with poignancy: by 1959 Che would be fighting with Castro in Cuba; in 1967, aged 39, he was shot by the CIA in Bolivia. But the film succeeds because all this remains where it belongs - in the future. Instead Salles creates a stirring odyssey of self-discovery which, in its romantic conception of friendship and hope, and its freewheeling celebration of youth, is tender and unexpectedly uplifting.Verdict A spectacularly realised road movie that offers an affective and affectionate portrait of young Che, and also a gloriously romantic coming of age tale set against a magnificently photographed Latin American backdrop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the privilege last night to attend the London premiere of this movie at the NFT and I have to say it did really impress me. We were also treated to an entertaining interview with Walter Salles where he talked profusely of his films, in particular Central Station, Behind the Sun and the film subject matter. On the film itself I believe this is one of the best films this year so far.It is beautifully shot and the performances by both Garcia Bernal and De la Serna are very mature and natural. The documentary-style cinematography, the use of black and white stills and the incorporation of improvised dialogue give the social content that otherwise would have been excessively throw into it had the filmmaker succumbed to the temptation of giving the future communism ideas of Che Guevara a more important role in the form of open political manifest. One can only be relieved that instead of being an evident defense of inequality in Latin America, this film is basically a man's journey into the purpose of his life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A road movie about social conscience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For many Westerners, the whole of South America is little more than some names of countries on a map. The whole surface area of the United States would almost fit into Brasil ? a single SA country. Poverty afflicts what is naturally a very rich area. Spanish conquest, followed by U.S. monetary domination, wiped out the indigenous infrastructures, both social and agricultural. Most of the world neither knows or cares.Against such a background, a political film around Che Guevara, one of South America's most well-known revolutionaries, could find fertile soil. Yet, apart from noting that the CIA backed Guevara's final elimination, Motorcycle Diaries skilfully avoids the temptation to make a political film. Instead, it firstly introduces us to some of the contrasts and beauties that make up South America and with which many western audiences will be unfamiliar ? the grandeur of Buenos Airies, the jaw-dropping spectacle of Valpara押o, the historical time-warps of Cuzco and Macchu Picchu, and the natural wonders of the Andes and Amazon. Secondly, it tells a story that could apply to thousands of youngsters who take time out to travel extensively and get in touch with themselves. Starting out as a simple adventure, Guevara slowly learns more about himself through the people he meets, realisation of disparities and injustice and the terrible sufferings many have take for granted. In making a film about discovering one's own humanity, Salles has neatly sidestepped potential arguments over Guevara as the political leader and the more limited audience that would attract ? what we see is a young boy who realises the world could be a better place and who builds the determination to do something about it. Salles has also given us a gem through which to glimpse a peoples and their cultures, attempting to draw a unity across the broad range of ethnic diversity within Latin America. The film charts the dawning of a social conscience, providing both the context and one character's developing awareness that, put together, spell the potential for change. Overall we are left with a movie that is far more than a biopic of the romanticised Che Guevara - it is a film of touching human warmth, made with consummate skill, and one that can reach out and entrance the hearts of all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not to be missed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this brilliant film at a packed 1 AM showing in Buenos Aires, Argentina. And although the projector broke down several times and the movie was in a language in which I'm not entirely fluent, I was nevertheless very moved by it. Although the movie is about a young Ernesto "Che" Guevara, it is not really a political movie. It is a road movie about a long, eye-opening journey taken through South America by two privileged Argentinean med. students. The movie does portray Guevara's developing social conscience as he visits impoverished copper miners in northern Chile and a leper colony in Peru, but it barely hints at his later revolutionary development. It's really not unlike "Y Tu Mama Tambien" except with more nostalgia and less sex. I'm sure when it arrives in the US, the usual bunch of right-wing idiots with their cabezas in their culos (pardon my Spanish)will attack it for not showing the role Guevara would later play in the Communist dictatorship in Cuba, but to be fair the movie also doesn't show the event that truly radicalized the young Che--the US-sponsored overthrow of a democratically-elected government of Guatamala in 1954 (which led to a bloody civil war that claimed humdreds of thousands of lives). Politic is not the point of this movie. It is about youth and freedom and adventure. It is about the past, the present, and the future of Latin America. Regardless of what you think of Che Guevara and his politics it is a wonderful movie which should definitely not be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so I've seen flames and bombs all over this site from holier than-thou commentators, but I want to discuss the movie, not a prepackaged set of political ideals. Overall a good movie, at least beginning and middle. It does force you to think about how people live in different parts of the world, and how interacting with them can affect us and our perceptions. Ernesto's personal voyage from average middle class kid to idealist firmly on the path to revolution is brilliantly portrayed by Bernal..His relationship with his trail partner is never over-done on drama or humor,and De la Serna is the perfect counterpoint to his moodiness. Fantastic speed and setting changes in the editing. However I think that Salles did a better depiction of the South America Road Movie formula in "Central do Brasil", letting the images flashing past tell the story, rather than stopping and pointing out things to make them obvious. There is a dreamlike quality to the road images, but every time you are about to believe it you are woken up.My main gripe is with the last portions, which get heavy handed on the dawning personality cult. Ernesto and Alberto have been partners and pals throughout, while at the end we have Ernesto (****spoiler****) swimming the unswimmable river to embrace the outcasts on the other bank. Big dollop of rhetoric for anyone? I was getting ready for a great finale, the black and white pictures fading into music and then silence, letting you think about the implications of what you have seen, but no, you get (****spoiler****) big letters on the screen saying that "Ernesto went on to become the heroic commander Che Guevara etc. etc.. We all know who "el Che" was, no need to beat us on the head, but the Diaries and this movie are not about Che, they are about a young man called Ernesto discovering the world. Knowledge of who he then became is like a dark cloud in your peripheral vision, it lends mystique, but not when you blow a trumpet and shine spotlights on it. Then it becomes propaganda, which was something El Comandante himself would have hated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Motorcycle Diaries" is the new film directed by Walter Salles, who directed the very good movie "Foreign Land" and the FANTASTIC movie "Central Station", which was an oscar nominee, as well as its leading actress, Fernanda Montenegro (in the year that * beep * Gwyneth Paltrow won the oscar). Telling about a trip through South America that Ernesto Guevara - before becoming the famous and polemic revolutionary Che Guevara - made with his friend Alberto Granado (who is still alive, living in Havana - Cuba), Salles succeeds in making a wonderful road-movie that I must say it's one of the best I've seen. It tells us about adventure, friendship, humanity and love. It's a very touching movie - not cheap emotions like "a-poor-girl-that-falls-in-love-with-a-rich-handsome-boy", but deep ones - two friends that all over their way get in touch with misery, injustice, prejudice, poverty, sickness and grow up with all this. It's very interesting how that characters - specially young Guevara - changes along the movie as the things happen. Mix all this with suberb acting by the leading actors Gael Garcia Bernal (as Che Guevara) and Rodrigo de La Serna (as Granado) and breathtaking views of beautiful continent South America and you'll get this great movie that "The Motorcycle Diaries" is. I rate it unmissable for good cinema lovers.Rate 5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, when I saw this movie in the video library, I thought it had something to do with racing or a road trip and go it home. I was in for a pleasant surprise. Not only was it not a racing movie, but it was also not in English as I had expected. But anyways, I decided to watch it for about 5 minutes and then decide. Boy did I decide to do that! While watching the movie, I researched about it on wikipedia and found that it was a movie based on the early life of Ernesto "Che" Guevera, the Argentinian-born, Cuban revolutionary leader. So I decided to just watch it for the non-political content.The acting by the two principal actors (and also the others), is AMAZING! Not only is the movie amazing (so say the least), but the special features are excellent also. Also included in the spl fea is an interview with the original Alberto Granada, the companion of Ernesto in this movie. Believe it or not, Robert Redford was the exectuive producer for this movie.A "MUST-WATCH" movie of all time! Doesn't matter if you like/don't like road trip movies. But donot expect too much political views in this movie. There is just a hint of the reasons why Che turned a revolutionary from a life destined to be a medical doctor. But not too much. In the first half, it is more like a comedy movie and then more like a "coming-of-age" movie.</fullReview>

I was expecting more commentary from him but was wonderfully distracted by the beautiful South American scenery. I liked the common people they met along the way and the 'still shots' at the end of the film. We find out more about them than the main characters. The music is nice and culture seems to seep out wonderfully. I liked the historical visits in the mountains and dance parties. The negative comments are the contrast between the two friends. Ernesto seems like a saint-though he lets lust rule in the backseat of a car. Alberto is self seeking and it's amazing his promise to Ernesto's family is strong enough to not kill Ernesto over the 15 dollars. Ernesto should have sunk to the bottom of the river due to asthma and Alberto should have harassed a nun seeing his hormones were out of control. It was like a south American Tom and Huck adventure down the Amazon where they want to live up to their ideals and help the slaves of sickness and society but do little really in their future career choices.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What the world knows about Che Guevara is mainly what everyone saw of him after 1959. "The Motorcycle Diaries" tells an earlier story, before Cuba's revolution or the changing world of the 1960s in which Che played a role.In January, 1952, Argentinian medical student Ernesto Guevara (Gael Garcia Bernal) and his friend, biochemist Alberto Granado (Rodrigo de la Serna, Che's real life second cousin), decided to go on a motorcycle trip across South America. Having come from affluent families, neither man has ever experienced hardship. But traveling across the continent, they see a different world. They see the oppression of the native peoples by the civil guard and the complete disenfranchisement of the poor. Finally, when they come to a leper colony, Ernesto refuses to isolate the lepers and ignore them as the nuns have done. This entire experience leads him to be, as he says: "...not the same me I used to be." The cinematography holds its own almost as much as the actual story does; the vast stretches of land are just incredible. While visiting Macchu Picchu, Ernesto asks: "How is it possible to feel nostalgia for a world I never knew?" One might say that he can feel nostalgia just by learning about the world that existed outside of his sheltered existence.On another note, I read somewhere that the whole idea of Che Guevara's life seems to be a promotion of macho warfare, hidden behind the idealistic image of a rich boy who abandoned his elitist upbringing to save the world. Maybe so, but he did do a lot for so many people. And "The Motorcycle Diaries" doesn't make the mistake of pushing polemics; it's mostly about how Che became who he became. I really liked how Jorge Drexler sang some of the lines from "Al otro lado del rio" when he accepted his Oscar for the song. Excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the only reasons I even gave this film a 6 out of 10 was for its beautiful scenery and, at times, excellent acting. Let's face it, Garcia Bernal is just pretty, too. But I was surprised to see what a high rating this film received from the viewing body of IMDb, with whom I usually agree.The film purports to tell the story of a young Che Guevara, based on a book by the man of the same title. however, the book tells a significantly grimier tale of their constantly broken down motorcycle, frequent sexual liaisons, and plenty of drinking. This film has some of all that, but it inevitably returns to Che's good nature and long-lasting love for the woman he left behind, eventually it seems, for the good of the people he wants to help.Did this not reek of Hollywood sentimentalism to other viewers?? Che is portrayed as someone who can seemingly do no wrong in the movie, while even in his depiction of himself in his book, he is no such angel. There are many scenes in the movie in which he is seen being overwhelmed by the nice people around him who all seemingly love him and him just standing there dumbly smiling.Two more things. One, his big feat at the end of the movie, swimming across the river, is flawed both symbolically and as a physical act. He is not swimming across to the island with the lepers for any particular purpose, unlike his very clear purposes in his revolutionary actions. All the people on both sides eventually cheer him on, but what for? He's not doing it for any reason! Why do they really care! Probably because Garcia Bernal, like Guevara, is a very attractive man. That's not a good enough reason though. And physically, he's swimming across a river, another biiiiiig deal kind of feat, not the kind of thing the hero does at the end to make the viewer see how incredible he is.And the ending! He overtly says to his friend that "he needs to do a lot of thinking. The people, they need help." There was assuredly no such 30 seconds of realization in Che, especially when saying goodbye to his good friend for a long time. This also brought out the awful stench of Hollywood-esquire sentimental crap, trying to get the viewer to say "Oh, it's Che! He did all sorts of revolutionary stuff! And this is him transitioning!", instead of what was probably more realistic, which would be to leave that out.NOT good enough a film to be in the IMDb top 250, and really, barely a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not brilliant, but a nice film nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Motorcycle Diaries is a film that tells the story of a young Che Guevara and his friend, Alberto, when they decided to womanise and bluff their way across South America on an old motorcycle. The story follows the common 'road movie' structure, with our hero's travelling and meeting various characters etc. However, there's also a strong documentary element in the film, and it seems keen to give us something of a history lesson about South America and the state of it's locals, which will either enlighten you or get on your nerves, depending on the sort of person you are. The film's method of story telling is efficient as it stays on track and doesn't go off in all different directions. However, this also works against the film because it becomes monotonous rather quickly, and it falls apart almost completely when it reaches it's rather lacklustre final. Still, realistic performances and an obvious good heart always ensure that the film remains interesting and even in it's final third, the motorbike never completely stops running.As mentioned, the acting in this movie is something to admire. It's so realistic that if anyone told you that anyone in this movie wasn't actually the character that they're playing on screen, you wouldn't believe them. This sort of realism isn't captured often, but The Motorcycle Diaries does it effortlessly. The artistic merit of the movie is benefited immensely by the truly stunning location shots, and it is more than evident that director Walter Salles is keen to get the beauty of South America across to his viewers, and make the contrast between the state of the peoples' lives and the picturesque areas that surround them. However, because this film follows a period of Che Guevara's life that occurred before he would go on to find fame, I got the impression that I would rather have been watching a film about his later days. On the whole, The Motorcycle Diaries is a nice movie and I'm not surprised at the strong critical reaction it's getting. However, I didn't find it stimulating enough and the final third lets it down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Visual Feast, Some Real Humor, Largely Good Acting - and an Appeal for New Cultists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Walter Selles stuck faithfully to Ernesto Guevara and Alberto Granado's book recounting their 1952 adventure traveling through thousands of miles of South America, much of their adventure taking them through magnificent wilderness and provincial small towns.Guevara (Gael Garcia Bernal) was about a semester away from receiving his medical degree. His jovial companion was training in biochemistry. They set off on Granado's misnamed motorcycle, "The Mighty One." Unfortunately it wasn't and most of their journey was by many kinds of conveyances other than the wrecked bike left behind in Chile. Granado (Rodrigo de la Serna) really loved that bike. Very sad.The two, a sort of Cisco and Pancho act, had a lot of fun as the book shows and the film recreates. Cadging money and food and looking for willing girls, they pulled various scams including passing themselves off not only as MDs but also as respected and acknowledged leprosy specialists.They encounter much poverty but also many spirited people who seem to need a healthy dose of some form of democracy. Guevara, who picks up the sobriquet "Che" in Chile, the name by which he is known to history and revered in Cuba, begins to demonstrate a nascent political consciousness. Watching people shape up for hopeful but very dangerous employment by the Anaconda Mining Co. folks and encountering a desperately poor communist couple shakes up the middle-class future revolutionary. As I watched those scenes, with pithy one-line expressions of concern coupled with outrage, a little voice inside me warned "Stand-by for a big speech."Part of the duo's plan was to work at a leprosarium on the Amazon. Arriving there director Selles focuses closely on Che's taut face as he's told that patients dwell on one side of the wide river with the staff ensconced on the other. Never mind that while a doctor says that the patients being treated aren't contagious, the actual pre-Dapsone therapeutic medical reality (especially in poor countries) was that such patients did pose a communicable risk if they were in extended contact with non-infected persons.More than a few observers and authors have noted that Che, or the memory of Che since he's conveniently dead and no possible challenge to Castro, is Cuba's secular approximation of Christ. Here at the leprosarium the young almost-MD treats patients with a compassion and skill that suggests he might be the Healer who can walk on water (later it's proved that, at the least, this seriously compromised asthmatic can swim the Amazon).As the time to leave the leprosarium arrives, the grateful nuns and staff throw a birthday bash for their now universally respected young genius. Even the nuns, originally somewhat hidebound by Mother Superior's rules, dance. Dancing nuns at a leprosarium! Well I never.At the bash Che delivers a quiet but impassioned speech proclaiming that all who live in Latin America from Mexico to Patagonia are of one race with one destiny. Arrant nonsense and now Che, soon to be the Dull, Turgid Dogmatist first flies his colors unequivocally. His statement reflects all he HASN'T learned in his travels. "The Motorcycle Diaries," divorced of politics and its mission of rewarding the living faithful and recruiting new cultists, is well-acted (only the two lead characters really matter but the rest of the cast is good). It's a fine road movie, largely genuinely funny. Scenery is breath-taking. But did I mention politics?Che was a star of the American rebellious, left wing, young in the sixties who couldn't or wouldn't realize that whatever the defects of Batista, Castro wasn't then and isn't now an improvement. Yes, American policy towards Cuba was stupid - still is really - but the reality is that the charming, funny, caring physician portrayed here was the trusted and ruthless aide to Castro in installing a regime where individual rights, the rule of law and due process were violently swept into that country's dustbin.An end title reports that Che's death in Bolivia was at the behest of the Central Intelligence Agency. Whatever that organization's half-baked involvement was, the fact not reported in the movie is that Che was the designated exporter of the Cuban Revolution, a product most Latin Americans never wanted. Che didn't understand that.Stalin famously remarked that with a live man there are problems and with a dead one none. Che as the iconographic representation of Castro's revolution continues to perform yeoman post-mortem service for his leader. Some young people still have his visage tattooed on their bodies and Che t-shirts are available everywhere. Perhaps in the fullness of time Che might have realized how wrongheaded and evil the Castro regime had become. Probably not-he had come to enjoy power.As a movie "The Motorcycle Diaries" is quite attractive. As a political polemic it avoids stridency for a while before descending into the world of The Message. Old unreconstructed Lefties will love it and the great historically naive young may well believe that Che was if not Christ at least a good apostle for social justice. He wasn't.In her forward to the new English edition of "The Motorcycle Diaries" Che's daughter, who lives in Cuba, remarks that rereading the book made her fall in love with her father as a boy. I can understand that. Book and movie capture a certain charm and the promise of a caring doctor. But Che's life went on after his peregrination. His postponed adulthood made him the fanatical messenger of revolution. Nothing to love about that.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie does not do the job</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, the movie does not do the job of really having us see what lay behind the development of Che Guevera. It probably is an impossible task for a short movie - one needs to study history, read more about the man, study the biographies of others (for example, Chou EnLai in China).Second, I have to comment on some of the comments I read here. The people of Argentia I believe are basically made up of three ethnic groups: German, English, and Italian. The natives there were pretty much wiped out. That is why many of the people in Argentina looked "European".This movie described a trip that took place in the fifties. You can judge the movie (or Guevera) by looking at Castro's running of Cuba, but you may want to consider that in the fifties Cuba was run by gangsters. It would also help to understand what the world was like if you recognized that all the freedoms that are lacking in Cuba that Americans hold sacred, in the fifties were not available to a substantial part of the US population.The US has changed dramatically since then, without the kind of all-encompassing violence that has plagued other states which have people pressing for change - a credit to African American leaders and the US government system. It is too bad that Cuba did not have the leadership or the system to change as well. On the other hand, the Cuban dictatorship from the start had to defend itself against an America that preferred the previous gangster government, because it was non-communist, and it was (is) able to resist change by using the need for defense as an excuse.Guevera was murdered because he was recognized as a charismatic figure who would cause trouble if he was simply put in prison. In present day parlance one would say he was an "enemy combatant" and therefore was not entitled to any trial or any appeal from execution. The problems that Guevera saw still exist.</fullReview>

It's bad enough it had to kill so many, now some dim-witted lefties want to create a legend out a one of commuinism's greatest failures. Have any of you actually read the real story of Che? He was such a pathetically poor military figure that even Castro had to remove him form his military operations. First it was Frida, now its Che. What's next? Josef? I can't wait for that one.

		<shortDescription>Easy riders, or two for the road.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, directed by Walter Salles, will not clarify the myth behind the Che Guevara's persona, nor, will it explain how he really changed by what he experienced on the road. Yes, we see his rapport with the poor and the sick, but it is never clear how his transformation came about, at all.Unfortunately, this is a movie that promises a lot, yet the true realities aren't apparent to the casual viewer, or to someone looking for the revolutionary. Actually, Ernesto Guevara didn't have too far to find injustice in the world. He could have taken a trip all over the Argentina of the 1950s to find his own calling. The film becomes a great travelogue. It is about the relationship between two friends and the difficulties in the magnitude of the trip they decided to take before settling in their respective careers. Both friends came from Argentina's middle classes. Both enjoyed things in life that weren't available to others, at the time. Somehow the movie feels empty in comparison to the majestic views of South America we get to see. It's as though both friends were dwarfed by the magnificent landscape where they are traveling.Gael Garcia Bernal is a good actor. In fact, his accent is almost perfect. He makes the young Ernesto Guevara, perhaps what he wasn't in real life. As played by Mr. Garcia Bernal we see a Guevara that is almost ready to be called a saint.On the other hand, his friend, Alberto Granado, portrayed by the earthy Rodrigo de la Serna, is a man in love with the world. He is a happy-go-lucky man, who is more concerned in scoring with a young South American senorita than in the social disparity he witnesses during the trip.In retrospect, the aura around Che Guevara doesn't explain why, if he was so evolved, or the sense of injustice was so paramount for him, could he help establish a totalitarian regime in Cuba where the same things, he supposedly tried to achieve, are completely ignored. His sense of compassion might have been impaired by his Stalinist views of what he considered justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully filmed, consistently funny and involving but a little simplistic politically</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years before the actions that would make him famous and ultimately lead to his death, doctor-in-training Ernesto Guevara de la Serna set off on a motorcycle trip to cover the length of South America ? taking in all the countries and volunteering in several medical clinics with his close friend Alberto Granado. After a brief stop to see Ernesto's girlfriend, the pair set off on their journey proper with both looking forward to the fun of the road and a girl in each town. However Ernesto did not imagine the impact that the people he would meet would have on his beliefs and his path in life.With so many 'big money, no brain' films to see during the summer time it is easy to miss smaller films that hold out potentially more interest but significantly less cars blowing u in slow motion and therefore tend to be missed in the rush to see the next 'event' picture. For me, Motorcycle Diaries was almost one of those films that I missed and would have done had it not been for my sister being fluent in Spanish and always being keen to see a Spanish-language film with me in tow. I will confess to knowing the basics of Che Guevara's life and politics but certainly no great detail ? perhaps just enough to find amusement in the way his image has become such a commercial product, worn by many of us who live outside of his ideals! However this film didn't require a lot of knowledge about this and, indeed, those parts of the film that look forward to this time are actually the weak points.The story is very simple; basically a road trip that brings Ernesto Guevara into contact with the reality that will shape who he becomes. Outside of this it is a road movie that is actually very entertaining. The script merges a story about friendship with one on social reality so well that the two work together as one pretty well. On a superficial level it was surprisingly funny, with most of the laughs coming from the friendship between the two leads and their banter. However this is well supported by the friendship, which is done well here and took me by surprise by how tender it was at times because I had only seen the superficial humour being focused on. However what didn't work as well for me were the moments where Guevara meets the experiences, people and injustices that change him; these are often very brief meetings where Ernesto (and the audience) sit at the feet of an old man/woman and listen to how hard things are while we sit with an earnest expression on our faces. Some of these brief meetings came across a little like a politician coming down among the great unwashed! These scenes are still interesting for what they are but they are revealed as weak when the film makes the same points with a much better developed set of people in the leper colony. However this aspect was still the weakest part for me as the film settled into a wide-eyed and simplistic set of events that made Guevara's political case with great simplicity ? perhaps too simple. Certainly this film will not damage Che's poster boy status one little bit as there is nothing difficult or controversial in his portrayal here.Gael Bernal tries hard with these bits but he brings out a lot more indignation than was convincing in such a young man ? the 'solemn look' is too easy to do and he does it too often. However, outside of the weight of knowing who his character would become, he is very good coming across as a likable young man who is having his eyes opened. As an actor I am impressed by his range since the last film of his I saw had him in a very different role (Bad Education), plus he is also very good looking ? not a quality that will damage his career much I suspect! De la Serna could have just been a comic sidekick but he managed to make the role so much more and often steals scenes from Bernal with his humorous and natural delivery. Outside of these two the cast is mostly real people in support roles, almost all of them are natural and indeed some scenes were 'captured' rather than staged, adding to the natural feel of the whole thing.Outside of this (and all around) is South America though and, if nothing else, this film could serve as a major boost for the tourist industry there because it looks fantastic. The conditions in each country (in regards landscape and weather) shattered my idea of south America and it was often gorgeous to look at while also mixing it with depressing images of suffering and poverty. The use of hand-held cameras allows for a quicker and more mobile filming style and helped the director capture some unplanned moments but also gives the film a sense of traveling and of a journey that we are almost part of.The film starts with good humour and laughs and continues with the same, gradually bringing in the 'eye opening stuff' which works most of the time but occasionally throws up the odd 'lets meet the poor people' moment ? not 'bad' moments, just a bit clunky and cheesy. Overall though, the film is very enjoyable even if it may annoy those looking for more than a very basic 'way in' to the future life of Ernesto Guevara de la Serna. It is funny and warm and looks absolutely beautiful from start to finish.</fullReview>

It ran smoothly and never stopped being interesting and, sometimes, funny. It was not preachy, as I expected, but showed the gradual awaking of "Che" Guevera amid the horrors of capitalistic greed. You could easily ignore the political statement as it is so subtle and just enjoy a great film. Filmed in Argentina, Chile and Peru with a Brazilian director, Mexican and Argentinian actors and actresses and produced by a Norte Americano, Robert Redford, it truly is Guevera's "united America."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Communism lite or just a road trip?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Separate yourself from any political overtones, which this movie itself does for the most part, and it's a well made road movie about two friends trying to tour South America. Most people in the US don't know much about South America other than the Amazon is down there and people speak Spanish, so it was truly refreshing to see the wide variety of landscape, people, and culture.But more than that, the movie didn't deliberately try to date itself. Most period movies in the US go overboard to fix themselves in time and place--the time period music, clothes, and general style are aped at every turn. A movie such as this, which draws nothing from American pop culture, doesn't have the same type of artificial fixing. True, the cars and clothes are from another era, but the early part of the movie transported me back to 1952 and made it seem like *now*, when all the future events and what we read from them weren't fixed, and the possibilities were endless. That perhaps is the movie's best achievement.If the movie had been about someone other than "Che Guevara," (Ever notice how these guys always change their names when they hit it big?) it would be a quirky and original story about Ernesto and Alberto, and might have ended with Alberto becoming a doctor and Ernesto reaching a turning point in his life--leaving Chihchina to help the poor, writing a book, whatever. In a sense it does, but then this is Che we're talking about....***Obligatory Rant***** To most people in the world Che is the guy on the T-shirt, and doppelganger wannabes buy "Che" brand to become politically enlightened, without having a clue. At the end of the movie we are told briefly that Ernesto, now "Che," had become a Commandante-or-ever in Cuba, helped Alberto out with a job, and then "fought for his beliefs" in the Congo and Bolivia before being assassinated by the CIA. (Actually it was a CIA trained Ranger battalion and the Bolivian army in a long running guerrilla fight, but never mind, it sounds more sinister the other way.) Imagine if this movie had NOT been about Che, but about a young medical student on a trip, and you would suddenly feel like a whole heck of a lot was unexplained. And it is.Not mentioned is Che's fall from grace in Cuba, or how he had wrecked the economy in three years, or even better why a guy from Venezuela who had talked about making a united South America was carrying the fight to a small country in the Caribbean. Then at the end you see that Robert Redford was the executive producer and it's like a smack in the forehead--I do wonder why people who admire Castro so much don't have much of a problem continuing to benefit from a capitalist society.But back on topic, maybe the reason why this movie is more of a background piece rather than a genuine biography is because Che has become like a latter day Jim Morrison, an iconic merchandising figure rather than a real person.</fullReview>

This part comes across as a typical road movie like several road movies I've seen over and over again. In the second half, the movies tries to shoehorn a political agenda. Since the two lead characters later become revolutionaries around Latin America, I guess they had to do this. I guess this movie is supposed to tell how these young men became the revolutionaries, but here it seems forced. The two actors are very good and the movie has its moments, particularly in the scenes in the Leper colony. However, the movie as a whole doesn't really work.

		<fullReview>You'll find this movie enjoyable when you watch it. But afterward you may feel that something is fundamentally out of place.There are lots of movies whose being is congruent with the message they contain. For instance "Dogtown and Z-Boys" is about some kids developing a ragged style and it itself is an expression of that style.But there are also many films where the polarity is reversed. The most numerous examples are the many teen films that preach being unique but themselves are bluntly, blindly formulaic.Well here I think we have an example of the latter. Che's life is probably undiscoverable at this point, but the legend has his notions as deeply rooted in the indigenous. The soul of a place resides in its people, and only by bubbling up larger notions from this root can we get at truth. Latin America, despite Spain's shameless rape, is a special case with deeper indigenous flows, and ? he believes ? a group soul.Anything in the way of this is evil, including western narratives of capitalism and catholicism. And now we need to add the cloying, falsely ennobling romanticism that is imposed on native people by post-imperialist do-gooders like Robert Redford. He sponsors a myth here worthy of Baden-Powell, the guy behind the noble Indian. Everything is beautiful. Every real person is deep and worthwhile. Every action by our hero is exemplary.Well, okay, such extremes have been with us long before movies. But one must ask why watch such a movie? To be inspired? To be educated? To be entertained? To be ennobled? If any of these four is what you intend, you may want to avoid this new insult on Latin America from the West.Spanish speaking filmmakers, even in the US, are making the most interesting and genuine films in the world now. This is just a perturbation. Ignore it.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey, Cisco!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Gael Garcia Bernal in "Y Tu Mama Tambien", I was excited about the possibilities here - a road-movie portrait of the early, influential life of Che Guevara with Bernal inhabiting this role.Yikes! I couldn't be more disappointed. This film was dreadful and sophomoric, despite excellent cinematography and art direction. The acting was astonishingly bad, with a dead-in-the-water script buried by shallow, stereotypical characterizations. But how did I REALLY feel about this film???? 1. I felt like I was watching a BAD rerun of the Cisco Kid with his sidekick Pancho. 2. I felt like director Walter Salles lost control of the momentum of the film within two minutes of the opening - a record since "Bonfire of the Vanities"? 3. I felt like every young woman who appeared in the film was caricatured as a sexual animal, ready and available to be picked over by the lead characters. 4. I felt like if I heard the word "b*lls" one more time, I would scream - the Alberto Granado character was painted with a sledgehammer.5. I felt like I could literally hear Paolo Freire groaning as he turned in his grave - the film was a contradiction to Che's manifesto. En toto, I felt like I wasted a few precious life hours on this garbage. I hope that you do not. 2.977 out of 10.</fullReview>

But there is something altogether too abrupt in the portrayal of Guevara's radicalization. At the same time, not enough of the internal dimension of this metamorphosis is communicated visually or through performance. The symbolism of the broken-down motorcycle is not sufficient substitute for the scope of these changes, and I could have used more development of this passage. Without this, the later scenes at the leper colony come across as too facile and strangely reminiscent of a TV-movie of the week. I wanted to like this film very much, but found myself leaving the theater unmoved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES (Walter Salles - Argentina/Chile/France/Germany/UK/USA 2004).From the director who unleashed the Oscar-nominated CENTRAL DO BRASIL (1998) on the world and is now torturing audiences around the world with Paris JE T'AIME (a joint-project with some other world-weary humanist directors), a film unlikely to increase Paris' appeal. The film seems conveniently marketed for the anti-globalist soul-searching urbanites in Europe. It will probably keep them quiet for a while, since 'having seen this film' undoubtedly cleansed many souls.The film's first hour is spent in the extreme southern corners of the continent, in Patagonia, which plays more like a National Geographic episode with some laughably awful dramatics in between. Some time is spent in central Chile and by the 57 minute we arrive in Peru. They use a shot of exactly the same mountain in exactly the same angle (prabably very consciously done) as in AGUIRRE: DER ZORN GOTTES by Werner Herzog, near the ruins of Machu Picchu. This was one of the worst parts of the film, where our infallible heroes engage in some embarrassing chit chat, and - en passant - blame colonialism, Catholicism and modern capitalism for all misery, while talking to some local Incan descendants about how they're gonna put an end to poverty in the world.Director Walter Salles has an indestructible believe in the goodness of mankind. I do not share this view, but such a perspective shouldn't be a barrier upfront for making a decent film. Salles, however, shows our hero as a completely one-note morally unambiguous robot. He is like a God to him. He seems to lack any questioning about his morals or world view. His view is already established at a young age and now the world has to adapt to his insights, and to this film, which does nothing but play lip-service to these, which results in even more suffering for the audience. All political views aside, the film doesn't offer the slightest assault of the senses, with two incredibly uninteresting characters. The film is largely made to tell the story of Che Guevara, or perhaps show us the diversity of South-American culture and its people, but the film's observations are alarmingly clich卜, contrived and repetitive.Camera Obscura --- 0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A " lavishly illustrated Rough Guide to white liberal self-affirmation."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That is a quote from Jessica Winter's review of Diarios de Motocicleta in The Village Voice that basically explains my feelings towards the film. First, I would like to get the politics out of the way: I consider myself a liberal, but I have never cared for Che Guevara's political philosophy. His admirers are very quick to dismiss his totalitarian leanings and repression of civil liberties. However, I can certainly admire and enjoy a film that represents ideas and philosophies with which I do not agree; for example, I am certainly not a Nazi sympathizer, but I acknowledge the artistry of Leni Riefenstahl's films. Diarios de Motocicleta, however, is an insipid and forgettable film based on the memoirs of arguably one of the 20th century's most recognizable individuals.What should have been a lively coming of age story has been reduced to over-simplistic hero worship. Before he christened himself as "Che," Ernesto Guevara de la Serna (Gael Garcia Bernal) was a middle-class, asthmatic medical student from Buenos Aires who, in 1952 with his biochemist friend, Alberto Granado (Rodrigo de la Serna) set off on a journey across South America on a dilapidated motorcycle. Instead of an exhilarating depiction of a journey that is in itself a fantastic yarn, director Walter Salles and Jose Rivera would rather the audience remain conscious of the influential figure that Ernesto would later become. An admiring depiction of a person's life is fascinating if it exposes his or her flaws as well, which Diarios de Motocicleta fails to do. Instead of showing him as stubborn and myopic, Ernesto is painted as heroic and idealistic. His only major fault seems to be that he is a terrible dancer. Most people who will see this film are no doubt fond of Che, even if only on a superficial level, so they will buy into the hero-worship hook, line, and sinker. They will also certainly approve of the ending credits' note that Che was "murdered" by the CIA, because "killed" is not as powerful a word. Such blind admiration is disturbingly frustrating, and it is well epitomized by Ernesto's swim across the Amazon to his downtrodden comrades in a leper colony as he is cheered on by them and his colleagues. Apparently his love of the people is so powerful it cured his asthma, which is great for the sake of everyone who owns a Che Guevara t-shirt. Personally, I was more intrigued by Alberto Granado, wonderfully played by Rodrigo de la Serna. Alberto is a fascinating and flawed individual who blindly chases wine, women, and song. He is depicted warmly yet remains firmly human. If only they had done the same for Che. While watching Diarios de Motocicleta I couldn't help but think about another Spanish-language coming-of-age film starring Gael Garcia about two friends who embark on a journey that will change their lives; I would recommend to anyone to rent Alfonso Cuaron's Y Tu Mama Tambien instead of sitting through two hours of "white liberal self-affirmation." I'm certain Che would disapprove of the idea of paying to see a film about him, anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't even know how to describe this stupid film, because I simply can't comprehend what's the real purpose of making it.What we got here are two stupid young men who thought they are the pioneers to travel the south and north American by riding an old, totally unreliable motorcycle to broaden their views of their future. One of them is even a poor con artist, trying so hard to bullshit all the way. The other one is just like romantic fool, a peacock with a more decent character, even thought of bringing a puppy for his love one. Both of them are terrible bikers, they crashed their miserable motorcycle so many times, even crashed into muddy trenches, gutters or creeks with deep water. They don't seem to have any mechanical knowledge of a motorbike, yet every time they seem to have no problem to fix a badly crashed one. They don't even know when to slow down on dirt turns of the country roads. And I don't know how they could and would broaden their lives' prospect since all they could do is just concentrating to stupidly maintain inappropriate speed, trying to reach some unknown places with food and lodging. The road trip never educated them a bit. They are still who they are from the beginning before they start the journey. I simply couldn't buy anything from this pathetic film, trying to tell us that it's the trip that has formed a great revolutionist in the making. That's total bullshit! I would never believe anything what this film targeted to us: A long road trip on a junk motorbike could make you different, especially when these two morons don't even know where and how to set up a tent during a stormy evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After 60 Years Nothing has Changed for the South American Poor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything has been said and more, so I will only add a grateful comment for such splendid entertaining time I got by watching this excellent movie. The Brazilian director Walter Salles did a fantastic job with a theme and locations quite hazardous and yet all the scenes seem to be as real and spontaneous as life itself in which we are participating as one more of the crowd; whatever the amount of technicians surrounding the actors they seemed to be nonexistent.Gael Garc眼 Bernal as Ernesto "Che" Guevara, Rodrigo de la Serra as Alberto Granado and all those actors from Argentina, Chile and Peru were simply perfect in their roles. The locations, spectacular, although they were not the prime object to be photograph as it could have been the case in a documentary, they just happened to be there and we appreciated them.I noticed that one of the producers for this film was Robert Redford, but he didn't appear in any scene as an actor.If the real life "Che" Guevara was like the character in this film and did the things he did ending up as the myth that everybody knows, I don't know if that was so (nobody knows) but if he did, it's funny the similarity some of these personalities have in common, like Mahatma Gandhi or Eva Per蚤, when they only turned away from established society and fought for the poor when they suffered themselves grave injustices. Very entertaining movie, superbly done, beautiful soundtrack and excellent, well balanced script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very nice film by Walter Salles and a talented cast. The film succeeds in portraying in detail the events that Guevara himself witnessed during his travels. As someone who knew quite little about South America, this film was an eyeopener. Salles shows us a glimpse of what life is in parts of South America. The landscapes are gorgeous and the people enchantingly human. The relationships that the duo encounter along the journey are very well captured on film, bringing the viewer into the story. While watching the film, I felt that I could understand what Ernesto was going through. Works well as a film that embraces the viewer from the very beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Making Che Approachable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Motorcycle Diaries is film that beautifully combines peaceful wanderings, urgent passions and thought provoking personalities. The former life of Che Guevara is one that seems at first to be quite distant from his future revolutions in Cuba but upon reflecting on the film, the connection in his passion and hope can be seen. The film does just what it intended do remarkably well and beautifully. It draws out the personality of Che and causes viewers to connect with him and even hold him in high regard. By displaying him as one who is following his passion, has a heart for what is right, and stands up for humanity above all else, Che is given a chance to be seen in a different light because of Motorcycle Diaries. The peaceful yet often chaotic travels of Che and his companion, Fuser, draw viewers in to the immediate beauty of their story. The times when Che becomes angry portray his deep passion to stand up for what is right, often by contrasting him with Fuser or other characters holding onto the status quo. Che is seen as a person who almost everyone wants to be: intelligent, passionate, caring and adventurous. He is not immortal but he is in almost every regard, better than those around him. These elements of character development and plot fulfill the intent of the director to change the view of Che by those who oppose communist revolution. The supporting elements in Motorcycle Diaries are also extremely important in giving it an exceptional rating as a film. The best word to describe the scenery and music the film is simply beautiful. The calm scenes pull at the heartstrings of the viewers who long for such beauty for themselves. The intense and upbeat scenes are supported by excellent acting that enables the passion of the film to also be seen as beautiful. By uniting these two beauties and supporting Che's passion, the film succeeds in supporting that for which Che stands. Since is caring actions are seen as beauty, so are his passion filled words calling for a revolution for a united America. If this were said without the build up for the rest of the film and all of its elements working together, Che would yet again be dismissed as a revolutionary communist who only did harm. The intricate build up of the film however, can convince the viewers that Che's opinion has merit. This is something that is quite difficult for a film to do: allow a viewer to agree with a character even when they might immediately renounce those opinions in any other setting. The viewers do not want to associate themselves with the nuns and doctors who stay on the other side of the river so they engage deeply with Che, a personality that outside of the film they might despise. Whether or not this opinion stands after the viewing of the film is difficult to assess but Motorcycle Diaries sure did its job extremely well: Che Guevara became a human being that everyone could relate with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Left a lump in my throat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on 'Che Guevera's' youth before he became 'Che' , it is a tale of a man's becoming. It is a portrayal of real events. I still have a lump on my throat from the emotion in the movie. I think the indigenous people are the one most affected by the current scheme of things which is hugely based on education-based skills developed for industries.The indigenous with minimal education has little scope in such a context. I can relate to Alfredo(Che)'s longing to have one united south America - his all encompassing approach towards everyone in the south America as his own people. He is not saying that from his philosophical thinking , he is telling it from his heart. His earnestness is so moving. I also admire his honesty and boldness. He is so soft at heart but at the same time very very bold and very very honest. There is saathvik advice that says you need to work to find out your life's mission and then live it. We know how Che has lived. Motor cycle diaries shows the homework.I don't really know what to write - I just know that I still have the lump on my throat.May be I should mention the scene where Che swims across the river from the section where the doctors stay to the section where the leprosy patients stay because having finished his birthday celebrations from the doctors' camp , he wanted to do the same from the patients' camp and on the same night as well and he has to swim the width of the river and he is allergic to water. That is one important piece - the inspiration part of it. This movie is very inspiring. It inspires you to follow your heart. It creates a longing in you. A life based out of passion - not based out of work schedules. Che was from a well-to-do background and he had a loving family with him too. He decides to sacrifice these for the greater good and the things that he wanted to do. He went around , saw things , did not like injustices around, had the balls to act against them and plunged himself completely into this mission. That is what he did, may be, somewhere along the line, he might have made mistakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine film about two men travelling through South America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film follows the journey of two young men; biochemist Alberto Granado and trainee doctor Ernesto "Fuser" Guevara as they travel from Buenos Aires to the south of Chile then up the west coast of South America to Peru then on to Caracas in Venezuela in 1952. They set off of on Alberto's ancient Norton 500 motorbike; it survives rough roads, snow covered tracks and numerous spills but ultimately dies after a collision with a cow! From then on the two must either walk or hitch lifts until they get to Lima. Here they meet a local doctor who arranges for them to work at a leper colony deep in the Amazon. Along the way they blag their way into getting free food and repairs for the bike; even going so far as to tell a Chilean newspaper that they are prestigious Argentinean doctors; with their pictures in the paper it gets easier talk their way into getting a free meal. Later on, as they head north they meet people who have been forced off their land; either because of their political views or because they are indigenous people; this clearly deeply affects Fuser in a way that would changes his views and shape his future life... when he will be better known as Che Guevara.One doesn't have to have an interest in Che Guevara to enjoy this film; even if he hadn't gone on to be a famous revolutionary this would still be a good story. Alberto and Fuser are entertaining characters and provide plenty of laughs in the first half as they blag their way through Chile, flirt with local women and in one case flee from a mob led by an irate husband! This helps the viewer to like the characters so when things get more serious as they see unfairness and get to the leper colony where we see that they really care about the patients and claimed interest in leprosy treatment was more than just a story to get them free food. I wasn't at all surprised to learn that after the film travel firms started running tours of the route Che took; the scenery is varied, stunning and beautifully shot. Actors Gael Garc眼 Bernal and Rodrigo De la Serna do great jobs as Fuser and Alberto respectively; they really bring the characters to life in a way that makes one forget one is watching a couple of actors rather than two people travelling on their own... so much so that one worries for Fuser's safety as he swims across the Amazon despite the knowledge that he has to survive as we know he must survive to become famous.I got this free with a newspaper and didn't bother watching it for ages as I wasn't sure I'd enjoy a film about Che Guevara; if I'd known how good it was I'd have watched it much sooner; if you haven't seen it yet and get a chance I'd certainly recommend it; I'm sure you won't regret it unless you are offended by swearing in films... The two men do swear quite a lot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Che brought to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The early years of Ernesto "Che" Guevara are brought to life by Gael Garcia Bernal in a truly believable interpretation of the Marxist guerrilla and t shirt icon of the 20th century. While traveling across South America in the early 1950s, Che and his best friend, Alberto Granado experience a life changing journey, as the young medical student and scientist see first hand the suffering of the common man. The original intent was to ride a Norton motorcycle 5,000 miles to Peru to work at a leper colony. The trip, of course, altered history forever. On the way they visit a copper mine and observe the terrible treatment of the workers. The beautiful Incan ruins of Machu Picchu, built by a native population convince Guevara that there has to be a better way of building an equitable society. The final and most important incident was the volunteer work at a leper colony in San Pablo where the medical staff were separated from the infected by a river. Che refused to wear rubber gloves, instead shaking hands with the patients without the usual precaution. Thus begins the political awakening of the famous or infamous, depending on your outlook, poster child, Che Guevara. Either way, The Motorcycle Diaries is a very good film.</fullReview>

The shooting locations were so beautiful and it represented Latin America very well.The direction,screenplay,shooting were tremendous and very real-stick.The acting of Garcia Bernal(Che) was extraordinary.But i prefer Rodrigo(Granado) because this type of humorous nonchalant character is very hard to act and challenging.But Rodrigo did an excellent job. But as i read the book 'the motorcycle diaries',i had high expectation about the scenario of tragedies of Latin American people.But in this movie the director rather liked to show the adventure of two more.But overall i can say its a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the road...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a number of different reasons why The Motorcycle Diaries is a great film. For one thing it is a fascinating look at the young Che Guevara before he became radicalised. As Che and his trusty companion Alberto Granado travel north through South America we witness a few small events effect him in profound ways until he realises that there is something rotten at the core of Latin American society. Another reason to cherish this film is as a travelogue par excellence. As we progress through the continent we are treated to the extraordinary variety of the South American landscape and culture. The cinematography is key here. Time and again the magnificent scenery is captured beautifully; from the snowy lands of southern Chile, to the grand heights of Machu Picchu, to the wild grandeur of the Amazon River the film never lets up in its celebration of wild nature. But other than an interesting narrative and the aesthetic beauty, the movie works so well because of the great leads. Gael Garc眼 Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna have great chemistry and really drive the narrative forward with top notch character-driven acting.Whether or not you have any real interest in the political radical Che Guevara isn't really very important. The film makes for a very unusual take on his life, stopping just short of the moment he began his progression to becoming the famous revolutionary leader. This makes it more appealing in many ways. Because on the one hand it provides fascinating historical context to explain the motives and experiences that set Guevara on his way from a comfortable middle-class life to the extreme path he chose; while on the other hand it makes the narrative less alienating to those who are less enamoured or interested in his subsequent path. It essentially works as a very intimate road movie. One that is political but more personal. It's also a love letter to a continent. And overall a very fine film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The noble character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Motorcycle Diaries tells the story of Ernesto Guevara as a young adult in Argentina, before becoming the revolutionary leader known as "Che". Both Ernesto and his friend Alberto decide to make a trip from Buenos Aires to the south of Argentina and then all the way up to Peru by way of Chile. The trip is full of ups and downs which reveal Ernesto's weaknesses and strengths, as well as how the person of "Che" is formed. The film succeeds at making Ernesto's image extremely admirable by focusing on his weaknesses, good intentions, and courageous nature. By having Ernesto and Alberto side by side the whole time, the director invites the comparison of the two, which certainly serves Guevara in highlighting his noble and just character. Salles also uses different cuts during scenes, as a way of showing Ernesto's long suffering during certain parts of the trip, as well as his tremendous sacrifice during others. The movie is extremely well done in all of its aspects and most definitely wins its audience over from the very beginning.</fullReview>

I found myself wanting to step into the film and help when Fuser was suffering from asthma attacks, deeply moved by his acts of kindness and rooting for him as he crossed the river.

Also, he has a knack for showing Ernesto "Che" Guevara as a person who is accessible to everyone. He makes him seem so normal - showing his struggles with asthma and the problems they have with their motorcycle, "La Poderosa" - which are ordinary problems of any other human being. Truly, The Motorcycle Diaries is a work of art that presents Che to the entire world in a well thought out manner, so that he is as accessible to them as possible. Bravo, Walter Salles.</fullReview>

I am captivated by the beautiful South American scenery and drawn in by the main characters and the people that they meet along the way.First time I saw it I had no idea that it was a story about Che Guevara before he became a general for the Cuban Revolution and I was surprised at the end when I realized that the young Ernesto that I had just traveled with throughout some of the most breathtaking and sobering parts of South America is also the same man responsible for great violence and corruption. That is a very important aspect of the film: seeing another side to a well-known icon. This version of Ernesto from Motorcycle Diaries is in great contrast with the typical portrayal of Che. The difference leads to the realization that there are two sides to every story and that things aren't necessarily black or white, good or bad. The audience sees this part of his life and comes to possibly understand the reasoning behind some of his theories that would later come into play on a much larger scale. I certainly do not agree with Che's method, but I can understand where he is coming from after traveling with him and Granado on the journey throughout South America.The soundtrack is beautiful and the gorgeous panoramic shots of the scenery provides a stark contrast to the absolute poverty and despair that many people of South America live in. The beauty of the land is contrasted with the pain and suffering of the people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Immediately after graduating from a medical college in 1952 Ernesto Guevara (the future revolutionary "Che")(Gael Garcia Bernal) decided to make a tour from south to north in South America (Argentina to Venezuela) in the company of another Argentinian the biochemist Alberto Granado (Rodrigo de la Serna) riding on an old 1939 motorcycle. The motorcycle didn't last for long and they had to go on walking, hitch-hiking and traveling by boat to their final destination. In the course of their route they suffered several bad vicissitudes but they also met good people who helped them a lot. They also made contact with poor exploited peasants, workers and miners mainly of Indian origin and this contributed to make Guevara conscious of those real injustices and to strengthen his revolutionary ideals that will end by (not yet in this movie anyway) by supporting some years later (and to be one of its leaders) the Cuban Revolution and ultimately by leading to his murder in Bolivia by the army (with CIA support or approval)in 1967. The story is human and lively told in images and dialogs and though not very deep it's significant enough to pass successfully its message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie on TV at around 3 in the night. No advertisements. The silence of the night amplifying the beauty of the journey of the two friends who travel just to travel.Very few movies have had an effect on me like The Motorcycle Diaries. Maybe it is because of the uncertainty of the outcome of their voyage right from the beginning. Maybe it is because the movie is more of an exploration of your mind rather than an exploration of South America. Maybe it is because I too turned 24 recently and hope to go on a life-changing journey to break the monotony surrounding my life. As naive as that sounds, it is the childish idealistic thoughts that made me love the movie more than anything else.Some scenes will never ever disappear from my mind. Like the one where Che's father tells him how he wanted to be younger and wished to travel with him. The way Che breaks the heart of a doctor who doesn't write well, with something that most of us have forgotten - honesty. The coldest night that he spent with the mining couple. And that mesmerizing speech. All of which played a significant role in defining the Che we all know and wear on our t-shirts. One day, I hope to get the courage to break the shackles of society and discover myself just like Che did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a complete surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just finished watching this movie so many years after it's release and, somehow, I'm not sure how. but I managed to know nothing about the plot before I watched it. I am very grateful for that fact. I watched it with no agenda, no preconceptions, no prejudices. I was hooked from the beginning when I first set eyes on "La Poderosa", a 1939 500cc Norton International. It was the type of bike that I'm sure my father would have ridden during and after the war - he was a big motorcycle fanatic. Even though he died when I was very young, I share his love of bikes. I also share his love of long, meandering road trips. So I settled down to watch this film expecting a bit of both; bikes and a road trip. I also was looking forward to seeing some of the countryside of a continent I have only visited very briefly. I was slightly disappointed when the bike "died" fairly early on in the story but stuck with it because of the great portrayal by the two leading actors, the scenery (amazing cinematography), the interesting (and sometimes, tragic) people they met and desire to see "how things would turn out". I thoroughly enjoyed the film for what it was for me: a great road movie with a conscience. I was stunned (and very pleasantly pleased) to discover at the end that it was a true story from early in the life of a major historical figure, about whom I knew very little. The revelation (to me, at least) that this was a glimpse into the situation which gave birth to man who became known as Che Guevara served to bring all the threads of the story together into one complete tapestry. I am glad that I didn't know more about the film before I watched it - and often prefer to watch a film revealed as it flows, with no preconceptions. I can recommend this film as it stands. It serves as entertainment of the best kind: it takes you on a journey, it moves your soul, it elucidates, it pricks your mind into thought, it is pleasing on the eyes and ears, and it leaves you feeling that you have shared a vision with the director/producers. I was surprised (but not shocked) to see Robert Redford's credit as Executive Producer. McCarthy would have had a field day if the film had been made during his era of madness. I am pleased that the situation has changed enough that this film could be made at all. It comes as no surprise that this film only managed to win one Oscar (for the music) and not one other film award in the US, yet it took two BAFTAs and four awards at Cannes - not to mention numerous other awards world-wide. Guess it's still too early for the American film industry to be truly unprejudiced when recognising art over politics or big business.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong dramatisation of Che Guevara's Damascene road trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a clever film by Walter Salles. I was a little concerned from the beginning that the film might be a bit flippant, concentrating on the adventures the two young men went in search of. Naturally there are plenty of entertaining episodes along the way - that's the nature of the road-trip both, the genre and in reality. Salles is clever though, turning the temperament of the trip slowly, incorporating the boys' experiences without bowing to earnest piety.This is particularly impressive given that much of the extra cast are undoubtedly co-opted locals. It would be easy to docu-dramatise the history and there are, surely, further contemporary political points to be made. Yet it stays on course and finishes with just the right sense of portence, including a strongly moving 15-second, three shot epilogue that ties it all together very nicely.Gael Garc眼 Bernal is to Latin America acting what Leonardo DiCaprio is to the US - the leading man at the moment. He shows it in a well- balanced fervent show. Rodrigo De la Serna is a fine foil as the happy- go-lucky Alberto. There is no over-acting from others along the road: the only melodrama is that caught in Eric Gautier's camera - the snow on the mountains and the mist-shrouded lepers of the final hospice. Stirring, whatever you make of the consequent revolutionary's politics and actions. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Walter Salles brings Marxist revolutionary Ernesto 'Che' (slang Argentinean word for 'mate') Guevara to the mainstream Western audience in this coming of age meets road movie, exploring the events that shaped the thinking of one of Latin America's best loved icons. The Motorcyle Diaries is based upon the memoirs of the aforementioned Ernesto Guevara (played by Gael Garc眼 Bernal), a 23-year old medical student one semester short of graduation, along with best friend and biochemist Alberto Granado (charmingly portrayed by Rodrigo de la Serna), six years Guevara's senior. Despite the age difference, they are united by their free spirits, and a predilection to the female of the species. A well executed and thought provoking adventure, which sheds light not just on the tribulations of Latin America during this time, but the effects on 'Che' and the formation of a legend.

		<shortDescription>Journeying through a Universe in the Making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie following closely the travel notes of a young Argentinean who made in 1952, together with a friend, a long journey across Latin America. The intention was to make it on a motorbike, only old Poderosa was definitely torn out and passed away quickly. The journey went on anyway, as anyone can expect.After watching the movie I found the book, The Motorcycle Diaries, and I read it at one shot. It's full of freshness, of that sympathetic craziness that looks true only in your early twenties; it's full of empathy for every new situation and new encounter. Nothing fake, nothing pompous. The young author of the diary would become after some years well known in the world at large; by that time he was just a young dreamy guy. His name was Ernesto Guevara.In the leading role a great Mexican actor, Gael Garcia Bernal, very well seconded, in some kind of counterpoint, by Rodrigo De La Serna (who, by the way, is a second cousin of Guevara).Das Kapital meets Easy Rider, wrote Times about Diarios de Motocicleta. I would rather disagree with this judgment. We all know that the young sympathetic guy from the movie will become Che one day, only he doesn't know it: the tone is warm and slightly humorous. The future of the personage is only a very discreet allusion in the movie; it is true that the situations encountered on the journey rise questions and suggest roads to follow, and the scene at Machu Pichhu transmits in a forceful way the emotion of the hero, his sudden awareness of what the South American identity means; but the movie succeeds in avoiding to be a political lecture. It is the merit here of the director, Walter Salles; it is also the merit of Gael Garcia Bernal, who is maybe one of the most intelligent actors of his generation.To understand the spirit of Diarios de Motocicleta I think we should compare it with another movie of Salles, Central do Brasil; a journey through a universe that is, like the heroes of the movie, in the making, open to any outcome, with a destiny not yet crystallized. And the empathy between the heroes and the universe they are traversing is total; both universe and heroes are fully open to each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ebert did not like this. I student of Spanish and South America thought it a fine film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is directed by Walter Salles who has made some very fine films. I have been trying to watch all of them. He is known for the famous film Central Station. This film is based on the journals of Che Guevara, leader of the Cuban Revolution. In his memoirs, Guevara recounts adventures he, &amp; best friend Alberto Granado, had while crossing South America by motorcycle in the early 1950s. Prior to viewing (&amp; during the film) I would have had no idea that such a strong young intellectual doctor would become Guevera of the Rebellions. The film wisely avoids politics but gives us a road trip movie (based on both of their journals) as they travel thru the rural areas of Argentina Chile Bolivia Peru Ecuador. From the cinematic view it is such a beautiful film &amp; made me want to take an extended trip to see those areas. Salles tells the tale in a relatively straightforward, unadorned fashion giving us great vistas of the areas they travel. Che went on to become 20th century's most romanticized revolutionary and this film covers they ground where he developed his "social conscience" . There are so many very beautiful places and interesting things that happen during their 8 month journey. The film attempts to re-create what Guevara &amp; Granado saw &amp; experienced, &amp; thereby to provide an honest account for how the journey expanded their intellect &amp; emotions. Salles uses the beauty of the countryside as a counterpoint to the ugliness of human conditions. In making the film, Salles took his cast &amp; crew along the exact route described by Guevara &amp; Granado in their accounts. With its beautiful on-location filming it functions almost as effectively as a travelogue &amp; the tale of their travel It is not a sober tale there are many playful &amp; joyful moments. "Wandering around our America has changed me more than I thought. I am not me any more. At least I'm not the same me I was." Guevara at film's end. The film is closed with an appearance by Alberto Granado now 82 years old. They also show photos from the actual journey &amp; note that Che Guevara was assassinated in 1967 with the help of the US CIA (somewhere in the jungles of Bolivia)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Motorcycle Diaries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't keen on foreign films in my college days, then I saw this Spanish film in my non-graded subject, World Cinema, and I really liked it, and still do. Based on the true story, from the journals of Ernesto 'Che' Guevara De La Serna (Babel's BAFTA nominated Gael Garc眼 Bernal), leader of the Cuban Revolution, aged twenty-three. The story sees Che and his friend Alberto Granado (BAFTA nominated Rodrigo De La Serna), typical college students, and before graduation, they start to travel across Argentina, Chile, Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela. They begin the journey travelling on a motorcycle, and they ride across South America looking for beautiful girls with little pick-up lines, good fun and long-lasting adventure. After losing the use of the bike, they continue the journey hitching rides in vehicles and on boats, and it becomes more serious as they enter many colonies full of sick and deprived people. In the end, Che and Alberto (apparently a distant cousin in real life) part with each other, but according to the end message, they did reunite years later, until Che was executed in Bolivia, and the real Alberto appears before the final fade. Also starring M眼 Maestro as Chichina, Gustavo Bueno as Dr. Hugo Pesce, Jorge Chiarella as Dr. Bresciani and Mercedes Mor烱 as Celia De La Serna. The performances by the two lead actors are very well done, the scope of the locations visited is most astonishing, I do enjoy the fun feel more, but the sympathetic colony moments are very heartfelt, it is a most watchable biographical road movie drama. It won the Oscar for Best Song for "Al Otro Lado Del R癌", and it was nominated for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, it won the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Gustavo Santaolalla and Best Film not in the English Language, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.

		<fullReview>"This isn't a tale of heroic feats. It's about two lives running parallel for a while, with common aspirations and similar dreams." -Ernesto "Che" Guevara, The Motorcycle Diaries.Another film based on a book I haven't read - so I cannot say how faithful it is in adaptation - but it certainly seems to have been lovingly done.It's the true story of best friends Alberto Granado and Ernesto "Fuser" Guevera (both get the nickname "Che" during their travels) who make one long journey before beginning their careers in medicine. It's at once, a biopic, a road movie, a buddy picture, a memoir &amp; travelogue, and a coming-of-age story. Beautifully photographed, from Venezuela to the Amazon jungle, the filmmakers take us on the mother-of-all road trips, the one that every guy I know ever wanted to do - travel thousands of miles on a vintage European motorbike seeing the land and it's people. Most may never actually get to do that, but watching this film is a bit of a vicarious thrill. And while there is little talk of revolution, we definitely see some of the experiences that would change a young man from aspiring physician to revolutionary.Peppered with traditional music of Latin and Native America, it's a movie that celebrates life, even in some of the most harsh, bitter and scenic places on earth.</fullReview>

I switched on and everything was in Spanish and then it clicked me, as to why the foreign section.I loved the movie more than the book itself, since the movie actually the fun loving Che transforming through out the trip. It was like the change being bought in into his mind, body and soul and every person that he met, bought in a new change in him. What i loved was actor himself was brilliant, their whole walk in Atacama Desert, they meeting with a number of accidents on the motorcycle - Norton 500 was well done and simply real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Journey of Transformation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Motorcycle Diaries reflects the journey of Ernesto Guevara ("Che Guevara) and his friend Alberto Granado on a road trip across the South American continent. Their journey begins with the objective of sight-seeing, but later becomes something of a political awakening as they plunge deep within the poverty-stricken areas of Chile and Argentina. The story's focus is on the transformation of these two young Argentineans?from na?ve adventure seekers to political activists. Although the story does not give an account of Guevara's political struggles, it illustrates the causes and conditions that later led him to become involved with such.Walter Salles, the director, invites the viewer along for the journey. From the opening scene where we watch Ernesto and Alberto climb aboard their raggedy motorcycle, to their adventures through towns, seas blizzards and jungles, the film allows the viewer to feel as though they have traveled an epic journey alongside the two. To heighten this journey, the story is told through the point-of-view of Ernesto; in particular, from abstracts taken from his journal which are read via voice-over narration and then related on screen with moving images. This allowed for more personal insights to relay the feelings that both endured on their journey. Cross-fades were also used quite frequently to suggest the amount of time elapsed on their journey, as well as hand-held camera shots to suggest a vicarious view-point. The viewer really gets to know these individuals on a very humane level: theirs interests, secrets, humor, idiosyncrasies, tastes for women, and ultimately, what they are made of in times of crisis.Guevara and Granado start off as directionless and perhaps even purposeless on their journey, but the more they travel the more people they meet that are in dire need of social reconstruction. The moment where I believe Guevara changes significantly is when he gives his money to a poor family in need at the cost of sacrificing the bikini he planned to buy for his girlfriend back home. In this instance, his desire for romance had become replaced with his desire to help his fellow man. His objectives change from frivolous materialisms to social benefit for mankind. The more he lives the journey of a traveler, the more unselfish he becomes. At one point, he even swims across a vast lake to celebrate his birthday with a village of lepers and other down-trodden folk. This scene really helped convey that his love for these people surpassed his own comfort and convenience. Life, as it had been, will never again be the same for either (as the last monologue of the film also suggests).While watching this film, I felt the journey of my own life displayed in my mind?as if running parallel to the journey I was watching. It was somewhat cathartic to recall where I've come from and where I'm currently heading. My life wasn't always invested with the pursuit of knowledge, inquiry or academia, but was filled with trivial pursuits such as parties, techno clubs, materialisms and other mind-numbing activities. Just as the values of the characters shifted from that which was good to that which was greater, I felt that I have been traveling a similar path the more I experience life. That which separates these characters from me, which is to say, that which separates the wise from the na?ve, is experience. I still feel pretty selfish; my hope is that I'll have some life-changing experience like Che did and learn to foster my selfish side towards more selfless pursuits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man Before The Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Motorcycle Diaries is the story of two young men who travel 8,000 mile throughout South America in 1952. While this may sound like familiar story one of the two men is Ernesto Guevara de la Serna who later in life becomes "Che" Guevara the Argentinian Marxist revolutionary. Ernesto's travel from Argentina to Peru can somehow be compared to George "I cannot tell a lie" Washington and his cherry tree; the adventures of a young man who would grow up to become a leader. It's a strategy that allows you to separate the image of a historical figure from the story being told.Accompanying Ernesto (Gael Garc眼 Bernal) on the trip is his friend Alberto Granado (Rodrigo de la Serna) the doctor and writer. The two travel through beautiful South America on a shabby, old motorcycle the skids and falls constantly. The two first stop at Ernesto's girlfriend's house, Chinchina. It's almost surreal to see him as shy and slightly awkward around people. Ernesto and Alberto are also the antithesis to one another. Ernesto is honest with the people that they meet and receive help from although he doesn't always get good results. Alberto, however, likes to take advantage of people by manipulating them.Throughout their journey, the two meet people who foreshadow who Ernesto will one day become. There is a couple that is forced off of their farm because they are communists. There are also managers of a miner company who neglect and take the upper hand of workers. The director, Walter Salles, comes up with an interesting way of showing how the images of poor people are ingrained into Ernesto's mind by showing them staring at the camera very still and in black and white. It resembles a photograph. De La Serna and Garc眼 Bernal have great chemistry together but it is the latter that carries the film. With such material, it is only natural to assume going into the film that it is going to be heavy-handed. It's not nor is it tedious, which can also be expected from a road trip movie. It is interesting to see that man before he became a revolutionist and rose to ubiquity in pop culture.</fullReview>

I was very touched by the bonds between Ernesto and Alberto and how much they experienced through their travels. The fact that all this led to Guevara's revolutionary stance is an added bonus, but this film clearly holds up without acknowledging who this person will become. I've been trying hard to get my hands on a Spanish version of Guevara's and Granado's versions of the diaries, and see how they hold up to the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ahhh..the joys of pure cinema :-) Why is it that most of Hollywood cannot turn out great works of cinema despite having so much money and technology and a great pool of actors/directors to choose from? The Motorcycle Diaries chronicles the journey that 2 friends undertake from Argentina thru to Peru on a vintage, leaking, Norton motorbike nicknamed affectionately, "The Mighty One". The story is important because one of the travelers, Ernesto Guevera went on to lead the Cuban revolution and became known as "Che Guevera". The movie portrays Ernesto as a quiet, shy medical student as he starts his journey full of hope and excitement with his traveling partner, Alberto Granado, a biochemist. With hardly any money, a dodgy motorbike, the 2 friends eventually travel over 10,000 miles before the end of their travels. In this time-frame, Ernesto finds much injustice in South America, which deeply affects him. He is a changed man upon returning home. The movie is not political or a movie about the making of Che Guevera, the revolutionary. It's a fascinating insight into the travels of two men who see and experience life in all it's painstaking reality and grow up on their journey across the Americas. Gael Garcia Bernal smolders on screen with such latent fury and passion inside of him that you feel he might burst into flames any minute :-) Rodrigo De La Serna is exceptional as the more exuberant of the two, who loves life and a laugh and oh yes!, the ladies :-) The acting, cinematography, the music was amazing. The characters seemed real, even apart from the two leads, who we know are based on real people. A deeply affecting movie that makes you think about what we can achieve by looking beyond our own selfish fears/needs/desires.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buddy Picture Reaches Far Deeper Into the Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I visited South America on my own extended trip a couple of years ago, I was amazed how many times I saw pictures of Che Guevara everywhere I went....caf乶, outdoor bulletin boards, art galleries, even department stores. Now I understand why. Having just read his diary, I was greatly anticipating this film, and my interest only heightened when I started seeing the travelogue shots in the previews. I am happy to report the film surpasses my expectations on almost every level. It is exquisite - perceptively directed, beautifully photographed and wondrously acted by a cast headed by two charismatic actors who tap deep into the hearts and souls of their characters. Whereas the book is more observational, the movie provides a more involving feeling in its portrait of a young man on the brink of his political awakening. It starts out somewhat deceptively as a comic buddy picture with the young Ernesto Guevara (pre-Che), a medical student, leaving his family and accompanying his seemingly more worldly pal Alberto Granado, a biochemist, on a dilapidated 1939 Norton motorbike traversing South America from their native Buenos Aires to Caracas. It is obvious what Alberto's hormonally charged intentions are on this months-long journey, but at 23, Ernesto is at a more sensitive juncture in his life where his encounters and observations have a deeper impact on his ideology.What I really like about the film is how it changes in tone and texture as the boys' hunt for adventure evolves into life-changing experiences for both of them. The motorbike acts as a metaphor for this change, as it unsurprisingly breaks down forcing them to open their eyes to the poverty and quiet struggle of the local people in each of the countries they visit. The story winds through wintry Patagonia, the blistering Atacama Desert, the awe-inspiring Machu Picchu and several towns in between. But the most touching passage takes place at the San Pablo leper colony in the Peruvian Amazon basin, where Ernesto bonds deeply with the lepers to the chagrin of the local nuns. His night swim across the Amazon, struggling for air through his asthma, is a powerful scene among many in this subtly potent film.As he proved with his wonderful "Central Station", director Walter Salles has an acute ability to connect his characters to their settings in deeply emotional ways. He is the ideal choice to guide this road movie. As Guevara, Gael Garcia Bernal transcends his Tiger Beat, teen heartthrob looks and delivers a deeply touching performance, as he grows from a big city innocent to a haunted young man ready to take on a greater cause than his medical career. He does an especially strong job in conveying his character's unblinking honesty and displaying unexpected acts of rage and compassion. Just as good is Rodrigo de la Serna in his feature film debut as Granado, effortlessly showing his character's bravado and humor while finding his own bumpy way in the world. His reactions to his buddy's political declaration at the birthday party, and to his own feelings during their goodbye at the end, are among the most poignant moments in the movie. In fact, much of the film's power comes from their palpable chemistry and unforced rapport. They are instantly and completely believable as best friends. And much more than the book, the film builds a solid emotional bridge between the young innocent and the Communist revolutionary Guevara was to become. If you are not aware of his fate, it is briefly summarized in subtitles at the end, and the coda with the real Granado is moving. While this may be the most glowing portrayal of a Communist-in-the-making since Warren Beatty's film about John Reed, "Reds", don't let that stop you from seeing this mesmerizing work. This is a wonderfully heartfelt film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a long motorcycle journey around South America. It's an adventure that shapes the future lives of a young doctor and a young biologist. They visit many towns and meet many people and they are constantly shocked at the hardships and the working man's lot.As most people realize South America has some magnificent scenery. A documentary drama needs more than that; and two or three falls from the motor bike in the early part of the journey does not add much interest or drama. Nor does the keeping of a diary.Nothing very interesting happens until the young men reach the leprosy hospital at San Pablo where they lend a hand for about three weeks. They win the hearts of the staff and patients and there is a genuine feeling of warmth when they depart and continue their journey.The two lead characters don't require a great range of acting ability. I do however believe that Ernesto's asthmatic attacks are convincing and I find myself most concerned as he chokes and struggles for air.The story makes light of the fact that Ernesto is a non-dancer and his birthday celebration among strangers is a nice touch and gives him the opportunity of making a little speech which as we all know will be followed by many more in his later life. Rodrigo de la Serna as Granado gives a solid performance if you'll pardon the expression. He provides most of the humour as he seeks out the girls at every port of call.At the end of the film we get a glimpse of the real Alberto Granada. This idea has been used in other films concerned with living people. It gives a little authenticity to the story, but I thought he looked rather sad as he contemplated the loss of his treasured friend Che Guevara many years ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great men are driven by compassion ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a young teen, I had read cover-to-cover Che's recipe for "Guerrilla Warfare." The book delved into the most effective techniques of Cuban Revolutionary war.One that struck me most was his use of "compassion" as an effective tool. He theorized that it was best to let the defeated soldiers of the dictatorship be freed. First, he said it was difficult to take and maintain prisoners as a guerrilla outfit. Second, by freeing them they develop a curiosity about the revolution and which in most cases lead to sympathy and support. Because for most conscripts being a soldier is a job out of need. Third, once the word goes around that surrendering soldiers are released, they are less inclined to resist once attacked by guerrilla forces.The concept of guerrilla warfare is not foreign to Americans. It was how the nation was liberated from Britain. However, in the period of cold war - the country found itself in the wrong side of many revolutionary wars in the impoverished and colonized nations. During this period, the C.I.A had branded every act of liberation as part of a global effort of Stalinist expansion, during a time of extreme paranoia that swamped the United States.Unlike, English colonies - most other European Colonial powers were extremely brutal. And extreme repression led to extreme resistance. Without any means of addressing their grievances, resistances typically landed on the laps of underground revolutionaries. On the other hand, no English colonies except for the United States ever succumbed to a revolution.The Motor Cycle diaries reveal the evolution of a great man of compassion. Compassion is the god of our soul. And it reverberates as we watch the transformation of a young man as he confronts the realities of brutal racism and colonization in the Latin countries of America.Ernesto "Che" Guevara, despite CIA propaganda stories was a great man of compassion. I enjoyed this movie enormously, and would encourage others to watch it before passing judgment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good buddy flick with some super scenery thrown in for good measure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming-of-age/biopic/road movie based on the memoirs of two Argentinean men, best friends who, in 1952, while in their 20s, set out from Buenos Aires on a six month adventure, traveling over 8,000 miles through South America. One was Ernesto Guevara de la Serna (played by the Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal), a medical student at the time, who would emerge just a few years later as Che Guevara, guerrilla hero of the Cuban revolution.The other was Alberto Granado (Argentinean actor Rodrigo De la Serna, a second cousin of the actual Che's), a biochemist a few years older than Guevara, who later accepted Che's invitation to establish a medical clinic in Cuba (at the end of the film, we see Granado as he is today, at age 82, still living in Cuba). The two friends begin their trip aboard an ailing, vintage motorcycle, proceed by foot after the bike dies, hitchhiking, and finally journey by boat, ending up as volunteers at a leper colony on the Amazon in Peru.The story features several standard humorous predicaments, the sort one expects in a tale of innocent young adventurers, and, in a sentimental fashion, it suggests how various encounters with impoverished peasants along the way gradually kindle a social consciousness in Guevara, who had grown up in comfortable urban middle class circumstances. If this were all there was to it, the film would be a yawner.It is better than that for two reasons. One is the majestic sweep of the lands through which the heroes travel. Patagonia, the long spine of Chile, and the Peruvian countryside, unfold before us in breathtaking fashion. But even this glorious visual bounty wouldn't make this film anything more than a good travelogue. This movie is made worthwhile because of the pairing of the two adventurers, characters who are delightfully dissimilar.Bernal's Guevara is soulful, pensive and introverted, while Rodrigo's Granado is fun loving, sunny, engaging, a great dancer. Both give performances that seem utterly natural and true, and the contrasting elements of their personalities give the film a richness that makes this one of the better "buddy movies" you'll be likely to see. (In Spanish) My rating: 7.5/10 (low B+). (Seen on 10/25/04). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acting, writing, cinematography.... what a combination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My main intent in reviewing this movie is to heap praise on actor Gael Garcia Bernal. What accounts for his unbroken string of excellent movies? Is he just particularly adept at choosing the right projects, or is he such a great actor that he elevates every movie in which he appears?Gael has portrayed the gamut of society, from a conflicted priest in "The Crime of Padre Amaro", to a lowlife punk in "Amores Perros". This is an actor has already proved his incredible range and versatility. He will never have to worry about being type cast.I have nothing but admiration for him, and I look forward what I expect will be a long and amazing career in films.This movie takes place in the 1950's, and depicts the true story of Ernesto Guevara...aka Che Guevara, before he became a revolutionary. He is played by Gael Garcia Bernal. Rodrigo de la Serna plays the part of his friend, Alberto Granado. The two daringly embark on a road adventure to see as much of South America as they can. The courage and daring this required is amazing. First, they were riding an old, unreliable motorcycle, and neither one had any significant amount of money to pay for the trip.Along the way, they witness not only scenic beauty and endless vistas, but crushing poverty and social injustice. This is the catalyst for Ernesto to later develop his Communist ideology and join the Cuban revolution with Castro.The trip often strains the friendship of the two adventurers, but also strengthens it. The two have amazing, life altering experiences they never would have had in their normal, sheltered lives back home.Beautiful cinematography makes Diarios de motocicleta a pleasure to watch. It gives you a sense of the huge tracts of unspoiled land in South America and helps explain why these two men would endure the hardships of their long journey. The very clever plot zigzags in a way that keeps you guessing.With different actors, this movie could have been a ho-hum experience. But thanks in great part the participation of Gael Garcia Bernal, this movie reached its true potential.</fullReview>

This film shows the journey of Che Guevara thru south America, in this movie you can understand him as a person, as how him became a revolutionary, seeing all the disgrace of the people and how their cultures are destroyed for money.This film shows who are and from where the Latin American people are, and how the culture of consumerism destroys the real culture, how some people live in absolutely poverty.The acting is absolutely great, a very recommendable flick, rent it or buy it, just don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>throw aside politics look at the cinematic value of that movie which is nicely done!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Critics tell us not to applaud this movie because they think "Che achieved nothing but disaster. Many of the early leaders of the Cuban Revolution favored a democratic or democratic-socialist direction for the new Cuba. But Che was a mainstay of the hard-line pro-Soviet faction, and his faction won. Che presided over the Cuban Revolution's first firing squads. He founded Cuba's "labor camp" system?the system that was eventually employed to incarcerate gays, dissidents, and AIDS victims. To get himself killed, and to get a lot of other people killed, was central to Che's imagination." Let alone such critics some viewers do think that the movie was an over-rated hero-worship movie by taking some of Che's action unrealistic(for example Che is invited to spend a frolicsome day with some friendly girls he meets but instead administers some kind of ineffectual medicine to an elderly woman and presumably writes a letter to his mother.defying a nun to shake hands with lepers, or even swimming across the river to be with the downtrodden common-folk, etc) I do seriously think these people do not look at the cinematic value of the movie. It seems to have a great message. I don't have to care what sort of person CHE is.I am watching a movie that is nicely done. People find their travel over-rated but for me it's better then watching the stupid travel "In search of wine. In search of women. In search of themselves" in the movie "Sideways". No matter what people say see this movie by taking its cinematic value. Throw aside politics,communism,revolution. Look at the movie!</fullReview>

From them you can see endless vigor., I shared their pain and joy from their unusual experience. Even I want to have a trip like them.Guevara and Alberto had different character. Guevara was calm and Alberto was active. The interaction between them was very funny. Their relationship reminded me of Miles and Jack (Sideways). In all they were good friend indeed.I appreciated the lively guitar music very much. Of cause the content was more uplifting. The most important thing is that finding what you really want to do and do it in your limited life.One of the best road movies. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You may or may not heroize Che. He did some awful things in the name of the greater good, according to him. I'm not commenting on the man and whether he was good or bad. Regardless, this movie inspires the viewer toward more compassion and love, and to think on the human condition. It instills a desire to be a better person. And that is a good thing. I'm afraid some people will be turned-off from this movie because of preconceptions of Che Guevara. That is irrelevant. View the movie as an art form. Art has many purposes, but I think one of the noblest purposes art can have is to propel the viewer toward his or her own betterment. So, if you don't believe the real Che has anything to teach you, the filmmakers do, so the purpose of the art form is complete.</fullReview>

Particularly good was the way they showed in their relationship, through thick and thin, hail storm or sunshine, that they loved each other. What a wonderful scene when they had to say goodbye! The fact that Walter Salles has done such a good job with this film means we might see him try and do Jack Kerouac's 'On the Road.' It's a pity that some people are brain washed by their governments into thinking certain things about Che Guevara, Castro and Cuba. I hope those few votes in Florida by exiled Cubans have been worth it. Did Castro really start the revolution in Cuba to join up with the Soviet Union or did he come to American first and was left with no choice? Who knows!

		<fullReview>Hi, I just finished watching the DVD. I was touched and moved,"conmovido", by the movie. I enjoyed very much the Argentinian accent and how they express themselves. So frank, so free, so rich.I loved taking the ride with them. Excellent cinematography. Beautiful images at the end of the film.It's no doubt Gael and Rodrigo portrayed excellent personalities of the "Che" Guevara and Alberto Granado. Very "simpatico" characters. You want to explore with them the unknown and the injustice they come across the road.A friend of mine told me that the director Walter Salles did not reach further on his quest to go deeper as he did with Central Station with the reality of life. But to me, you can understand what is going on in south America. I don't need to go back to the 50's. He can use this movie to reflect what is Latinamerica about.You can sense it right now. But, some of us might turn the heads and close the eyes. It does not matter, with eyes closed, hears blocked real life is happening right now. You know it. I know it. And that is why we feel compelled by this movie to identify what some parts of Latinamemica faces.It's a great film. Don't miss it. Rent it. I enjoyed a great film-making.Cut. Print.

		<fullReview>Films like Motorcycle Diaries fall into a category absolutely apart from any other kinds of movie. Latest I can recall like this one is "The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind". What's the connection?, you might be wondering if you are versed on cinematography ... well, the strong effect on feeling and not on mind I must answer, and this, very, very few films do achieve.Personally, I do not stand for the message that "Che Guevara" carries, which is that of violence as a means to achieve certain supposedly good things for mankind; I just don't stand for violence.And still, I must admit that "Motorcycle Diaries" reflects very well a certain period of Guevara's life. The film smells truth, and the situations are quite real. The pace slows down a little bit in the second half and that's why I'm voting an 8 instead of a 9 or a 10. Anyway, a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give It A Break</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think much critical and commercial success carries with it the taint of a film's being seen as suspect. Ditto anything produced by Redford. One senses almost reflexively the edgy feeling of possibly being manipulated. This is especially so when the subject of the film is an historical person who for some was a saint and for others a monster.The best way of viewing such a film is to eschew all the hype and innuendo and evaluate it on its own merits. This film is about the youthful excesses of a middle-class man (there was such a thing in Argentina at the time) who leaves home and discovers that the world is surprisingly rich in other than bourgeois values. In that sense, it zeroes in both visually and metaphorically on glorious geographical detail and the fascinating complexity of human life in Latin America in the years just prior to what I would term the "third wave" of revolution in that area -- the first being independence from Spain and the second involving moving from an agrarian to an industrial economic base.Thus the awakening of the protagonist to the inherent social evils of what had evolved as a military-industrial domination of the continent is easy to understand. He was destined to immerse himself in the suffering of the lowest levels of society in order to become, for better or worse, the larger than life character we know today. The rest is just cinematic fluff that the viewer can take or leave alone. Bernal does a respectable job for the most part, but I would have preferred a native Argentine in the role, like Leonardo Sbaraglia -- a little less boyish and a better fit for a tragic figure.Don't take too many preconceptions with you into the theater on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the Motorcycle Diaries with a friend on its final night, we'd been putting it off for a while and were glad we went. I was kind of expecting more of a road trip type of movie but it turned out to be much more than that. Although I was not really aware of Ernesto "Che" Guevara's political career I am now and this movie depicts what drove him to get involved in his chosen cause. Although I do not support communism I could definitely see how seeing the poverty and suffering of the poor in South America could galvanize a person into action. A few friends of mine have been to South America and have commented on the poverty they saw there, I guess this film was perhaps intended to be a social commentary as much as it was meant to be entertaining. In spite of all this heavier content there were still plenty of comic moments and conversation to be enjoyed as well. Definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>South American movies at their best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very rarely that I would give a movie the highest score, but Motorcycle Diaries really deserves it. The beauty of South American landscapes is shown so clearly but it is the people of those landscapes that grab our attention as the movie shows the gradual change in Che. The experiences shown make us understand why, at least partially, a promising medical student became the celebrated revolutionary martyr we are all familiar with today.It is not a movie about social issues or politics yet the humour and powerful story bring those issues to light without screaming political correctness. The two main actors' talent just shines throughout the movie with an excellent supporting cast. Another amazing feature although the movie is based on truth is that there is no glossing over the bad qualities of the characters, they are presented in a humorous and very realistic light. It really is a story about two friends who take a motorbike ("The great one") ride across South America during the fifties before they take their separate life paths and knowing their eventual fates does not take away from the story or spoil the enjoyment from watching it.Wonderful scenery, great cast, moving story - all this elements together are rarely integrated in one movie. As the advertisements say it: "A movie not to be missed!" For once, they are right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Salles' exhilaratingly relaxed re-creation of the epic voyage that young medical student Ernesto Guevara (Bernal) took around South America in 1952 together with the biochemist Alberto Granado (de la Serna) is both a light-touched examination of the kind of experiences that began turning the former into 'Che', and - thanks to the way the film crew welcomed the locals they encountered into the movie itself - a subtle reminder that the social and political problems facing Latin Americans back then are far from resolved. Often improvising along with his able and extremely charismatic actors, Salles concentrates on character and milieu rather than plot or 'message', so that even the duo's life-changing stay in an Amazonian leper colony is mercifully bereft of rhetoric and melodrama. Gautier's camera is adept at catching the telling glance or gesture, while Gustavo Santaolalla's music contributes to the overall freshness of the approach. Very fine indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is my opinion about the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This particular movie is based on a true story; The Motorcycles Diaries is a motivating and thrilling adventurous movie that gives the notion of youthful origins of a revolutionary spirit. The film follows tow daring friends, Ernesto "Che" Guevara and Alberto Granado {two doctors} who travels on a beat-up motorcycle for an amazing and exciting road trip across Latin America. The movie starts of with both friend leaving there families before taking off to there journey. Ernesto wrote about all the features and site the he saw alone the journey across Latin America. Latin America has many great sceneries and also many great problem. Some of the biggest plans are located in Latin America. Some places like Temuco Chile, Valparalso Chile, Diedra Del Aguila Argentina, and Desierto de Atagama are some of the largest places in Latin America which contain great plans, mountains, and Acers of land for growing crops. Also, in these great places in Latin America there were many problems with sickness, poverty, and lack of crops. There where so many people that had to live poverty and in lack because of no money to provide for themselves. These situation that many people in Latin America have lived the life that this move portraits.From what I have learned in Latin American history class about Latin America, in pertaining to the movie The Motorcycle diaries, what I have learn is highly accurate and believable about the history of Latin America. Some of the reason it believable is because the movie shows the lives of people in Latin America and the lifestyles. Example, the hard labor, life of migrants, struggle for a life of success to provide for there families and sickness and disease unable to be care for because of expenses. Some of the things the director left out were in what plan and land were the crops grown for the different parts of the countries in Latin America. One thing that would have been have been helpful about the historical context would be, what was the purpose of the two brother traveling throw Latin America issuing medicine and helping people they know, are even what 's the purpose of leaving home to see a world that you have never see before at risk. In a personal opinion, by expressing or acting out what did the two brother want to accomplish during there journey across Latin America would have been helpful as far as understanding the historical context. As I review the movie as a story, the plot of the story was to show the injustices between the ill and the well. The Characters play there part very good to how the plot of the movie try to show. The two characters Ernesto and Alberto catered to the ill and sickly and learn about how they were treat form the well, as it plays a part in how people were treated were the two doctors were originally from. This was very good acting from the characters. The movie was really worth watching because it's based on a true story. Plus it showed real issues people in Latin America history have dealt with. This is worth watching educationally because your knowledge of Latin American issues will increase. In Conclusion, this movie shows many things about two adventuring doctors trying to see the world of Latin America. On the way there they help sick and ill people with there medicines. From a scale of 1-10, awful or great, I would rate the movie a 9 and great because the entertainment was hilarious and funny, and also help to my knowledge about Latin American history which was very help to this final projected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Motorcycle Diaries attempts to explain the early revolutionary foundations Ernesto Che Guevara, who fought alongside Castro in the Cuban Revolution. The movie chronicles his journey through the length of South America with his friend Alberto. The movie's based on The Motorcycle Diaries by Guevara himself and Traveling with Che Guevara by Alberto Granado. Ernesto, played by Gael Garcia Bernal, and Alberto, played by Rodrigo De la Serna, reach a point of maturity by the end of the movie as both are faced with the injustices suffered by the indigenous workers at the hands of imperialism and capitalism. The story ends with their stay and volunteer work at a leper colony isolated on the Amazon River in Peru.Che comes from a relatively well-off family in Corbada, Argentina where he is an aspiring medical student. Guevara is only 23 and Granado only 29 at the onset of the journey set in 1952. Both are idealistic and are out to have a good time ? especially the charismatic and funny Alberto, who mostly looks forward to getting laid (and does in factaccomplishes).More and more, Ernesto confronts injustices throughout the continent. One particular example is his encounter with a couple who is kicked off their land by capitalists and forced to travel to find work. The meeting makes such a strong impression Ernesto gives the couple the $15 his girlfriend gave him to buy her a swimsuit in the U.S. Such an action is meant to be a portent of the Marxist revolutionary he was to become. His travels through South America would also enlighten him for the need of a unified South America ? briefly explored in a poignant speech given towards the end of the movie but unsuccessfully undertaken before his death in 1967. The leprosy colony at which the duo volunteers their medical expertise finally portrays them as the mature men they were meant to be.Unlike many of the road trip movies we usually see, this movie is a serious depiction of an important figure in Latin America's history. It is not compacted with lots of slap-stick nonsense of two bumbling fools. The viewer can truly understand their transformations as a result of their well-developed experiences. Gael Garcia Bernal did an excellent job of portraying a serious, sincere, and likable fellow and Rodrigo De la Serna's well-executed comedy definitely will bring more than one smile to your face. The two actors compliment each other quite well on screen. The cinematography is beautiful and the mellow tempo of the music highlights the movie well throughout.</fullReview>

I saw it in Spanish, its original language, and I think that it's better, because seeing the film in another language it loses some of its essence. I think too many people doesn't know in what conditions live the people of South America and we can know it with this film. It is also a pity and an injustice that the producers of Hollywood have not wanted to promote the film too much, although it has received numerous positive critics.

		<shortDescription>Great movie, shows why Che became the great hero he was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting was excellent, and it shows the idiosyncrasy and simplicity of the great Latin American people, something not known by many people from the 'developed' countries... and how a man left behind the comforts of the city and progress, how he learns from the poor and marginal and attempts change their world.. a one-man crusade practically.. It shows how crude society is, idealism, true leadership, honesty, moral values, altruism.. all virtues that are hard to find in today's world.. the kind of story you will never see in a Hollywood production! It is not necessary to live in a communist regime, but it would be a much better place to live with more people like Che. Greed is in human nature, and it is when you Give that you set yourself free, that is the vision of idealists like Che, Jesus, and some of us, regardless of the location, and why the Greedy men can't tolerate this behavior!! Hasta la Victoria Siempre, Vamos Argentina Carajo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Engine of Change</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie remains true to its tag-line presented at the beginning of the film: It is not a story of heroes, simply a story of two impassioned individuals (sic). The simplicity with which this story is told carries no outright political agenda whatsoever. Much unlike "Good Morning Vietnam," or "Platoon" or even "Apocalypse Now" which became the rallying cry for second generation foreign policy activists (the first being the hippies of 1960s American lore) the "..Diaries" carries no inherent political message. Although it may contain one in its subtext, the focus of the film is on the heart of the viewer instead of the viewer's mind or sense of ethics. Therein lies the genius. Hollywood and its directors (not necessarily limited to the examples above) have been made notorious for unapologetically advancing political agenda through the medium of film. Although Robert Redford himself has been reviled as a communist-sympathizer, in producing this film, he retains a level of detachment by merely presenting a story based on the diary of two young Argentinian men in search of themselves. Of course, by the end of the movie, the viewer sees the overall goal (which I won't ruin for IMDb members here) and the true significance of portraying the film in such a manner. As a closing note to this review, I would like to justify my rating of the film. I would imagine that many who had rated this film sub-par or awful would balk at the thought of even reading this, but if they've made it this far, this last segment is for them. The film deserves a 10 rating not because of its historical accuracy or because of its attempt to over-glorify an international political figure with a "storybook" portrayal. The rating is there because of the innate simplicity of the story which leaves the reader to draw his or her own conclusion and opinions of the themes presented within the framework of the 2 hours and 7 minutes in which the story is divulged.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A revolutionary film, but not a Revolutionary film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think that this film was about Che the revolutionary. It is instead about Ernesto, discovering the country and continent that he is a part of, and coming of age to discover that the privilege that his family is fortunate enough to be a part of was unfortunately not the life of the majority of those living in South America - especially not those indigenous to the continent.In the end, it becomes a film about the revolution of the mind rather than the revolution of the people. We see the path that Che Guevara was set upon without seeing the destination - this gives us stronger understanding of the character of Ernesto without being bombarded with Che's ideologies. And yes, they are separate personalities - the raw and the evolved, if you will.You can clearly see the path to the man who fought for liberation and the rights of the South American and Cuban peoples, but I'm glad they left politics out of the film - it's MUCH stronger for it, even if the film wasn't one hundred percent accurate.As well, the parallels between this film and Hero astound me. I would never suggest that Hero had any influence on The Mtorcycle Diaries - even though it did come out a couple of years ago - but the fact that it DIDN'T have any influence makes those parallels that much more astounding. If you will:1) Both films are about the goal of uniting a divided people and a divided land (the warring Chinese nations vs. South America divided along lines of ethnicity and class in addition to borders)2) Both films are about the liberation of the people from the oppression that they suffer.3) Both films focus on the LAND - from the awe-inspiring colours and landscapes of Hero to the all-weather and hardened South American land in The Motorcycle Diaries.4) Both films are about politics without ever actually touching on politics.5) In both films, the hero must go through quite a lot of hardships and discover a lot about PEOPLE that they were never able to, beforehand.Like Hero, The Motorcycle Diaries will give me much to dwell upon, and it is strongly relevant to our time and our treatment of people, in a personal, social and communal way. Go see both films and compare - you will take home something from both of them, hopefully something that opens your mind and heart to the people around you.</fullReview>

It teaches the lesson of idealism, compassion, and determination through a journey of a medical school student ("Che")took with his best pal. Just like the trip changed Che's life and the life of many others, this movie has the power to change the life of many viewers. It was well directed and acted. It had many powerful moments and developed the main characters really well. The part when Che swam across the river was particularly moving and affecting.

		<shortDescription>One of 2004's best films- how Ernesto begins to turn into Che</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Turning 30 is often perceived as a landmark in many people's lives- after all, three decades of living it is assumed that we ought to have an idea of what we are doing and what we want. And Alberto Granado knew exactly what he wanted for his 30th birthday: to have fun and to explore. Faithful to that goal, he embarked on the ultimate road trip for this occasion, along with a young Ernesto Guevara on board "la poderosa," or the mighty one, an old and leaky Norton motorcycle. Counting on improvisation as their modus operandi, the two took a break from school to transverse the unknown continent beyond Argentina's borders. But as someone in the movie pointed out, "let the world change you and then you can change the world," and after this trip, one would start working at a hospital, and the other one would begin a revolution. One became a doctor, and the other became "Che." This was no mere trip, but more of a voyage that the further the pair went, the deeper the transformation of Ernesto into the person that eventually became the Che.The cinematography is stunning, with ample views of the Argentine Pampas, the Andes, Chile's arid north, and Peru's lost city of Machu Picchu. For this movie, parts the actual path taken by the adventurers is shown, as it has changed little after fifty years. But La Poderosa was no match for a trip of such epic proportions, and meets its final fate not long into the trip in Chile, making hitchhikers from the rickety riders. As a result, what started as a travel continued as a saga, allowing the explorers to come into close contact with much of the human misery and social injustice that permeate (present tense) the region.The movie is a masterpiece of story telling. Buoyed by earlier performances (Amorres Perros, Y tu mama tambien), Gael Garcia's portrayal of the young, pensive and asthmatic Che cements his place among the finest actors of his upcoming generation. Rodrigo de la Serna's role of Alberto as the fun-loving (if slightly obsessive and explosive) but ultimately caring friend is equally flawless.There is a genuine element to The Motorcycle Diaries that leaves the audience with the feeling that they have seen more of an actual footage than a simple re-enactment for the cameras- not a story being told, but being presented instead. This feeling of veracity is bolstered by the extra features found on the DVD: the making of the movie, and an interview with Alberto Granado. The director and cast consulted extensively with him in Cuba, and one cannot help but be moved by the glitter found in eyes of the octogenarian when he reminisces about a trip that he took over fifty years ago, and the devotion he still has towards his beloved friend (when in doubt, still asking himself, "what would Che do?") Walter Salles' directing is subtle, and at points laconic, mindful of the fact that a transformation of an individual occurs within, and it is pointless to try to spell out such changes in a dialog, or even words for that matter. This tacit approach to storytelling is in stark contrast with many of mainstream movies where ideas are explicitly presented, built into the dialog, and even highlighted within the script for the audience. This movie of the Che before he became an iconic image of the past two generations could easily be considered among 2004's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite a satisfying film overall covering Ernesto's 'road' trip through South America in 1952 with his friend Alberto.I have to confess that I watched the film mainly for its South American landscapes, of which there are plenty. It was fascinating to see Guevara's character change as the trip progressed, although the portrayal of this was rather heavy handed in places. The film also seemed to change pace two thirds of the way through - this final section didn't work quite so well.Nevertheless, this film is highly recommended and will appeal to fans of the road trip genre. I'll buy the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, THE (dir. by Walter Salles) I just caught this before it left the theaters and I'm glad I did. Like most of you, I read this at THAT age when I was also reading stuff like Malcolm X's autobiography and the Tao of Pooh. I'm still down with it all. I waited until the last minute mostly because I was sort of worried this would seem trite or simplistic to me now.In fact, "The Motorcycle Diaries" is a beautiful and for the most part understated look at Che's legendary trip across South America that led to his political awakening. Rather than give you some really obvious political rite of passage, you get a beautiful story about the love of the people and the land. More so than his Marxist adopted philosophy, you get to see how the trip evolved his ideas of internationalism. Out of the theater, the audience can analyze for themselves how internationalism is something you feel and how revolution is not something you can simply learn in college.Director Walter Salles knows what he's doing. The film is as warm and concerned as his other films like "Central Station" and "Behind The Sun". His footage of Machu Picchu is as beautiful as "Aguirre". He must have found the exact same stoop that Herzog used.Gael Garcia Bernal is great as the pre-revolutionary Che. Actually, he's the pre-Che Che. I don't know if I've seen him in a movie I didn't like. "Amores Perros", "Y Tu Mama Tambien", "Crime of Padre Amaro" and even "Don't Tempt Me". I'm really curious about "Cuba Libre". I'm not really familiar with Rodrigo De La Serna. But he's great as Alberto Granado, Che's travel partner.Hey, I like communist movies. I like communist everything. But this movie is beautiful to watch no matter what you think of Che. It's one of those movies that I just can't imagine transferring to the small screen with even half of its power.It's great to see that the new found popularity and power of Latino and Latina stars has lead to such great biopics that reach large North American audiences starting with Frida and now this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(7/10) - for a buddy flick (3/10) - for a biographical beginnings movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched The Motorcycle Diaries last night.Meant to be representational of Che Guavara's youth and the trip on a motorcycle which led to his change in career from Medicine to politics, it feels more like a gritty buddy-flick up until the end where the singular 'speech' by Che occurs re: how his America (South America) is being fractured by outside forces (money and Capitalism) to the point where people from different villages don't know each other anymore.Going into the movie, I didn't know that it was a story about Che Guavara...I wasn't told. I figured it out after his nickname "Che" was used twice in quick succession. As a buddy flick and as a story about growing up and facing realities, it's an excellent flick. As a flick about Che Guavara...it has failed. Meant to convey the 'why' of his efforts from his 23rd birthday until his assassination in 1967...it only offers a quick peek but precious little introspection. It shows where he gets his strength, surely...but not his direction. It shows the initial push, but none of the inertia. It certainly doesn't talk about why he left his native country and went to Cuba as part of a revolution. It doesn't speak of how a young doctor-to-be would give up his Hippocratic oath and find himself in such a violent revolution. How someone who would give up his own medication to help save an old woman who is sure to die, would change his personality so dramatically.Frankly, to say that this movie is infected with Hollywoodism is too imprecise a statement. I believe that although this film is beautiful to watch with its stunning scenery, and well shot with its switches from Black and White to full-colour and back to indicate mood, that is still fails to convey its message. The humanizing of Che Guevara for the general populace falls flat because we're left watching a movie about someone who has the same name, but doesn't seem to be the same person. (7/10) - for a buddy flick (3/10) - for a biographical beginnings movie.**On a side note...despite it being in a language which I only understand somewhat, and the fact that I kept having to refer to the subtitles...the movie moves along without stops and starts. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was really nice to see Gael Garc眼 Bernal in something else. Bad Education was the last I saw of him. This movie however seemed to have the basic premises of Sideways. Two men taking a cross country trip together, transforming themselves, the way they look at things and their relationship to each other. Beautiful cinematography and genuinely good acting, just nothing I considered outstanding &amp; above &amp; beyond unfortunately. I look forward to seeing Gael in many more movies that will put his talents to the test because, I think he has a lot to offer as far as an actor goes. It wasn't the worst movie I have seen but wasn't the best movie I have seen. I really enjoyed the b&amp;w stills at the end of the film. They just made me stop &amp; stare at the screen, transfixed for a few moments as these beautiful faces full of expression, depth, feelings, extreme texture flashed slowly before my eyes.

		<fullReview>I watched this movie tonight and I now have troubles writing down my thoughts. So I'll start right away with saying that the movie is not boring at all and all the critics that said it is boring probably watched Spiderman2 one time too many.The second thing that comes to mind is how well the two main actors played. They seemed real, very real. You could actually feel everything they were doing. A really rare performance of acting, something that you enjoy watching even if the movie itself is stupid which it isn't. When "Che" had an asthma attack on the boat I actually felt sick with him which was really unpleasant but also amazing. I can't recall any movie that made me actually feel the character that way.In overall the movie tried to show how this trip across the whole continent changed "Che" and his friend but I think that in that point it failed miserably. I really didn't see any point in all those random people that the movie showed from different countries in the Spanish side of South America. But my biggest problem is that "Che" himself wrote the diaries so I can't say "No way, that couldn't effect him". And since I didn't read the book saying that the movie didn't show the book very well will be only a guess. So either the "Che" writes badly or the movie is not very well done.Anyway, the movie is full of view on the most different locations in south America and it looks amazing! I won't say that the cinematography is too good but the views are so beautiful that the movie still looks amazing in this aspect.So all in all the movie is quite interesting, the acting is great, the movie looks great but feels empty after all. I will still recommend anyone who gets sick from the thought of watching Spiderman2 for the second time to watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Motorcycle Diaries, without doubt, is the best biopic in the world and that's saying something. It's a journey that takes the viewer all across South America with two great and watchable actors playing two great and interesting characters - Ernesto Guevara De La Serna and Alberto Granado. The story is an emotional one with themes of heart-ache, self-discovery, friendship, illness... The list is endless. Don't be fooled, this is not the kind of tearful, Oscar-grabbing film that you see every month or so. The film at many points is funny and touching, while at others it is tense or contemplative. It seems strange that so much was fitted into one film, yet it never seems busy. This movie is a real eye-opener and it's very hard to describe the emotional ride it will take you on. Long live The Mototrcycle Diaries!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I have to say that Gael Garcia Bernal and Rodrigo De La Serna shine altogether in this magnificent film. Their sincere and amazing performances are one of the key elements that make this movie a masterpiece. With an exquisite tour along the Latin America and a direct introduction to the native people of places like Argentina, Chile and Peru, this movie is not only a firsthand approach to the lives of the impoverished, which causes the most moving and breathtaking experience throughout the film, but also a fantastic depiction of Latin life and culture. And, still, this is only the first target at which the movie aims, and hits so hard, because there's also the life of the great, great Ernesto Guevara, who is one of the most remarkable personalities of human history. His ongoing joyfulness and admiration for others stands out at every moment. He is caring, compassionate, helpful and most of all generously humane. There are so many great scenes during the movie that say about all aspects of Ernesto's life and which need no explanation, since they speak for themselves. Even if you have never heard of Ernesto Guevara, which I truly doubt, I assure you'll get to know pretty much of his brave and daring personality. Technically, the cinematography is one of the main achievements of this film. 10/10</fullReview>

First the incredible performances by Gael Garcia Bernal, as the young Che Guevara and Rodrigo De la Serna as his friend, Alberto Granado. Also the scenery was some of the best in film history. This is the story of a young medical student Ernesto Guevara and his friend travel from their hometown in Argentina and travel up the west coast of South America until reaching Venezuela. Their travails are very well encapsulated in this trip. It is also fascinating to see the change from a idealistic medical student to the beginnings of the revolutionary Che was to become. It is very emotional at times and the friendship between these two men was great to see. Even during certain moments where you knew what the outcome was going to be, like Che's swimming across the river and whether he was going to make it or not was still tense and exciting.

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, inspirational film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reaching for the human being behind the Athena poster, Walter Salles' adaptation of Ernesto 'Che' Guevara's youthful diaries is simply one of the best road movies ever.In 1952, young Argentines Che, a medical student, and his friend Alberto Granado, a biochemist, decide to see South America for themselves and set out on an ambitious trip through their homeland and Chile to Peru on a ramshackle 1939 Norton 500.Their journey is punctuated by breakdowns, accidents, hardships, spectacular scenery and, eventually, hitch-hiking ? but more important is the sense of the two friends accessing their cultural heritage and finding so much of it cut adrift by the economic imperatives of the very system which made their lives in Buenos Aires so comfortable.By the time they arrive to volunteer at a leper colony, their experiences and meditations have left them questioning all the old values, sowing the seeds for the remarkable work they would do in the future.It would have been easy for Salles to get the emphasis wrong, to slip into well-intentioned sledgehammer polemic, but he's far too subtle for that and delivers a measured hymn to idealism and freedom peppered with humour and wit. This isn't the kind of self-important hagiography turned out by the likes of Richard Attenborough but an intimate drama of a time when two lives ran parallel for a while and it's a balance captured to perfection in the quietly majestic performances of Gael Garc眼 Bernal (Che) and Rodrigo de la Serna (Alberto).At its heart, The Motorcycle Diaries is the story of a remarkable friendship between two men and, by extension, the fraternity they come to feel for their fellows.Deeply moving, beautifully crafted, inspirational film-making like this doesn't come down the road too often, so stick your thumb out.</fullReview>

To watch this movie, you firstly need to know a little about Che Guevara and South America.To watch it as a movie, it is breathtaking, both the storyline and the cinematography. To have been born in Chile and to know the history of Latin America and to watch it through a film was moving.The movie was in Spanish with English subtitles, at one point I closed my eyes and just listened, it was like listening to poetry as Spanish is a very beautiful and romantic language, so if you're into poetry, this is perfect.To watch the metamorphosis of El Che into the great revolutionary he became was as if you got to know him. The actors did the movie great justice and the "real" people in the movie, made this movie...real. This is a film that you will want to watch over and over again, at least it is for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>South-African Cinema......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This post is not explicitly about "The Motorcycle Diaries" (although it is about the state of cinema in the developing world- Southern South America has quite a prodigious output these days). I just didn't want my (I think) worthy message board post (which is what the post that follows originally was) to get lost in the madness down there....About the lack of an Oscar nomination for "The Motorcycle Diaries": "I am a South-African and I am personally hoping that, as far as "fringe world cinema" is concerned, one of our films, "Yesterday" (2004), wins (it has been nominated). What a condescending term "fringe world cinema" is, eh? It's more a patriotic thing than a statement about the film's excellence. It is very good, but manipulative. It is about HIV/AIDS in rural Kwazulu Natal (the province in our country most severely affected by the virus- I could get you some stats but you'd probably weep). South-Africa gets a great deal of good press throughout the world. We do, in print, have one of the most 'liberal/ democratic', for lack of a better term, constitutions in the world- it even seems likely that legislation on the right to legal gay marriage will go through sometime in the foreseeable future. It is still, however, the country with the highest prevalence of HIV infection in the world (you've seen the sappy, self-aggrandizing Oprah episodes, yes) despite multi billion rand (our currency) awareness campaigns. Sad, huh? Anyway/.... see the movie if you can. It could have been better, but its still worth a watch.Forget the dismal rating it got at IMDb.com (from an equally dismal 38 votes!!). It REALLY is not at all THAT bad (who the hell are those 38 morons anyway??). It is well filmed (good budget) and a very thoughtful (if small) film. Seeing that HIV/AIDSs in Africa is a touchy question for the 'elite', a broad term again, including those wealthier personages in our own country who can afford movie tickets who choose to ignore the problem as a rarefied poor/ township/ 'dirty'/ black/ oversexed youth problem. the film has not found itself an adequate distributor in the "West" and it only got a limited, art circuit release over here. It is strange that an Oscar nominated film with an African subject should be seen by so few people at what a site that is touted as "EARTH'S BIGGEST MOVIE DATABASE" See also, if you can "Story of an African Farm" (2004), based on Olive Schreiner's book (1886). It glosses over many pertinent questions the book (mostly unselfconsciously and implicitly) raises about Colonialism and hybrid etc. and is "cute", and worth (slightly) less of a look than "Yesterday", but 'tis okay. It is slight, but if you want a window on one of the most stunning desert landscapes in the world (the Karoo), this is it.That film (again well crafted and made with care) got 7 votes IN TOTAL on IMDb (despicable). The world ignores African films, seems to have an aversion to them. There aren't many out there (lets be realistic 'n all), but it is a market which is trying to emerge, one which will never be able to emerge if people carry on ignoring it. Which is just bloody sad. There are many worthy subjects, subjects as worthy as that depicted in "The Motorcycle Diaries", that our continent has to offer. There are those that would say that oral narrative cultures adapt the best to the film format, but I won't push a point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now, for a taste of things to come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mototrcycle Diaries, for me, is one of those films, that makes you want to get out of your life and go away, somewhere else, where everything is different and life is an adventure. The film, telling a story about a journey, becomes a journey for the viewer as well after a while and although nothing spectacular happens and the film is not as dramatic as many Hollywood films of it's kind are (like I'm expecting The Aviator to be for instance), it manages to hold your attention for two hours without getting boring.My favorite part of the film is, when the two friends arrive at their medical destination, for then we get the biggest glimpse of what Ernesto and Alberto are really about and it is then when we find out most about them. It is kind of funny, that we must wait so long to really get to know the two and the main criticism I have of the film is, that it doesn't pay a lot of attention to who the two really are (except for their basic attitude). Also I felt that that the film was a little short on information sometimes and often missed that adventure feeling. If you'd want to put what I want to say in a nutshell, it would be this: 'Having a message is important, but a film also needs to set a distinct note.' Now while some American movies tend to overdo it on that department (being over-sentimental and dramatic or spending too much time and effort on the adventure part) this movie could have done a bit more on that department. I can see what the director tried to do with this movie, but I felt that the feelings the friends endured on the road could have been crystallized more. The irritation at each other, Ernesto's (what feeling???) when he got that important letter or Alberto's excitement after his afternoon of sight-seeing. I felt that these points, although not as important as some of the facets that the film highlighted, could have been able to get you drawn into the adventure and into the characters more.Overall this neither a bad film, nor a good one, despite the fact that the effort of cast and crew is good. For me it all depended on the director approaching this movie on a 'taste of thing to come' manner. Walter Salles focused all of his effort on Ernesto's future as a revolutionary leader and spending almost not time on the feeling of youth and freedom as I've so often felt it while on travels. The film, should have been a mix, now it just off balance. What could have helped maybe would have been a short portrait of Ernesto and Alberto as students, but maybe all of this wasn't in the books either.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie almost reaches a state of perfection.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Diarios de motocicleta is a movie that shows the possible sophistication of the medium of film as well as the expertise of the director and the acting cast. Very cleverly the filmmaker chose to focus on the youth of a revolutionary, rather than the decisions (some of which inevitably include violence) that an adult would have to make; those decisions that a person who has thought long and hard about their personal philosophy would have to make. The film is beautifully shot, the cinematography an integral part of its beauty, without becoming a gimmick like in a recent reactionary Chinese film (beautiful colours but vapid, ie: "Hero"). The young actor who portrays Che is just wonderful, he manages to show the inherent goodness of a young bourgeois transformed into something else through a road trip. His friend is just as wonderfully portrayed. This is truly an accomplishment in the history of film and time will show this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Motorcycle Diaries: 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Che Guevara has become a teenage fad of sorts. I don't know why, or how, but he is. It's sad, too, because I can safely say that the majority of the teenage population does not know why Guevara was important. But that's not the story here in The Motorcycle Diaries. That's the story of Guevara (Gael Garcia Bernal) and his friend Alberto (Rodrigo De la Serna) taking a road trip through South America on a ratty old motorcycle. Throughout their journey, they run out of money and their motorcycle breaks down many times, causing them to lie about who they are (saying that they're doctors) so they have places to stay. Throughout the way, they notice the injustices brought upon some of the people there.Che Guevara, being the leader of the Cuban revolution, needed to have some sort of provocation for his revolution. The movie provides the evidence (based on his own diaries), and it's fascinating at first. Seeing how everything changes Guevara's mind is very thought-provoking...for the first few times it's shown. After about something like 45 minutes into the movie, we get the point of what the movie's trying to say. We get that everything Guevara sees changes him, and we need something more in it. But nothing more is given, and what we have left to look at is the magnificent scenery.Bernal and de la Serna are both very good, but can that make up for the lack of a real sustaining plot worthy of two hours? Now, that's not to say that The Motorcycle Diaries is bad, in fact, it's pretty entertaining. When watched with half an eye, it could even be considered great. But all that's in my head now is the non-variety in the plot, the music, and how short this review is.My rating: 7/10Rated R for language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The simplest criticism I can make of The Motorcycle Diaries is thatit has no climax. Everything seems to be adding up to something,but the audience is never really taken for the ride. Everything else is just wonderful. The cinematography- bleak andgritty- is absolutely breathtaking. The score provides a melancholymood- similar to the one created in Burt Bacharach's score fromButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The acting, especially byGael Garc眼 Bernal and Rodrigo De la Serna, has just the rightamount of humbleness and reservation. Even the story isextraordinary, just incomplete.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Always be capable of feeling deep inside any injustice committed against anyone anywhere in the world." - Ch GuevaraThe Motorcycle Diaries is about the early years of Marxist revolutionary hero Ernesto Ch Guevara and the process that led him to give up a promising medical career to become a radical activist. Directed by Brazilian Walter Salles and adapted from the journals of Guevara and his traveling companion Alberto Granado, the film shows how their 8,000 mile road trip across South America in 1952 on a 1939 Norton motorcycle led to Guevara's powerful transformation. The narration, based on Guevara's observations in his diaries and his letters home during the time that he was away, gives the film a poetic tone that contrasts sharply with the earthy screenplay of Jose Rivera. Rodrigo de la Serna, an Argentine actor, plays the lusty biochemist Alberto who is there for Ch when he is suffering asthma attacks and his aid in their constant struggle to find food and shelter. Gael Garcia Bernal (Y Tu Mama Tambien) portrays Guevara as an appealing middle class youth coming face to face with injustice, perhaps for the first time in his life.The trip takes the two friends from Buenos Aires, west to Patagonia, Chile, through the snow-covered Andes, then north to Cuzco, Machu Picchu and Lima. The journey is beautifully photographed by Eric Gautier and the gorgeous vistas of South America themselves are worth the price of admission. In the middle of the Atacama desert in Chile, Guevara meets a family looking for work at the Chuquicamata copper mine, the world's largest open-pit mine, run by American mining conglomerates and a symbol of U.S. economic domination. Their chances of finding work are slim since they are Communists, yet they have no alternative but to keep going in order to survive. Guevara writes in his diary: "By the light of the single candle ? the contracted features of the worker gave off a mysterious and tragic air ? the couple, frozen stiff in the desert night, hugging one another, were a live representation of the proletariat of any part of the world." Feeling their plight, he offers them the fifteen U.S. dollars given to him by his wealthy girlfriend when he left Miramar, Argentina.The travelers volunteer for three weeks at San Pablo, a leper colony deep in the Amazon where nuns enforce a strict separation between patients and staff and refuse to feed anyone that does not attend mass. Guevara rebels against the rules and refuses to attend mass or wear rubber gloves when greeting patients. To show his solidarity with the lepers he swims across a two and one-half stretch of the Amazon to be with the patients on his 24th birthday. On this occasion, he gives his first political speech. "We believe, he said, "and after this trip even more firmly than before, that Latin America's division into illusory and uncertain nationalities is completely fictitious". When Alberto goes to work in Venezuela, Ch returns to Buenos Aires proclaiming himself a changed man. "I will be on the side of the people ? I will take to the barricades and the trenches, screaming as one possessed, will stain my weapons with blood, and, mad with rage, will cut the throat of any vanquished foe I encounter," he writes in his diary.Though its political implications are not hidden, The Motorcycle Diaries stays away from sermonizing except to ask -- what is the Latin American identity beyond the strong colonial influence, the different languages, and the varying political systems? Salles does not offer any answers and touches on issues of class-consciousness and injustice from a safe distance. Although the film endorses idealism in a world grown cynical, it offers its radicalism as an entertaining road trip, a cinematic T-shirt for comfortable middle class audiences that ignores such untidy adjuncts of social upheaval as internment camps, prisoners shot on sight, and bloodlust against real or perceived enemies. Nothing is said about conditions in present day Latin America where the richest 10 percent account for 35 percent of total earnings, where 43 percent of the population live below the poverty line, and where 20 million people are poorer today than they were in 1997.Guevara was a revolutionary who fought for social justice and his legend is an inspiration to thousands who languish under oppressive regimes, yet beyond the myth is a complex and driven man capable of ruthlessness and hard line adherence to an ideology that trampled on human rights. The Motorcycle Diaries succeeds in preserving the symbol but overlooks the man, simplistically presenting only the sentimental side of a multi-faceted personality. If we want insight into who Ch Guevara was, what drove him, and what demons caused him to proclaim, "Hatred as an element of struggle; unbending hatred for the enemy, which pushes a human being beyond his natural limitations, making him into an effective, violent, selective, and cold-blooded killing machine. This is what our soldiers must become", we will have to look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Story-No Matter what Dr. Guevara Did with the rest of his life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to make the point that this is an entertaining and visually beautiful movie The story rolls along at a good clip, showing the different aspects of South America. The scenery changes for the urban side of Buenos Aires, to the pampas, to the Andes mountains and finally to the lush jungle of Peru. It reminded me of how beautiful South America is. Also , no matter what Che Guevara did with his later life, one must remember that he started out as a naive Argentine medical student.The film is full of good natured Argentine slang, somewhat vulgar. One phrase I remember is "your sister's xxxx" in Spanish. However, this is very authentic. I've lived in South America.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You might agree or not with what "Che" did in his life. Most people would agree with his goals but less would agree with his means. However, this movie does not debate any of that. It is only showing us the amazing transformation that a medical student went through when he saw and felt, pain, suffering, and injustice. It's a story about human life, a brilliantly told story about a man wanting justice, not for him but for the needed ones, the poor. Rolando de la Serna's performarnce is brilliant, Oscar worthy. Unfortunately since this movie represents so many countries (ironic, that's what Che wanted, a unified continent!), it is not clear how it can enter in the race for Oscars (yes, not just one). The director is Brazilian, the main actor Mexican, the supporting actor and most of the cast are from Argentina, Robert Redford, the producer, is American, then a Puerto Rican and a French complete the main team. And, the movie was filmed in Argentina, Chile and Peru. If you want to see a movie with the rest of Che's life wait until 2006 (there is another coming with Benicio del Toro &amp; Co.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's nothing like romance to befuddle the brain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years ago, you used to see all over Europe and Asia battered VW Kombis with the letters AUS on their bumpers and maps on their doors detailing their travels. 'OE' ? overseas experience ? was part of the agenda of every self-respecting Australian college student. (Now alas 'OE' means 'overseas employment' for the best and the brightest). Yet as far as I am aware no graduate of a Kombi tour helped overthrow a dictator anywhere or became themselves part of the totalitarian problem.The question is often asked: why is Argentina such a mess while a country like Australia, with which it has many parallels, reasonably prosperous and stable? This movie suggests that incurable South American romanticism might have something to do with it. Walter Salles succeeds brilliantly at depicting the physical beauty of the South American continent but the portrayal of Ernesto 'Che' Guevara is an exercise in hagiography. The man later proved beyond doubt he was no saint, even if he was shot with CIA assistance. Here, as impersonated by the terrific Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal, he is the pure hero inspired to a life of selfless dedication to the cause of the dispossessed by the suffering he comes across in the course of the journey. His foil Alberto is inspired by Ernesto to rise above his hedonism and to join the cause also. In real life, of course, a corrupt dictatorship of the right was succeeded by a puritanical dictatorship of the left in Cuba, and Che went off to martyrdom in Bolivia.In fairness to the film makers here, their purpose is artistic, not polemic; they have tried to capture the atmosphere of Ernesto and Alberto's odyssey from the original literary works and succeeded brilliantly. But the tone changes noticeably when the story moves from Ernesto's account ? a joyous romp largely ? to Alberto's, in which the hero-worship obscures his friend's character. The leper colony scenes in particular portray Ernesto as a Christ-like figure, in stark contrast to the naughty boy we see earlier. The transformation is put down to the journey itself ? sorry, but nothing is that simple.Doing a little research around the topic of Che Guevara I discovered that his father, Ernesto Guevara Lynch, despite being well-connected in Argentinian society and a small-time entrepreneur, had radical political views and was very proud of Che's exploits, even after they ended in a hail of bullets in Bolivia. So whatever Che was rebelling against it wasn't his father (not that Salles suggests otherwise). The trip around South America made (partly) by motorcycle was not so much an awakening as a confirmation. I'm quite sure others have made similar journeys without deciding upon the life of a revolutionary. One does wonder, though, what kind of "OE" Osama bin Laden had.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES is a turn of the century take on EASY RIDER that, like that 1969 classic, says more about the era than about the characters. If you are looking for insight into Che, this film is not going to help much. It ends before he gets truly political and he fails to develop any of the values that might hint to socialist leanings or true anger at inequalities.SPOILERSome major scenes don't really work. Angry at an Americana mining company for not hiring all the day workers, the movie fails to show any other job options for the starving poor. Are the miners to blame for being the only job around?Swimming across a river to see celebrate with the lepers may be honorable but doesn't work cinematically since he was just there earlier on a boat. What was the point of that struggle?Che and his sidekick come across as spoiled thrill seekers, confused as Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda without the drugs as an excuse for their flippancy in the face of a dying world. Someday a real Che Guevara movie will be made. One that may explain why he felt obliged to take took his moral high ground to Chile, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Cuba while tolerating a middle class upbringing in his own equally oppressively poor Argentina.Che Guevara, the last great imperialist? THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES would suggest as much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>is this a film about Che Guevara?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Salles 'Diarios de motocicleta' - 'The Motorcycle Diaries' co-produced by Robert Redford is a good film. Whoever is interested in the history of the 12000 km journey of two young Argentinians in the 50s, with stunning visuals and good acting by Gael Garcia Bernal Rodrigo de la Serna can enjoy it. I did enjoy it, but to do so I had to forget for a moment that the film is about Che Guevara.It is not clear to me whether the lack of reference to the political and revolutionary career of Che is intentional or not. The film tries to be some kind of a ritual of coming of the two young Argentinians into knowing real life and social injustice of the Latin Americas of the period. This is possible, but from a psychological point of view I could not find a real justification in the movie of the reasons of Che's evolution to revolutionary communism. The same social injustice could be fought by many other means, Cuevara could have become a missionary, or participate in international relief activities. He had a medical background, he could have become a 'medecin sans frontieres'. The reasons to chose violent fight are never shown here, and actually according to biography I read he entered the Communist movement only one year after this journey, while witnessing a coup in Guatemala.We can ask ourselves if making an apparently apolitical film about a young, handsome and romantic man named Che Guevara is not a political expression after all. after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a nice film, an interesting film, but not an amazing film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard a lot of positive things said about the film Diarios de Motocicleta long before I finally got round to watching it.The Motorcycle Diaries (in English) is a biographical film, telling the true story of the young Ernesto "Che" Guevara and his friend Alberto Granado as they travelled across South America in the 1950s.I must shamefully admit that I didn't know who el Che was before watching this film, which probably makes me pretty ignorant, but I wanted to watch it partly because of that reason - I knew it was about the life of a famous Marxist revolutionary, and wanted to learn more about him.This film was also actually shot at the original locations through which the two travellers travelled in Argentina, Chile and Peru, which also attracted me to the film because I love travelling, and have always wanted to go to South America, especially Argentina and Peru.It turned out that the film does not really go into Guevara's revolutionary exploits at all; instead it shows, in a very real way, how he learnt, through the things that he saw on his journey, that the indigenous people were suffering beyond his imagination in so many different ways. The film finishes with Guevara staying behind when his friend, Granado, returns to medical school, but all we are told is that he has to stay because he knows he has to do something to help.I like this approach more because the film is very realistic and very honest. It does not have a complicated plot or any real political agenda. Instead, it is just the simple but well-told story of two young men who travel around South America on a temperamental motorbike they call La Poderosa (The Mighty One), and the things that they see and do on the way.It stars Gael Garc眼 Bernal, who is the excellent Mexican-born actor who also stars in the two great films La Mala Educacion and Amores Perros, which I've also recently watched. But I have to say that all the actors in this film are amazing, and Rodrigo De la Serna deserves just as much credit for his performance as Granado.To conclude this is a nice film, an interesting film, but not an amazing film. It did lead me to want to find out more about this important historical figure, and the film also gives some interesting information about his friend Granado in some end captions, as well as in a short interview with him included on the DVD (he's still alive).But the film itself does not really show much of the South American landscape, or develop in a way that gives the viewer much information about anything. In fact, it leaves the viewer needing to find out more to consolidate the story s/he has just seen.I certainly intend to read the books Notas de Viaje by Ernesto Guevara and Con el Che por America Latina by Alberto Granado now that I have seen the film, but I must admit that, in this particular case, you would get a lot more from the film by first reading the books and then looking up some facts about Che Guevara before putting the DVD into the player.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Motorcycle Diaries is a very watchable movie with humour and incidents aplenty. It is purportedly based on the real-life travels through S.America by Che Guevara and his cousin way back in '52. The film doesn't seem very realistic primarily due to Bernal's performance and scripting problems. The real Che was an extremely charismatic man who inspired millions to follow him. The Che in Motorcycle Diaries should be even more intense and charming because of his youth and immense charisma. Instead we get a philosopher who doesn't speak much but feels a lot of pain. I can't believe such a person could lead a revolutionary movement. There is no mention as well of the violent side of Che's personality. Despite all these criticisms, this film can be enjoyed and the vistas of S.America are quite beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An engrossing, adventurous story told well, with beautiful cinematography. However, the much troubling aspect of this movie is that it must exist in the context of the real world. Inasmuch as it not only deals from a basis of real people and their life events and transformations, but as well only reveals this to the uninitiated at the conclusion, and in the blandest and most whitewashed of terms (two short paragraphs of heavily selective description), it is a dangerous piece of fictionalization. Even if all scenes shown in the movie were to have happened as depicted, the dangerous part is again the thoroughly heavy selection of what is portrayed. In the film, Guevara seems a nice guy who starts with deep convictions to some ideals (like total honesty) and develops others throughout the course of the story. None of the troubling genesis of who he truly became is shown, as exhibited in his writings. He was no Gandhi, but a bloodthirsty revolutionary who, while fighting for his ideals (whatever they truly were in a much larger scheme not shown in the movie), warped his philosophy and methods to terribly brutal, evil execution (so to speak) throughout the rest of his life. Those who see the film come away with no idea whatsoever of the scope of his later tyranny. I can only desperately hope that the mention in the end of his real-life existence and role in Cuba causes enough curiosity to engender further investigation by the viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a terrific film for anyone who loves road trip movies. The exquisite South American scenery is alone worth the price of admission. A young man who will become later in his life the famed Cuban revolutionist Che Guavara hops on a motorcycle with his best friend and decides to see the continent they call home. The movie does a good job of setting up Ernesto's and his friend's naivete. They're sheltered middle class kids, essentially, both given many advantages and both on the fast track to becoming successful career men (doctors). But what he sees of the social disparity existing between South American countries changes Ernesto forever.This film is good but surprisingly lightweight. It seems to want to avoid conflict at all costs. Therefore, we get fleeting glimpses of some of the problems the two men run into on their trek, but nothing seems very substantial. Even the leper colony that so fundamentally changes Ernesto is portrayed as little more than a summer camp. The film pushes too hard to exalt Ernesto as a saint; however, when one considers that the film is based on the idealistic diary of a 24-year-old, perhaps this criticism is unfair.The ultimate success of this film depends on what you're in the mood for at the time; but either way, it's still very good.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Right-Wing Leftist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave the Motorcycle Diaries a 7 out of 10. It is a very handsome movie with beautiful scenery, well acted and has a few humorous incidents. What troubled me throughout,as a Ronald Reagan conservative, was that Che Guevara in real life was not a hero. When he reached power he turned into a tyrant. When that wasn't enough for him, he turned to armed terrorism until he was finally stopped.I decided to read Roger Ebert's review after seeing the movie to see what a leftist would think. Ironically, he was troubled much the same as I was. Except that he dubbed Che a "right-wing" leftist. This is the same mentality that called the communists in the Soviet Union right wingers and the free marketers left wingers.I have often wondered how the left could possibly view themselves as idealists while vilifying the right. After all, were not Stalin, Mao, Fidel, Pol Pot, etc, etc. all leftists. To me, it is the inevitable result of a total government takeover. More power to the government means less power to the people. People rebel. Government cracks down. Tyranny results.Anyway, now I know. You just call a communist a right-winger and he automatically becomes the bad guy.</fullReview>

It seems to have been screening there every week for ages.It falls slightly short of being a hagiography, capturing the somewhat blunt, stubborn, dogmatic side of Che's character. His more hedonistic sidekick seems sometimes more human, as for instance in the scene where he gives an uncomprising diagnosis of a malign tumour to an old man.Not a bad film, but I have a weakness for any kind of road movie.

The influence of the events on the future "che" is less then subtle... but most of all the movie is boring. I don't have much more to say... this movie looks like a mix between a budgetless movie, and a cheap documentary... soulless, and uninspired. The casting is also very bad, not only the lead character cannot compare physically to the Che (i.e. looks like a midget with short arms) but the support character looks fake by forcing his smile all the time... Furthermore, regularly it seems that the director shoots randomly... maybe it is done on purpose, but it is as if there is no script (e.g. the soccer game with the leperos...).

But, the movie wasn't that bad, so if you have two hours to spend, you could see this. It will not be a waste of time. A sweet film, who missed something to make it good.Overall, on a dice...a 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good measure of Hollywood bias.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With few exceptions, good movies are few and far between particularly when it comes to Hollywood. I'm not rating the movie here, just the obvious and cheap tendency to portray our country and heritage in as poor a light as possible when it comes to movies of an historical nature. When it comes to characters, like Che Guevara in this case, boy do they get good treatment. And Hollywood loves themes, fictional or otherwise, that always has our government and military as dark, shadowy figures behind all that is wrong. Nothing in reality could be further from the truth. Now, stop right there, if you haven't been in uniform you are not qualified to comment. You don't know. I've also studied film so I can comment on what I see in movies as well. What I am pointing out is epidemic and obvious. Michael the lying slob Moore's Fahrenheit 911 for example was loaded with out-right lies, a complete fiction actually, yet the Hollywood crowd and liberals not only chose to ignore that, they hyped it. The Manchurian Candidate was re-written from the original to paint us the bad guys. Where is truth and honesty? Certainly not in hollyweird or the liberal left. So, good movie or not, it shows that communism, obvious bias, and anti-American sentiment is alive and well in Hollywood. Lets bring back the failed revolutionaries and glorify them, spark interest in these amazing and intriguing individuals...god comments like the latter make me vomit...When I discuss issues with younger folk these days I am amazed at how factually ignorant they are when it comes to the history of anything - except rock and baseball. They often can't buttress an argument with anything but regurgitated information that can't stand up to well informed fact and, that liberal nightmare - logic. There may be many reasons for this but Hollywood and t.v. share a load of the blame. They churn out films that are in the main devoid of the values like character and decency, honesty. They misinform and distort. So what do we get out of Motorcycle Diaries? Who really knows and who cares...in true Hollywood fashion it conveniently leaves out a lot, for one thing - where did he learn to kill and torture? He did and that's a fact. Also, Castro's Cuba is no picnic. It wasn't prior to him either and we should remember that he sold out the Cubans. He promised his people freedom, justice, a hand in their destiny and he reneged, choosing instead the ultimate path of communism - repression and enslavement. Whatever ideas molded Che on his trip, the movie doesn't explain why he went along with all that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to be a critic but this movie really wasn't very good. It was dull, over-hyped and when I watched it I lost interest very fast. The story was flat, the plot was almost juvenile and the actors cold, no chemistry. Shaky camera works if you do it right but it was not done right in this film. I really enjoyed Gael Garcia Bernal in 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' and 'Amores Perros' but I was disappointed with this movie. He should go back to working with Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu from 'Amores Perros' or Alfonso Cuaron from 'Y Tu Mama Tambien'. It's a shame because Gevarra is a very important historical figure and the filmmaker did not give him justice.</fullReview>

Then go to a villa or town to get it repaired. They meet girls, drink, dance and stare at poor people. They do the same thing again. When their motorcycle dies, they walk to a town or board a boat where they drink, dance stare at more poverty and move on. By the time the pair reach a leper colony (where they drink and dance with nuns), I was more interested in the screen on the dial of my watch than on the one in front of me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Diarios De Motocicleta is a bad attempt to try to make a nice image for a well known murderer. It is very simple to "discover" that in each murderer, once, there was a soul and that soul was even full of compassion and life. Probably such crap as this movie was needed once more, in some countries; after so many truths were discovered about the atrocities made by communists. Mr. Robert Redford probably needs to clear up the memory covered in blood of a huge criminal. Probably tomorrow we will need to clear up the memory of Hitler or Pol Pot or maybe Ceausescu. In the end the last two of them were murderers and icons of communism bringing terror to all those who worked and owned something in this life. The movie is an artistic but very boring attempt to clear up the image of a monster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this the right way to portray this man?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Motorcycle Diaries is a road movie, a road movie based on the life of a man who managed to change a large proportion of political discrepancies in South America. This man was Che Guevara, the leader of a revolution in Cuba in order to make all people equal. This decision of his came after this road trip which is the story of The Motorcycle Diaries.The film starts with Ernesto (later Che) and Alberto heading on a road trip across South America to explore countries they have only read about. The plan is to travel 8,000 miles in a record 5 months, and arrive at their final destination on Alberto's thirtieth birthday. This doesn't happen however due to their unreliable motorcycle and their abundance of money. At first we see the pair as child like, attempting to see out the remainder of their youth. They bicker, they laugh, and they act on impulse in order to get by. At first we witness Ernesto as an upper class boy in his final semester at college in order to become a doctor. He has the world at his feet and this trip is his last chance to enjoy his surroundings. Alberto is a biochemist and wants to witness South America before he finds a girl and settles down. The trip begins with them enjoying themselves by flirting with women, conning the locals into giving them money and fighting with entire villages. That is until their motorcycle finally breaks completely and they find themselves trekking their way to Peru. Now having to hitchhike they begin to meet all the people that society hasn't been good too. Communists who must hide from the government, farmers forced off fields by capitalists, and builders moved from their homes in order to build capitol cities. Once they reach Peru the duo are beginning to hate the society they are witnessing and begin to talk about forming a way to create a revolution and help all those in need. A doctor friend of Alberto understands how they feel and sends them to an island where they cater for patients with leprosy. The two men spend three weeks there and are appalled to see that the sick are treated like animals. They are made to live on the island whilst the doctors live on land, they have to use a smaller more cramped boat to travel back and forth compared to the doctors having a much spacious boat, and the doctors insist that they must when gloves when treating these patients. The duo are angered at this do all they can to help the patients feel like people. On Ernesto's birthday he chooses to swim to the island to spend it with the patients, despite being thrown a party by the doctors. He is slowly beginning to realise that everyone should be treated equally. At the end of the film the road trip ends and each go their separate ways, but we all know that Ernesto is heading home in preparation to become a leader of a revolution and transform into Che, a man that changed the world.I will begin with the positives with the film. The acting is top notch. Bernal and De la Serna are on good form and are utterly believable as the people they are portraying. The rest of the actors could be mistaken for real life residents, but as far as I am aware they could have been. The story comes with a little humour which is always a bonus, and it is intriguing to see the beginnings of a man who is plastered all over t- shirts in South America.My problem with the movie is that I don't really know much about Che. I am aware another movie has been made on him starring Benicio Del Torro, but that is all I know. I looked him up when the film was finished and I have to say all I really found was that he was a murderer and a terrorist. He helped people gain the freedom of speech but then persecuted them if they didn't follow his beliefs. He was a full blown communist by the sounds of it, and a man who ended up doing more harm than good. He was eventually tracked down by the CIA and killed; so I wander why there is a film documenting his rise, especially since the film paints him as good. In the film he is a gentle, kind man but in reality it seems that he wasn't. The film doesn't really hint at a man who turned to killing in order to stamp his beliefs. If the film showed him as a man with a tendency to become evil it may have worked better. Maybe others will see him as good, but from what I have read it seems to be the opposite.Also the film at times becomes a little boring. Nothing really happens throughout other than them travelling, meeting people, motorcycle breaking, and then leaving town. It does repeat, especially for the first half. In the second half the tone seems to change, which takes away some of the fun with the first half. Could this highlight a change in him?All in all it was an average film. After reading up a bit about it I am shocked to see such a bad man shone in a good light. For those who are aware of Che's life, may be disappointed to see how his image is shown. For those of you, like me, who know nothing, may enjoy it more.3 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.uk</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Motor Cycle Diaries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Walter Salles The Motorcycle Diaries (2004) is an attempt to portray the infamous Ernesto 'Che' Guevara as a good and kind hearted man. The film in and of itself was well done and probably convinced a number of individuals who perhaps had never heard of 'Che' Guevara that he was in fact a kind and moral character.In recent years it's not uncommon to see t-shirts with Che's face in a silhouette and a commie star with some printed letters saying "Love and Peace" or "No War." The truth is however that Che was a leading figure in the Communist revolution that took place in Cuba, the same revolution that put Castro in power. Keeping in mind revolutions aren't won with hugs and kisses, or by throwing flowers at armed soldiers Che was guilty of a number of war crimes before his death.It's easy to point the finger and say many historical figures are guilty of heinous act and war atrocities but none of those figures have their image sold as a pot smoking trend of rebellion. If a student wore a shirt to school that had Che's face and a slogan that said something to the extent of "Guerrilla" or "Blood Bath &amp; Uprising" then okay? Che was a critic of the United States and he hated capitalism. The irony is that capitalism has marketed off his image? HAHA!! Perhaps if his life wasn't some sugarcoated daydream then his legacy wouldn't be a lie. Fans of Che are always so quick to point out others in the world that do evil, and subsequently have a fan base, but don't lose focus on the fact there are sworn testimonies by those who bared witness to Che's bloody revolution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The discovery of pity in South America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fascinating Road (and River) movie about the legendary Latin American revolutionary and visionary Ernesto 'Che' Guevara de la Serna (Gael Garcia Bernal). It is directed by the great Brazilian director Walter Salles.Although initially very slow and lamentably sullied by a dreadful, diabolical translation ? featuring such American vulgarities as 'asshole', 'motherfucker' and other anachronisms which surely have no basis in the Spanish spoken in South America in 1952 ? the film develops slowly into an intriguing, thoughtful observation into the mind of a young man who sees the unfairness and desperation of those at the bottom of the class and capitalist system.Che and his friend Alberto Granados (Rodrigo de la Serna) meet a whole variety of people as they cross the entire continent, journeying north, initially on an old Norton 500 motorcycle. This breaks down in the end ? a metaphor for the advancement of mechanisation and its limits? ? and the two continue on foot, walking and hitching wherever possible.Here, they get down to the nitty-gritty of real, peasant people, the tiny natives of Chile and Peru, mostly high up in the mountains of the Andes in some spectacular, stunning cinematography. There are numerous migrant workers along the way ? each discarded by the big corporations the moment their usefulness is at an end ? and lots of mist-shrouded mountain tops.Thankfully, the voice-over, italicised subtitles of Che's diaries ? in contrast to the dreadful dialogue ? reveal a sensitive and thoughtful person, all delivered with a certain literary style. He talks about the people, the inequalities and the epic landscapes.They visit some of the awesome sights of the great Inca empire, high up among the Gods, and Che wonders how such a noble people can reach such a desperate state of suppression, slaves in their own lands.When they reach Valparaiso, they see one of the great cities of Chile; similarly Cuzco, the former capital of Peru, before the Spanish created La Paz.The film recalls Werner Herzog and his filming in similar locations. You half expect to see Ray Mears appear in the jungle, providing the two with survival advice, which they need.</fullReview>

While I can read almost entire sentences and words in Spanish, it is so hard to understand what the speakers are saying, because they say it so fast. I recently watched the motorcycle diaries, and I could not understand a thing been said. I only could make one word in a sentence, and relied heavily on the subtitles. Words are not that big in Spanish and are generally smaller than English sentences. I don't know if it's like that with other languages, or I simply don't speak it well enough yet.

		<shortDescription>One of the best films that I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a Spanish person - in either language or culture - but have looked at this movie over and over again looking at the subtitles. I just popped on a theater while it was playing (snook into it on my way out from another movie just for kicks), and could not leave.The beautiful Andes mountains, and good South American scenery were seen throughout the movie as you could catch on with the spirit of this road-trip. The Fuser (nickname for Che Guevera) and his friend were almost like a Laurel and Hardy comedy flick watching these two goofs get themselves into and out of trouble. The best scenes were their interactions with women, ranging from being chased out of a bar by hitting on a married women, hitting on local women, or the funniest scene when Guadero begs Fuser for money on a ship because he could not afford a whore that got him too horny. That was too funny. He gambled his only last dollar in order to earn enough money for her. I wonder if this is for real when I saw that scene.Fuser (Che Guevera), has shown interesting lapses in judgment in the diaries or actions that seem to contradict his quiet and orderly nature. For example, hitting on a married woman, and then reinforcing her seduction without being cognizant that her husband is nearby or the signals from the woman to stay away. The other scene was when he confronted the truck driver who appeared to be treating the workers harshly, and then throwing a rock when they were leaving.Aside from the swearing (should not have been put on the subtitles) - which costs this movie 2 units on my evaluation, and is the reason I decided to return it back instead of own this video. Not that it was mindless swearing at every other dialogue and most of it was simply out of natural frustration arising out of circumstances of which anyone may be prone to do, but there was too much on it as far as I'm concerned and unnecessary. Apart from this blemish it is one of the best films I have seen. Another blemish is the Guedaro desperate to get money for the whore scene, but I will reserve my rating since it was a necessary comic relief in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Film Of Che</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a solid film. Make sure you are aware that the main character in the film is Che Guevara. I was watching the film with a few people and I was surprised to hear that they were unaware that the main character is Che himself. Knowing that the film is about Che takes the movie up a notch. As film by itself, the movie is OK. The story of two youths traveling across South America is entertaining but not amazing by any stretch of the imagination. There are some slow points, but still, the movie does keep your interest and is entertaining.When you add the fact that the main character is Che Guevara this movie moves up a notch. It is fascinating to see early signs of a transformation in young Che. The movie covers a very short period of Che's life when he was in his early 20's. During this period the early seeds of activism are planted in Che and I really like how this is done subtly in the film.Truly a solid film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My reasons to give it a 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, there is a small list of movies I think would deserve a 10, and this list keeps small even if we include on it those first-time-captivating ones, those who make you run to the computer to write a praising review about it when you have just watched it for the first time. 'Diarios' deserves it. And before telling you why I would like to say that it has nothing to do with Brazilian director Walter Salles being a fellow countryman of mine. Actually, I think his other successful movie, "Central do Brasil", was reaaaaally annoying. Despite the commotion felt in my country by the time it was released, I believe Benigni's "La Vita ? Bella" was far superior, and if the Academy Awards could be considered a serious award, it would equally deserve it. However, it seems Salles was working with the wrong people here in Brazil. I had to think twice about he being a bad director when I first got into the theater to watch Granado and Guevara's adventures through South America. To say the minimum, this is the kind of Cinema I believe we should look for on the coming years, on a "de-Hollywoodization" process. This is a movie about the history of the world, of every and each one of us. Everywhere in the world there's this aggressive sort of capitalism Che first described on his diaries. It is a fact that, whenever you are, coincidentally, the ones responsible for such conduct have an US-British-Christian-Jew origin, not necessarily on such order. Down in South America, it was not different, as the movie makes public with the scenes on the Chilean coal mine. Che's life after this is another subject, and I'm afraid a thousand words aren't enough to discourse about it. If you have seen 'Diarios', and didn't like it, I'm afraid you're on the side that defends the western kind of society, the one they tried to taught me when I was a kid (that America, Land of freedom kind of ****), but luckily they haven't made to complete the "brainwashington". And that's the point. Society doesn't have to be like this, work market organization doesn't have to be like this, and finally, but specially, Art doesn't have to be the way it is. There's a lot of good music throughout the world, and not all of them have a neoclassic, roman-Greek origin. I'll support anything that tells us about pre-Columbian way-of-life. There's a lot of good people making Cinema throughout the world, and hell no they're all settled in LA. More European movies, more Australian, Iranian, Mexican and South-American movies; that's what I want. Well, this is my point. This is the best movie I have ever saw in my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so much 'motorcycling', but lots of 'diary.' Excellent movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I usually do for movies based on real persons, I also spend a bit of time 'googling' some background information. Ernesto 'Che' Guevara is known as the leader, at age 28, of the Cuban Revolution during 1956 through 1959, beginning two years after he met Fidel Castro in Mexico. His name of 'Che' was given to him during his 1952 journey through South America, the trip dramatized in this movie, "Motorcycle Diaries." Che died in October 1967, some suspect with the cooperation of the CIA, to get rid of this revolutionary. The movie appears to be reasonably accurate, showing us the journey that changed Che and gave him his direction in life.Gael Garc眼 Bernal is Ernesto Guevara, 23 and only one session short of completing his medical degree. He and friend Alberto Granado, a Biochemist almost 30, decide to explore their continent, on a 5000 mile journey on a 1939 Norton 500 that already was not in very good shape. They wanted to see for themselves what they had only studied in books. They had little money, instead relied on their charm, plus some odd labor along the way, to get them from Argentina, through Chile, Peru, and Colombia to Venezulela. Disappointing was that their motorcycle lasted for less than half of the movie, being abandoned as too broke to fix in Los Angeles, Chile, at 49 minutes into the movie.There are good scenes at the leper colony in Peru, where the Amazon river separated the merely sick from the really sick. Guevara was upset by what he perceives as an injustice, along with other injustices along the trip, all of which helped shape his revolutionary views.One of the DVD extras has a very nice interview with Guevara's travel partner who is still very much alive in Cuba. The movie is in Spanish with English captions. Very good movie, but I enjoyed the first 49 minutes most, while the two young men were traveling, with frequent mishaps, on the old Norton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully told buddy/road-trip/coming-of-age biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Motorcycle Diaries" tells of a critical period in the life of Che Guevara, the larger than life cultural icon and revolutionary who contributed to Castro's Cuban revolution in the early 60's. The film is based on the writings from a diary Che penned in 1952 while on a 5000 mile journey of discovery through South America. The film has little story arc and is a linear telling of the experiences which helped transform Che from a naive medical student into a man of political idealism and social awareness. What you won't see are sex, romance, action, thrills, and the usual cheesy stuff of Hollywood flicks. What you will see is the great beauty of South America and its people and a young man's awakening as he begins to forge his social conscience. The film is a serious attempt to recreate the actual motorcycle journey and depict Guevara as a sensitive, empathetic idealist which is part road trip, part buddy flick, and all biopic with elements ranging from humorous to poignant to dramatic to exciting. With support from the still living second man on the trip (Alberto Granado), Che's daughter, and the masterful auteursmansip of Walter Salles, this film offers an earnest, honest, and accurate look at a what the experiences of Guevara's journey must have been like. Worth a look by those into serious cinema, South American history, and the life and times of Che Guevara. (A-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a bad effort, yet it fails to show Guevara's other side as a blood thirsty guerrilla responsible for many summary executions (in Cuba) In 1964-65, Guevara defined himself --and he applied it to every other "revolutionary"-- as a "senseless killing machine", in his opening speech to the Tricontinental meeting. He was not simply a sensitive individual, close to the suffering of the poor but a fanatic, uptight, homophobic, dictatorial character capable of many atrocities in the name of the sacrosanct revolution that would allegedly change south America's destiny. Beyond political adherence, these are aspects of Guevara's personality that one cannot see or foresee in this portrayal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Success in spite of itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The motorcycle diaries is about a road trip taken by a pair of young men, one of whom grows up to be an important figure in revolutionary Cuba and elsewhere. "Fuser" Guevara was a young man of 24 who appeared to be confused with the age old question that every young person feels - what does life mean and what am I supposed to do with it. His counterpart also feels this way, though seems less inclined to change his life drastically.The pair of personalities nicely offset each other with one being shy and the other far more outgoing. The journey across the South American continent is full of encounters with people that wonderfully display the landscape and culture of the people in this part of the world. The end result, without spoiling the particulars, is that there is a greater difference between the two men at the end of the movie than at the beginning. "Let the world change you" is very much what this movie is about. So why does this only feel like a 6? The movie is very subtle in the changes in the character. This is due to the excellent performance by de la Serna - actually, the movie was well-acted from top to bottom. Perhaps the reserved nature of the character didn't seem like much of a change from before the journey and after the journey. The change seemed to be opening a can of worms more than developing something in him that was not there to begin with. If there was one particular epiphany along the journey, then I admit that I missed it. The direction and cinematography of the movie felt very average, but maybe that was because I had to read subtitles. Also, the change in Guevara may have been a little too subtle for it to be effective in my mind. I didn't see the connection between the journey and a change as a result. He did what he felt was the right thing over the course of the entire journey - it wasn't developed on the the road. Lastly, and most subjectively, I didn't find the movie very interesting. It seemed like an updated version of Easy Rider, only Motorcyle Diaries raises questions that will likely be relevant for much longer.That being said, the questions raised by this movie are, imo, more important than anything in the movie itself. What is a persons place in society? Can you correct injustice? Can one person make a very large difference in the good of the world and society? These questions are an extension of the movie, but not because of its content or dialog. 6 of 10, mainly for the questions that follow the movie rather than the content itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>:: a worthwhile spending of your time ::</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few films that reach around the globe today that aspire to more than pandering to the schlock that Hollywood dishes out with delight in abandon. You might say that the difference between this film and the standard fare pouring out of Hollywood can be simply summarized as such.Natural beauty vs. plastic surgery.This movie has to fall in the realm of being a 'natural beauty." Yes, it's loaded with sentiment and the interpretation of the director and the actors, however this is underscored by a sincerity which I find is uncommon these days. Now, a previous reviewer found focus on the road trip to be more important towards adding to an almost too sweet sentimentality. I feel that anyone who does not walk away from this movie, feeling somewhat moved or touched is out of touch with their humanity. Now that's a bold statement to make, so let me recap.Most people switch themselves in to denial mode when they start to read about the past, especially when that past is alive and condoned today. This movie reminds us that the system of capitalism can be brutal as it is an abstraction that overlooks those who are born in to less than favourable socio-economic conditions. Capitalism often relegates the poorer classes to the back streets and backwaters of society, where they are left to their own devices - unprotected by the finer qualities of modern democracy. Many of them are not their by choice; most of them remain there because they are beaten in to submission. This movie is not directly pushing this particular storyline; no - however it does start to underscore what inequality, the abuse of power, greed, suffering, compassion, empathy - the strengths and weaknesses of the human being in dynamic tension. It may ask you to consider your prejudices and take not of the road or roads that you are traveling on in life. You need not become a "Che Guevara" - however you can take the chance and show a little kindness and compassion to the next person you meet who is less fortunate than you and your friends.See this movie if you want to be captivated by the beauty of South America and the beauty of the human spirit; not perfect - yet not faulty - just human.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine a film purporting to depict the youth of Adolf Hitler that never dealt with an instance of his Anti-Semitism and you will about have what The Motorcycle Diaries represents for Latin American Communism. The film, based upon the book of the same name, culled from the diaries of Ernesto 'Che' Guevara (Gael Garc眼 Bernal), the mass murdering top henchman of Fidel Castro in the Cuban Revolution, attempts to portray the monster as an all-caring near-Christ-like figure. Now, I am not one who's a PC stickler when it comes to art and truth, but the fact is this film is a) bad history, and b) even worse art. While not quite as bad a film as Monster, for its better visuals than that feminist ode to girl power via serial murder, the earlier film at least acknowledged that its subject was a mass murderer, even as it excused it. By contrast, The Motorcycle Diaries not only glosses over Che's massive crimes against humanity, but gives absolutely no hint that such evil ever resided in the man. He was Latin America's Osama bin Laden before there was an Osama bin Laden. Yet, to the recrudescent Hollywood PC Elitists he is a hero, simply because he opposed America. That, alone, to them, erases all of the blood on his hands, even though he was enamored of the Soviet Union's genocidal methods. Yet, George W. Bush, a man I certainly do not admire, is utterly reviled for his crimes against humanity, even though his 'cause' is arguably only just as ignoble and ineffective as Che's ultimately was.The film, which was lauded at the Sundance Film Festival, and widely touted by executive producer and political na?f, Robert Redford, follows spoiled rich kid Che's months-long trek, at age 23, across South America with an older pal named Alberto Granado (Rodrigo De la Serna), 29. The film, while filled with beautiful vistas of the countryside, is not particularly well shot by director Walter Salles nor cinematographer Eric Gautier, as there is none of the lingering sumptuousness that one finds in Lawrence Of Arabia, nor Kundun, films made by filmic masters like David Lean and Martin Scorsese. Instead, we get filmic postcards, not engaging realities. The framing of the shots sometimes seems as if it were done by a tourist who was in a hurry to get through whatever area he was traveling through. It also plumbs virtually every clich of the two genres it inhabits- the buddy film and the coming of age road film. On the buddy side you have handsome, serious, empathetic Che, who-like George Washington, cannot tell a lie- he rips a doctor's poorly worded novel after his pal praises I- telling the old man to stick to medicine (would that someone had told Che the same thing!), and the chubby, fast-talking sidekick, Alberto, on a continual poon hunt. They get in to wacky adventures, constantly crash their motorcycle, and escape disaster by the skins of their teeth. On the road picture side, Che falls in love with a beautiful girl, but breaks her heart, the two meet strange people and grow up, chase girls, and idyllic vistas inspire the duo to talk like a bad screenwriter's imagination of what depth is, especially when at Maachu Picchu. If this insipidity is what Screenwriter's 101 feels reconstructed conversations should be, well?.yeesh. In short, this is one foreign film whose subtitles do not matter vis-?-vis dubbing because they are bad either way?. Despite being made by a Brazilian filmmaker, this film is thoroughly Hollywood, and bound to polarize. Simpleminded Leftists have and will praise it to the hilt, despite its manifest flaws, all because they will not bother to check out the facts. Rightists will damn the film, sight unseen, thereby missing the chance to rip its poor artistry and only justify the many delusions of their enemies, by showing them they are correct that Rightists cannot separate art from reality, either. And so it goes?.but, at least, I recognize such things. If the film did so I would not have to state it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hagiography of a socialist saint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read many good reviews of this film by film critics, a film described as non-political, merely a look at a young man's life and journey before he became a revolutionary. I was intrigued, and interested. But after seeing the film, I can only say that those rave reviews are misleading to say the least. It is a dull, third rate film, a political hagiography of how a young man became a socialist saint.As befit of any hagiographic treatment of any sainted figure, you have Che empathising with the poor and exploited, giving money to the needy, and even him as the sainted one touching the lepers. And there is of course the obligatory heroic swim across a treacherous river, an essential element of a hagiography in modern times (e.g. Mao Tze-Tung swimming across the Yangtze, Saddam Hussein across the Tigris, etc.). I'd almost expect a shot of him with a halo round his head at the end. It is cringe-worthy (e.g. the scene of the people bringing him food after the nuns refused to give him any, stiltedly holding out food as if giving offering to a god), and embarrassing how people with any brain would still buy this kind of fairy tale nonsense nowadays. But apparently they still do, as evident from the rave reviews, and the major film awards it garnered.There is very little in the film that would mark the film as one that's worthy of the great praise - the acting is average or below par, the scenes are not evocative of any particular time and place (which is odd considering the number of locations the film used), and nothing stands out as being particularly good. It's just a film for the gullible amongst the "educated" class, a hagiography of a socialist saint for those who should really know better than to lap up nonsense such as this like credulous peasants.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A portrait of two young men discovering Latin-America and its people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best movies I've seen in the last few years. It's about a motorcycle trip through Latin-America that Ch Guevara made in his youth. There is (luckily) very little politics in the movie, just two young men traveling, living through often funny adventures in little villages, meeting various people etc. Near the end of the movie there is more thought about the social circumstances in the regions they travel through, but this luckily does not dominate (*cough* ruin *cough* ) the movie as in e.g. Fahrenheit 9/11. I have the impression this social concern was added as a bit of an afterthought, but maybe this was intentional. Ch didn't expect his travel to turn out as socially impressing as it turned out either. I was often surprised by some very nice pictures of Latin-American people. The movie seems to want to try to capture the character of the Latin-American people and imho succeeds very nicely in this purpose. I don't know all too muchtechnically or historically about movies, but I was very impressed by some of the great shots. If you are looking for insight in Ch's political ideas or historical insight in his personality, this movie is not for you. It is just an off-track, relaxed movie about an adventurous travel through Latin-America somewhere in the 20th century.Very nice film, you should already have seen it !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whitewashing the reality of Che</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In reality, Che was a totalitarian who was instrumental in ensuring that the new state that followed Cuban revolution would not be democratic, but rather Stalinist totalitarian in nature. He helped inspire terrorists throughout Latin America who killed thousands but effected no improvement in the lives of the people there.By presenting him sympathetically, this movie whitewashes Che's real history. Furthermore, they exaggerate greatly how ideological and how anti-conquistador the diaries were. You can see this at http://slate.msn.com/id/2107100 .The film was fairly well done as art, although I didn't quite buy the relationship between Che and Granado. However, even if it were great art it wouldn't justify covering up Che's evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catholism is not Stalinism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the beginning of this movie, the scenery of South America, the motorcycle, and the road trip. But after they got to the Leper colony the movie slowed down and I found it offensive. I was offended by the fact that the nuns were treated as if they were some kind of Stalinist dictators for requiring their guests to go to Mass. Maybe I am being overly sensitive because I am a Christian, which is similar to a Catholic. I know the Jews got upset about Passion of the Christ, but I didn't think it was derogatory towards Jews. The problem I had with Motorcycle Diaries is that we are not shown how much sacrifice the nuns are making in their personal lives to care for these lepers. The nuns have devoted their lives to the service of others. They will never have husbands, never fall in love, and never have children. Not to mention that many left their families behind to help these lepers. They are doing this because they believe that God loves these people as much as any other person. The fact that they require them to go to Mass is a very small thing to ask for all that they are giving. Even if you don't believe in their God you should at least give them lip service and respect what they are doing for the less fortunate. Their sacrifice is not shown; instead they are the evil Stalinist dictators of the Leper colony. This is very typical of movies these days. It is OK to pick on Catholics and Christians. Well, if it wasn't for them setting up the colony to treat the sick their would be even more injustice in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since when is it OK to make movies that support terrorists? Che hated all U.S. Americans, and was heavily angered when the USSR decided not to wage nuclear war on the United States. Besides that, the movie forgot to show Che killing innocent families and children who got in his way. It is estimated that he murdered 500-600 people. He is not a revolutionary-he was a terrorist. This movie is a terrible portrayal of Che's life. Maybe next time someone will come out with a love story from Hitler's or Hussein's early life??? Keep all of this in mind when watching this movie! It really disgusts me how Hollywood is gaining support by presenting Communistic ideals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was FINALLY able to walk out of this dull as (heck) film after leaning over to my girlfriend and telling her I was taking her to a tractor pull for this one. OH MY, this movie was AWFUL! People are raving about it like it actually is decent. WHY? I would rather watch a baby being born from a 900 pound transvestite! I would rather pour hydrochloric acid drip by drip directly into my suffering pupils. I would rather see a 90 yr old man naked. And since this isn't ten lines yet, I must add that I would rather take a nail file and gently pry off all of my toe nails and RIP the remaining skin up to my knees. Well in all seriousness, this movie is terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horrible movie....guys don't go to this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are male, you do not want to go to this movie. I went expecting to see a rousing depiction of Che Guevara's triumphs. Instead, all I saw was a journey of "self-discovery." Quite sappy. The crucial part of the movie is a handshake with a leper! I actually asked for my money back at the movie theater, because it outraged me that I worked about an hour of my life (with movie prices as they are these days) to watch a chick flick. This movie had potential. The director needs to show Che as a rabble rousing revolutionary, not as some soft student. The movie could be about any Hispanic student. The movie provides no hint of the great things Che will accomplish later in life. I found the cast of characters to be quite B-List. No Ben Afflect, Damon, or Di Caprio? And I'm supposed to watch this. I was asleep by the time I left.</fullReview>
