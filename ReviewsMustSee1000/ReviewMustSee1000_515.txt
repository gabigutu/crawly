		<shortDescription>Definitely a classic although rejected by many as being too dark and morose.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, in my opinion, is one of Rourke's greatest roles. It's infinitely sad that Americans prefer movies which tend to resemble fairy tales instead of those which reflect real life's hardships. Bullet, superbly directed and acted out with a profundity which we rarely witness in movies of this genre, had been treated with utter injustice for it was released directly to video. It features the day-to-day reality which does not conform to society and its laws as well as the teachings of theologians or those professed by pedagogues in high schools and universities. I had lived in BKLN for nine years before moving to London. There is nothing more sad than wasted youth and drug-induced frustration. Bullet demonstrates that only too well. Those of you who love Bullet might enjoy watching Menace to Society, New Jersey Drive and 187. Please feel free to e-mail me with any questions or comments. optimism_always@yahoo.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On Bullet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes I wonder how many people who watch these movies, (gritty street, criminal activity types), know what they are seeing? Being black, and growing up in the 60s and 70s, this was everyday life. People did act like this. Don't you know how precisely Mickey Rourke portrayed an ex-con? Especially one that was tired of the life? Man, why don't you give the man the credit he is due as a great actor, I have seen every one of his films, and he is so wonderful in each and every one of them, it makes me cry. When I re-watch a movie like Diner, or Johnny Handsome? When I see him go from cocky private eye to hysterically sobbing scared human in AngelHeart, and know that he is neither of these people? Or Henry Chinowski in BarFly!! The effeminate sharpshooter in the Last Outlaw? Give me a break! He's fabulous!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people bitch that "Bullet" is far from standard Hollywood fare, but what that means to you depends heavily on your personal opinion of Hollywood fare. If you, like myself, don't think too highly of it, then consider this your first boarding call.The "Bullet" spoken of in the title is the film's central character, a 35-year-old Brooklyn heroin junkie (Mickey Rourke). The film begins with his release from the pen after serving an eight-year sentence, and then proceeds to closely follow the lives of him and those around him -- the parents, an eccentric little brother, a completely shell-shocked headcase of a big brother (Ted Levine, creating yet another standout psychotic), as well as various players in the substance supply industry (Tupac Shakur makes his last screen appearance as the druglord Tank, and does a decent job in a rather thankless role). I'd summarize the plot more clearly if I could, but the fact is, these people's lives just aren't that simple."Bullet" is one of those rare movies which somehow leak through the cracks and make it into production with their soul (or lack thereof) intact. One of the few who dare pay attention to the dregs of society. Worse still, actual dregs of actual modern day society. The REAL dregs. The "uncool" dregs which are far less likely to break out the one-liners after offing someone then they are to strip the corpse of all valuables and sell them for drug money."Bullet" wastes no time whatsoever on making it's characters presentable. I admit it, there's no way this film could ever have raked in the cash. On the surface, the majority of scenes depicted in "Bullet" are the furthest thing any decent human being would classify as entertainment. But below this poverty and violence is a complex and intriguing world filled with complex and intriguing characters.The film's craft cannot be faulted. The direction is superb, the soundtrack appropriate -- at times eerily so -- but even despite all this, most viewers will recoil in disgust at the request to tune into the lives and minds of characters as genuinely vile, violent and emotionally unstable as these. Characters that would instruct packs of ten-year olds in mortal combat. Characters that can no longer see the future beyond their next hit. Characters that assault their own image in the mirror. This is ground most viewers aren't willing to tread, and why this film was doomed to fail commercially. But that by no means makes it bad. Those who can stomach the imagery and see beyond it will not be disappointed... with the *movie*. How you'll feel once it sinks in that these kinds of things happen on a daily basis in what is supposedly the most civilized country on the planet is anyone's guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So dark, so sad, so underrated, so REAL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not Mickey Rourke's best work (that title goes to "Barfly"), but it's close. It's a pity that the grittiness of this film made it unacceptable to so many, but for those of us who have known people stuck in the quicksand of inner-city life despite their best instincts (and loved them in spite of their mistakes), "Bullet" rings so sadly true. Rourke, Adrien Brody, and particularly Ted Levine elevate a depressing little gangland story to the level of an epic commentary on the degredation of life at the end of the 20th century. This one is not for the weak stomach, but it IS for the social crusader.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very underrated hood classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Bullet about a year ago after really getting into Mickey Rourke films and i have to say i really liked it a lot. I can see why some critics flushed it, yet not all of them the film is very different from Rourke's usual work and nothing like other ghetto greats like 'Boyz n the hood' and 'Above the rim'the film has a kind of quirky way about it especially since it's story centres around a Brooklyn born Jewish junkie(instead of African-American)and his rivalry with drug dealer Tank (a small yet great cameo from Tupac Shakur)and also his social problems with friends Lester (who he thinks might be gay) and his two brothers Ruby (Adrien Brody)a painter who is looking for a way to get out of the whole street life and Louis (amazingly played by Ted Levine) who is a freaked out ex-soldier who still thinks the war rages on. So the story is very different,but in a good way i think. The acting is superb and directing from Brit Julien Temple is great. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another classic from Mickey Rourke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not long ago I saw Sin City, and I was crazy about Mickey Rourke's character Marv. This character was actually a comic book monster (with a heart), and since I loved Marv so much I have sought out other Rourke films. This one is just another one of his best rolls. He plays Butch or Bullet who has been in prison for eight years for a crime he didn't commit (he kept his mouth shut and suffered for a friend). He's a junky that is sick of the life and wants to die...really...'cause nothing is going to change ever. Tupac Shakur plays a thug that is after Bullet for blinding him in one eye. The way the revenge plays out reminds me of Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice, especially when Rourke says to Shakur, "You want your pound of flesh...your business is with me." (Not a direct quote) I thought this film would be like a Die Hard type film, but I was very surprised. Ted Levine and Adrien Brody play Bullet's brothers: Levine's character could rival his Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs. This film never played theatrically (I think), and its a shame. Good drama always deserves its audience. I hope all reading these comments will give "Bullet" a chance: you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Damn Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I stayed up one night till 3am and i put this in and at first i thought it was gonna be a waste of my time and i could juss be sleeping, but i was wrong. tupac dissapointed me actually, even tho im a huge fan of his music, but mickey rourke was looking real good. I wouldnt recomend it for the family or young kids, but this was a really good movie, full of alot of truth if youve ever lived in the city, the bad section, you will know exactly whats goin down. I would recomend this for anybody looking for some urban drama, action, its great and while youre at it, go rent the last boy scout w/ bruce willis and damon wayans, that movie is great too, its an action movie. Bullet is real gritty tho. A lot of cursing and drug use and some sex and some homosexual themes but overall a great rent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Street. Real.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a feel of a home movie mixed with real actors. It's hard to explain. Nothing is hollywoodized as far as being over the top, yet the characters are "professional" as in comfortable in front of the camera. They are almost stylized.Back to the realism. The family here is so real they feel like they could be neighbors. However there is an added component of the family being Jewish, and honestly, this is the first time I remember seeing a Jewish family being portrayed in middle-class, "street" style (if anyone has suggestions for other examples, email me).By the time it's over you feel like you know the characters, or that you've met people exactly like them if you've ever lived in a moderate to large sized city. Mickey Rourke as Bullet is great, as usual. It's almost as if this role were made for him. I see him as a tragic, heroic figure, fighting against the demon heroin. His kid brother is Adrien Brody, a talented artist and headed down the same path as his brother if he's not careful. There's the 3rd brother, played by Ted Levine, who isn't quite right after coming back from the war. You will feel affection for this man before the end credits. There's the mom and dad, who could be anyone's mom and dad (watch it and you'll see what I mean). A real standout in the film is Bullet's sidekick, John Enos III. In 1996 when this movie was made let's just say Enos was a perfect specimen of the male form. YUM. (Mickey was, likewise, in *excellent* shape!) Not only is Enos gorgeous, but he plays the faithful buddy who is also very wrapped up in his looks role well. Tupac, as Tank, the villain, isn't the greatest actor but he does OK. His clothes and his style are noteworthy. A couple of the gang members have screen presence, including Pudgy and Bullet's old pal who is now one of the white guy gang leaders.There's a day-to-day sort of realness in the plot. It shows probably a week in the life of the characters. Some disturbing images of abandoned buildings-turned-heroin houses (not sure if they are called that, but if you know what a crackhouse is like, it's the same thing but with heroin. who knows maybe heroin houses are the forerunners to crackhouses and I just don't know it.) Lots of sad junkies doing their various things (shooting up, giving blowjobs for drugs, buying, selling, ODing.) Weaknesses in the film have less to do with the plot and the actors as it does with what seems to be sh*tty editing. That's a shame too, as Bullet (1996) has many elements that could have turned it into a classic.I decided to watch Bullet for 2 reasons: 1) Mickey Rourke; and 2) it was going to be on HBO at a time when I was looking for a movie to watch. I was glad I watched it. I'll watch it again too. Give it a chance and see what you think of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the absolute best movie ever. I have never been able to find a movie with more priceless quotes in it that this--unfortunately I can't mention most of them--but here's a few--"Ma where's my teef" "Alright Stanley up against the car" "Shut the **** up Oprah" "Git yer mama's titty out your mouf." "It's dead it just don't work" Ted Levine should have been given 100 Academy Awards for his brilliant portrayal of Louis Stein. My friend Billy hasn't even seen it and he thinks its great and uses these quotes all the time. No other movie in my life has given me such amusement and I haven't even seen it in like 3 years--but there is no need I think we have memorized the entire script. If you have an extremely sick sense of humor then this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first I drifted through this one 'cause it was just there but when I really sat down and watched, they really went in-depth about Bullet(Rourke) and his family. It really makes you realize you can't take life for granted and just how wicked the streets really are, worlds do collide in this. the dude who played Paddy was decent, Jermaine Hopkins holds his own in a small role as Pudgy, and I had no idea that Michaek K. Williams(Omar from The Wire) was in this he too had not too big a part. Tupac as Tank, Bullet's long time rival, gives a tight performance in this as well. This movie is not for everybody and it wouldn't have done well if it was in the theaters anyway, I thought it was decent cause I actually sat through this and tried to understand it...not that bad 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>since i watched the wrestler i've been on a kick of renting mickey rourke movies and aside from the wrestler i'd say this is his best performance i've seen so far. he was just so good in this movie. he shows so much emotion and still pulls off the whole tuff guy bad ass thing. mickey rourke is effing cool man. the guy who plays bullet's older brother also really stands out to me. he definitely had crazy, paranoid war vet down. and bullet's best friend was funny as hell. what a joke.i heard mixed reviews about this movie so i decided to go in without expecting much and i was pleasantly surprised. i really enjoyed it. it's not a feel good movie. it has lots of funny bits (for those of us with a sick sense of humor) but at the same time it is quite serious and i think people can learn from it. it may sound cool to be hard and tuff but watch this movie. i think the main intention of the movie was to show kids what street life can do to people (which of course had been done before in other films but its still good).anyway... they say that this one of mickey rourke's few good moments in that point of his acting career and i would definitely encourage people to check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remarkable piece of film.....Real as it gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bullet ...This film can be put as raw, seedy, grimy ,realistic,dark and depressing. So that explains why this movie never got the respect it deserved as most people like to avoid these films as these stories of dysfunctional family's ,gang wars etc make the news everyday in our lives,except we only see the headlines and a brief story ,but with 'Bullet' we see the full 99min unrated story of a broken family and street life.This movie in my view is a 'masterpiece' like many other movies out there ,but this never got enough attention, but now its gaining more attention and becoming a classic gem. The direction in this movie is excellent,some great arty shots of the streets in Brooklyn's and flashbacks from bullet himself... excellent music score also. As for the characters they all play superbly . Bullet is the street thug who just got out of the pin and cant come to terms with normal life ,whilst an old friend is on his trail for revenge,as bullet trys to step on his turf. This is 'Tank' played by Tu Pac ,this has to be one of the best ruthless thug characters i have seen played on screen since the 80s.Rourke is amazing as the bullet,he roams around the streets with his bad addiction.....taking one day at a time, he looks cool in this movie,their's so much i could say for his character,but id be here typing for weeks ,so just watch him for yourself.... also 'Ted Levine' plays a superb role.I seen this film in 96, i loved it then ,but didn't understand it as much then,i just loved the characters. But now my eyes are open and i can see the message, don't slip, cause its tough and mean out here. This movie tells the story of the street thug and all that comes with it like no other,forget menace to society etc...this is the 'real' deal....'You ain't gonna make it out there,take long hard look in the mirror'- Butch Stein (bullet)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the beginning of 1998 for the very first time. It was on TV and I never heard it was in movie theaters, that's why it struck me - is that Mickey Rourke? He played this ex con... with a serious heroin problem and his paranoid brother... trying to get a new life, but somehow getting tired of not getting anywhere. The sinister, dark atmosphere only amplifies this spiral "not getting anywhere" except for the places where he has already been.I must say it's a very good movie about life. I'm not surprised it was so underrated. Americans want energetic criminals who know what they are doing, who are invincible... or either succeed or get killed. Rourke however is a criminal... a criminal addicted to heroin with a demented brother... with no money, and no chance of getting out of it. Just like a life of a criminal really is.I recommend this movie to European fans as it is very European, even though it was made in USA. Again - very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this dark movie which follows the life of Butch 'Bullet' Stein played by Mickey Rourke. The movie shows you the life of 'Bullet' from when he first gets out prison and the events that follow. I like how the film makes you feel like you are there following his life. I also enjoyed the other characters in the film and feel they were portrayed very well and had depth. Pitting 'Bullet' against 'Tank' played by Tupac Shakur worked perfectly. I was really impressed with this film overall and have watched it several times. Remember though, it is dark, and not a positive type of movie so it may not be for everybody. But, for those who like a tough, gritty Mickey Rourke it's a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a movie that has invoked tremendous feelings in me, due to how closely related I am to this family situation. A family that loves each other but never can admit it. The cold, sarcastically funny environment and characters that come to light in this film make it real. The musical score that Mickey Rourke personally did is outstanding! Even at the beginning of the movie when they pan the upstate New York setting as John Enos and his brother come to pick him up from the penn, the music goes from classical to hip hop beautifully with the change of seasons and finishes with Barry White. Just a trippy movie with believable characters who we all grew up with in one way or another. The family dynamic is quite bizarre but real too. Any one who grew up Jewish and not wealthy can relate to it. I really dug this movie and ended up buying it. Check it out and try not to get all caught up in how you cannot relate to these people, flawed as they are but how you do relate to them on many levels.</fullReview>

The film does have a dark, gritty feel to it and Mickey Rourke really does a good job in this film as well as 2pac as the villain. This movie may seem like an action film, but its more a crime Drama as it has some depth and seriousness to it in terms of plot and characters.for what it is it's a good straight to video flick with a great cast (notice a young adrien brody and Donnie Wahlberg).Its definitely worth a watch.Overall : 7/10</fullReview>

It certainly portrays the street life in a very potent way, everything from the bottom feeder users, to the dealers, are depicted in a hit you in the face manner. The acting varies. Mickey Rourke is doing his usual Mickey Rourke imitation. Tupac Shakur seems strangely detached from the story, while Adrian Brody and Ted Levine shine in supporting roles. All I can say is that "Bullet" delivers what it promises, and that is totally acceptable for a "B" movie. The expected language and violence is all there, along with a compelling revenge story.

It's not a 10; it's too one-sided in its darkness to be perfect.If you actually grew up in places like this, you are just awed by the accuracy of tone and cadence in the portrayals of street life, drug culture, prison mentality, etc. Yes, Rourke's character is pathetic, but that's the point!This is not a film for the tame; it is full of morbid humor that is often laced with mysoginistic or racist undertones.

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies I have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think bullet was one of the best movies I have seen. It wasn't about your typical African American gangsters. It was about a white Jewish kid who was very talented and bright, but went the wrong way due to the streets, drugs, people he hung out with and the simple fact that the family was your hardworking, struggling, middle class inner-city Americans in NY. The character who should have been nominated for every possible award was the brother Luis(played by Ted Levine). The movie is worth seeing just for his performance. ALthough he is a left-over from the Vietnam war, he is totally insane, but you have this compassion for him. He truly loves his family and brother and that shows in the final few clips of the movie. You can't help but get choked-up when he and the family were attending Bullet Stiens funeral and the brother, Luis, is standing in full military officers garb at attention with the dog. At the final moment of the scene, you can see a tear drop run down Luis's(Ted Levine's) cheek. (SPOILER COMING UP!!!!!!) In the next scene, he cuts Tanks(Tu-PAC) throat using his military training(same training he gave the neighborhoods kids in previous scenes). You get a sense that he is crazy, but is well aware of the situation. ALL in ALL an excellent movie. How about the scene were Lester is the bathroom with the two women in the toilet stall and he is screaming out"Who's the best looking Mutha F***er in this place?!?!?!". A total classic scene/line.</fullReview>

So we have some fans of the film here too. And something else. Micky is going to have a role in Russia, in Moscow, this is so cool, my favourite actor through 13 years of doing nothing plays in big movie again, in my country, and all this time i believed he is the best, it's a great feeling.

		<fullReview>I feel that "Bullet" was a good movie. It had an EXCELLENT moral to it. You know, it wasn't saying that doing drugs and using violence is cool, regardless of the contents of the movie. It basically was showing that Bullet knew he was going to be going soon, and he knew he'd made too many mistakes. He was basically being the "bigger brother", and teaching whomever was paying attention to keep your life straight, do what your good at, make something better of yourself, don't put yourself in a bad situation, take care of friends and family, and be a role model and pass this GOOD stuff on.I don't feel that it is your average gangsta-thuggin'-violence 'n druggin' movie. It had a serene point to it. I just felt it powerful. The writers came up with a good story and plot/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of the Best Movies Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie! Mickey Rourke is at the top of his game. He looks hilarious as a homie hood who comes out of jail. Rourke's character is the title character (and yes his name is "Bullet"). He wears a hoodie for most of the movie and you know he is down and out. I'm laughing just writing about it. You can't take this movie too seriously. I've seen worse movies and this is really not that bad and Tupac put in a decent performance as the main villain. Overall, it's a pretty tough movie with a touch of goofiness. Other good Rourke flicks are "The Year of The Dragon", "Angel Heart", and "Wild Orchid".For more insanity please visit: comeuppancereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Downbeat anti crime yearn. Great stuff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bullet is a violent cautionary tale about what it means to live a life of crime in New York City's brutal Hell's Kitchen, to live (and die) with all the baggage and tragedy that comes along with it. Mickey Rourke is excellent as Butch Stein, a pathetic yet somehow endearing Jewish American hoodlum locked in a personal war with local drug dealer and gangster Tank (Tupac Shakur). Butch still lives with his family, and spends his nights slumming about with slick wannabe wiseguy Lester (John Enos III) and his gangly brother Ruby (Adrien Brody). One gets the feeling that all of them are essentially still little kids who never learned to grow up or use their words, but the sandbox they're squabbling in now is a dangerous area of town, and their toys are heavy artillery. Butch has another brother, a reclusive weirdo played phenomenally by Ted Levine. He's distant and strange, but there's breaks of clarity that shine through, and in those moments he's pretty much the voice of reason amongst all the tomfoolery that adds to the mortality rate in their district. Levine is unique and shelters the gold in his work until right at the end, letting off an emotional stinger of a cap to his performance that is yet another testament to his skill. Rourke broods through his work with sombre self loathing and a grim resolve, dead set in his ways, perhaps unable to live his life differently, and feeling helpless at the road he's taken, a dark one that has strayed far from what might have been. Tupac's role is somewhat underwritten, which isn't quite fair to the guy, because he has more acting talent than pretty much any other rapper I've seen in film. Reduced to a mostly a jive talk sterotype gangsta antagonist, I would have liked to see them allow him to level with Rourke in a way that made their locking horns seem a little bit more than just a petty turf war. Director Julien Temple comes from a music video background, and transitions nicely into the world of the urban crime drama, shooting the seedy NYC locales with glittery precision that suggests festering rot below. It's an anti-crime film, and I'm always curious to see if such a sentiment is undone by the glorification of such a lifestyle, intentional or otherwise (it's easy to get caught up in sensation and cinematics, losing sight of what you set out to say in the first place). This one stays true to its word, showing us characters who have irreparably lost their way, and assuring bullet by bullet, death by death, that this isn't any kind of life for anyone. Searing stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Rourke;s greatest works!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this film because i consider myself a Rourke fan. I've made it a goal to watch every Rourke film that COULD be good. Pretty much everything from the 80's and nothing post-'97. Out of all the movies i've seen of Rourke's, this is in my top 3 (Angel Heart and 9 1/2 weeks are the other 2). Rourke turns in a mesmerizing performance as Bullet, a heroin addict who gets released from prison after serving time for a crime he did not commit. Bullet returns to his estranged and troubled family and once again falls into a web of violence, drugs, and crime. But there is a gangster named Tank (Tupac) who has a grudge against Bullet and wants him dead. I was glad to see Tupac is only in it for maybe 20 minutes and Rourke is in the best shape of his life. There are some great performances form Ted Levine and Adrien Brody. John Enos III is pretty solid too. I was surprised that the film wasn't low-budget and had great quality. Rourke co-wrote the script and his character is an interesting and provocative one. Rourke still looks good facial wise, so i take it this was before he became some what deformed (hence why i pass on anything post-'97). I was shocked, moved, disturbed, and intrigued through the entire film. It's a gangster film with a very realistic and gritty feel. The family life and how his family all reacts to Bullet's release and his life style are fascinating and deep. Ted Levin is great as the psychotic and disillusioned older brother. This is a real treat for Rourke fans and fans of gangster dramas. One of Rourke's best films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a cult film for Tupac fans because it was one of his last films. However, it is the acting of Mickey Rourke, the ensemble cast, and the sweetest soundtrack, that paints the brightest of pictures. The music from the movie, the acting from, Mark Wahlberg, Adrien Brody, Tupac, and Mickey Rourke make this movie a favorite, even in re-runs on cable. "Salvador, Salvatore, what the hell is the difference?" "Hey Mazaltuff..." best lines! A great movie, before Mickey Rourke went to Patrick Swyaze's and Kenny Roger's plastic surgeon. If you are a fight fan, you can catch a cameo from 80's fighter Ray "Boom Boom" Mancini as a cop. No doubt a connection to Rourke's fighting days. Apparently, Rourke helped write the screen play, and you know, he has a great movie on his hands. Bravo Mickey!</fullReview>

Plus Tupac was in it so that made the movie even hotter.The ending was great I don't want to give it away to anyone who hasn't seen it but it was a perfect ending. I watch this movie whenever it's on even if it's on 3:00 am I have to watch it. I love Adrian Brody I can never get enough of him. This movie reminds me of the dudes where I used to live I mean they came from nice home but they were all messed up in the head and they were definitely ride or die and this movie was definitely a blockbuster. Mickey R. made the movie great, as did Tupac I have to say this movie never gets old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bullet is the type of film that makes me want to look for other films with the same actors. The main characters are very unique and some times funny, for example I thought that Ted Levine was great as a psycho Vietnam vet, whether or not I was supposed to laugh at him i don't know. I laughed because that is just the type of humor I have , I'm not bashing the acting because it was good. Some famous names that appear in the film are Adrien Brody of The Pianist, Tupac Shakur, and even Donnie Wahlberg, (Mark's brother...new kids on the block) as a thug. The film is available on DVD with a R and an Unrated version, I've only seen the unrated version though, it contain graphic drug use, a sex scene, and violence of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best Rourke's performances! He plays Butch Stein, the New York junkie, who's just got out of prison after a few years. Butch arrives in New york (brooklyn), meets his old pals and starts his criminal life again. In this film you'll find out how it is to live in the worst part of the Big Apple. Crime, drugs, hoo***s, gang wars, numerous curses - that's the world of people who once were normal, but know they're nothing more than drug dealers, idling all the time, spitting on pavements, looking for easy money, ashaming their families... This is what the film is about. Rourke really did great job - his acting skills are fantastically used in this film. Although he's a bad guy, we are on his side from the beginning to the end and we really regret what he's turned into. Apart from M.R., there's also Ted Levine and deceased rap star, Tupac. They also did a great performance - T.L. as a crazy brother of Butch, and Tupac as an one-eyed gangsta. There are many moving moments in this film, eg. the scene when Butch decides to steal jewellery from his parents, or when he is riding with his friends along the same street where Gene Hackman chased the drug dealers in "French Connection". The music in the background is really cool and moody...I recommend this film. It's rather disgusting one, but still it's worth watching. There are no great heroes, outstanding cops or other almost-perfect people we usually watch in these modern blockbusters. In my opinion this movie is underrated and that's a pity. It could be something like a warning or a message for all young people if they watched it. Unfortunately, they probably won't because 98% of the movie fans don't know this film!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an irony in itself because Bullet defies the peace-loving Jewish people in America concept. Most Jewish children born into the Jewish community turn out pious and learned citizens. This movie can relate to Russian Jews, though. The neighborhood in which Bullet grew up shaped him to be of criminal character. His emotionally unstable brother seems to live in his own world. Bullet's artistic brother shuns the usual stereotype of a Jewish man. Bullet is well respected by most members of that criminal community that he inhabits. It is surely do to the fact that he did not betray the man who should have spend 8 years in jail instead of Bullet. This film is strong and personal. Only some people can relate to this movie. This movie is not for the general public. Hence, it did get popular vote.</fullReview>

Although not a racial film, it can be seen as such in some parts, but that's what it's like in some situations. If you will it, it can be. Not sure if this one of Tupac Shakur's last films, I believe Gang Related was one of them, but he proves he can act, as well as be a gifted poet in this movie. If he was still alive he'd be in a top box office hit right now. I Haven't seen Mickey Rourke in anything lately, but I felt his family members and the supporting actors in this came through beside him and he didn't look like he was in a B movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly written, genius dialogue.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is of the highest order. From the Show &amp; A soundtrack to the excellent script to the brilliant acting.I wonder how they came up with some of the lines in the scenes, pure genius. Characters are very well defined and entertaining, as they should be. Louis is fantastic, Butchie is brilliant, Tank is pure gangsta. Cookie, Sal, Frankie Eyelashes, Lester. This film is banging from the door!!Loved the scene when Louis was training his elite army. The end of that scene shows Louis' gentle nature, when congratulating Stanley on his good demonstration. Basically everything Louis says or does is entertaining. "Would you like to eat Louis? I'm making Schmoltsen Gurdle soup, it's your fathers and Butchies favourite." Louis replies, "No thank you ma. The Pretzki's have left the cat out, I'll just nosh on that."The toilet club scene is also top class. Just think about it. Those 2 punks Brian and Jamie, robbed and humiliated by Bullet in the Projects earlier on, decide to get revenge by planning to do him over with 3 more of their friends in the toilets. To think that they must have been watching him and planning their actions all this time. The 5 of them follow him to the toilets, 5 against 1 would seem like a lot but Bullet is seriously tough and the punks are pussies. Jamie pulls out his little flick knife which is very brave considering that Bullet has a penchant for stabbing peoples eyes out. Jamie acts tough, Brian too, their 3 friends watch on. Jaime goes for Bullet with the knife, Bullet grabs them both, throws them against the wall and scares the hell out of them. Obviously the 3 friends they called for backup run for it. "You didn't say this guy was crazy! We out of here!"Brian says "Fuckin' pussies!Please don't hurt him" which I find strange as they are both thrown against the wall, not just Jaime. Bullet lets them go, lectures them and they make their way out. I would love to have seen a follow up scene where Jaime and Brian catch up with their friends. I bet Jaime said he beat Bullet up or something. Absolutely brilliant. However this film is full of brilliant scenes. Dinner scene, fight scene, death scene, end scene, all scenes involving Tank. I would highly recommend this film to everyone.</fullReview>

Worth watching, if only for Rourkes great performance as a going nowhere dead-end loser piece of human excrement. Bruce Rubenstein said he wrote this partly from his own experiences and if that's true I hope I never meet the guy.My Grade:B- DVD Extras: both R and Unrated versions in both widescreen or fullscreen; and a 5 and a half minute featurette on the movie (including the trailer)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out of prison, Mickey Rourke goes back to his old ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bullet" is a movie with distinct positives and negatives, which is why reviews of it are mixed. The story is strong on scenes and incidents while being weak on plot. The story is strong on depicting the frustrated and essentially broken lives of a dysfunctional Jewish Brooklyn family both at home and as they extend into their surroundings, but it is weaker on endowing us either with much of an understanding or making us identify emotionally with them. Perhaps that's because, although they have a lot of screen time and we see them from the outside, the script just isn't sharp enough to cut deeper. If this were written like "On the Waterfront", we'd get inside the characters. The story is strong on acting, but weak on plot and tension. It becomes a series of scenes with no real forward momentum, a slice of life kind of movie. The movie is strong on involving us at a level of seeing lives we do not otherwise see in a kind of curiosity or voyeuristic vein, but weak on getting us as sympathetically involved as we should be.Here we see the oldest brother (Ted Levine) is schizoid and has many quirks, and his character is amusing, but why should we be especially interested unless the story wants to veer off into comic vignettes and ironies? The youngest brother (Adrien Brody) is a graffiti artist with good skills but seemingly stuck for the moment in his neighborhood. The middle brother (Mickey Rourke) is a perplexing character, an incomprehensible mixture of strengths and weaknesses, which are contradictory.The movie at times has some badly acted material, like the father's monologue. It has some exaggerated action mixed with real detail. The script tries for theme and tragedy in places but doesn't achieve it. It falls flat. This seems to be because the writer simply didn't know how to achieve dramatic effects within the context of this kind of story. It was at times too much detail and focus on irrelevant details and too little bringing out of the motivations and conflicts by sharp, even if brief, detail and situations.We needed to know Rourke's mindset when he comes out of prison and why, before he comes out. Or we need to find it out soon after he gets out. Or it needs to be brought out as we go along. Most of this we actually have to guess at by inference or by how he carries on or by lines begrudged to us. There is an attempt to make him a bit parallel to Terry Malloy (in "On the Waterfront") but it falls flat. Is he a hero or a victim? What destroyed his self-control? Why does he have a will to die? What did prison do to him? If he is strong enough to die, why isn't he strong enough to live? In the end, the movie like many movies comes out rather average, a good try, not bad, but no big winner and no big prize. We can like certain aspects, and I do, but without giving it critical acclaim. I believe the central issue with this and many movies is script. It is not beyond the reach of most movies to achieve some grip on us through plot, theme and character. But it is very difficult for most movies to create that flow of story, incident, theme and character that is truly great, that rings no false notes, that has all the pieces fall into place, that is honest, that makes us feel, that leaves out no essential and excludes all that is inessential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Micks back in a different kind of drug movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took my Mum to see this when it came out in 97. A male usher came walking over to me, and said "I don't mean to pry but why you going to see this". "It's like a private screening". One of my answers was "I like Mickey Rourke". This one that only ran a week at two Wallis Cinemas, was actually Mickey's comeback to cinema after White Sands, five years prior. Here, this film proves time and time again, why Mickey Rourke is one of the all time acting greats. You might think, oh, not another drug movie, which really it isn't. Bullet's different, as to the interesting and funny characters is Rourke's family. Rourke's just got out of prison, with his pet rat, after an 8 year stint, the rewards you reap, all for keeping your mouth shut. Already to start business again, his father starting on him at the dinner table, we see the hopelessness of this family. Rourke's character, Butch, nickname Bullet was once a prize fighter, who sports a number of trophies in his room. His younger brother (Adrien Brody) who idolizes him, is a gifted artist, friends with Rourke's best friend, Lester who drives a pink Cadillac, (this actor played the pimp in Phone Booth). Now we get to the real character of the family, the much older brother Lewis (great character Ted Levine) classic who's room like Lebanon, a war nut, a psychiatric case, who keeps two pit bulls in his room, and hardly washes his underwear. He likes stuffing cake into his mouth for dinner too, but also he's of course into guns. In one scene this grown man harps onto his mom, nagging him to buy him this new gun. When she's not really agreeing to his request, he resorts to crazy talk. Truly a funny scene. Lewis also teaches army survival skills to kids, standing on top of a mound in the district. Totally a zealous gun and army nut. It makes me laugh recalling these scenes. Another scene, while he's out at night, walking his dogs, he really gives it to these two cops, patrolling the area who have it for Bullet's family. All the while, Bullet and Lester are only a few short hundred meters, upstairs, doing over the neighbors place. Bullet is funny, sad, tragic, but different. If you watch Tupac Shakur in anything, make it this. He plays Bullet's enemy and bad guy Tank, in an impressive piece of acting, almost stealing Rourke of this movie, or surpassing his performance. Though the ending is tragic, it's act of retribution, finishes this movie perfectly. A good satisfier but very funny too, fans of drug movies will get a kick out of this one, I've viewed a few times. A little shock violence, here and there, one scene, a bloodied victim of Lewis's big army knife.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to agree somewhat with the comment entered before mine. The film is pretty predictable, had a weak storyline, contains a LOT of violence, and is full of holes.... and yet the characters (the two bothers and the parents especially) --- if not all always put in credible situations 100% of the time --- are very strong and surprisingly deeply moving, Rourke's perhaps being the weakest written and acted. Ted Levine, as the mentally-disturbed war vet brother, is especially moving and disturbing despite a scene or two (training children in warfare from atop a sandpile) which were a bit far-fetched. In fact I would have to say that the film itself is overall quite disturbing, violent, and a bit ugly, yet those aspects only cause the few images of humanity and tenderness to shine all the more. And isn't that what director Rourke intended...?Overall, I'd say ---- with all the incredibly weak screenplays, seemingly written by ten-year- olds, that end up on the big screen every day --- his film is surprisingly well-crafted and under-rated, and definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fresh from prison Butch 'Bullet' Stein (Mickey Rourke), a Jewish ex-convict with sticky fingers and some nasty drug habits, moves back in with his parents and two brothers. His eldest brother Louis (Ted Levine) is a Vietnam war veteran with a severe case of post-traumatic stress, which keeps him locked up in his room-fortress and reliving his experiences. The youngest is Ruby (Adrien Brody), the artistic soul of the family, a talented street artist misunderstood by his parents, but loved and cherished by both his brothers. On release Butch however goes back to his old ways of stealing (from his neighbours or from drug dealers) and is quick to remind about his presence to former foes. Among them local drug lord Tank (Tupac Shakur)...Famed more for this being the last movie done by Tupac Shakury, than for its actual quality, "Bullet" is a movie overladen by this burden. Within the confines of a chaotic script lies an engaging story, but one that is dragged down by overly rash plotting and over-the-top characters, which threaten to turn the movie into a farce. Nonetheless the three lead roles are masterfully captioned by Rourke, Brody and Levine, each rather memorable with their strong respective presence. Especially the first is tour de force, showing off some of his intricate acting capabilities, which self-detonated during the nineties to throttle him to relative anonymity. Bullet is strong macho persona thrust in between worlds, but controlled by his crack lifestyle. At the same time after his time in prison he is unable to cope with his homosexual tendencies, released during his stay behind bars, whereas the movie suggests more than it explicitly states about his penitentiary experiences. These chaotic character traits deliver a crisp persona with which we are invited to venture into the life of Bullet and his surroundings.However thrust on top of the story are several themes, which cause it to lose focus. Especially the whole ordeal with Tank meanders through some poor plotting to come to an unsatisfying conclusion. Unfortunately for Shakur his final role wasn't exactly one worth being remembered by. The movie however in general jumps around, at times uncontrollably, as if unable to really envisage whether it has a message or is just another street crime story with no purpose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Bullet one night expecting to have something to keep me occupied for a little while. With it only being an hour and a half long I figured it would move quick and keep me interested.The plot was predictable and really had no twists to it. It reminded me of King Of New York in a way because we see him leave prison and go right back to doing stupid stuff that almost got him killed before. You know how the movie will end as soon as it starts. Tupac could have killed Bullet multiple times in the movie, but toys with him to "torture" him and get revenge. But at the end he just shoots him and runs away. Nothing clever and nothing unexpected. They attempted to build suspense but it led nowhere.Tupac's performance was not as good as some of his other movies, and it was a really clich type of character anyway. Adrien Brody was underused. Mickey Rourke was good as usual. He's great at playing the twisted hardass. Ted Levine was also great. Who better to play the paranoid ex-army psycho brother? Also keep an eye out for Donnie Wahlberg playing Big Balls haha.So in general Bullet was OK. If you're bored check it out. You can kill an hour and a half. Wasn't too bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BULLET starts off with a series of scenes that are so bad, they are comical. Mickey Rourke dressed as a gangbanger? Who has a pet rat named "Tony Curtis"? And a brother who is stark raving mad, shuffling around the house clad only in his underwear? And the brother teachers children how to cut a throat, and he and the kids laugh during the lesson? Hilarious!Unfortunately, after the first 20 minutes or so, the movie stops being funny, and becomes a bore. It becomes so bad it's bad. And pointless - there doesn't seem to be a plot. Even fans of Tupac will not find enough to make this worth watching - Tupac hardly appears in this movie (despite his billing), and none of the music on the soundtrack is by him.As a result, it's not surprising that this movie spent two years on the shelf, then released direct to video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starting empty, leading nowhere and ending blank</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one leads nowhere and is boring doing so. Gratuitous violence apparently for the effect alone. An incredibly narrow set. No attempt to tell the audience why people become what they are or do what they do. Just an attempt at a film noir'esque crime portrait. And wow, does it fail in the attempt. And what is it with the preaching scene towards the end? It was pretty obvious in the beginning that Bullet mocked the two kids for the sheer pleasure of it - not to teach them a lesson.By the end nothing is resolved. No clues as to anyone's motives. Nothing. Just a feeling of having wasted another hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pretty disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>don't give me wrong,I like 2pac.I've seen one of his other movies and they were great.But this was not really my taste.The story line was good,The performence of tupac and Mickey Rourke were amaizing,but it did'nt seem to be very interesting.This is probably one of the worst crime movie I ever saw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is poor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rourke is almost comically cast as 'Bullet'. He comes across as some kind of white guy who wishes he was black. Tupac proves that he can't act to save his life (sorry about the pun, I expect it'll be omitted) and the whole film just sucks. Humorous for the wrong reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly one of the best movies ever. Oh wait that was some other movie (spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(spoiler) This was an okay movie but not quite average. I don't know what the point of the whole movie was: Oops my bad. I just looked at the poster for the movie and learned what it was all about: "You only get one shot at revenge".What a sheisty catch line for the movie. Buffalo Bill was his crazy old self in this movie. That was really the only cool thing about the whole movie. He was a crazy war vet and dropped down on Pac and slit his throat. Cool scene as the rest was just absolute crap with no purpose other than revenge. Pac was out to kill Butchie. Boring. Yawn. Damn me for wasting two hours of my life on this. Maybe this review will help someone save themselves before succumbing to this garbage of a plot/movie/straight-to-video-crap.What the hell was Adrian Brody doing in this movie?Anyway, it's a good movie for this time of day: 2am.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stay away from this so called classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is officially the first film, where the death of a leading character makes me feel nothing at all. His death makes no difference and I don't think this was the point, if any intended. The overacting Brody gives me the rest.Bullets brothers are not believable and tend to replicate typical clichs about New Yorkers: art and violence.And one line about the late sprachgesang artist Mr. shakur (i don' like the name which sounds like this Peruvian terrorist group MRTA). Lame!Well it is a masterpiece of bad directing: to manage that the viewer will, for almost 90 minutes of his screen presence, not identify with the main character. Ed Wood would be proud! This film is point- and clueless. I hope i was the last person on this solar system to watch this horrible movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting though weak film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to correct some errors stated by others.First off, this film is not well-done. The plot is virtually nonexistent, and at times it looks like it was created by an adolescent, especially at the ending.It is also not "realistic" at all. It plays like some suburban (or European's) vision of the "mean streets", and has no knowledge of the actual grittier side of life.However, it does have some interesting scenes, from where the friend is banging two chicks in the kitchen of the bar, from the fight scenes, to the Vietnam brother's psycho character.In all, it seems like a series of unconnected vignettes, some of which are interesting to watch. Kind of like a college kid's first attempt at film-making.Rourke is indeed an interesting, though flawed actor, and he stays in good shape for an older guy.</fullReview>
