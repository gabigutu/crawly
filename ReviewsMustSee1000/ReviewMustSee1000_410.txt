		<shortDescription>Will you like it? The answer is, "it depends".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When looking through reviews on this site I've noticed that it seems most people who weren't impressed with the first one like the second one more and those who absolutely loved the first movie were somewhat disappointed with the second.I think this is because the first one had more build-up and a slower pace that gradually came to it's climax. The second one instead went from harmless innocent events and not much happening to BOOM - death! So I think it has to do with the person's patience and preferences as to which style they prefer. Personally, I prefer PA1's style and think it allows the dread to intensify as it grows and grows with each scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary and creepy enough. Worth seeing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked the original Paranormal Activity, you'll like this one. Myself, I was not really that impressed with the original, and I liked this one quite a bit better. The mood and creepiness was pretty intense at times.It is NOT just a remake of the original movie, as some would have you think. Yes, it uses that format, and follows it pretty closely, but does it better and takes it a few steps farther. Just because it uses the same format doesn't mean it is the same movie. That is like saying all 'Cop' movies or all 'Buddy Pictures' are the same, just because they also follow the same format.If you saw the first movie, you will recognize everything that is happening here, but that doesn't decrease the sense of dread and hair-raising-on-the-back-of-your-neck scariness. Instead, I think it will increase your enjoyment as you watch things develop. Talk about things that go 'bump in the night!' And sometimes in the daytime, too! I thought this movie was more intense than the original, and it helps to put the original into a context, and makes more sense out of it all.Is it a perfect movie? No, but show me a perfect movie. They all could be better in SOME way, and this is no exception, but I think it is a pretty darn good movie, and worth the time.Oh, I should also tell you kind of "Where I'm coming from." I LOVE a good horror movie. I LIKE to be scared. But I hate slasher, torture, vicious movies or movies that get too overt about hurting people. Give us something we can feel, something we are afraid of, but don't make us sick. I think Paranormal Activity 2 is just my kind of horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You need an imagination to make this movie work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with the first Paranormal Activity, this movie is largely suggestive instead of implicit with its creepiness. The performances given by the actors are genuine and the characters are more relatable than in the first movie. This movie both expands on the Paranormal Activity mythos and provides a genuinely scary experience, so it comes highly recommended. So many horror movies these days either mistake gross for scary (Drag Me to Hell) or are uneventful/predictable with characters no one could care about (The Strangers, White Noise 1/2, The Eye, Shutter, etc.). The Paranormal Activity movies stand out as the best horror films since the superb El Orphanato, you just have to be willing to fill in some of the blanks yourself to truly appreciate the terror.Many people "pooh-pooh" the Paranormal Activity films, but I think it's likely because they've become desensitized to good horror by all the tripe that constantly comes out undeservedly under the "horror" name these days. Do yourself a favour and see this movie if you are a horror buff. It won't disappoint as long as you're smart enough to understand the movie and what makes it scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite not entirely living up to the original, Paranormal Activity 2 is still another grueling excerise in subtle, intimate terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Happening in the months leading up to its hit 2009 predecessor, Paranormal Activity 2 follows Katie's sister and her family as they experience a series of similar paranormal phenomenon in their home. Determined to get to the bottom of the increasingly threatening occurrences, they decide to set up a net of security cameras in and around the house to see what really goes bump in the night. Alas the terror only escalates, pushing each of them to their breaking points as they confront a ruthless being that feeds off their very woe and angst, that sickeningly wallows in their fear until revealing its final master plan...Despite arguably cloning original's formula, this is still a largely enjoyable and chilling sequel. Although if you weren't a fan of the original's slow-burning and brooding terror, I find it hard to see you appreciating this. It stays true to the original's creed, taking time to develop characters and subtle tension as it slowly creates an increasingly suffocating repertoire of intimate horror. The 'evil' remains invisible and shrouded in eerie shadows for the most part, playing at the terror your imagination can evoke as opposed to visceral scares. The final twenty minutes is essentially a resonation of all the progressive tension built up, hitting hard with almost unbearable suspense and thrilling scare sequences that bring the film home intensely right until the very last disturbingly grim frame.But with all that being said, I can't say it totally measures up to the original's level of brilliance. The security camera shots were a little corny and didn't have the effectiveness of the infamous darkened bedroom shot in the original. I also found the acting to be considerably weaker and the pacing a tad off the potency of the original.Nevertheless, the film captures the essence of brooding, intimate horror perfectly; which is most vital.I won't spoil anything too major, but I will say it ties in with the original's story with surprising competence. Katie plays a major role, whilst Micah also makes a couple of appearances. Oh, and it most definitely sets up for another sequel. Paramount are obviously pushing hard to make this the next big horror franchise.Overall, I was yet again sufficiently creeped out and satisfied by this second journey into the 'Paranormal Activity' universe. The characters were detailed and layered as they faced interesting personal demons as well the evil that haunted them, the atmosphere was great as it focused predominantly on stark and foreboding imagery, and best of all, it wasn't a lame Hollywoodization of good non mainstream material - It kept absolutely true to the tone of Oren Peli's subtle yet profound masterpiece, as well as adding interesting twists and turns to the intriguing story.8/10. If you loved and/or were scared by the previous installment, check this bad boy out. It won't disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The question is - why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scariest thing about this movie is that they actually made it and in the end it just makes me want to ask why, oh why. While the first one was mildly innovative and provided a few scares and could actually call itself a horror movie, this one wants to be a carbon copy of the first one but fails miserably. It's a perfect example of greedy producers wanting to earn more money on account of the first movie, without actually caring what the sequel is all about or how many people who see it will feel like they've been fooled. If after all you want to see the movie, fast forward until the last 20 minutes and watch, unless you want to feel like an idiot because you just spent an hour and a half watching still images of empty rooms. Sequels... there's just something so terribly wrong about them these days, they used to actually make them for a reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total ...Letdown. Ending Symbolizes the entire movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Paranormal Activity was pure genius. This one; not so much. It was obviously made in a rush to capitalize on the success of the original. The storyline was convoluted while trying to tie PA1 &amp; 2 together. It was a disappointment because you can see the potential early in the movie to have been really great. You knew there would be a connection between the two movies, but instead of their plot lines flowing and making sense (like the Saw movies), the 'connection' was a mishmash of stereotypical horror/paranormal genre revelations.There's two or three scenes out the movie that will make you jump briefly, but only because they catch you off guard. You are kept on edge the whole movie because you realize that like PA1 one, You were kept in some suspense waiting for that really scary moment that just really never came; it fell flat.The ending epitomizes the entire movie. For about 10-15 seconds, the screen turns black (no credits, no nothing...just black) and you're wondering if it'll be like PA1 where there's a last second surprise. No, nothing happens. The credits begin to roll; the final suspense and final let down... The ending symbolizes the entire movie in 10 seconds.Not to let an opportunity pass by, it is left wide open for a sequel.However, on a humorous up note, PA2 introduced "Stenchilada" which will stay with me for awhile. I will also say that this version may actually transfer better to home 'video' for viewing and may be a little scarier watched in an intimate setting; especially if you have a little one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay some, if not most of you will like this film if not love it but I found it hard to make it through this. The movie starts out with the us in the home with the family as though we are filming. This continues on until you wish you had taken your Dramamine.At about the time one has had it with this we get filming they install cameras throughout the home (the reason for this is someone has broken into the home and taking nothing except one peace of the wife's jewelery that was her grandmothers). One is given the impression that this ransacking of the home was done by the Paranormal but we will never find out if the Paranormal did it or the reason for the Paranormal taking the jewelery.We then spend a painstakingly long time to build up she scare factor that is to never happens. This continues on and we finally come to a point in the film that we fill is going to give us that good jump but they elect to have a quick simple killing... fade to black... black for 30 seconds... and credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not scared one iota. This sequel was not above the original (which was also not scary) and I kept hearing how much better this was which prompted me to see it.Sister of character in original apparently has a son the Demon wants due to some bizarre story about her dead ancestor making a deal with a Demon for wealth or some other nonsense. Then just like in the original weird things happen at night. Blah blah...Just one long boring scene after another follows none of which generated any thrills for me. Paramount is laughing all the way to the bank.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first paranormal activity movie and from hearing all the hype about this movie series I'm totally disappointed. This is suppose to be a fictional movie, yet they didn't bother to show much of anything other than pans and doors flying open and shut! The only cool part was the mother being pulled down the stairs by the "ghost" over and over again, but thats the MOST action filmed for the whole movie. The end of it consisted of a power outage and the father running around with his night vision camera tossing it everywhere surprisingly not breaking it. All you see for 10-15min is green rolling around on the TV along with some cheap growling effects. Screw this movie. Don't walk into this movie expecting to see a lot of spiritual contact with the living because you will be disappointed. It's mostly a movie playing with sound effects to try to creep you out. If the females weren't so attractive id give this movie a 0 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal activity 1 was made on a shoestring budget of around 15k. No big stars, no huge special effects, and yet one of the scariest movies ever made.This, being a prequel was a kind of introduction to part 1. However, it failed in basically all aspects. It was not only not scary, but slow, really slow. there isn't a climax.If you loved the first, please do not see this movie, it will tarnish the original. I feel bad for all the people who watched it opening day.Overall, I wish I could give it 0 stars, but IMDb makes it a point to at least give 1. It really saddens me that the sequel/prequel doesn't even halfway live up to the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Worth Paying For.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts with a close nit family, a new born baby and of course the house pet, the family suffers a break-in and install cameras in case it happens again. I have to admit that I was getting pretty into it at first and then Katie from the first movie turned up at the house. Bad move. At that point, the whole audience started muttering and became restless. Here was an audience, who expected the new film to be with a new family, to have new scares and to have a whole new perception on watching horror films alone. Did we get that? No. Were we promised it? Yes. After paying an extortionate ?6.50, I at least expected to find myself hiding behind my coat for half of the film, or something along those lines. I understand that with a $5m budget you can't afford to have special effects running through the film, but it looks like a majority of that money was spent on both the motorised flying baby and about 100 meters of fine string to open all the doors in the kitchen at once. However my review can't be said for the other members in the audience. Countless times was my concentration diverted to the amount of people leaving the cinema screen, perhaps they were too scared? Or maybe just like me, simply bored. Not worth the price, not worth 2 hours of my life, not worth using your hands to shield your view of the screen. An absolute joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only thing worse than Paranormal Activity, is Paranormal Activity 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title says it all. Well, I guess the joke's on me because these people actually got me to pay to see these two movies. Seriously, it was the biggest load of garbage I have ever seen. Honestly, I think I may just be bitter because these people made millions off of a movie I could have made at home myself. Just put a camera in a dark room and make some noises, and you've got Paranormal Activity 1 &amp; 2. From what I hear, they're going to "Saw" the crap out of this movie and make like.. another 10 of them. Do people even go see the Saw movies anymore? Anyways, this movie sucks, and you shouldn't waste your time/money seeing it. Maybe if people stop seeing it, we'll get lucky and they'll cancel the franchise before their yearly previews become a bigger joke than any movie with M. Night Shyamalan's name attached to it.</fullReview>

And like during the first movie I was bored to sleep by about half way through. A complete and total waste of my time!!There is nothing scary, shocking or disturbing about this movie at all. When the mom was drug screaming down the stairs into the basement I was laughing my ass off. I was also laughing when Katie showed up as the demon and killed the dad and then punched the mom into security camera. Baby Hunter and his sisters whereabouts are unknown.. oh dear.. now the only thing scary about this movie is that they are going to make a 3rd one... a movie that i will not waste my time with!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little over the top at times, but it's totally worth checking out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last year Paranormal Activity was released nation wide and became the new Blair Witch Project, it was a movie you just had to see because all you kept hearing was how scary it was. The trailer was pretty clever in only showing the audience's screams and members hiding under their coats and covering their eyes. I thought it was an extremely clever film and one of the best horror movies we have had in a while and I noticed others, either they loved it or they hated it. In my opinion as a film buff, it's what we don't see and our imagination that is most terrifying, but in this generation of internet, texting and TV we have a bunch of ADD people who need to see blood or monsters in order for that to scare them. Paranormal Activity was a huge hit at the box office and a sequel was immediately planned, which I didn't appreciate because now it's about the money. However I still decided to give the film a chance and see how the story continued and it actually wasn't as bad as I was expecting. Instead we get more of a prequel to the first film and it explains how Katie became haunted by the demon. This time the demon is haunting her sister and her new family in their beautiful home.In 2006, a "burglary" occurs at the home of Kristi and Dan. Every single room is completely trashed except for their infant son Hunter's bedroom. The only thing stolen is a necklace that Kristi's sister, Katie, had given her. Dan installs a number of security cameras throughout the house to watch over their son, Hunter. The family starts to hear noises and see items fall or move on their own. Martine, the family housekeeper and nanny, believes evil spirits are the cause and attempts to cleanse the house of "evil spirits," and Dan fires her after catching her burning sage. Katie and Kristi talk about being tormented by a demon or unknown spirit when they were children. Dan's daughter, Ali, begins investigating the mysterious happenings. She discovers that on occasion, a human can make a deal with a demon for wealth or power by forfeiting the life of their first-born son. She also realizes that until Hunter, there had not been a male child born in Kristi and Katie's family since the time of their great-great grandmother.What I liked about this film was the characters who were a bit more likable than the first film, they seemed so real to me. The family reacted exactly how most people would act towards finding out that they are being haunted by a demon. There are some genuinely creepy moments, one of the biggest being when Kristi is sitting in the kitchen and BAM(!!!) the cabinet doors fly open as she's trying to keep it together and trying to convince herself that it's not real. There are some laughable moments like when the demon keeps knocking the cooking pan off the rack and all I'm thinking is how bored is this demon that he just wants to more annoy Kristi vs. terrify her? I tell you though, clean freaks beware of this demon! My only other complaint being is that the effects were a little bit cheesy with the demon pulling Kristi out of her room. The first film seemed more realistic with the way the demon was behaving by dragging Katie out of bed. However I did like how the film ended and I think this was a fun addition to the Paranormal Activity story. I wouldn't mind if the sequels continued on other characters, but for now I think it's a good closure and we should leave it at that. I do recommend the movie for a fun scary night, it's always more effective when you're at home alone in the dark.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great formula, repeated and washed down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IF you enjoyed, or I should say got scarred from the first release its normal to want to see PA2. Despite the hype and disappointment of it never being a true story - as viewers we don't really care, we feel like we want to see what happened to our characters, and what else is new in this story. This review may contain spoilers.So the first disappointment is that is is a prequel, that at some point runs parallel to the original story. This doesn't explain much of what happened, and what would happen to anybody but is merely an expansion of the original story, a parallel if you will - that gives no payback at the end. This is due to the obvious option to leave the franchise open to another film. Just wait for PA3 "the explanation" coming sometime next year. this franchise is the most successful movie ever done from a cost / profit standpoint - i could see why they want to keep on milking this cow for at least another run.The story felt somewhat as an afterthought, even if they claim it was announced about at the same time as PA1. It had the same approach, but this time being the second release, some of the elements felt a little forced - as viewers I feel we had higher expectations on the "scary" parts, and though there were a couple hits here and there, the movie built up too slowly, and lacked the surprise of the original. Overall is a cool flick to watch at night around halloween, and somewhat of a decent story parallel to the original. but there's a lot of holes and questions, and really no resolution. Not bad at all, but nothing of a game changer like the original. Also I admire the concept of going to the grocery store, and spending $40 on groceries to make sandwiches, and then selling those for $10,000 each. From a business standpoint this movies are plain brilliant, they took my money for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whoever said that money doesn't grow on trees isn't familiar with the Paranormal Activity franchise. The series has become the cash cow of every movie studio's dream. It currently stands at two entries, but will have many more by the time people tire of seeing the same film multiple times. Paramount did a very good job with the first sequel and was aware of what the fans wanted. Paranormal Activity 2 has more quick scares than the original and builds on its story. It also canonizes the first one's theatrical ending.The movie is both a prequel and sequel to Paranormal Activity. The cast of characters has been enlarged to include the sister of the first film's Katie. Her sister, Kristi, lives with her husband Dan and his daughter Ali. They have a newborn son, Hunter, who serves as a focal point for many of the scares. After Hunter's first birthday, unusual things begin to happen. Objects begin to move independently and loud noises trouble the family. Dan installs security cameras everywhere, and Ali becomes afraid the family is being bothered by a demon. She does some research and finds out that her hunch is true. The demon is after Hunter because of some deal family ancestors made with it a long time ago. After Kristi becomes possessed by it, Dan performs a ritual that transfers the demon to Katie. At this point, the events of the first movie take place. Kristi's new normal life is interrupted when Katie arrives and kidnaps Hunter.The sequel is clearly a corporate production. The movie follows a formula for the entirety of its running time. The characters speak for a few minutes about inane things, a scary event happens, and they react. Admittedly, the first film does this too, but it is able to link the "boo" moments into a feeling of lingering dread. Its downtime doesn't permit viewers to relax like they may this time. Baby Hunter becomes necessary to artificially insert tension and get audiences ready to jump. It's more unsettling to see a defenseless child, whose crib is always kept in a different room despite his frequent crying, than it is to see capable people in terror.Given the lack of a well-presented story, the movie has to resort to several clichés to sew each vignette together. The family's Hispanic maid and lovable dog are the only characters besides Hunter that interact directly with the demon. The maid warns the family to take precautions, which Dan ignores. She is fired and the dog has a seizure just in time for the longest vignette. There are even photos of ethnic people on the walls as an added touch. These outdated stereotypes and the scare formula make the movie seem like such a product. The script was intelligently written to tie in well with the original, but it's superfluous. If you want to see a shaky camera movie this fall, go see The Last Exorcism.Not Recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a letdown.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the first film at the cinema and not being too disappointed (but not completely overwhelmed with praise) I thought I'd give the second one a chance after hearing pretty good reviews from it. I'd also heard that those who liked the first one would find the second one better. I, however, did not feel this way in the slightest. First of all I had to convince my boyfriend to come and see the film with me, making the first 20 minutes of nothing incredibly painful for particularly myself as it was my fault we even bothered to see it. Regarding these first 20 minutes, I watched in anticipation of it getting better and tried to appreciate that tension had to be created for a successful climax. This however, did not occur. I found myself laughing at the incredibly slow progress of 'scary' events such as the mobile spinning and a couple of bumps here and there. I was not the only one. The whole audience at my screening laughed at the film's poor attempt to shock the viewer by levitating a baby. The ending was also pretty meagre as it ended with more people dying just like in the first one, except in the first one it had been unexpected. By the end of paranormal activity 2, I felt almost cheated. Despite this there were some positive elements to this film. The scene in which all the cupboards opened suddenly and unexpectedly was probably the highlight as this did actually spook me. The possession part was also pretty OK, particularly when she was dragged down the basement. These were the few scenes that stood alone from the cheesier, more predictable events such as Kristi being dragged down the stairs - this part had me laughing at it's pure failure to even surprise me. Cristisms aside, the acting had improved vastly so from the first one and I found the actors to be more convincing. I also liked the link between the two films, though I felt it was rushed even so. To conclude, Paranormal Activity 2 is not worth seeing if you are not easily scared. For those of you that find a couple of pans dropping terrifying, then this is the film for you. Other than that, I recommend seeing some more old school, horror type films like The Ring, which I suspect this film got it's main idea from anyway. As for my own enjoyment, the most entertaining part of my experience was the teenager that tripped in the middle of the aisle before jumping out of his skin at a 'scary part' as he went to sit down.</fullReview>

Still wondering why he wanted security cameras installed, yet he never wanted to look at them and rarely did throughout the movie. This truly was a joke, surprised it never came out on April fool's day!

		<fullReview>Last year when I saw Paranormal Activity, I saw it with a girl who kept commented on how stupid the film is throughout the entire movie. She would keep making remarks about how boring and unscary it was, even after the climax of the film. A year later, she went back with me to see the sequel, and she was actually terrified this time around. And a girl in the theater actually got so scared, she threw up outside the theater.Paranormal Activity is one of those rare gems where you love it or you hate it. Most audiences don't like to sit through what they like to call nothing when the film is genuinely trying to build up to tension, to get to know the characters before plummeting them against the unknown. I really like the establishing of the characters where we get to know Christi, Hunter, Ali and heck, even the dog.The premise is simple: A family related to Katie in the first film moves into a house, has a baby, and everything seems to be like one big happy family. Then one day they find that their house is in shambles. Naturally, they want to discover why so a surveillance system is set up to monitor the house. What they discover is that there is something beyond a simple break-in and their lives, especially their baby, could be in jeopardy.I like the fact that the father is a skeptic. He absolutely refuses to believe in the paranormal. The teenage daughter loves the fact that they are being haunted and relishes on what phenomenon would happen next. I like that. It's good build up because we know as an audience that things will eventually get worse, especially if we learned anything from the first film. It's all about character development, in which this film thrives on.As the film progresses, the scares really come out of nowhere. As a sequel, they really had to take it up a notch; not with just having a baby and a dog, but to show those naysayers that Paranormal Activity isn't just about a film with slamming doors. Doors slam, but they take someone with them. The filmmakers listened to their fans, and not only that, they did a great job fleshing out the backstory, and intertwining the two movies together where it all makes sense.I only have a few nitpicks, somewhat minor, but I really did wish they fleshed out the Martine character more. She was a nanny who knew a lot about evil spirits, and I wish they spent a little bit more time with her character. Another thing was that there parts in some of the trailers that didn't make it to the final film. Extended DVD, perhaps? I also was a tad let down by how everything concluded. It wasn't a total letdown, definitely leaves room for another installment, but a little too abrupt for my taste.If you are a fan of Paranormal Activity or at least bit curious of how this one turns out, you owe it to yourself to see this one. It's definitely one to experience at the theater with other fans, and something to look forward to on your home surround system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Bad That I Can not contain any spoilers...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is this? Is this supposed to be a movie? I liked the first Paranormal Activity. It was a fresh look, with ordinary people you can relate to and a story!!!!Story people story!!!What happens in the second?Yes the family has a pool we have seen it. Yes they have a kitchen and there is a mug on the island in the middle.They kept showing the same scenes over and over again every night. May be it is a way to save more money. And nothing happens!Literally nothing. There was 3 door slamming; 5 cracking noise; 1 flying baby; 1 woman dragged on the ground; 1 barking German shepard. And that is it! Nothing more. No story; there are too many characters you can not relate to them because it is so superficial;no explanation...Just some brief conversation about how those two girls were hunted (1 sentence)and the curse of the first born. At the end; you understand it is around the same time Katie get possessed. So it is like a prolongation of the first one. All non sense really. Do not waste your time on this. The producers have to have a little respect for the audience. Such a shame I wasted my time on this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been SO much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love a good horror story, and the premise behind this is a good one- that the sins of the "Father" may be paid for by the "Son." There are strange occurrences in the household, including the house being trashed during a supposed break in. This prompts the installation of video cameras with recorders to record events in and outside of the house. The daughter stumbles across something on the internet suggesting that there may be a demon in the house. This is seconded by the nanny, who senses an evil presence. Sounds like a kind of scary premise, right? Well, that's about it- the premise is never developed. While We learn that the mother and her sister experienced "Disturbances" when they were growing up- we never learn what was the nature of them, only that they do not talk about them. We never learn if there was an ancestor that made a "Deal with the devil," it is brought up and suggested and the movie fleshed out with that premise just accepted. However, it is never explored in any way- and that really makes the plot WEAK. I know it will seem a cheap shot but I will make it anyway- on the cast listing on IMDD the camera installer man is listed at the top. He gave perhaps the most solid performance of any of the actors and actresses, so perhaps it was meant that way. Three stars is my rating- a good premise developed with a weak plot and mediocre acting only goes so far. The sad part is that this could have been so good, and so frightening. My gut tells me, like other reviewers have mentioned, that this was a rush job to capitalize on the first movie, and not an attempt at a good, memorable movie- as it is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surfing on the popularity of the first one, this prequel tries it's best to deliver the same scares with lame results.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Article By: Sam LeGassick Twitter: LG45 &lt;- Please follow! Website: www.thewildbore.com Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Wild-Bore/299067834888 &lt;-Please Add To Your PageFor those who have not yet seen the first Paranormal Activity, you're missing a real treat. Released in 2007 the film was shown around festival circuits to great acclaim, the cast was essentially two people, it was shot in the directors house and used very simple techniques to great effect. In fact, I would go as far as saying it's really a masterclass in film-making.This might seem far-fetched but it's so clever in it's execution that any budding auteur ought to take note. Firstly, the narrative is simple and the 'monster' is really a metaphor for the relationship between Micah and Katie. The film also relies on your imagination to create fear, you're actually subconsciously interacting with the film, it's framing makes you look in places that you wouldn't normally find interesting, in fact you're looking for something in the shadows. It's open doors invokes a Hopper-esquire sense of desperation and mystery with the depth of the image playing an important part in creating the tension. That's the real killer, the tension, there's more tension than anything Hitchcock could have done, and I don't say this lightly. You know watching every diary insert that you're about to see something and it's gradual development from an opening door, a light switching on to a more violent intrusive force makes every night shot more and more unbearable. It plays on the post-9/11 paranoia and terrorism-at-home American sensibility (which in fact is joked about in the sequel). Not only all this, but the sound, the simple effects and the 'possession' (a brainwashing of sorts) all create this horrible yet thoroughly enjoyable 90 minutes of the fear of the unknown and no matter what anyone says, if you're at home by yourself at night you can freak yourself out by just thinking about it.However, once Spielberg got a hold of it and wanted to release it internationally, he wanted to do different scenes and a different ending. Therefore, if you went to see this on the cinema or saw this on DVD recently, chances are it's Spielberg's monster that you saw. I would thoroughly recommend viewing the original, or at least watching the different endings on YouTube because the original ending is a million times better. Anyhow, it's the re-released 2009 version that this prequel draws from, which is important.This might sound like a long-winded approach to dealing with the second film, but it's very important to make people aware of these issues because the problem with the second one is that it recreates, to a much less effect, almost exactly the same as what happens in the first one. The deal is Katie's sister has just had a baby boy with her new family she's married into, after a while things start going bump in the night as the monster tries to claim baby Hunter.The problem is (and here's a SPOILER if you haven't seen the first one) you know you're not going to see the monster harassing them because of the first one. So every noise, every opening and shutting door is just stuff that you've seen before so you don't find it scary, instead you're waiting for the more hardcore stuff. However, all this ghoulish foreplay takes up about 70 minutes of the 90 minute film and there is a LOT of watching nothing, but you're watching it knowing not to look out for anything because you know you won't see anything. The idea of the baby being harassed yet guarded by a brave dog is a good one that doesn't get interesting until near the end and, unlike the original first one (not the remake), they get hassled during the daytime and the night-time. But it's everything we've seen before, dragging them away, opening doors and a ridiculous pool cleaner that keeps turning up outside of the pool (a machine not a man). However, there's something going on in the basement which I thought could turn into something interesting but instead becomes a REC wannabe that wasn't scary at all. Katie's sister becomes possessed and she is completely lame and the whole thing lacks all the originality, all the fear, tension and mystery that the first one thrived on. In fact, it was what made the first one any good, so if you take that away you're just watching people doing nothing and getting scared about tiny things.The company have also not released the details of the cast which is trying to keep to the 'real' element of the first one (when it obviously cannot be real) as we know full well, with enough interviews, promotions etc. that it wasn't real. Why try and recreate the Blair Witch effect the first one had? 'Found footage'. We're not idiots! Who would actually think this was real? The girl was in 24 for God's sake.During the film they try to create more of a backstory and a 'why' to all the attacks but I don't want to know why. The whole point is it could happen potentially to anyone and even though the first one made it clear this stuff had happened to Katie before, that's all I needed to know, I don't want to know all the details of their family tree, of deals with the devil or whatever, MYSTERY remember? When it coincides with the first film it is completely cr*p and the ending made me want to throw something at the screen. It took everything that made the first one great and shat on it, in fact it might have potentially corrupted the experience of the first one for me by being so sh*t. I'll never want to watch this again, in fact I'm really angry about it. (Cut short due to IMDb guidelines please go to www.thewildbore.com to read full review)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked the first one and although this one was supposed to be more intense purely through previews and trailers but I thought it was a total waste of my time and my boyfriend's money....we should have seen something else!!! Very very slow to get in to and although there were some "jumpers" but nothing near to what I feel makes a thriller/horror what it is from this movie. It does tie into the first one but you have to wait and wait for it. And even when it's explained somewhat you still don't really understand why the demon is hanging around anyway...or at least I didn't. I wouldn't watch this again and I suggest that any of you don't bother with this one either, or wait until it comes out on DVD and rent it.....if you feel you must see the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sequel prequel with more paranormal exposition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple become increasingly disturbed by Paranormal Activity in their home that maybe linked to their an infant son. His teenage half-sister against their father wish tries to uncover the truth.This sequel /prequel contains some quality direction by Tod Williams who takes over the reigns for this instalment. With the usage of static security camera's and some thought out camera work it gives P2 a slight edged and a grander film quality over it's predecessor. However, the jump out sound moments aside the sound effects and design appear less creepy this time around.The whole cast are fantastic. The acting is plausible and natural by the leads, notably Molly Ephraim who plays the inquisitive everyday daughter and Vivis Cortez as the 'help'. Those with young children and pets will be left a little more disturbed by this follow up and fans of the first will be pleased by Katie and Micah's return.Sadly, for the most part its purpose is to build up to a big scare at the end. Again it's simply another story told through the eyes of a camera lenses and the writers inject some unnecessary connections and exposition to the goings on which takes away some of the mysteries random edge.It's nearly 15 years since the 'The Blair Witch Project' used the camera point of view and while Paranormal Activity 2 looks better than the first it goes over the same old formula. If you enjoyed and were scared by 1st you'll be blown away by Paranormal Activity 2. Yet, old school haunted house fans maybe left less chilled and thrilled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive follow up to a phenomenal original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***Paranormal Activity 2 is a very scary and dramatic movie for me. I had no idea that this film would connect with the first film In a very smart way. Paranormal Activity 2 is the first film on steroids. It really is because it's almost a twin to the original and had similar scares just more grander and more Amped up. This film is the longest in the series and takes the longest to pick up but the characters are interesting enough to watch for a while. When the scares do pick up they are grounded just like the first film and doesn't loose the formula that worked the first time. It's hard to say if this film will attract new fans. I felt bad for the baby and the dog because they see the demon more than anyone else and are both scared of it. Seeing the baby look around and cry at something that cannot be seen is effective for me cause every baby does that and having a dog bark at something that cant be seen has been done by every dog so it makes you think if there really is something that you cannot see. The films last sequence feel a little rushed and I feel like more could have happened to make it more suspenseful but it really is a shocking ending to see for the first time and Paranormal Activity 2 is a smart and scary film with plenty of scares that take a little to get going but it ultimately is an effective film but like the first one not everyone is going to agree but if you believe in what you are seeing as real and realistic and something that could happen then it can go a long way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Demon strikes again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, after seeing over and over all this film's trilogy, I feel I'm ready to write about this one. "Paranormal Activity 2", in my humble opinion, is the weakest and least scary off the franchise-- which doesn't mean it isn't frightening.It's not that scary as the first version because it's no longer an innovation; also, it takes much longer for the weird things to happen, whilst in the first one you're already scared in the first 30 minutes. It's way less scary than the third, because in there we have cheap jumps and false scares every time, so you never have time to breath. The demon is present in many more scenes in the third; in this version, the demon only scares in the last minutes-- but, at least, he REALLY scares. Kristy, poor girl, gets really creepy after the demon pulls her in the stairs and makes the spectator feel horrified. All in all, I believe it's very well written and the writers were smart enough to make all the three films be logical and believable. Don't be that afraid to see this film, but don't be that calm!</fullReview>

There are a few scary moments.The trouble is is in the central conceit of the film allows us to we see the action through a house from multiple cameras instead of a single cameras, the cutting between cameras undercuts the tension because-if you're like me, you keep wanting to see the bits that weren't included but should be clear in another angle- for example the reverse shots for the stuff in the living/dining room.Worth a look but wait for TV</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well done sequel, but not as memorable as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creating a sequel to a film like Paranormal Activity sounds like a silly idea in theory. The film was released two years after it was made and went on to become a wild, completely unpredictable success. It struck a horrifying chord with audiences, and is one of the few movies I have seen where the participation of the audience was key to the film's overall effect. It was a memorable experience, one that cannot be replicated on DVD. So could a sequel to a film like this do any justice? Rather surprisingly, it can.Paranormal Activity 2 revolves around the Rey family. Dan (Brian Boland) and his new wife Kristi (Sprague Grayden) have just welcomed newborn Hunter into the family, and very soon after, a weird break-in occurs in the house. Despite the family's affection for hand-held cameras, Dan gets security cameras installed around the house. Then weird, unexplained things start happening.Paranormal Activity 2 easily could have been a phoned in sequel made specifically to bank on the original film's success. Instead, the filmmakers have crafted a film that not only ups the ante and precedents set in the original film, but enhances them as well. It gives us more characters and more cameras, and uses them to their advantage in every situation it presents. They even manage to craft a method of tying the original film into this one, in a totally unexpected way. It does what every good sequel should do ? elaborate and extend the story from its predecessor. The sheer fun and surprise of some of these elements is more than worth the price of admission alone. But of course, the less you know about some of the surprises within the film, the better. It was secretive for a reason, and those going in unspoiled will no doubt enjoy the movie a lot more than those with an idea of what to expect going in.What also works is that the film does not do away with the little scares and idiosyncrasies that made Paranormal Activity so effective. It lays them on, and builds towards some pretty horrific moments. While the original film relied on freaky and subtle special effects (the footprints and movement of the sheets come to mind immediately), this film relies more on sound and impending dread. The pumping bass gives away some of the scares a little too early in some scenes, but the unexpected high pitched sounds give way to some incredibly terrifying moments. Despite a higher budget, it felt more minimalist in a lot of ways, and showed that the filmmakers did not let success go to their heads. They wanted to maintain the same sense and style of the original film, and never once do they change this wise mentality. There are scenes that are much more elaborate and look like there was more money involved, but for the most part, it looks just as cheap as the original.The experience of watching with an audience is also maintained here. There are plenty of moments of breathlessness, zany suspense and wild "What the hell is going on?!" moments scattered throughout the film. While the audience is more honed and prepared for some of these scenes than they were in Paranormal Activity, a lot of them still manage to be just as unpredictable and crazy as ever. While I did not see the film with a sold out crowd like I did last year, having a rather large crowd still managed to make the film just as scary as it should be. This is another film that will not be anywhere near as ridiculously effective on DVD.If there is anything that works against the film (outside of a rather ludicrously bad effects scene involving a pool cleaner), it is that the film takes a bit too long getting around to hooking the audience on for the ride. Part of this is because the film's primary characters are nowhere near as captivating as Katie and Micah were. We care about what happens to this family, and we feel the pains and scares they are going through. But we never see the irresistible chemistry or horrifying realism of what is happening on screen the same way. In this case, it is much clearer that we are watching a movie, and the illusion of it being "real" footage is never there. Part of it is also due to the first act being padded out with a bit too much dialogue and set-up for what we can expect to come. I liked these early moments a lot more than most people did, but I still think they could have been significantly stronger and better honed.I also feel that, despite the lengths everyone went to creating a film that did not simply cash in on a brand, its lasting impact was nowhere near as intense and petrifying as the original film. It admirably tries, but it never quite reaches the same heights. It can try all it wants to be just as good, but the lasting effect and charm of Paranormal Activity was just how wildly original it was. It is not an easy film to replicate, and while I admired all the techniques used in this sequel to make it feel in line and a worthy sequel, it simply cannot match up and go the distance as a film that betters the original.I was greatly surprised by what Paranormal Activity 2 has to offer its audience, but must contain my enthusiasm for it. It is the rare sequel that does everything right, but it just never manages to be anywhere near as strong a final product as the original film. It is by no means a disappointment, just simply nowhere near as effective as the original film. And that is not necessarily a bad thing.7/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bring on Paranormal Activity 3!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those rare sequels that packs just as powerful a punch as the original. Its so strange, Paranormal Activity and its sequel were made on super cheap budgets with no name actors, they were made with a hand held camera and didn't even have a soundtrack and yet they are as scary as any high budget horror movie. Both movies are kind of slow getting started, but once the scares start hold onto your seat! I wanted to mention that I think its good that the makers of these films don't use gory special effects like so many others do. To me that is the mark of a truly fine filmmaker. That scene in the film where all the kitchen doors fly open scared the daylights out of me! As always, they leave the door open in the end for a possible sequel and I am looking forward to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I went to go and see this film hoping it'd be scarier, and in general, just overall better than the first which in my opinion sucked.The film began really slow - took just over 20 minutes to get engaged with the "paranormal activity". In that time it was incredibly dull. Now you may think that 20 minutes isn't bad to get engaged into a film but for one that's just under 90 minutes, it's rather slow.There was about 15 loud, bound-to-make-you-jump moments because they're unpredictable/unexpected. Hardly made me jump but I can assure readers that are more faint-hearted or jump easily that it'll be a jumping fest for them when they watch this. Some moments were freaky but some were just "rest assured, it's only this/that" (something like the pan falling/cupboards opening).It intertwines with the first one quite well as a prequel showing where the burnt picture shown came from and why Katie is at Micah's house in the first one, and then it turns into a sequel at the end showing the night after Micah's death and what Katie does to the house in this house when possessed.However a flaw with this sequel part is that if you watched the original version where the police shot Katie, you'd have no idea where she came from in this one.Personally I think the time and day displaying was not needed,I mean does it really matter if it's 1:41am? Especially when time does not play a part of the demonic presence. We know that it occurs during the nights and this is clearly shown with the camera's colour so why show the time? On the whole, better and scarier than the first film (which I had hoped for) and I suppose it was worth paying for. It's one to watch at the cinema unless you own some spectacular surround sound system.If The Last Exorcism made you jump, this will DEFINITELY make you jump. If you got scared of The Last Exorcism, watch this for something freakier. If you thought The Last Exorcism was rubbish, I suppose this is something better to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Cut to final point/spoiler, for the true punch). The first had...well, ye olde 'Blair Witch' simplicity going for it. This prequel/sequel is just, sadly, an uninteresting mess. All right, sure, there is still that inherently creepy vibe of watching the footage. Then, I will give some credit for the bravery of trying the prequel angle. The idea of the sisters as sharing the demon haunting - could be very interesting. But the pacing here is so lopsided, it's painful. Add to this the father and the maid as stock characters (defiantly no-nonsense dude and frightened ethnic) and a basement crescendo that is just impossible to understand, and you get very, very little. Spoilers!! WHY does it never occur to anyone in these things to go out to the freaking lawn, when things are going berserk? Why are no friends and family being recruited to keep the house nicely full of people, until a plan of some kind can be made? Lastly: this is clearly a tough demon. A quick, home-made exorcism from the Yuppie dad, and he skidaddles down the street to possess the other sister, to get the job done? That's the trouble with demons today. No staying power.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened before Paranormal Activity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In some ways this is a better movie than the first, but then Peli had a lot more money to work with this time and previously, so he could afford to splash out. Looking at it from a technical point of view, this one is much more complicated than the first, particularly since Peli is now using a baby and a dog (both of which are very difficult to make movies with at the best of times). Also the special effects are somewhat more impressive, namely because in this film he is using security cameras, so there are a lot more continuous shots and a lot more subtle things can be filmed. In the first movie the plot was limited by a single camera which means that only when the camera was filming, and the spot in which the camera was filming, could be shown. Not so in this film.I guess Paranormal Activity 2 expands on what we saw in the original film, and with the extra budget, can be better with some of the things he shows. The shock value in this film is higher, due to the ability to use security cameras (and the scene where all of the cupboards in the kitchen fly open is one example, also when the demon drags her about the house when nobody else is home).However there are some strange situations, such as when the fire spontaneously erupts in the kitchen and we never see the security camera footage leading up to it. Maybe it is because it is being left to our imagination, but I doubt that it could have been too hard, particularly since he is able to do a lot of other things.The basement scene at the end was somewhat contrived, namely because I find it difficult to believe that the character would carry a video camera around the basement while trying to perform an exorcism on his wife. Maybe it was because Peli wanted the audience to see that scene, but I found it a bit unbelievable myself. Further, there are a lot of inconsistencies with the first film. I raise that because the events in this film are running simultaneously with the events of the first. Both Micah and Katie also appear in this film, but I was under the impression that Katie died at the end of the first film, yet at the end of this film she walks into the house, takes Hunter, and the film closes stating that Katie and Hunter cannot be found. It is as if a completely different film (one that I haven't seen) is being used.I suspect that number three will be about Katie and her sister when they were haunted as children. There is a lot of references to that event, so I suspect it turns out that this haunting was filmed as well, and thus you have Paranormal Activity 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top Ten Things I Took From Paranormal Activity 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>10. You can, in fact, write an entire screenplay on a cocktail napkin. All on one side. With room for your glass.9. Save time by skipping the first 52 minutes. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENS in about the first two-thirds and its debatable anything of significance occurs in the final act.8. Movies that claim to be real (or "could've been") shouldn't cast known actresses such as Sprague Grayden from TV's 24 and Sons of Anarchy.7. There should be a drinking game based on movies that focus in on pools, kitchens, living rooms, front doors and kid rooms. I lost count at SIXTEEN shots for EACH location and in that SAME ORDER.6. Brian Boland, who was out-acted by the sleeping dog, played the funniest character: the dad. Unfortunately, he looked more scared of what his friends and family might think after the film's premiere than the supposed demon in the actual film.5. Gusts of wind can slam doors from the inside much like pool cleaners can leap for freedom. And these are the rationales from said dad. Really?4. While the first movie was a riot ? a downright, laugh-out-loud comedy ? this one was just a sad Short-Sale Advertisement.3. Mockumentary sequels like Paranormal Activity 2 give Blair Witch 2 a bad name.2. The on-screen narration's ("Day 1," "Day 2," "Day 3"?) monotony got increasingly annoying since they were cursed with the world's most patient demon. It waited at least 30 days before it did ANYTHING, such as?wait for it?dropping a pot or opening a drawer. Here's hoping part 3 will sum it up with: "Month 1?in five easy minutes."?and the number one thing I took from Paranormal Activity 2?1. It's nice to see people can still make movies for under $20.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointment same as 1st one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what's so thrilling about these movies that people start to make such a hype about them. I didn't go watch it with high expectation, cause already 1st one was not scary and a complete waste of time, this on the other hand is even worse. you're in some kind of suspense all the time, cause you're waiting for that climax moment when something really scary will happen, but it never comes, so it falls flat and at the end you're left with a blank screen for a few seconds and just when you think maybe one last 'shocker' moment is about to occur maybe like in 1st one, you wait there for credits rolling and at the end you end up just sitting there realizing it'll never happen either. acting is way worse than 1st and the shots are less effective as well. not recommending as its practically just like a home video trying to scare you with some growling poor effects and pans flying and doors opening for which none come out as scary, but rather funny. Only thing that maybe this movie will leave you with for a few min after watching it is this feeling of thinking hmm maybe we are not alone in this house after all either, but it wears out just as quick as it comes, pretty much same as movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictably not as good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think I can find much to say about Paranormal Activity 2 except for that predictably because many of the things it does in the first film are done in the second film, the sequel isn't as proficient as its predecessor at grabbing you by the throat and nearly strangling you to death.Interestingly, this film sheds some light on the subject of the films, and the origins of the spiritual creature that mercilessly torments the protagonist. This film takes part as a prequel, when Katie's sister brings her newborn baby son home, and soon reveals the reasons for the demon's appearance. SPOILER A few reasons for the actions in the first film are revealed in the second. Firstly it is implied that in the murky past of the Featherstone family, a member of the family made a deal with a demon to give said demon their first male heir in exchange for wealth and fortune. Second, the reason for Katie's torment is revealed to be because of the father passing it on to her to save his family (which unfortunately - if you've seen what happens to poor Katie in the first film - makes him and his family seem somewhat cowardly and unsympathetic with the exception of Hunter. As a result, the fear and shock of the ending when said demon now liberated from its prison at Katie and Micah's house and determined to get what it wants, takes it out on Katie's sister and brother in law, is unfortunately replaced with a 'yeah, you deserved that' sort of reaction, which I feel is a bit of a weakness, especially since said ending - though still scary - is nowhere near as horrifying as the ending to the first).These revelations are interesting and add to the story in my opinion, but if the mystery of the films makes it worth watching then you probably should avoid this one.The film is still tense enough to warrant you trying not to look at the screen for fear of horrible things to emerge in front of you, but after the first it doesn't have nearly the same impact. At the end of the day, it's a fun scarefest to watch, as long as you don't expect it to be on a par with the first (sequels rarely are anyway).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10 mins of actual film and about an hour and a half of nothing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected this to be like Paranormal Activity 1 so I set my expectations real low. The only reason I even had a small interest in watching the 2nd was to find out what had happened to the missing girl in the 1st one. ohoho, little did I know that this movie's timeline is exactly the same as the first. I wouldn't even call this a prequel or even a movie.Nothing irritates me more than useless footage and there is plenty of it in this film. I can't even remember how many times I was looking at a scene of a pool cleaner or a normal looking front yard. OOOooh, we find out later the pool cleaner gets out of the water on its own. REALLY? This movie is actually a PG film about an annoying invisible boy taking pool cleaners out of the pool, closing doors, and dropping pans.The climax of the movie is about as much as a middle finger to the audience as you can get. Remember that girl from the 1st movie? They took her and killed off the 2 main characters in the most unhorrific way possible. A snap of the neck and a push to the wall in a span of 30 seconds. Just when I thought the movie was getting good it was as if they ran out of their 3 mil budget. 3 mil?! The 1st one had a couple thousand dollar budget and there's nothing different between these films. Oh that aggravates me and even more when I find out how much this movie made in profit. I am one of the suckers that contributed to that number but they'll have to rob me of my free will if they think they'll get more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot Mauled by Bears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a sequel, not supposed to be as good as the first, and yet I was still pretty let-down by this sad excuse for a working sequel. Three complaints: 1. WHY were the two movies intertwined? What a terrible idea! You know what happens when you write an interwoven sequel to a movie that wasn't made with such a plot in mind? You get ridiculous, gaping, irritating plot holes and a movie that makes NO good sense.2. Pacing totally sucked. I'm not an impatient person, but this movie had me YAWNING! Tossing, turning, cleaning, anything I could do to pass what seemed like an hour of NOTHING happening! Maybe I was a bit amped up to see what was going on because I was trying to figure out what the hell the movie could be about since it happened before the first one!!!3. Plot again. Micah finds what he thinks is haunting his girlfriend in the first movie. Possession explained. THEN teenage daughter finds a COMPLETELY different explanation for what's happening in the second flick. And they are allowed to coexist like that. Some questions that are just eating me alive: If the 'demon' wanted to brat, why does it possess mommy and then aunty? Why not wait till the kid was old enough to possess on its own? And you're telling me that the whole time this crap was going on at one sister's house and the other sister doesn't even HEAR about it? Like, 'hey, I know you were getting haunted last month and now its at my house... you're right they're probably unrelated'.Fools. They could have made a PA2 that had NOTHING to do with the first one and still made a good movie! Instead, what do we get but this sad plot and the same rehashed gimmicks? Pathetic.Two stars. One scene was actually pretty cool/surprising</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't think this movie was as well written as the first. The original built the tension much better. This movie moved even slower than the first, which was pretty sparse itself. About an hour in, I had gotten really tired of waiting for any new developments.The story begins with a couple bringing home a new baby, and as strange things begin to happen, their teenage daughter figures out that a demon wants the child. It is supposedly trying to collect a debt--the first born male--since someone in the family made a deal with a demon to gain wealth. Somehow, the husband transfers the demon to his sister-in-law, which puts into motion the events we see in PA #1.At the end of the movie, we see Katie the night after she's killed Micah. She goes to her sisters house, kills her and her husband, and walks off with the baby, never to be seen again.I think we can be sure this whole backstory was thought up after the first movie was written, because we know the original ending had Katie killing herself while possessed. So the idea that the demon wanted Hunter rather than Katie was new. If there really is a part three, I don't care to sit through it. Whatever technique made the first one enjoyable was lost this time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and too strenuous to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am no fan of these movies which are supposed to be amateur documentaries. Shaking cameras, bad sound (which makes it especially taxing for a person with another mother tongue to understand what is being said, as you have to concentrate so hard), blurry pictures, dark pictures taken with a night camera etc.. I think it gets so strenuous to watch them, that it becomes more "work" than relaxation...Also, this movie was slow and boring. "The Blair Witch Project" in the same genre was at least exciting all the time. The ending was also unsatisfactory: too sudden and abrupt and did not explain anything...This movie also belong to the "haunted house" genre, and as in most of those movies you become very irritated with the owners' irrational behaviour. I mean: in reality people would have fled from the house much earlier than when characters in these movies finally attempt it. You do that if you are normal, to protect your children - whether you believe the disturbances are supernatural or not. This stupidity in the main characters, makes it difficult to identify with them.Still, I give it three stars instead of one, because my heart beat went up a few times, before I became too bored to care... and that (the heart beat) is a prerequisite of a horror movie! :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the first one which was bad but this is really bad..basically the whole movie is so slow, doors opening, pots falling down e.t.c..really dumb cliché ghost stuff..I basically sat through the film waiting for something exciting to happen, last 20 mins wasn't too bad but it didn't save this film. Characters were boring, and I felt like I was about to fall asleep..maybe these films are better in a cinema but I highly doubt it..and now Paranormal Activity 3 is coming out later in 2011 can't wait...not. These movies are now going to become a cash cow and they are going to get worse but the masses will lap these up. This isn't film making this is garbage, it's not a horror it's a very lame thriller..but if you liked the first one I'm guessing you like this one so hey, go watch it and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't really care for this movie. I thought there were a few good scenes, but that was about it. I will definitely see the third one though because I want to know the questions I have regarding this movie. I like how they use a different style with this movie, the way the characters act like they have no idea that they are even starring in a movie! The only good part of this movie was that fact alone, and the cool scenes that did get my attention. Overall, this movie was just barely watchable for me. I can only hope that the third one will be a tad bit better. There were times when I wished the film would have just ended, but of course, it dragged on and on without anything interesting besides just a few scenes. If you want an honest opinion, just watch it off of Netflix or something. Don't even bother buying the Blue-ray or DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior Sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films need time to form and develop.This is certainly the case for 'Paranormal Activity 2' as for the opening 45 minutes, the pacing of the film was punishingly slow and a dreary watch for almost everyone in existence I can guarantee. Thankfully, the film's second half was more than rewarding and it increased the chills that I submitted from the original 'Paranormal Activity' significantly. With this instalments story, you cannot call this a sequel or prequel as it would not attract to any of the terms. Taking place at the same time as the original, we are this time placed in the house of another American family, related to Kate and Micah, who undergo a similar situation to their counterparts at the same time. It's intriguing as links and connections build between the two films and the fear installed inside me was enough to satisfy my needs. The main reason 'Paranormal Activity 2' has the edge over it's predecessor is the fact it's budget is increased by approximately almost $3 million. This gives the film an overall better structure and polish which leads to a larger variety of scares and more interesting camera viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Step-Down for a Few Reasons, but "Paranormal Activity 2" Still Delivers the Thrills Overall, and is a Very Fun Ride...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a bit torn. I feel as though my score of 6 out of 10 may be misleading. For me, a 6 out of 10 film is generally a film I really enjoyed, but felt was a bit too basic, or had some major flaws. And that's what I thought about "Paranormal Activity 2." I really, honestly enjoyed it. It's a lot of fun to watch, and is quite scary at times. I've even watched it repeatedly. It had a lot of creepy moments, it had some really funny humor, and it did something a little different with the whole "found footage" genre. But all of that being said, there were some major problems with it, hence, I had to take off a few points.Looking back at a lot of my IMDb reviews, I always wish I could change them. I won't, just because I want to stand by my original reviews, but I will say that I gave the original "Paranormal Activity" a 7 out of 10, but in retrospect, I'd bump it up to a 9. I reviewed it based on my experience seeing it in an empty theater with my father, who doesn't like horror films, so I was viewing it in the context of a safe environment with someone who was sort-of a buzz-kill, whereas I should have reviewed it on my home-viewing experience. When I recently re-watched it, I fell in love with it in a way I hadn't before, because the at-home viewing experience in the dark by myself helped tremendously. I was able to pick up on details I had missed before, and let myself be more "immersed" by it, and I decided that it was one of my favorite recent horror films. So, officially, I am saying that the first film is a 9 out of 10 for me. Hence I excitedly watched this on NetFlix and plan on buying the third film.I just wanted to tell you about my views on the first film to give this one something to compare to."Paranormal Activity 2" begins a little over a year before the original film. We follow Kristi (sister of the Katie character from her first film), her husband Daniel, her step-daughter Ali, and their newborn baby Hunter. We learn about the recent birth of Hunter and get to know the family a bit, before we cut to August, 2006, two months before the original film. Hunter is now one year old, the family have a house-sitter/nanny named Martine, and things are great.However, one day, they return home and find that their house has been ransacked by apparent vandals- every room has been torn apart except for Hunter's. The family has security cameras installed to help monitor and prevent this from happening again, which is where most of our "found footage" comes from. (That, and the camcorder that Daniel and Ali carry around)This is the set up for the film. Like the original, the film elapses over several weeks, and things begin slowly. At first, it's just small things- tapping on the windows or the pool-filter being removed from the pool during the nighttime. Little things that could have earthly explanations. But, over the days, the activity becomes more blatant and more violent, and the stakes are raised when Ali's research suggests that this presence may be after Hunter.The film is quite startling at times. The horror works well to a point. The eerie sounds in particular are fantastic, and a few "jump" moments are terrifying. However, here's where one of the big problems crops up- the activity is too "harsh" for a prequel. The first film was very subtle- it wasn't until the last few days that anything truly horrifying occurred. However, in this film, the activity seems to ramp up too quickly. Doors explode open, people are pulled through the air, electricity is affected- it all happens much quicker than in the first film. It just felt like a slight betrayal to the rules set by the first film. It should have been more subtle.The acting is generally good. But the problem is the characters- they are a bit more clichéd this time. It all feels more manufactured and "movie-like", as opposed to the real-life feeling of the first film.Also troubling is the final act of the film, which has a lot to do with the original movie- again, it felt like a slight betrayal, because they change the rules and how we interpret the first film.Finally, some of the activity felt too much like special effects, which took away from the film.But all of that being said, it was still a highly enjoyable film, and worked for the most part as a decent follow-up/prequel. Like I said, this is one of those cases where the film is just too much fun to condemn it for its flaws.I'm giving "Paranormal Activity 2" a 6 out of 10. It's flawed, but you will forgive the flaws for the frightful good time it provides. Now off to the third film!</fullReview>

The commercial ads opening the movie were way more interesting, I heard a lot of people complaining during the projection and some people left the theater before it ended. It is slow, annoying as hell, repetitive (I think the main character of the story is the pool robo-cleaner), and when I say that *nothing* happens until the last 20 minutes, I actually mean that NOTHING happens until that time.. and when that time finally comes........... well.... it sucks, like the rest of the movie.Finally you leave the theater room, with the feeling of have been kidded by a bunch of greedy, money-thirsty, soulless movie producers...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To some this will be a slow and boring film, with a few choice moments. It is mostly tension. It forces you to bring the fear yourself. Long, wide shots of large rooms, make sure you are searching each frame for something out of place or abnormal. Your mind may even play tricks on you at times. In contrast to the first film, this was a little better. The main problem I had with the original was the fact that one of the protagonists was completely unlikable. Here we have a close family, and for the most part, people don't act THAT stupid. The real star is the dog, coming off as a protective guardian, and honestly able to act scared and brave almost at the same time. There are some brilliant sections, but it never goes far enough. A third film seems to be on its way, but will it run out of steam?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal activity 2, the prequel of paranormal activity although released after its sequel initially works. That's as much credit as I can give the film. With each thud you're going to skip a heartbeat. It convinces you that while dying might be bad, living with intense fear is worse. The constant wave like noise gets under your skin and tells your instincts that something terrible is about to happen. I've covered the first half hour of the film. The remaining hour is a spoof of the first half hour. The ghost turns hospitable by opening and closing doors, but when it doesn't receive the "Thank you" that's due, it burns a man's testicles. When the teenage girl tries communicating with the ghost, the ghost starts flirting with her by saying that he wants pussy. And a hat. Since she doesn't respond positively, he wakes her up by whispering her name in her ear. Not very imaginative, is he? From here on, he goes on a series of pranks with locking her outside and triggering a false fire alarm when she's making out with her boyfriend in the pool.Here's the twist- it's not a ghost, it's a DEMON. The head of the house refuses to acknowledge the demon's existence. Now, the sensitive demon feels insulted. The increasing anger of the demon drives the remaining half hour of the film. From here on, it works neither as a comedy nor as a horror. The film throws sucker punches by banging open every door that could possibly be opened, when you're expecting the frying pan to fall on the wife's head. The characters are not believable. The characters hold on to the camera even when the certainty of their lives is suspended by a thin thread. There's more chemistry between the camera and the people who feel it up than between the husband and the wife. To make up for that, the demon's character is well developed. He suffers from identity crisis. But the people in the house don't know that, do they? So they assume that talking about the demon would just enrage him further. How close it all came to never happening!From here on, it's hilarious. The dog gets tossed from one corner to the other, you can't be sure if it got humped just before, because the demon's invisible, but it certainly seems so. This scene in particular, is rib crackling especially for PETA activists. Of course, the pets are always killed first. The screenwriters have obviously seen Fatal Attraction and Cape Fear. The film ends like the first one, with everyone dying. The Demon is a wrestling fan; it performs a chokehold on the husband, a choke slam on the wife and walks away with the baby (an allusion to the golden belt). Why the baby? Apparently, some old hag in his ancestral tree hadn't honoured a deal with the demon- to exchange a male infant for riches.Rating- 2/10</fullReview>

The first one may have had a big effect on the supernatural genre, but that doesn't make it good. The third one was actually pretty entertaining, but nothing great. The forth one looks like a steaming pile of excrement. And then there is this one, boring, lame, simple minded, with only one purpose, money. It is somewhat disturbing how much money these films make, considering they are mediocre at best.The characters were bad, I didn't like any of them, and I can't blame them for their acting, it's understandable. The supposed scares are laughable bad, someone getting dragged down the stairs into a basement just looked weird. And I would like to know why ghosts are as strong as a predator and as cunning as con man. Which leads me to the stupid characters. The dad being the most annoying, with his disbelief of whats happening. The movie is one boring scene after another, with those lame quiet sections accompanied by a loud noise. The movie fails at suspense and thrills, so don't expect much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror Series of the Decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the first Paranormal Activity was released to theaters, it caused more stir than any horror movie had in years. It started as a super-super-super low budget film made by friends, and, slowly, by fantastic word of mouth it became one of the highest grossing horror films. For good reason, too; Paranormal Activity and its sequel are truly horrifying films.In an age of movies like Saw 3D, it is difficult to find a horror movie that can genuinely scare you, and even rarer one that doesn't rely at all on blood and gore to do so. What makes the Paranormal Activity films so original is that they went back to the unfortunately-forgotten idea of slow-build and suspense; particularly in the first film, there was no sudden and quick thrills. You waited. You got chilled. The terror built and built and built, almost to the point of being unbearable. I will never forget the way the first film was able to turn the taped night-time sessions into increasingly intense prisons of fear. Each time the lights on screen went out, the fear in the audience became more and more tangible. And eventually that fear realized itself in a haunting, terrifying, perfect finale.This sequel is, admittedly, not quite as dedicated to the slow-build style that made the first one so good; the scares come pretty quickly and pretty intensely from the start. Having said that, it is just as scary and the use of an infant was a perfectly horrifying idea. If you are expecting an average, bloody, cheap thrills horror film, you will be disappointed by Paranormal Activity. This is realistic, believable terror and it is done with an admirable reliance on slow-build suspense and subtlety that makes Paranormal Activity the best horror series of the decade.Jay Addison</fullReview>

The movie and storyline were pretty predictable and childish, so it was like every other horror movie storyline. The home-movie effect ruined it. There was one scene in the end that was awesome though. It was when a possessed chick snapped the dude's neck killing him! It was so ninja-like that I wanted to yell, "Hell Yeah!" , but some guy in front of me, who kept saying his immature commentary, beat me to it. All-in-all it was pretty stupid and i would have rather give the wasted $8.00s to a bum or burn it and watch the flames cause that would have been more interesting!(I'm a pyromaniac...), but seriously if you haven't seen it do NOT go, your not missing anything!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 2 is a low-budget mockumentary rehashing the first installment.The film is slow-paced in the first hour. Despite the director's attempt to build the tension step by step, the similar images repeatedly shown by the cameras fail to engage the audience. In the last 30 minutes, there are some creepy moments which will give you goose pimples, thanks to the demon's rumble, the dog's growls, the creaks of the door echoing eerily in the house, etc, whereas those who have watched the first film may find the tactics used familiar and the story formulaic.To make the most out of the film, you should watch Paranormal Activity 1 first because it starts as a prequel and ends with a twist related to the first film. Besides, you should avoid spoilers and watch it in a cinema with as few talky people as possible.Those who have watched the first film may find Paranormal Activity 2, whose tactics we have already seen, less scary.</fullReview>

Man fires Hispanic maid for being concerned about bad vibes in home. He's against that crap, but has African tribal art all over his walls? Wife doesn't seem to care. Wife has bad posture. Teenager is just generally annoying. The movie starts with about 300 edits. Then cycles through every camera angle in the house to the point of absurdity. Really the most interesting thing in this movie was the automated pool cleaner, and really that's kind of sad. There was no creepy build up. In fact the first sign of demonic infestation was a total house makeover! Please, and the first noise was a sonic boom that let you know the film wasn't in overly creative hands. "People are seemingly breaking into our house every night and little hunter is scared, we need to go out for drinks, hon!" WTF? And then during the climax, it turns out that demons can just be expelled with common kitchen ingredients? Do we ever find out what happens to the nanny? I'm also glad there weren't too much of Micah and Katie as they seemed to have porked out enough for at least 2 or 3 sequels. Katie's breasts, in particular, stunning in the first film, seemed to have given up the cause in the prequel. Wish this was a "Yeah!" review, instead it's just kind of "meh".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Half of the movie is recycling the night time camera activity. Water cleaner moves and in the morning it's out of the pool. Pans do a little wiggle and so on.The movie also has the thing that makes a low quality horror movie; a poor attempt at jump scare. Jump scares in general are lazy way to make a movie scarier but suddenly opening all closet doors may be the worst one I've ever seen.This is one of the few movies I've watched that ware so boring I can't watch in one sitting. Paranormal Activity is the Call of Duty of movies; surprisingly popular and extremely repetitive. When they used the "self-filmed" approach in the first movie it felt refreshing and new. The sequel is just riding on the back of the first film.I could see how this movie would get a good grade for a school project but for a 3-million-dollar movie this seems like a joke, even though 3 million dollars isn't much when talking about movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling Yet With the Same Flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 2 (2010): Dir: Tod Williams / Cast: Sprague Greyden, Brian Bolden, Molly Ephraim, Katie Featherstone, Micah Slout: Worthwhile sequel that displays the same low budget technical intelligence as the original only adding a few new characters to the mix. Taking place prior to the first film, here a family moves in to a big house and have security camera installed after their home is ransacked but nothing stolen. This is all brought together by New director Tod Williams who heightens the suspense gradually as each night grows creepier through the camera. This is effective and works for independent film work without the use of computer graphics. While the first film was no gem, it was an effective breakthrough for fright fans. This sequel is more of the same and it has effective scare moments but it also deals with people who aren't thinking logically. Among the residence are Sprague Greyden and Brian Bolden with their baby Hunter and step-daughter, played by Molly Ephraim. Greyden and Ephrain already feel a presence that isn't right, and Bolden seems to find some sort of logic to conceal any concerns. Katie Featherstone returns as Greyden's sister who urges that any paranormal discussion be ceased. Featherstone is remembered as the female lead of the first film who is also haunted. Micah Slout is more prominently featured in the first film, but here in the prequel he is a reminder of what the future will hold. It seems to contain a better screenplay yet lacking the freshness of the original film, which took independent films to new lows. Score: 6 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same Old Material In A New Package!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set before &amp; after the events of the first film, the second chapter in the Paranormal Activity series is a parallel sequel that follows a suburban family which decides to install numerous security camera in their home, following what appears to be a break-in attempt, but soon discover that the events unfolding in their residence are far more sinister than it seems.Directed by Tod Williams, Paranormal Activity 2 is virtually the same as Paranormal Activity for it follows the very route that its predecessor did and is connected to it by a thin thread. It's got nothing that we didn't see in the last picture, the direction is lazy &amp; uninspiring, the entire script exists on a single page and the only improvement is a much better pace.On an overall scale, Paranormal Activity 2 is an inferior follow-up that lacks the freshness of the original, offers nothing interesting for the majority of its runtime, and is simply a rehash of the events that transpired in the first film. Fans of the original may still find it entertaining or spooky but if you are hoping to find something new here, then Paranormal Activity 2 will disappoint you for it's the same old material in a new package.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not as good as Paranormal Activity 1 but still a good movie, with great story and likable characters. I loved that Katie returned, because she is one of my favorite characters in this franchise. In this film we have a new family and more video cameras, which must means more activity. But no. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie but sometimes was quite boring. I liked the jump-scares(Kristi in the kitchen and the ending-Kristi's death) and how the story develops.In conclusion, the film definitely worth seeing, if you are a big fan of the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big, big movies fan. Especially horror movies. I go to the movie theaters very often if not every weekend. I watch them on TV and all, and I am guess lately -- like in the last 10 years -- you could easily say over 80% of the movies produced are pitiful. It is hard to imagine that somebody really went through all the channels: writing a script, pitch to some show-off a-hole agent who will, in turn lick boots until some Hollywood hot shot who like to be treated like a god decides to take the project on 10%-905 profit sharing basis, you know you're the one with the 10% profit deal. And in the end find someone to produce it. and here is PA-2! A disgrace to horror movies fans! A movie I felt asleep and put my DVR to work and I fast-forwarded it like 7 times. I guess I watched 30 minutes. Franchise is the new name for second tier sequels. Good luck. If you have nothing more interesting to do, nothing at all, if it is snowing outside and you have absolutely no book, video game or a pet to spend your time, it is OK. Other than that, it might help you sleep better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary sequel that's mostly the same as the first but of lesser quality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Paranormal Activity" is perhaps the scariest movie of the 21st century. The factor of not knowing where the heck things are gonna pop out in the dark blended with the subtlety and terrifying reality that sweeps the floor from under you, leaving chilled audiences to the bone was only step one of its success. The sequel delivers fun scares, but it's very similar to the first. We see everything coming and the actual film left out tons from the trailer. The sequel is attached to the original by having the possessed Katie haunt a new family. After experiencing what they think are a series of "break- ins", the family sets up security cameras around their home, only to realize that the events unfolding before them are more sinister than they seem. OOOOOOO! Only $3,000,000 out of the bank and over $80,000,000 at the box office, "Paranormal Activity 2" is definitely a success story in terms of finance. In quality, however, it feels made for the sake of being made. It's better than most campy sequels that had no purpose in being made. Hell, the intention of most sequels is for money instead of a continuous story. This isn't really a story. It's a frightening story with a terrifying climax but just way too many scares that we have already experienced. Let's just say this; it wouldn't be devastating if this sequel never appeared in cinemas. As much as we love a good ghost tale, we have a pretty strong understanding t what the German Shepard is barking wildly at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Credit to IMDb) After experiencing what they think are a series of "break-ins", a family sets up security cameras around their home, only to realize that the events unfolding before them are more sinister than they seem.This sequel is a sham! Plan and simple. The first movie was a suspenseful movie, but they eliminate everything that made the first movie so successful. This sequel goes completely errant and bored me to tears in the process. It was so boring that I did other things at the same time at times. There is virtually NO suspense until the end. This sequel is beyond lazy! There are endless shots of the house, pool and all the accessories! We get this a lot throughout the film. I have no idea what they were thinking, but that is not the way to build suspense. Hardly anything happens until the 70 minute mark! They were basically the same shots in different ways that always ended with the baby crying! It almost felt like they were trying to troll the viewer because they knew it was gonna make a ton of cash regardless. Who cares about quality when you can make money! Everything feels contrived this time! I didn't care about Katie's sister or her plight. There is no proper story structure either. As I said, its contrived. As much as I enjoyed the original movie, the sequels got overbearing! I like my Horror movies to be as unrealistic as possible. The realistic approach backfires miserably here. It takes place two months before the events of the original, so I guess you call it a sequel/prequel? Either way, I didn't give a damn. The acting is technically solid, but I hated almost every one of the characters. Brian Boland plays a selfish Burger King owner and I couldn't stand him. This is the guy you want as your protector? Give me a break! The daughter is the only character that I didn't mind. Katie Featherstone shows up in a thankless role, a glorified cameo. Micah Sloan shows up briefly as well (This was before his death) The ending does have semblance of chills, but it was WAY too late and I didn't care about it. There was no thought or effort put into this film! They clearly saw dollar signs after the first movie, but show nothing but contempt for their audience. I know people are into these movies, but I'm not one of them. I liked the first movie and that's it. If you love boredom, slap in this sequel! The only thing this movie is good for is to wipe your ass with the DVD/Blu-ray cover! 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>::::Possible Spoilers::::This second installment of the Paranormal Activity series actually (for the most part) precedes the events that happen in the first movie by about two months. It's only towards the end of the movie that the two intermingle with each other.Here we are introduced to Kristi, Katie's younger sister, and her husband Daniel along with their daughter Ali Rey and new son Hunter. It doesn't take long before strange events start happening around their house, and as the events start to intensify, we find out more about Katie &amp; Kristi's experiences of what happened to them when they were children. That, and along with the frights and more intense scenes, is what makes this installment a bit better than the first for me - we start getting a bit more of a back story on what is happening (and has happened) to the two siblings. While the first film briefly touches on the background story of Katie &amp; Kristi, it still leaves more questions than answers. This film, however, starts to fill in those answers.While this is not a fantastic movie, it's still a good, creepy movie to watch and the way this one ties in with the first makes it that little bit better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This second installment of the Paranormal Activity franchise was a disappointment. I found it to be very boring throughout, with absolutely no build-up to the paranormal goings-on within the house to the point that they sometimes pass almost unnoticed. It seems with this film they erased everything that made the first one creepy. The characters, however, are slightly less annoying with the exception of Daniel whom I found to be very unlikeable.The only good thing about the film is it tells us more about the story of Katie (from PA 1) and her sister, Kristi, and we discover that Kristi was in fact haunted before Katie and this film follows the story of Kristi's haunting. It also gives us a couple of hints about their childhood and 'something' possibly happening to their mother, which is intriguing if you are interested in the storyline. I gave it 5 stars because it continued Katie's story quite well and kept me interested only for that reason.If you are looking for a good scary horror film then I would give this a miss. I'm afraid this one's just for the PA fans who are following the story.</fullReview>

Her husband has surveillance cameras placed around the house to catch the vandals, but instead it records sinister forces that the housekeeper warns him about, but ignores, which leads to yet another tragic end, as it seems the activity is centered around their new baby Hunter, and Katie as well...Clever structure that picks up events with possessed Katie after the conclusion of the first, at the end of this, but it isn't enough to make this familiar situation that compelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie for cheap thrills with friends but runs no deeper than that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for a fun thriller/horror movie to watch with friends this movie will not disappoint, but the movie fails to run any deeper than the cheap scares and thrills it's predominantly made up by. The movie has no strong storyline or back story that would make it stand out from others, this can be solved though by watching the prequels/sequels but who has time? this could have easily been put into one film instead of the four currently released, after all, the movie is boring. There is one location in the whole 98 minutes the film runs for, this could be acceptable of course if the duration of the movie wasn't filled with the same 4 or 5 camera angles mixed with some relatively unexplained hand-held camera work. The writers try to make excuses as to why the members of the house are filming everything on a hand-held camera despite having security cameras covering the entire house. Obviously the true reason is to make the movie less boring and still than it already is, but I found myself questioning why characters were picking up video cameras and filming everything in such seemingly horrific moments. Fixing this obvious plot hole would have made the movie much more plausible and therefore much more scary.As far as direction and editing goes though tension is well built throughout the film. I found myself on the edge of my seat throughout the majority of scenes.Ultimately the movie will suffice if you're looking for some cheap scares with friends but the movie runs no deeper than that. Predictable story line and nothing of real stand out interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Just Alright</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like the first movie, this movie is just alright. At first, I thought this was a sequel, so I was confused for a few minutes, but that's OK. But then I realized that it was a prequel and took place a month to a month and a half before the first. I didn't learn that until I paid attention to the dates. One thing I've learned about this series is that the directors always do a wonderful job at keeping you in extreme suspense. All of the night scenes kill me every time, because I don't know whether something's coming or not. The first one was absolutely one of the most suspenseful horror movies I have ever seen. Not ever, just one of them. The movie is very similar to the first in many ways, both good and bad. In the good ways, it was very, very suspenseful, and pretty realistic for the most part, but in some scenes I could just tell that there was string involved. Anyway, other good ways are that the film was fairly thought provoking, like how it really makes you think about all the stuff that is going on and what you would do if you were in that situation. In the bad ways, however, the movie starts out very boring with no scares. It took a long time to build up, and I was bored throughout the first half hour. Also, It's just a bunch of stereo-types. Like pans dropping, doors closing, and cupboards opening. In fact, that's what some of it is in the first film. However, in the first, there were also a lot of original things, those I cannot tell you, but you can check out my review for the first as well, which was typed right before I made this. Anyway, my dad was watching this with me, and was so bored that he left with about a half hour left and started looking on Craigslist for guitars. I told him the movie builds up, but he didn't listen. My mom watched the first movie with me so I could see how scared she got. She didn't get scared. I watched this one with my dad because he does NOT get scared easily, and wanted to see how he would react to this. He thought it was terrible. Anyway, I was only genuinely frightened maybe once or twice. I'm sorry Paranormal Activity fan people, but I don't think that this is genuine horror, but that is MY opinion, so don't get all mad. If you want to see real horror, go see Insidious, or Insidious 2, but if you just want to have a good movie to watch at a party, go see this. That's all I have to say. The movie was generally alright, but in a nutshell, it wasn't really scary. Hope you found this helpful. See ya!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you just called the Ghostbusters, we wouldn't be four movies deep.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh goodness. Where to begin.In the first movie, the subtlety was what really kept us screaming. In this movie, the jump scares are in full effect. Gone are the whispers of wind, the shadows, the growls, the three knocks on the walls indicating that yes, the writers did their research and knew exactly how demons work.In it's place is a movie where what could best be described as a poltergeist is knocking things over, breaking things, and dragging people all around.So we have a break in at Kristi and Dan's house, shortly after their son Hunter is born. Kristi is the sister of the last movie's victim, Katie. So what we have is a prequel of sorts. The house is a mess, so a bunch of cameras are installed to catch any burglar activity.First we get a pool cleaner being pulled out of the pool. Then Hunter keeps waking up crying, along with the family dog Abby having fits and growling and barking at nothing. The housekeeper Martine knows something's up, and one night while watching the baby, gets freaked out and blesses the house, which gets her fired.After pots and pans get tossed around, (typical poltergeists, always terrorizing the kitchen), Katie talks to Kristi and tells her basically to ignore it. It will go away. Apparently, the same thing happened to them as children and eventually stopped. (I smell a sequel prequel!) Dan's daughter Ali figures out that when you make a deal with a demon for either power or wealth, the demon will want the first born son of the family in return. Later, while using a Ouija board like a really smart person suspecting a ghost should always do, she asks what the demon wants, and it literally spells out Hunter. But, she ignores that, then gets locked out of the house by the demon, allowing Hunter to walk his tiny baby butt down the stairs and open the cellar door. I have no idea what that's about, but the parents blame the door being locked on Ali, despite video evidence that they refuse to look at proving it wasn't her.I didn't mention this, but this movie is a classic example of stupid men not listening or paying attention to the obvious going on around them. If you thought Micah was bad in the previous installment, well, Dan takes the cake. After seeing the pool cleaner lift itself out of the pool on a video, he decides rather than figure out what's going on, he's going to scare Kristi with a neat trick he learned. You'll see.Later, he tells everyone to knock off all the ghost business, even though things are falling and breaking and being knocked around. Dan, get a clue, would you? That clue happens one night when Abby gets tossed around and Ali and Dan have to take her to the vet, leaving Kristi to get dragged down the stairs twice by the demon, and locked in the basement for an hour, before emerging possessed.She acts completely catatonic for a little while, so Dan leaves Ali with her, and when Ali checks on Hunter, she proceeds to growl to Ali "Don't touch him." Finally, Dan comes home and watches the video of Kristi being dragged around. At first I thought he'd play a trick on Ali by tying a string around her legs and dragging her down the stairs, but no. He wises up and calls Martine, who tells him the spirit in Kristi can be transferred to another family member using some weird ritual, something about burning a picture of that person. (Um, like a picture found in a previous installment. Yeah.) Also, she gives him a cross to drive the demon out of Kristi.So they make their way down to the basement armed with a camera and no flashlights, as the electric goes out and, of course, they wait until it's pitch black outside to do any of this. They drive the demon out of Kristi after some jump scares, and it's transferred to...Katie. (See "Paranormal Activity" review for what happens next.) After Paranormal Activity's most acceptable ending is over, Katie then wonders over to Dan's house, snaps his neck, throws Kristi into the wall and steals Hunter. The end. Except that Paranormal Activity 4 is coming out, which will connect all of these events, including the third installment, I think. By the way, we'll have that review coming up on October 20th, so stay tuned.All in all, so far, this series has had three different feels to it. The first was completely subtle. Everything was implied until all of the sudden, it was right in your face. This movie has explosive acts committed by the demon/poltergeist. And that's apparently what the creators thought would scare people. The kitchen doors all blowing open at the same time is really the only part of this movie that scared me, but it was a small jolt. It doesn't have the same jarring, unnerving, nervous feel as the first one did.And the third installment? Pure unadulterated cheese. You'll see._________________________ For all the Horror Banana's reviews, visit http://morozov924.hubpages.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of the Same and a Bit More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 2 is a rare film. It's rare in the fact that it's a prequel, a sequel and it takes place in between. But the question is, is it better or just as good as the first one? Well, I will say this: It's good but it's not great compared to the first film. Think of everything you that scared you in the first film and you'll get pretty much of the same in this one, but that's not entirely a bad thing. You will get scared and that is what made the first film so great is that it was scary and this one is just as scary.What makes this film good, aside from the fact that is indeed scary is that it delves a little more into the storyline. It now follows Katie's sister and her families dealings with the demonic presence. This time we are introduced to more cameras and different scares with the same results. We learn a little bit more on the demonic presence which is good because we as the audience want to know a little more as to why this is happening to this family and why it moves on to Katie and Micah.There are a few things I had a problem with in this movie: 1. Like I stated it's pretty much the same scares in different ways, but then again what can be done when the entity isn't being seen. It still works, but it's the same.2. It is scary, but it's not as scary as the first one. The first one really scared the crap out of me, while this one just really made me jump a few times but it didn't have the atmosphere that the first one did.Of course it's still a great film, above mediocre but like most sequels it doesn't live up to its predecessor. I'm sure you will enjoy it though!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great installment in the Paranormal Activity series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Paranormal Activity 1, this movie is full of jumps and an eerie atmosphere. The scares are subtle, so you must rely on your own imagination and ability to delve into the plot. You have to be able to put yourself in the shoes of the characters, which is easy enough, because the characters are very likable and the acting very convincing.The plot takes a curious turn by explaining what happened before the events that took place in the first movie. You get to meet new characters, as well as build upon the characters that you already know and like. Unfortunately, Martine did not get the time that she deserved. She was thrown out much too quickly, in my opinion. I think embracing her character would've added so much to the movie.The only other flaw I see is the directors inability to explain in depth why the poltergeist/demon was after Hunter. Daniel's daughter spoke briefly about it, but nothing was ever thoroughly explained. Martine's ritual "treatment" was not thoroughly explained either. I was left feeling satisfied in my fright, but did not have all of my questions answered.If you want a good scare, and are willing to give yourself over to the plot, this is the movie to watch. Don't let negative reviews steer you away. Give it a try yourself. I don't think you'll be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those "Paranormal Activity" movies are so boring and lame.The main reason of why the first one was such a commercial success was because it had a very appealing concept, the idea of supernatural events happening in everyday life, renewing the common archetypes associated from haunted houses stories.However, the first movie was way longer than it should have been, having too many boring and repetitive scenes, with the main characters doing so many dumb things. Personally, I think the plot of this franchise would be way more effective as a short film.That being said, this sequel feels completely unnecessary. It is way worse than the first movie. It not only repeats all the flaws of the original "Paranormal Activity" film, but also made them worse, made the story more boring and dumber.This is one of the dullest "horror" movies ever made.</fullReview>

She could have been Caucasian-American, British, Italian, French, Native American, Irish, Russian, Asian, German, African-American, or even an alien from Mars! Why are housekeepers in movies and TV shows always Hispanic? Putting that aside, I think was really bothered me was that the family went out of their way to record everything! Oh, night vision camera! Let's use that instead of a flash light! Let's film myself looking stuff up on the computer. Let's film Dad's reaction to the surveillance DVR. You get the idea. Now, I was fine with the surveillance camera approach. Heck, if you film a "haunted" house long enough, you're bound to see or hear something weird. That's ghost hunters 101. Anyway, the story pacing is as slow as the remake of When A Stranger Calls. I'm not joking, it's exactly like that tragedy. If you have to see this movie, just watch the last ten minutes or so, you didn't miss anything important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Complete and utterly horrid. I have seen worse movies, but not in years. I thought this was worse than Mortal Combat Annihilation, and feel ashamed at having seen this movie. There were no true scary scenes. Nothing reached out to grab you and attempt to frighten you. It paid tribute to Evil Dead, but in a way that molested more than praised, Honestly, anyone who has a good word for this movie is a liar or never saw it. It's crap, plain and simple. I honestly question the authenticity of the earlier GLOWING reviews. This movie's story is like diarrhea....it's messy, unpleasant to go through, and all over the place.And I would like to know why the director choose to steal themes from Time Machine, the Birds and other older movies. And what is the deal with the calf high boots on these women? Really quite a bore for much of its duration.There is an extreme amount of focus on cleavage, which becomes more pronounced as the movie comes to an end. Cleavage isn't scary. The main thing is that you be entertained</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems to be the norm that sequels are very hit-and-miss; either they blow the original out of the water or completely puts a growing franchise to shame (Yes, I'm talking to you, Pirates of the Caribbean). Paranomral Activity 2 is a perfect example of how this trend in sequels sometimes has it's exceptions. Viewers are equally likely to shrug off this movie as they are to delve into it hungrily. What it comes down to is really a matter of taste. Those who found Paranormal 1's slow pace and subtle horror dull are likely to be satisfied by 2's bold scares and clear plot. On the other hand, viewers who appreciated the quietly eerie style of the first movie and have their misgivings about "jump-scares" as opposed to subtlety may be left wanting. The story jumps back in time before the death of Micah Sloat and Katie Featherston, revolving instead around Katie's sister, Kristi, and her family. Through the hand-held camera, we see a typical (if not freakishly upbeat) family who have just had another addition to the family, Kristi and husband Daniel's infant son, Hunter who is essential to the scares to come. The plot kicks off when the family arrives home one day to find the home ransacked with nothing stolen. Daniel takes initiative and sets up cameras all around the house in addition to a security alarm system, one might say a very nice setup for potential "activity". Unfortunately, much of these security camera shots are vacant of any real paranormal happenings in the beginning and seem to be there only to build tension. When comparing it to the first movie's subtle scares that happen earlier in the film to whet viewers' appetites (low noises and barely-there travelling shadows)one might say the tension went on a pinch too long. When the real scares begin, some (such as the pool-vacuum incident) are almost more cute than sinister. As these incidents progress, Daniel's teenage daughter, Ali, begins researching the potential causes.(Spoilers) As it turns out, the "thing" that is plaguing them is a result of a deal made by Kristi's grandmother with a demon to achieve wealth--this fits in nicely with the first movie, as Katie mentioned that she came from money. The deal, as Ali discovers, was that in exchange for wealth, the first born of Katie and Kristi's family must be given to the demon. We are lead to believe at the end of the movie that Katie and Micah's demonic woes were brought on by the demon being cast out of Kristi's household, left to try its luck at Katie's until it could possess her and return reclaim it's right, Hunter. But wait--is there not a scene in Paranormal 1 that contradicts this? Did Katie not tell the psychic she contacted for help that the strange thing that plagued her and her sister as children always said Katie's name, only pursued Katie? Those who are in love with Paranormal 2 are probably able to shrug this one off and justify it with trauma that could have lead this character to forget what really happened. I, however, am a little irked by this and feel that this important detail in the tying-together of the films leaves a bit too much filling-of-the-blanks to the audience. I like things to be explained clearly and cleanly. This will always bug me just a little.I give this movie a 6/10 simply because it is an entertaining watch and viewers get the scares they came for. For me, this sequel loses some it's stars from a pinch of inconsistency and horror that is predominantly due to "jump-scares". What kept me awake at night after seeing the first movie was the fact that it was so subtle and eerie, playing off the scares we all get; seeing shadows from the corners of our eyes, the fear of something grabbing you if you leave your foot outside the covers ... etc. Even after seeing Paranormal Activity fifty times over, I'm still chilled by the things I catch at the corner of the camera. With Paranomral activity 2, however, once I picked out where all the moments that made me jump were, I could watch this movie without batting an eye. All in all, this is a movie that's success is left up to style-preference and the ability to not be bugged by little inconsistencies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good news I got it free on Sky bad news I feel robbed. It has 3 stars as it made me jump a couple of times. The plot is laughable some demon pact made in the past, I have rarely been as bored watching a movie, I am not sure if it is my English ears but I could barely understand the actors {actors?} muttering away, when I could make out what they were saying the dialogue was very mediocre. While watching it one of my cats wandered in and started grooming himself and it was actually more entertaining than the film. Slow is barely the word most of the film was like watching a cctv of a car park which probably would have been more exciting.The Blair Witch project broke new ground with its is it real? we know these are actors in Paranormal so the least we can expect is action, plot, dialogue, suspense and we get non. The only character I empathised with was the dog. Avoid this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't Micah die and Katie disappear?????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm pretty sure that in the 1st Paranormal Activity Katie killed Micah and then she disappeared as what was said in the end of the movie so my question is why the heck are they in this movie????? How does that make the viewer think that the movie is in some way real if they are gone? Did anyone else pick up on that? Also wouldn't it be in the director's best interest to make a movie with a new family and not add people from past movies to spice up the movies. I feel that this was bad judgement on the directors part. I also think that it took way too long to lead up to the action in the movie and made it quite boring for a viewer who is expecting to be scared. The director should have put a short background story and then the rest of the time scaring the you know what out of the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is at least a bit of stuff going on this time around but it's still a bland horror move</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some reviewers claim you have to use your imagination for a movie like this. But this movie tries to go in a realistic approach to all the supernatural stuff going on and it fails in that level. The first "Paranormal Activity" was bland with it's characters and not very relatable. This time the characters are at least somewhat relatable and the direction isn't all that boring to the point where it's almost unwatchable. But that isn't really saying much since I didn't like the first one in this franchise. There is plenty of horror movies that is done with a shoestring budget that is much superior and way better than this. Maybe this isn't the type of movie I enjoy or something but I just wanted it to end after a few minutes in and all the way through it. This movie also tries to connect with the first "Paranormal Activity" but it doesn't connect very well and seemed a bit forced in. The development of the family in this movie seemed a bit drawn out although it's relatable but the character decisions in this doesn't make any sense sometimes. Which takes a lot away from the realism of it all. The scenarios are even more non believable with all the weird stuff going on and the ghost/demon in this comes off more childish than actually scary. I mean it's nice to see at least something going on but most of the time it's just arguing about what is going on and later at night appliances just moving around and that sums up most of this movie. So yeah the ghost/demon just comes off silly just toying with appliances and crap constantly than intimidating. This is a typical horror movie that is very generic and predictable. With the father of the family not buying into supernatural stuff and always in denial until it's too late. The only thing that is different is how the family is videotaping what is going on in the house. Just very slightly better than the first one but not by much at all.4.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen the original Paranormal Activity and I thoroughly enjoyed the intensity of the mood and the subtle, creepy occurrences that led to a great climax. This sequel ties into the original and builds on its suspense and creepiness in all of the best ways.For those of you stating, "this movie is not scary" or some such jargon, you should know that this movie is not your typical horror movie. This kind of horror is the kind that requires an attention span greater than that of a five year old suffering from ADD, it also requires close attention to details. The images of the rooms are not quite as they appear if you pay close attention. That is all I will say so as to avoid spoiling any of the movie for anyone reading this review.The story, as stated, ties into the original quite well. The characters are well developed and they really draw you into their story. The camera, as with the first, resembles homemade video footage. In addition to this there is also footage from security cameras placed at various points throughout the property/house. . This is generally fairly effective in regard to building the viewers sense of anticipation and tension, although at a few points in the film I found myself wishing that the camera was steadier. This is a minor complaint and more often than not I found myself pasted to the screen, holding my breath and waiting with anticipation to see how the story would unfold.The acting is fairly well done as well. I don't know what other reviewers are talking about when they complain about it. The actors did an amazing job at capturing the "real" feel of the characters in the movie and I have no complaints whatsoever in this regard.There are scares to be had here but if you're looking for something like Insidious or other movies that rely on "jump out at you" scares then you will likely be disappointed. The scares here are the kind that make the viewer feel unsettled and sends shivers up the spine of those who still have some form of an imagination left. I recommend to those who wish to see this movie that they bring with them a modicum of patience and an active imagination. The more active your imagination is the more fun you will have watching this. There really isn't much else I can say without wrecking the movie, suffice to say that if you're looking for an unsettling ghost movie that slowly builds suspense than this movie will mostly likely be for you. If you are of the frame of mind that a horror movie needs gore, blunt and overdone scare tactics and nudity then this movie will not be for you.I also recommend viewing the first Paranormal Activity before viewing this one because knowledge of the first one makes this movie even more unsettling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent Horror Flick...but Falls Flat to the First One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I just finished watching Paranormal Activity 2 alone late at night in a dark living room, a setting that I pondered about whether to go through with at first (As the first Paranormal Activity really creeped me out) but thought what the hell, my couch is against a wall, and of course there is no better way to watch a horror movie; especially when it's about demonic spirits haunting a house. It turns out that yes I did want to reach for the lights a few times, but overall I was quite comfortable in the dark on this one.Paranormal Activity 2 focuses on Katie's (the woman that starred in the first film) sister and her family as they move into a new house with their teenage daughter Ali, a dog named Abby, and their newborn baby Hunter. The film takes a bit longer to develop the characters before odd things start to happen and inevitably take a turn for the worse. I must admit I thought the characters in this movie were much more interesting and real than the first, especially the father and daughter. However the film as a whole does not deliver in the end, which is too bad as, given some of the material, it had the potential of being much better than the first film.Having said that Paranormal Activity 2 does convey a very creepy and ominous atmosphere, that leaves its audience (especially viewers of the first one) on edge and alert to what may be dwelling in the dark. The film does deliver a couple good scares; some scenes that come to my mind are the kitchen cabinets simultaneously exploding open (I jumped at that since I was expecting the pots to just drop again), and the toy vehicle rolling across the floor by itself while playing a creepy melody. All in all though much of the scares are more of the same: doors opening and slamming shut, ouija board meddling, fires starting by themselves, wife being dragged out of a room and down a stairwell (I couldn't help but laugh at this as it just appeared so unreal and campy while everything else in the film was more subtle.) I felt more could have been done to strengthen the story and add better and more distinct scares. I wish the director or writers had done more with the baby monitor, the shadow figures, the basement, and even the parents' bedroom. So many subtle scares took up the majority of this movie that by the time really drastic things begin to happen the movie is over. The climax of the film was exciting, but the nightvision basement scene couldn't help but remind me of REC which is a much better horror film.My biggest disappointment with this movie was the way it ended. I wish the scriptwriters hadn't tried so desperately hard to fit the first two movies together as far as events go. They even could have ended this story on a happy note rather than at the last minute bring Katie over (quite randomly and viewers who missed the first film would not understand) to finish off the father and mother in really stupid manners. In fact I don't think that even fits the first film as far as the timeline goes as I thought it ended with a demented Katie curled in a fetal position for days in her bedroom before being gunned down by police (At least that was the ending I saw in Paranormal Activity 1).And so I conclude, Paranormal Activity 2 is a must-see for people who enjoyed the first one, but don't expect this movie to exceed it. The movie has a compelling yet lengthy build-up with interesting characters but then quickly falls flat on its face and delivers one of the worst endings of any movie I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still gives me goosebumps, but the end was like wtf m8</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying, this movie is still a mind f**k.Although, after watching the first, you can see how the "paranormal activities" pan out from beginning to end, predictably so. That being said, it was easy for me to skip the first bulk of the beginning.Now, compared to the first movie, the shock factor is definitely more immediate with more loud popping noises, less build up. Not a lot happening in terms of back story; you get Molly suspecting her grandmother sold the soul of her first born for wealth. Again, not a lot of elaborate build up, as any horror should have. But since your anticipating something to go wrong, the loud popping, banging noises still gives you a fright, no matter how anticipatory your nerves are.What REALLY cheesed me --- So, the people behind the screenplay, obviously wanted a direct prequel to the first movie. SURE go ahead. But the ending of the first movie, showed Katie, after killing Micah, going back into a catatonic state until police arrives. Near the ending, they state Micah dies Oct 8. The following video states Oct 9, in which Katie, still bloodied up, just goes to their house, snaps the husbands neck, goes upstairs and superman punches her sister into the corner.W T F? I can't express my bewilderment for such a stupid ending. SUCH A STUPID ENDING. Goosebumps go back down, eyebrow goes up, and you wonder who the hell gave the green light for one of the dumbest endings of any movie.Lets put it this way. Before I saw that ending, the movie, IMO, deserves a solid 7.5/10. After - easy 3/10. Worst ending to a decent movie. If you watch PA2 first, then watch PA1, you'll be even more confused. GOD WHAT A TERRIBLE ENDING! Still if your bored to tears, like I was, give it a shot. But stop the movie after [3 Weeks Later]. Eject the DVD. Break it, Burn it, then spread the ashes over a pile of trash, where the ending belongs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all i must say that I'm a big fan of the first part. A very big fan. It was something fresh, something with a kick, it was able to scare me (it is a very difficult thing to do with the level of "horror" movies in this past years) and most of all it had a soul. I liked everything bout this movie. So when i heard there will be sequel i was feeling like a school girl waiting for new twilight movie, because you can't ruin something like that, right?..... Wellllll it appears you CAN! IF there would be Oscars for animals the dog in this movie would take it. YES the DOG was the best thing in movie about the GHOSTS....... Basically every scene of this movie was BAAAAADDDDDD.... Sometimes it was so stupid that even the creators was later thinking "ah, what the hell lets leave it we'll make millions out of it anyway"... GRRRRR!!! The first part was low budget so i was thinking "hey, maybe their different, maybe they will not focus on making more bucks but put everything on story". Oh, how I was wrong... Well OK, maybe it's just because i'm angry about what they did with an idea of this movie but in itself is a watchable. I will not write that it's "unwatchable piece of sh*t, stay away at all cost". If i wouldn't see the first one i would probably even enjoy it in some way... so if you want a night-movie with friends go rent it, but if you are a fan of first movie... well i can only say you will be disappointed A LOT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a good reason why Steven Spielberg was so interested in promoting these movies in the first place - he wrote the plot back in 1982 and called the movie "Poltergeist". I enjoyed the first PA movie for this reason but PA2 is too much of the same. Opening cabinets, banging noises, moving chairs, a woman getting dragged around by something unseen, little kid(s) and a dog, a psychic investigator pronouncing a demonic possession of the house, and a teenager who thinks it's all kinda cool at first. The PA movies have much of the same creepier plot points as Poltergeist while taking advantage of the video camera viewpoint fad which already has been done to death. Sure, some of the special effects in Poltergeist look a little cheesy and dated by today's standards but the intent was sound. As a movie score fan, I also miss the subliminal scare that music adds to a movie, and better picture quality helps as well. Fans and haters of the PA movies should revisit Poltergeist (not the sequels so much) and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now after a couple years of this film being out I rewatched it the other day. I still think out of all the paranormal films I find this to be the most engaging, and scary film out of the series. It was better paced than the original, had more likable and relatable characters, and delivered more well executed scares. It did have some shortcomings...I wish the directors of this series could find a better way to film things a little more naturally (they achieved this slightly with having cameras set up for security in certain rooms in the house, but some of the shots with the characters holding personal cameras were not as natural (conversations about possibly a ghost being the young daughter's dead mother for example) could have been done on the security cameras and just have the scene moved to a room where those cameras were set up. I understand the more intimate aspect of having the personal camera shots but i feel like those should have been reserved for (shit hitting the fan moments, and when they wanted to show the aftermath of supernatural activity.) If this would have been tweaked a little I think the film would actually have been way more natural feeling and believable.</fullReview>

It's watchable without being particularly engaging, so it plods by painlessly enough, but it constantly walks the edge of boredom.Somewhat interestingly, it's set before, during and after the original movie but, not as interestingly, is comprised largely of shots of empty rooms; uneventful to the point of self parody, it's really only in the last half hour that anything happens, and only in the last ten minutes that anything scary happens.Ho hum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptionally fun and entertaining sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Convinced a strange series of household disturbances are the result of intruders, a family's efforts to contain the culprits on hidden cameras result in them discovering evil spirits are haunting the house and obsessed with their danger, putting them in danger to get out alive.This turned out to be a wholly entertaining effort on it's own and is certainly better than the original. The fact that this one finally gives us a storyline plausibility for the hauntings is where it gets a majority of the positives here, as this is a fairly new idea that's in play which is so rarely used it's a shame that so few use it that it feels new and original for it's being utilized. As well, the fact that this makes such a cool impact on the proceedings of the film within that there's a far more damaging take on the actions against the family, as there's finally a reason for the hauntings to take place here since it plays in nicely with this story, and those hauntings are just so much fun. From drawers and dishes clattering open at just unexpected times in one massive strike to lifting the infant out of the crib through seemingly-invisible means, itself a chilling sequence, to similar scenes attacking the family itself that make for a non-stop continuation during the finale, this has some rather fun scenes in here that make it quite enjoyable and gets a few jumps out of it. There's still some flaws here, mainly in the way it's supposed to interact with the first one that never feels at all like the events are connected beyond the shared cast, since the events don't really line up all that well and none of what's explained in here gives an explanation for what happened in the first one, especially when it comes to the finale which is just a mess. The first-person camera isn't an annoyance to the tune the first one was, but it's still pretty hard to make stuff out at times which again really hampers what's going on within the scene when you can't tell what's happening, and with a slow build-up it takes a while to get going with the hauntings since the set-up doesn't allow for any on-screen happenings until later on in the film. Overall, though, it's still quite fun.Rated R: Graphic Language, Mild Violence, children-in-jeopardy and animals in danger.</fullReview>

That's not really a story. If there was any story behind the original, it was really a story about great marketing.But in addition to the well made story, it had actual good actors. Sprague Grayden is a seasoned veteran at this point with some good work already. And Molly Ephraim who would soon be in a sitcom with Tim Allen. The addition of real actors make it a more watchable affair. I understand the original had no names and it added realism for some people. But let's face it, if you had half a brain, the original couldn't possibly be real. It was a faux realism, and done boringly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard various things about this movie, having not seen the first Paranormal Activity i was determined to watch this film when i found it on Netflix, and so i did. What can i say? This is probably the most gripping and tense film i have ever seen, it keeps you watching it on the edge of your seat and offers a host of excitement and thrills, i loved it. Paranormal Activity 2 was better then i was expecting it to be, the fact that the movie is seen through security cameras and hand held cameras makes it a unique viewing experience, its different from other horror films.Paranormal Activity 2 is such a clever film, the way shadows and lights are used creates a terrific atmosphere of tension which unlike in most films, is actually quite enjoyable to experience. It is more of a psychological thriller, there is not much physical horror in the movie, it is more of a 'what was that?!' kind of horror, where it truly relies on the viewer spotting the little things like moving shadows and quite noises. It is basically a piece of genius.Fresh, exciting and genuinely terrifying, Paranormal Activity 2 is an absolute thrill to watch and will keep you up wondering what 'that noise was'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to start by saying that these series of movies require a very specific mindset, atmosphere, and audio system to maximize the experience. This is not a review, it is meant to give you, the viewer, and idea as to how to enjoy this movie. So many gave it low starts because, frankly, they just don't get it. I also believe the major problem is many watched it in theaters. This type of movie will not work in those environments. They will not work because there are other people who will probably scream or make noise and it will be a distraction. You really need to be alone, because you cannot be embarrassed to be scared. You need to get sucked into the terror. To best enjoy this movie, you must watch it alone, at midnight, no lights on, big TV, no external noise(dead silent house)and a very powerful 5.1 audio system with a sub woofer.Okay, this part is important in my opinion. You need to have an imagination, you are not going to be SHOWN visual terror like generic horror movies like Saw. Those movies "scare" you by showing you scary environments or events. And honestly, those movies aren't SCARY, they are just intense and thrilling.This movie is meant to SCARE you. It requires a certain type of person to really enjoy it. Why? Because you need to have an imagination. You will not be shown something you are supposed to interpret as scary. It is more implied, that something may be lurking. You need to have experienced this yourself in real life to really understand it. Have you ever heard a noise in the middle of the night? Did it send shivers down your spine? Did it freak you out to think someone might be in the house. In fact, while you lay in your bed, they might be in a shadow staring at you.. This is the type of emotion this movie is supposed to give you. It is not a cheap thrill, it meant to tap into that fear and maximize it. If you have never experienced any of those feelings before, then don't bother with the movie as you will not understand and will be left wondering why anyone would watch something so boring.Anyways, for me, this movie freaked me the hell out. I don't believe in ghosts per se, but this sort of thing gives me shivers down my spine. I don't know why, but it just does. I literally had tears in my eyes at some points while breathing heavily, I was that freaked. This movie requires that you have a sub woofer(a real one, at least 10 inches). Their is an ominous low frequency rumble starts to appear when something is to happen. It is meant to build suspense and get your heart rate going as you wonder whats going to happen. So if your watching this on your TV, with no sound system, again don't bother. Its is completely mandatory.In summary. This movie is not for everybody. You need to have felt that shiver in your spine at night to really understand what this movie is about. You must watch it alone, midnight, silent house, NO distractions or lights, with a big TV and powerful sound system.I gave this a 10 because it really did its job in freaking me out.Anyways,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A less creepy co-quel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely not a sequel in the conventional sense of the term and not quite a prequel either (since not all of the action in this film takes place before the action in "Paranormal Activity"), "Paranormal Activity 2" is kind of a co-quel to the original. The story here focuses on Kristi and Daniel, a married couple who with a newborn baby, Hunter, and Daniel's daughter from another marriage, Ali. The link between this film and the first does not become apparent until Kristi's sister Katie and her husband Micah (the main characters from the first film) arrive for a visit. When Micah first appears, a graphic on the screen informs us that we are seeing him 60 days before his death?and the puzzle pieces begin coming together. Since there's a small child and a dog involved in this story, the terror potential is a bit higher than it was in the first film, but it seems to take an unbearably long time (and a seemingly infinite number of surveillance camera shots?of the same household scenes) before anything happens. The home video/documentary style narrative still works and affords us just enough information to co-construct the narrative, but this film delivers fewer spine-tingling and genuinely creepy moments than the original. When the action does happen, it is abrupt. And even though this film fills in some of the gaps in the original narrative by providing some additional information about the demonic power that's terrorizing Katie and Kristi and their families, it also ends with a scene that appends some information to the conclusion of the original and ultimately points the way to the third film in the series. Despite some inevitable disappointment, fans of the original will probably enjoy this one as well?but not as much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen(and Yes, I watched the whole crappy thing and have been watching movies for 50 years). Nothing happens for the first 75 minutes. We watch an hour of surveillance video. We watch the scenes looking, hoping for something, anything to happen or even MOVE. Just move. The pool, the family room, the foyer, the nursery. The pool, the family room, the foyer, the nursery. The pool, the family room, the foyer, the nursery. Oh. look the dog got up. The male lead is not an actor. That is to say he does not know how to act. The women actors are OK but they don't have a script worth reading much less acting. If you watch this trash on DVD jump to the last chapter and you will see ALL of the action in this cheap, inferior, awful video (can't call it a movie).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that some people who gets scared by this movie might be too sensitive or fearful to pretty much anything out there. Seriously, like the first one this is pure garbage halfway into the film and I was wondering why everybody call this film scary at all. 45 minutes into the film and nothing happened. There was one scene that lasted about 5 minutes and it was nothing but a shot of this retarded couple sleeping through the night and the only thing that happened during the night was that the bedroom door moved about 5 inch. That freak you out people? This movie is pure garbage. For real...I turned it off close to an hour into the movie. I rather watch wedding videos of people I don't even know. The only scary thing about this movie is that they actually have a third one and most likely a bunch of mentally handicap people will soiled themselves over a freaking curtain moving back and forth....and they wont shut up about how scary this it. Save yourself the time and do not watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This gets my second worst movie award. The gold medal for worst of course goes to number one of this. This is supposed to be a prequel to the first one which is absolutely ridiculous because apparently every house that this person around is haunted (stupid i know).This movie takes place in the sisters house of the girl in the first one. Of course her house is haunted too for some odd reason not worth explaining apparently. Then of course once again they film some more people sleeping and then some loud noises and some screaming. This is slightly better then the first id prolly give the first .5/10 and this one .8/10 sooo slightly better but still please don't waste your time. Much like the first one unless you like boring movies that wont make you laugh cry or feel anything then this might be for you. STOP MAKING THESE TRAVESTIES!!</fullReview>

The opening scene is dull and describes the family it is also similar to the original. The next scene shows the whole house ruined except Hunter's (Kristi &amp; Daniel's son) room. So the family put cameras all around the house.Kristi &amp; Ali (Molly Ephraim)(Daniel's teenage daughter) get freaked out by invisible movements but Daniel dismisses them, saying it's merely the wind or a coincidence. It is unclear why the demon remains in the household but with the help of an Ouija board Ali finds out with her boyfriend but they never take proper notion of it.DONNOT WATCH THIS ALONE AT NIGHT!!!!!!!

		<fullReview>paranormal activity 2 is sort of a prequel , and not a sequel to the first, it follows the sister of the haunted girl from the first movie, and her and her family's experience with the paranormal activity occurring at her house. Fist the bad stuff, the movie had a bad pace, most of the first half of the movie doesn't have anything to do with the demon, just an awkward family and their problems, and the rest of the movie was not that scary, there was only one scene that I jumped at( If you see the movie you will probably know which scene i'm talking about).We still do not know where Kate wen't, the only thing we know now is that Kate was not the only one being haunted in the area. I sure hope the next movie occurs AFTER the first movies time frame. the positive things about this movie are very few. The movie had great acting, and great character chemistry, so much of it that it took up most of the movie.It was also interesting to see the family's reactions to all the chaos. Other than that, i'm not that impressed with this film. It could have been better</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw the first one and it was long-winded and underwhelming. Here we have more of the same, only with more people involved and a (very) slight increase in the backstory. One of key reasons why people like myself can't take ghosts, demons or poltergeists seriously is that their actions don't make any damn sense whatsoever. What in the name of Beelzebub was the point of getting the kid out of the crib, letting him wander around the house alone, and then putting him back before anyone re-entered? Why do such entities need to open and close doors? Can't they just kind of float around between floors? Look, since the 'scares' mostly involve the kind of cheesy parlour tricks favoured by those who post YouTube videos with titles like 'Real Ghost Caught On Camera!' do yourself a good turn and spend an hour or two checking out some of those rather than renting this. You'll feel a lot less cheated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of scary movies. Paranormal Activity was far and above one of the best I've seen. But what really won me over was how real it felt. It didn't feel scripted or acted out to me. In PA2 I do enjoy looking deeper into the storyline from the first movie but the fact that they were tied in so strongly made that realness that I enjoyed from the first, disappear. I also wasn't crazy about using more established actors. When "Kristi" was first shown on screen more of that realness faded. I'd seen her on shows before. In the first movie Micah and Katie were complete unknowns. The lack of familiarity added to the idea that it was just someones home movie, which made the first one much more scary.I did very much enjoy this movie. But I think, especially for just the 2nd installment, I would have enjoyed it more if it was a completely different, unrelated story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Predictable demon picks on family, father spends many days telling himself that its the wind rather than evil spirit, most end up dead, very little explanation" Paranormal activity 2 is a lesson on "average". You need to be very patient indeed before you see anything really happen. The film is only 91 minutes long but the first 60 of that is watching some quite wealthy Americans sit by their swimming pool and go about their day to day tasks in a very mundane way. Yes, i accept that this is to build tension for when something does happen but there is too much build up for little reward.As in the first film you never really see much happen, just a few doors slamming and a dog getting scared and barking into mid air. An imagination would definitely help with this movie. But you can't help but feel you're using your imagination a little too much when you have paid to see something happen on screen.It is a well known fact that in horror movie, dogs and/or children are pretty evil and sinister. The inclusion of a child and a dog in this film could have been utilised so much more, the cameras set up around the house never managed to pick up anything gruesome which is a lucky coincidence as the film makers never had to splash out on any special effects. Because of the lack of tangible events, the average acting, average wealthy American setting for which the demons always seem to choose to scare i am scoring it an average 5. You can't blame the film makers however as they were only cashing in on a very successful first film and films like this are easy to knock out with little imagination and budget and big profits. It was a for gone conclusion that it would be made and its pretty much how i expected it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie does not get scary until the last 8 minutes of the movie. It is a prequel at first then a sequel. Katie is creepy at the end of this movie. I was quite disappointed because in the trailer you see this creepy woman at the door of the baby's room, but no they decided to cut that part out along with the baby being in the middle of the street. I don't understand why because it totally would make sense in the movie. The fact that they made less horrifying than the first is an extreme letdown. I mean it's not like the worst movie in the world. It does have it's moments but meh it's mediocre. OK so I have to talk more because you need ten lines of writing. Not cool. So OK the one scene where where Katie appears and breaks the dad's neck is cool and then she throws the mom into the camera and she takes the baby and leaves which sets it up for another sequel (Paranormal Activity 3) which comes out this year in October (BIG surprise) I am hoping that this one at least gives you nightmares like the first one,or is a least more scary than this one. I mean the nanny who only speaks Spanish sucks! You need her to speak English. This movie is not worth seeing in theaters so go rent it.</fullReview>

Save your money - purchasing this one is not worth it. Maybe if they were to try a third movie they could relate the storyline to some of the reality based ghost hunting shows out there. Basically the majority of the movie action / and fright effects happen in about 10 minutes of total movie time. What a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 2 is more or less the same as the first movie, the difference being it's more of a play on the storyline itself.Given the movie has to make up a excuse to have the cameras set up so it can continue in the same fashion as the first, the movie gets it set up pretty quickly and moves into setting the story.One thing I found though, it does take awhile to set up the story. Painfully we wait so the story is virtually spelled out for us, but once things start to get interesting it keeps the pace up.The acting is OK, I guess the actors have to work with what they are given, but the casting was pretty good. The effects were a step up considering the budget was bigger this time, but i feel they could still have done better, like in terms of originality.All in all though, I read other comments about movies like this where people say "worst film ever" or "Totally fake", but I mean it's a horror movie, of course it isn't true, we watch movies to escape from reality. And it is not the worst film ever either.I gave it a 6/10, which some may consider generous, only for the fact that I don't nit pick everything, I just sit down and watch with my coke and pop corn.The Bad: Storyline is predictable and childish. The Good: The acting is pretty good considering and the last 15 mins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Paranormal Activity movie was quite an original little film (well, as original as these 'found footage' movies can get): it had a domestic setting and the mysterious demonic goings-on were being captured by a couple who had cause to set up a camera in their bedroom. With the exception of a silly bit of demonic vocalization and some ill-judged CGI, it was a genuinely creepy little yarn, one that actually came back to haunt the viewer later if he or she was in the proper mindset. Put it like this: you'd never look at an open door leading to a stairs in the same way again? This sequel comes almost snapping at heels of the first due to its fast turnaround time. It's more of the same, of course, but with a slightly different angle on the original tale. For one thing, it's actually a prequel and this time round it's a married couple that is at the center of all the demonic activity. The man, a widower with a teen daughter, is married to a younger woman who we quickly discover is the sister of Katie from the original movie. The devilry is actually captured by a hi-tech multiple closed circuit camera system. The reason behind this is actually worked nicely into the plot: the couple are compelled to install the rig after they return home one day to discover they have been victims of a burglary but, ominously, one in which nothing was stolen. After the cameras are up and running, they start to capture strange goings-on, which start off creepily, though harmlessly enough, but gradually start to escalate to increasingly high levels with most of activity seemingly focused on a specific member of the family.On the plus side, the film doesn't feel just like a cash grab. There is some thought put into the story. It's a logical sequel/prequel that feels true to the first. Micah and Katie from the original film even show up in a perfectly credible story strand and their connection in the prequel is written effectively into the plot. Overall the story is actually woven believably into the mythology established in the first movie and everything ties in nicely. However, this doesn't come without a price: the prequel is so intent at trying to get Slot A to fit into Slot B that it slightly deviates and in doing so, violates and contradicts some aspects of the original, but these only come to light if you're really looking hard enough. If you're not, chances are it won't be a problem for you.If the first Paranormal Activity was all about subtle and believable scares, this one is more in your face and suffers all the more for it. Because the spooky happenings are bolder and more ambitious, the degree of realism that the original had all but disappears here. You quickly remember you're watching a film and not some intimate piece of authentic home movie footage. Furthermore, the film replays a lot the scare tactics from the original to the extent that the familiarity factor starts to creep in and any chance of real terror quickly dissipates.Essentially it's not really all that scary, certainly not the type of film (unlike the first) that will give you the willies if you're all alone later on. Any shock/scare that does occur in the movie is of the loud banging variety and this in itself ? as with the first movie, but more so here - is always anticipated by an annoying and continuous sub woofer rumbling which gives you forewarning. Surely a rapid thump without the silly build-up/notification would have been more effective? Even when they do get away from the bangs and crashes, the one standout sequence (shot in infrared) is executed so confusingly, it's hard to even tell what is going on.Even though the multi-camera system does help to tell the story better and offers more coverage than a single camera would doing the job, a lot of the time it just feels like we're watching? um? security camera footage? which doesn't in itself make a movie. We get endless static shots where nothing is happening and it does grow tiresome after a period of time. While this material is augmented by hand-held video footage (which is always preempted by an 'I'm going to record this' line from one of the protagonists) it doesn't have the same intimate feeling of the single camera approach of the original. Furthermore, because of the 'CCTV' aspect, it always feels like we're observing strangers caught on CCTV rather than getting actually invested in the characters. For this reason alone, the frequently utilized hand-held camera is a Godsend and just barely prevents the movie from becoming just a collage of static security camera images.There are unanswered elements so presumably we can look forward to parts 3 and 4, as there is more than enough material for it. In this age of diminishing returns, by the time they get to Paranormal Activity 5, the demonic entity will surely be a fully realized computer generated Playstation game type creature. But the logical question is: is the film any good? There are two answers to that: as a standalone movie, it's perfectly watchable and enjoyable. But as a sequel to Paranormal Activity? It's not really that frightening. Loud ? yes. But frightening? No. As with part one, the budget isn't spent on lavish computer animated effects. This is movie is all about loud noises and things that go bump in the night? but those that are polite enough to give you ample warning first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first "Paranormal Activity" was genuinely scary because it was something of a novelty. It had few characters and kept the audience waiting for its thrills, building up slowly, but inexorably, towards a horrifying conclusion. Much of its impact comes from the suspense generated by having most of its events take place, slowly, at night.The sequel provides some of the background, and a brief codicil, to those events and uses the same approach - it was even filmed in the same house. However, it really takes things too far. or maybe not far enough. The shocks are fine when they come, but we are kept waiting WAY too long for them. Along the way, we are treated to too many shots of the same things, particularly that wretched pool cleaner. These people must have the cleanest pool in San Diego.The real problem, though, is with the characters. Worst is the main male character, Daniel (Brian Boland), who is basically a jerk. His skepticism comes to seem pigheaded rather than rational. At a crucial point, when his family is dissolving into chaos, he chooses to leave the house to go to a business meeting. Most reprehensibly, when the truth of the situation is clear even to him, he resolves it by foisting the whole problem onto someone else.The consequences are fatal for them, but Daniel does get his comeuppance in no uncertain terms just afterward, At that point, I actually cheered.Rating: A disappointed 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 2 begins promisingly with the introduction of new characters; more than than in Paranormal Activity. This meaning more people to protect from the ghostly goings-on we know are going to transpire. Cutting to the chase, the new family believe their house has been broken in to, so they install security cameras around their home. Now we know we're going to be viewing the remainder of the film through these cameras, and also a very helpful hand-held that someone always seems to have, for some reason. It is fair to say that Paranormal Activity 2 is rather slow at getting to the spooky bits. We witness a few bizarre moments involving a swimming pool and a saucepan, but we are still firmly sitting in our seats. We do, however, know Director Tod Williams has far more in store, and that's why we eagerly carry on watching. The success of Paranormal Activity 2 is thanks to its simplicity. With no jaw-dropping special effects and buckets of blood, we aren't looking for a film about to win "Best Picture" at the Oscars. Audience's flood to the cinema for the genuine frights they know they'll get. Which is something missing in most horror films these days, with their unnecessary and scare-free re-makes. Humans are scared of the unknown and that's why Paranormal Activity 2 triumphs. We never actually see what is haunting the family, and that terrifies us. Our imagination is allowed to run wild. This added to the drawn-out silences and careful editing is a recipe for a true horror film. The clever link to Paranormal Activity is another reason this film deserves a thumbs up. Without giving anything away, the reappearance of Micah and Katie lures us in to wonder what is going to happen next. There are a few laughable moments, including the sinisterly named baby, Hunter but, they are quickly forgotten when the family's beloved Alsation is included in the hauntings. The story may not be completely original, with the man of the house typically disbelieving anything paranormal is going on, but this just involves the audience, we and his daughter urge him, "look at the tape! Look at the tape!" Overall, despite a slow beginning, Paranormal Activity 2 may not be as effective as the first (probably because we now expect the long silences to lead to a loud bang) it still delivers a handful of jumpy moments that will keep you entertained until the (again) shocking ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The found footage gimmick, for some reason, still doesn't irk me as much as it should. Yeah, it means awful-looking movies with a shaky, grainy look, trite dialogues, lousy character development, little rewatch value. Still, it can work: it did in Cloverfield, REC and, to a certain extent, even the first Paranormal Activity.Sadly, PA2 is just not scary. A long build-up of tension is fine, but there is a fine line between slow pacing and repetitive padding, and the movie tip-toes over it. The premise of the demon-haunted house, with the inhabitants' growing realization of the danger, is not used to its full potential. After ANOTHER scene of nocturnal footage with the dog barking at an invisible intruder, I grew bored. Guess what? We came to see the monster. I appreciate you don't want to show it right away but, if I had wanted to see a dog howling all night long, I could have watched my neighbours'.At least with the first movie one didn't know what to expect, so it was moderately unsettling; here, the repetitive structure grows obvious and tiresome. Hint: found footage is not an excuse to have a lazy screenplay; the genre actually requires a particularly strong, well-balanced script, or it becomes a recipe for cinematic boredom.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in the day, they made movies about ghosts haunting old castles and mansions. Eventually they'd move to farms and the suburbs. With advances in special effects, filmmakers could show us horrendous things. 'Poltergeist' is a prime example of a really scary haunted house film with amazing state of the art effects. The difference between it and something like 'The Haunting' though is a lack of subtlety. A few years ago, a little independent Horror film would harken back to the days of leaving it up to the imagination. The sequel would continue this trend, also successfully.Pros: Above average performances. Suspenseful. Well paced. Does a good job of adding to the story. Plenty goosebump-inducing scenes. Raises the stakes. A few good jolts. A hell of an ending.Cons: We've seen much of this before.Final thoughts: They say that lightning doesn't strike twice. The first 'Paranormal Activity' was such a success that a sequel had much to live up to. A lot of times sequels disappoint, but that's not so here. It's not equal to it's predecessor, but holds it's own as a fun and scary time at the movies.My rating: 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some intelligent producers knew they had created a profit monster with the original Paranormal Activity, and so was spawned a cavalcade of sequels. By cavalcade I only mean three so far, but this is a franchise that will keep on going until it stops making money. Anyways, Paranormal Activity 2 is the sequel to the infamous Paranormal Activity. This sequel begins a few weeks before the events of the first film. It follows the family of Kristi, the younger sister of Katie, the main girl from the first film which meets her demonic demise at the end of that film. It plays out much in the same way as the first film. There are some weird noises and strange events occurring in their household, so they decide to buy security cameras to set up all over the house. And, as anyone would expect, things get pretty creepy from here.To me, this is an incredibly scary and disturbingly clever franchise of films that are so much fun to watch. I have a soft spot for any film done in this first person camera style of filming so this entire franchise is right up my alley. I think you can go into these films with a skeptical eye and you will come out hating the film, but if you really just sit back and enjoy these films for what they are they can be awesome. They are really entertaining, put together with a great suspenseful atmosphere, and they get truly scary when the time comes. To me, these films are all very successful in what they are trying to accomplish.As far as Paranormal Activity 2 goes, it at times feels like more of the same, but the filmmakers actually do a plethora of devilishly clever things throughout the film. The introduction of the surveillance cameras adds a whole new element of creepy to the film. Each night we jump from camera to camera, seeing the same things around and outside the house, just waiting for what is going to happen. The suspense is cruel at times as we just sit and wait for a door to creak open, a chair to move, or a cabinet door to fly open. This is an element that the original film did a great job of, and Paranormal Activity 2 just keeps it going. I wouldn't say that it is as scary because we already know, to some extent, what to expect from this demon, but nothing stopped Paranormal Activity 2 from scaring the hell out of me.Honestly, you should see this film. If you enjoyed the first one at all then Paranormal Activity 2 should be a really fun experience. Don't be a party pooper and go into the film full of skepticism. Just enjoy it, be scared, let it get inside your head.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 2 has a barely existent premise- the only hint given is that something's fishy and yes, the ending is disclosed right in the beginning. It has a Blair Witch Project style of filming- using a hand-held camera in many of the shots. The only distinctive quality is the use of surveillance cameras; otherwise the movie is entirely inspired from BWP. But Paranormal Activity 2 fails to emulate BWP; it holds back too much and tries to scare its audience with silences but tanks.A couple moves into a huge house, with their two children- one a typical tween/teen that can't get her hands off the hand-held camera. The wife's sister is the predecessor's lead, and it's obvious that it's now her sister's turn (Poor family!). There is even a Latin American stereotypical maid who can 'sense' supernatural feeling along with the baby and the dog. Mysterious occurrences unfold at a mundane pace, which at first seems fairly entertaining but then begins to drag. The climatic scenes are uninspired and predictable.Paranormal Activity 2 invokes no fear at all- it doesn't take advantage of shadows, corners, silences and instead relies more on surveillance cameras which rob the intensity of the so-called-scary sequences. BWP had a hand-held camera; the tension was continually visible and intense. PA2 simply malingers. It's sad that the credible performances from all the actors remained wasted.My Rating: 2.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can't expect much from a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching paranormal activity 2 and I can tell you it's a piece of crap. Nothing happens for the first hour of the film. I'm not against slower movies but out of a horror flick you're expecting entertainment not great cinematography. The first film was very decent because it was independent, made a bunch of money and had an idea that didn't need to many resources to be executed. I'm sure there was much more budget for this one, but yet they decided to do it just like the previous one, so it ends up like a big Hollywood movie trying to imitate and independent low budget film.The way in which this movie tries to scare it's audience is by using very loud noises. It's inevitable to feel surprised when that happens and I also think it's a valid way to scare people in a horror film. But any scary movie should also have a strong story behind it. I think the first PA lacked a good story or at least one strong enough to make a sequel out of it.I know I'm being harsh on this movie and you shouldn't expect much from a crappy sequel. Yet I just finished watching it and felt inspired to write a review on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subpar-anormal Activity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Six months before Katie and Micah are terrorised by a demonic force in their own home (as documented in Paranormal Activity), Katie's sister Kristi (Sprague Grayden) and her family suffer from a series of similar terrifying supernatural occurrences that appear to be focused around toddler Hunter.Having recently watched the first Paranormal Activity, I was keen to discover what new tricks the film-makers had devised to ensure that the prequel remained fresh and unpredictable. In short: they hadn't! With the exception of some preposterous exposition in an effort to link the plot of Paranormal Activity 2 with events in the original, the format of this film is virtually identical to the first, only a lot more monotonous.Once again, the action consists of spliced together video footage, primarily from the series of security cameras installed in Kristi's luxurious home after an apparent break in, but also from the hand-held camera belonging to her teenage stepdaughter Ali (Molly Ephraim). As the supernatural events escalate, Ali desperately tries to convince her sceptical father Daniel (Brian Boland) that something is terribly wrong in their home (apart from the fact that the parents let an Alsation sleep in the baby's room and haven't installed stair gates!).For much of the time Paranormal Activity 2 feels like the cinematic equivalent of a Where's Wally book, only instead of wasting time searching for a bespectacled man in a stripy outfit, the idea is to try and spot almost imperceptible movement in an otherwise seemingly static environment, the most likely result of which will be eye-strain rather than abject terror.After much unspectacular supernatural malarkey, the malevolent demon finally musters up the energy to make more than a baby's mobile rotate slowly or a saucepan fall off a hook and delivers some genuinely effective scares (accompanied by very loud noises to wake up those who might have dozed off), but when all is said and done, this second movie is far too similar to its predecessor to be considered a worthwhile follow-up.4.5 out of 10, rounded up to 5 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>pretty decent movie with no scares, not much horror or suspense........ its a love story simply. people are comparing it to Paranormal Activity 1 and the Blair Witch Project which are way better as far as the actual paranormal content is concerned, don't watch it for the title just watch as a simple love story. very slow and boring, but sweet and enjoyable. do watch it, it won't be a waste of time. The special effects are unsurprisingly lacking considering the budget, and they actually look as good as most 90s era computer games. The demons themselves are never really appear at all. Of course the camera work is 100% hand held, given the rapid filming schedule, Overall, Paranormal Activity 2 surpasses most of the typical sci fi channel trash, with it's suburban location and a highly formulaic premise. Check it out if you are a fan of this type of movie. The story has a little bit of Office Space mixed with Falling Down with an ending reminiscent of Fight Club. Enjoy! This may be the best $15 movie ever made, Most of the time it feels more like a romantic comedy than a scary movie, and yet there's opportunities for napping all the way through. watch it for a change from the usual movies. Good and familiar in a ABC Afterschool Special kinda way, but with plumpers. ;D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The scariest thing about the existence of part 2 is that they are making part 3. Some things better don't go into franchise. Blair Witch was a perfect example. And here we have the same. Were part 1 did have his scary and jump parts this one doesn't. Two reasons I guess. You already seen part 1 and here not that much happens. Part 2 continues were part 1 ended in some kind of way. But they tried to scare us with using a toddler. No for me kids or toddlers can become scary in horror flicks because they used to be so innocent. But even that part didn't really worked out. Some things do happen with him but overall it's a bit lame. Okay, doors open and the kitchen has a life on his own but it takes a bit too long before humans get possessed. I've watched the unrated extended version which is 7 minutes longer than the theatrical version, didn't know why I did it. Part 1 was surely not for the squeamish, this part you can easily watch with a rookie. Easy cash-in...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ties in well with the first movie but lacks the realistic human nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a fan of the first movie, especially because the movie didn't use the typical Hollywood formula for horror flicks. The movie didn't rely on nudity, sex, and gore just to bring in viewers. This film is the same way. It uses the same great mix of sound and paranormal actions to make you jump and send chills down your spine. I also like how the movie was tied into the first one. It gave a nice background to Katie's past and explained why the events in the first movie took place.But here is why the movie only received a six in my review. Unlike the first film, the characters weren't very realistic and were poorly developed. The first movie was simple with only a few characters. Yet those characters were clearly understood and acted mostly how you would expect someone to react in a similar situation. But in Paranormal Activity 2, it was confusing how each character was related. I eventually figured it out but still went to this site in order to make sure of the relation of each character. One thing that many people agree with me about is that the characters didn't act very realistic. There is no way a decent functioning family would ever act like this. In the whole movie the toddler, who is very significant to the story, stays in his crib. All day long the family doesn't seem to ever care about the child. Throughout the film family members pick up the child, calm him down if he's crying, then put him back in the crib. When the paranormal entity becomes violent, the family never seems to care about the child's safety. Even when the child is obviously in danger, the family doesn't watch over him. The father's character was very poorly written. For being someone who obviously was financially successful, he sure did a poor job of making good decisions. When his family is in obvious danger, he still leaves his daughter home while he goes to something "important". He doesn't show any concern for his children nor his wife. If you go through the comments on this site you will see plenty of people complaining about the same issue. It may not be a big deal in some movies but in this film the characters are supposed to be very realistic. This movie relies on realistic characters. But the only characters who seemed at all natural were the maid, daughter, Micah, and Katie.The ending of the film also seemed to be thrown together. I won't go into much detail because I don't want to spoil the film for you. But the last fifteen minutes really frustrated my girlfriend and I. I threw my arms up in the air and remarked "What the heck is going on?". The movie started off quite slow and then moved rather swiftly the last few minutes. When the first movie ended, I was astonished. When the second movie ended I was frustrated and puzzled.If you liked the first movie, you still might like the second one. If you didn't like the first one, I doubt you will like the second one.</fullReview>

Seriously, anyone associated with this festering sore of a movie should be ashamed. It's a real Alan Smithee production. Its only hope (which sadly will probably bear fruit) is if enough people are so suckered into it that they'll rave to their friends and get them suckered in too, a la Blair Witch Project.

Whole movie is like watching an "empty" house through security cameras. Frustrating and boring, just can't state that enough. Though something had me going through the whole movie, while loudly saying "such a waste of time" it is still absolute boredom. Acting actually was not that bad, but who could know for sure when everything was going through house security cameras and aka Blair witch kinda perspective. Those last 10 minutes should be happening in first third of the movie or at least provide us with some action in first 60 minutes. I can honestly say that most topic related movies in 80's were much much better and we all know that just a few of those are actually watchable. This is a true 1 star and 90 minutes (give or take) wasted. Last few minutes just can't make up for the rest.</fullReview>

The scary parts are some pots moving in the kitchen, the cabinets opening, the baby being dragged and the dog getting punched. Not too scary in my opinion. I think they were trying to use the Blair witch theory too much and it failed. I can't believe people actually pay money to watch this crap.

		<fullReview>I can honestly say that I do not find the Paranormal Activity movies horrifying but I do give them credit for indeed being disturbing. They offer chills and might cause you to keep looking over your shoulder when you are alone in your house, but I expected a lot more from the second film. I didn't see this in the theater (I saw Saw 3D instead...worst) so maybe I missed out. But watching this at home, I felt that most of the movie was just footage where you're just waiting and watching for something to actually happen. Nothing remotely interesting happens for a long time into the movie. What I want to know is why did the demon start off with a bang and trash the house in the beginning, then just go around moving bedroom doors? We see that the demon really hates the pool cleaner but doesn't cause any real disturbance for awhile. I found myself yawning a lot through most of it but when the real action started occurring it was enough to keep me interested and redeem the movie. I heard about the alternate ending, and yeah it's disturbing, but you kind of figure that that's what happened anyway even though you don't see it in the theatrical version. The acting wasn't too bad either. I found them all pretty believable. Overall, this movie wasn't horrible but nowhere near being great. It was a good movie to watch in the dark right before bed that wouldn't give you nightmares.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I'm not telling you that this movie has exactly one scary moment and you'll have to wait quite a while to see it. I was yawning most of the time and was waiting for something to happen. I find it quite surprising that adults and teenagers in the US all go to bed before 10PM - this made the story quite unbelievable. And what's the story with that pool-cleaning thing anyway? Yeah, I only rated it 4 out of 10, because it was basically just a silly movie and cash-cow based upon Paranormal Activity (episode 1). I just noticed they're even making a third movie - I wonder if they'll come up with anything a bit more exciting. I just hate those scenes where things start to become interesting and 1) everything gets dark all of sudden and 2) the camera goes in full-action Parkinson shaky mode. This stuff started with the Blair Witch Project and they just can't seem to get enough of that horrible camera technique! Why the heck do you think they invented tripods! I guess these DOPs are real DOPeys :-) Ah, well, it was only a couple of dollars to rent it, so I'm glad I didn't go to a cinema to watch it - that would have been a real waste. Oh and guys... next time... in episode 3... don't use that silly sound effect as if something is going to happen - that takes the whole surprise away! Maybe these producers should learn something from Alfred Hitchcock - he would have made Paranormal Activity something you would literally never forget, whereas this movie... well... what was the title again?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't a fan of the first movie, because it was hyped up to be oh-so-scary, but it was just a lukewarm experience. This sequel, well I found it to be even less interesting than the first movie. And it is even less spooky."Paranormal Activity 2" is good in the way that it is slowly and genuinely building up suspense, but it failed to deliver what it was building up. The culmination of the climax was sort of anti-climatic to say the best. Throughout the movie, you are given small pieces of something dark and sinister building up, and you are left in the dark, wondering and clueless. And when you are shown what is happening, you are left with a flashing question mark over your head, and going "what?" The acting in the movie was actually adequate enough, despite it having a fairly small list of people in it.One of the better parts of the movie is the aspect that the dog and the child senses the presence of the "demon" (or entity). But you never get to see what it really is, and that was (for me, at least) very disappointing. I am sure that some liked the part that keeps you in suspense, where you don't get shown stuff, but I like to see what is actually going on.There weren't any scares in the movie, at least not for me. No shocks or scenes to make you jump in the seat, and that was a major disappointment. Actually, I had no particular expectations to this sequel, because I found the first one to be uninteresting already.For entertainment value, I found the movie to be disappointing, but I am sure that there are people out there who will find this movie interesting or even scary. For me, this was hardly a horror or a thriller, it was just a build-up to an anti-climatic ending. If you like horror movies, then there are far better choices available to keep you entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Answered Everything That You Wondered After PA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Paranormal Activity (the original) came out I left the theater wondering two things (knowing that there would surely be a sequel.) 1)Will Katie's boobs actually get a lead part in PA2? 2)Can we witness Micah dying again for the assurance that his douchebaggary is officially dead?Luckily for me, the directors came through in the clutch. Katie's boobs make a guest appearance in multiple bikini shots. The director also gave an added bonus of cleavage throughout the entire movie. There were parts where even the father had a little bit of cleavage showing. Oh, Mr. Director how well you know your target audience. Sure, we college aged males like to be scared at a midnight showing, but you take it that extra step. There is only so much that can be said about being scared after the movie, but cleavage talks can last throughout the night. Thank you for giving us that privilege.In answering the second question, we didn't actually get to see Micah die again, BUT we know. I'm glad they brought him back for a little bit so that we could all remember why we were glad that Katie killed him. Then we are shown that he, in fact, is dead when Katie walks into the final scene with blood on her nightgown. The fear that the scene is supposed to instill was overtaken by the immense joy I felt in reminiscing about the death of Micah. Thank you also for that!All-in-all, it was a very good movie. They took what worked for them in the first one (literally, they took every paranormal activity that happened in the first movie) and multiplied it by a million. A little shock value was lost because we all knew what was going to happen. Oh, nothing happened day one? A small door movement later on? A huge bang? Doors flying open? Sheet moving? Person being drug out of a room? All of this happened before but somehow it kept it's liveliness in PA2. I am preparing myself for PA3 where Katie and Hunter rove the land looking to terrorize the world Jason Vorhees style. Paranormal Activity 3: Revenge of Katie Galore</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After coming home and seeing their house vandalized the Rey family installs security cameras to catch burglars. The cameras pick up much more then that. If you have seen the first one you will know what to expect as far as the camera work and basic feel. I did not realize going in that this was a prequel, in a way. If you have seen the first one you will understand more of the aspects of the movie. It's not really an easy movie to review. The original scared the crap out of me, and I was tense all through this one too, not because it was really scary on its own, but more of a hangover from the first one. The original was a better movie overall and this one felt forced, but it is still very much worth watching if you liked the first one. It didn't scare me nearly as much as the first one, but I really liked the way they tied the two movies together. Not really sure they need a 3rd one, but they are making one anyway. I guess horror directors and studios just don't know when to stop. I give it a B-.Would I watch it again? - I think I would, after re-watching the first one to see stuff I may have missed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a longtime horror aficionado, and huge fan of the first film, I was looking forward to seeing this. I just did. I wish I hadn't. This is not a patch on the original. Its not even a true sequel, as the credits state it is "inspired by the motion picture, Paranormal Activity"!It's slow, terribly-clichéd and -- as a long-time horror fan of all kinds of horror films, especially the psychological ones -- not very scary. The film takes forever to get into, has very few scares, is highly unrealistic (thus ruining the whole "found footage" feel) and nosedives into tired Hollywood scare tactics towards the end, with screeching sound design and people diving at the camera.Very, very disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing Paranormal Activity 2 and though I don't think it can hold a candle to the first movie, it's certainly worth seeing.On the plus side, it ties in very well with the first movie, clarifying why the things Katie &amp; Micah suffered through happened. It is well directed and the acting is believable.On the minus side, it replays many of the same tricks from the first movie, but since you've seen them all before they don't have the same impact. Also, the claustrophobic feel of the first movie is nowhere in evidence.The movie takes a little while to get going but once it kicks into high gear it is quite entertaining, in spite of the 'I've seen this before' factor.What I found odd was the surprising number of clips that had been released as 'viral' videos that were not in the movie. Where'd they go?If you're a fan of the first movie, then you'll want to see this one too. If you thought the first movie was a boring waste of time because "nothing happened", well, more 'stuff' happens in this movie, but you'll still probably not like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was the absolute pits. While people around me were screaming and jumping, I was sitting there falling asleep, waiting for the few and far between scares. The acting is twice as bad. Katie is twice as fat. The scares aren't scary (there are two jumps. Two. That's all.)The story is lacking any real thought or believable plot at all. It was also twice as funny. Honestly there was more to laugh at then there were things to jump at! There were so many times during this film that I wanted to just strangle the actors. The mom is an annoying and horrible actress who is really ugly, yet always makes little remarks about how cute or hot she is. The dad is hardheaded to a fault, and the daughter is as cliché as they come. They have cameras set up all over the house, yet they only check the footage a handful of times! WTF?! Even Katie's character wasn't as good or believable as in part one. You could tell it was more a case of "been there, done that" for her, as she just doesn't convey any of the same emotions or feeling or reality that she brought to the first film. Part one had some truly creepy moments, where you're at the edge of your seat suffering from some truly unexpected scares. this movie doesn't even come close. This is a case of a movie better left alone.</fullReview>

A baby's mobile that moves by itself is not scary, a dog getting all worked up and barking at nothing is not scary, and finally people being dragged by unseen forces already got us in the first one. This movie was a waste of ten dollars and my time. Save your money for something original. Having to spend an hour and a half trying to 'spot the scare' sucked. The story for the sequel pokes holes in the original ( a film that clearly needed no sequel) I have been more scared watching 'Dancing with the stars'. My guess, after the big opening weekend this had there will be a third installment. Go see 'Jackass 3D' instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranormal Activity 2 , Close but not quite enough.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw the movie today. Only a handful of people in the theatre but it was a 2:30 show.Here goes......... I had some mixed feelings about PA2. I would sum it up as not quite good enough.It's a decent flick but can't measure up to the original with the scares or the ending. Actually for me, the ending felt somewhat rushed and just wasn't that scary. Disturbing, yes. Scary? No. And the pace was a tad slow at times.The film does in my opinion, an excellent job actually, at establishing the introduction of the characters and very nicely ties in the events of this film with PA though there are some unanswered questions.Why if Katie's sister is having problems with things going all "paranormal" doesn't Katie then mention this while talking about it to Micah when filming during their paranormal events. And how did that burnt pic get into their attic? But I digress.I had mixed reactions to the explaining as it were, of the demon's intent and motives outlined by the one of the character that actually uses their brain in this movie and does some investigative work.I thought it an interesting twist that nicely tied the events of both movies through the obviously frustrated demon and ultimately using Katie to get the job done though it had some help from one character that ultimately involves betrayal. People should be talking about this.One major nitpick? The slow buildup up in tension never comes close to delivering anything to what PA did and I really let down with the general lack of overall good scare moments and just how few and far between the great ones there were.I was hugely disappointed with this. My biggest nitpick of the movie.The best ones take place in the kitchen and with the daughter on the couch. That entire sequence in the basement where the mother takes the baby, was annoying and fell flat. Not going to lie to you, that second kitchen scare got me though. One of the few truly, good scare moments.Also, the the scene with the daughter sleeping on the couch is another. Why, oh why, couldn't they have had more scenes like this? What she experienced was genuinely creepy. I just wished they had more of these types of scares throughout the movie. It would have been brilliant. And what was the deal with the demon and the basement? Unlike others, I found the acting was just fine in my books. I saw nothing that indicated lousy, unconvincing acting for the most part. Just a couple of parts that felt forced.But for all the hype, I still walked away thinking that despite a great job of tying in the events and the overlap between both movies, that it felt like they struggled to come up with something fresh to scare us with this time.And how can they possibly do a third PA with what happened at the end and the fate of several of the characters? Who gets haunted next? The movie is going to be successful and I did enjoy most of it despite my nitpicks but still...... They dropped the ball somewhat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Paranormal Activity 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One profitable turn deserves another. I believe almost everyone will have balked at the return of investment for the first Paranormal Activity (PA) film, which continues to build upon the recent trend of films seen from the first person perspective by way of a video camera. So confident about the prospects of this film being able to spawn an ongoing franchise (hey, Saw managed 7) that Paranormal Activity 2 was announced shortly after the first film was released into cinemas.So let's cut to the chase and get to the point - is this film any good? I continue to state that films like this one are an acquired taste. If you do not appreciate films from the first perspective, or are constantly annoyed at plot loopholes that stem from the use of a camera, then this film is not for you, as with any other film of any genre employing the same storytelling technique. Otherwise this is a film that requires you to have watched the first in order to maximize your enjoyment because it makes references to, and ties in intricately with the first, without which you'll be questioning who's who, and the significance of things that can be innocuous if seen by itself.Writer-director Oren Peli who created the original film takes a backseat here as producer, handing over the directing reins to Tod Williams and writing responsibility to Michael R. Perry. While the first film focused on only one camera with most things happening when the audience is fixated as bedroom voyeurs, here we have more cameras thanks to the introduction of a baby and a series of house break-ins, which give reason for more vantage points to be set up by way of strategically located CCTV and nanny cams, and thus a larger stage set up with various situations to spook, but not quite. Filmmakers can attest to difficulties when it comes to handling either animals or children in films, but Williams prove that both can share the same frame together, and I suspect a lot must have gone into coaxing what the end result was, perhaps with a little help from the CG department.Michael R. Perry's story though sums up this prequel-sequel (sprequel?) nicely, building upon and expanding the world of PA. The first film posed a number of questions, some of which get addressed here, but in turn builds upon what's known thus far to create more unknowns through the narrative, which is more "talky" since there are a handful of scenes involving a HD camera bought by the family to document baby Hunter's growth, now used to document the strange apparitions that happen more frequently as the story wore on. Some scenes involve switching the camera on during a conversation (yeah, perhaps the social-media aware teenager of today will require everything to be made available and put online), and the constant refusal of the father figure to look at evidence will stretch believability just a tad bitThe spook factor gets considerably dumbed down from the first film, though making the same impact as the filmmakers went all out to shock you out of complacency as you think by darting your eyes around the screen trying to pick up clues or signs would mean you can keep a step ahead. Some tactics like the moving door get repeated, but only so because as I mentioned, there's an intricate link between the two films. Here we follow the Dey family of four - Dad Daniel, Mum Kristi who is the sister of the first film's Katie, and kids Ali the teenager and Hunter the toddler, where Perry's story provides the backstory, some opening doors for another prequel, while providing closure from PA.Will there be another Paranormal Activity film? I don't see why not, since the seeds already got sown with more fruits to be harvested by future filmmakers who may want to come on board and stem their mark in providing a fresh perspective to the now mature storytelling technique. If the basis of the film continues to be that of putting oneself into the shoes of an investigator (as how I will approach this) sieving through tons of archived material just to piece together and reverse engineer the source of all that have happened, PA will grow its own fanbase (if not already) and probably develop into a franchise to be reckoned with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 2 repeats the same formula that made the original so successful. This sequel offers the same scares, the same creepy atmosphere, and uses the same tactics to get under the audience's skin. Unfortunately, it's almost an exact replica of the original movie and that's part of the problem. I guess they wanted to avoid the mistakes made by the producers of the Blair Witch sequel (which was just an awful, awful movie). Go with what works, right? Makes sense to me, except there's no suspense this time because I knew exactly what would happen and when. The cameo by Katie Featherston was nice (and we do see Micah Sloat briefly too), but the main characters in this aren't nearly as interesting. Combine that with the lack of real suspense on who lives or dies (since this is a prequel to the original movie) and it made for a much less satisfying movie-going experience.</fullReview>

The break-in right at the beginning foreshadows that something bad is going to happen, we just don't when it's going to happen. 2. The scene in which Alie, Kristi, and the nanny are all sitting down, looking at Hunter's newborn pictures, when Kristi stumbles upon a picture of a younger Katie, do we realize that something fishy is going on. Especially since Kristi says they lost all their pictures in the fire. ...Okay, that's just a tad creepy. 3. This next scene really gets to me. When Alie and Hunter are playing, and Hunter rushes out of the room, bawling, Alie conveniently lays the camera down facing the baby monitor. Over the next few seconds, we hear and see things supposedly going on in Hunter's room. But, how can that be when no one is in there? 4. Okay, first things firsts - DO NOT MESS WITH OUIJA BOARDS. They are NOT a toy! I know from personal experiences that these things are dangerous! Anyways, back to the movie... Theses kids obviously think it's a game and nothing can hurt them. But, boy are they wrong. Especially, the scene right after where Alie is attacked by the entity while sleeping on the couch. 5. The moment when Hunter's night light flashes, there's something in our gut that tells us s***'s going down. And while Kristi is being pulled down into the basement, we're all crouching and thinking, "Oh s***!" Overall, the acting was pretty mediocre right until about the climax of the movie. Then, the actors start acting genuinely scared of the demonic presence in the house. The directing could've also been better. I can't name anyone off the top of my head, but maybe someone more experienced in directing horror movies would be better suited for this. My overall reaction to this movie, was that it had some great ideas, but they were badly executed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Mexican maid fails to deliver - so Hunter becomes the hunted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as I thought the message of the movie might be "every home should have a Mexican housekeeper/witchdoctor waving incense around", the proud parents of the annoying infant get slaughtered and the baby kidnapped. So much for middle-aged Mexicans maids and their anti-voodoo crap. The first PA movie was abysmal, so I consider PA 2 a vast improvement, in spite of its flaws. Most likely it has to do with the change of directors, dunno. PA 2 has far less tedium, most of it being in the early segments ? which frankly made me want to vomit. Those typical suburban-Americana film-intros, complete with stupid jokes, gay laughter, annoying "cute" kids, people saying "I love you" every 5 seconds, and all those other pathetic gimmicks intended to give the movie a realistic feel of family bliss ? all those combined to almost make me want to press the "stop" button and abandon the movie altogether. After all, the memories of utter boredom while sitting through PA still haunt me ? far more than the haunting of any Mexican-maid-resistant apparition might. Most of that movie was Katie and Micah (what a damn dumb name) babbling piffle, while the ghost patiently waited to finally make a worthwhile appearance ? in the last scene. And by the time Micah got killed, it was more a moment of elation (coz he finally snuffed it) than any kind of feeling of horror. After all, the anti-Micahists among us viewers were cheering the ghost on, and felt very let down that it killed him without torturing him a little first.Which is why I was annoyed, offended, disappointed and disgusted that the sadistic writers of the PA series somehow managed to write in the dead/not-yet-dead Micah into this sequel. Why kill him off if you're going to give us more of him later on? Why lie to us so blatantly? Why this cruelty? Fortunately, his appearances here are very brief, and the legendarily daft-sounding name "Micah" gets mentioned only a handful of times.One reviewer, who hates PA 2 but considers PA a masterpiece, wrote that PA 2 "was obviously made in a rush to capitalize on the success of the original". PA was released in 2007, PA 2 in 2010. That's three years. How's three years a "rush to capitalize"? Duh. In fact, IMDb's overall rating for PA 2 is lower than that of PA, which only confirms what I've always said about the majority of film audiences: 1) they love crap, and 2) they simply love to be bored. Don't give them anything interesting because it might anger them. PA 2 has broken this cardinal rule ? by being better and more interesting ? hence the lower viewer ratings.Most of the "spooky" scenes are not scary, but at least interesting. The only truly effective scene of this sort was when all the kitchen cupboards opened at the same time, and Kirstie's very realistic reaction to that. The ending was OK, half-foreseeable half-unexpected, though hardly gripping. Predictably, the film-makers chickened out of having the baby killed ? which makes no sense whatsoever considering that this baby-snatching demon had as its prime directive to take its life, and not to friggin' adopt it (or whatever he did with the darn whining toddler after Katie/demon carries it off; I have seen neither the 3rd or 4th parts yet).As all hand-held clones of the moronic "Blair Witch" movie, PA 2 also has the problem that many of its wobbly scenes make no sense. It's simply retarded for anyone frightened to the bone to keep pointing the camera at things instead of simply chucking it aside and running for their lives. This highly inferior live-cam horror sub-genre needs to end soon, because it hasn't produced one quality product yet. What saves PA 2 somewhat is that many of its scenes are from the house surveillance cameras, which of course makes sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some minutes ago, I watched the movie "paranormal activity 2" on German free TV - I laughed all the time about this sh*t of terrible story-telling and felt no time scared or anything else like that. For summing up and making the point: I am SO happy to spend no money on that crap, otherwise I would like to have it back - so I wish someone could spend my time back :( Really 1/10 points for this waste of time.PS: please forgive my bad English, I am a foreigner...PPS: you have to write at least 10 lines at a review, but this movie doesn't deserve more than one line ;) so I have to fulfill the required number of 10 lines by repeating how much waste of time this movie is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>snoozefest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 2 was a total snoozefest. In fact, this is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.NOTHING happens for the first 45 minutes... then a few seconds of not-scary-door-moving type stuff over the next 10 minutes... and then there are a couple of quick makes-you-jump moments in the last 20 minutes, but no real creepiness, no heart-pounding scares, and nothing original and/or interesting in the story. *yawn* Every single character (except the dog) is unlikeable, and I actually found myself hoping that they would all just "hurry up and die already!" I also could have done without the screaming baby. Yeah, there is nothing scary, nor entertaining about listening to a baby scream on security camera footage, over and over again; it's just obnoxious.Watching this family through their security cameras and hand-held video footage just came across as overly voyeuristic, rather than "artsy" or "stylistic". There were several conversations that seemed totally inappropriate to film with a hand-held cam, as well as a few moments where the daughter films herself surfing on the internet (seriously? who does that? nobody!) that made the footage feel unrealistic and completely staged.I liked the 1st Paranormal Activity, which I found to be creepy (even when it was being predictable) but this prequel was a complete let down.2 out of 10 stars from me: 1 star for low-budget ingenuity on the (not-so) special effects and 1 star for the one and only sudden, jumpy quick-scare in the kitchen scene.I would only recommend this movie as a sleep aid for those who suffer from severe insomnia. Zzzzz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, I only watched the entire movie in the hope that, at the end of the tedious one and a half hours something would actually happen. When something did happen, I was sorry that it had.I'll be frank, I can't understand the hype about the Paranormal Activity series. It has a fairly unique style, yes, and that made the first one stand out a little more than other average horrors. However, films like this need to have a few key elements to make them work well: scares, interesting plot twists and creepy moments that haunt you in your sleep. Now I'm definitely not the bravest of people, I jump quite a lot and with an active imagination things that scare me stick in my mind for a good long time. With 'Paranormal Activity 2' however, I found myself going to sleep rathan than losing sleep.I can't think of a great deal of positives to the film. Initially, it did interest me, I felt like the movie was building up to something big, something scary, and this creation of suspense was done particularly well by the film's creators. It is something that I should credit them for, as they do it very successfully, but this creation of suspense is then made irrelevant when they fail to deliver a satisfactory climax. At the very least I expect to jump or flinch and feel my heart pounding, but in this case my greatest reactions probably consisted of a blink or two.If you scare easily and you know it, then by all means, watch this film, it might prove a bit more thrilling. But for those thrill-seekers that want genuine scares, don't waste your time with 'Paranormal Activity 2'.</fullReview>

Despite the house having a full set of installed cameras.The reused footage just shows shots of all the rooms with nothing happening at all.Do not bother watching it, it's a boring go nowhere movie.The actors are bad, the plot thin.The main male character dismisses all evidence of "demons" with a laugh despite seeing it on video, live.He's a complete idiot and the women must be ready tok ill him for his ignorance and ill founded confidence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranormal Activity 2 (3.5 Stars)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an age where horror films are defined by teenagers whose I.Q. ranges between "Dumbass" and "Hopeless", Oren Peli's "Paranormal Activity" brought needed hope not only to exhausted horror movies, but also to the slashers that occupy them. Man. Freddy, Jason, and Myers must be tired from hacking college students all the time.If you liked the original, chances are you'll also like "Paranormal Activity 2". They are similar in structure: the slow beginning, the creepy middle, and the chilling end. Both movies take place within a home, and both homes are inhabited by a demon. This is scary. A home is said to be a place of rest and refuge. Once you explore the possibility that an evil demon might be trying out all the furniture as it plots to murder your family, you're in trouble. Anyone who doesn't get scared by that situation is either really really brave or a Satanist.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/paranormal-activity-2-movie- review/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lesser follow-up, more of the same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This lesser follow-up to the surprise low budget hit tells virtually the same story, tenuously linked to the original (this time around, the ghostly goings-on are happening to the family of the girl in the original). The film is adequate but does feel lacklustre in places; it should have really upped the game ? considering viewers will be aware from the start-off of what it's all about after the first time ? but instead it feels like more of a half-hearted retread.Still, these films are all about subtlety and that's something I'm all for ? especially when you think about older Hollywood attempts at ghost stories (like the execrable HAUNTING remake with Catherine Zeta-Jones). PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 2 works up some creepy situations, usually involving minor objects moving around the home while the CCTV cameras look on. Both a dog and baby are added to the mix to liven things up again, with varied results (I like the inclusion of the dog, but it's too obviously playing with its trainer at one stage, and a bit involving the baby in his cot made me burst into laughter ? not the intention of the filmmakers, I'm sure).After the incessant slow-build, I did find the climax to be a bit disappointing ? I know they didn't have a lot to work with, but the same can be said of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and that had a genuinely terrifying ending, in my mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better then the first, now stop it with the sequels already!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. Would you actually believe that this movie is better then the first Paranormal Activity? Even though I had lots of doubt about a sequel to a movie that had very poor acting and little to no plot at all, it actually pulls off the 'Blair Witchian' haunted house movie a lot better then the first. That doesn't mean this movie is great by any means. The 8 out of 10 rating should therefore be classified to this type of movie only. You know the type of movies I mean; some people videotape everything they see with a crappy camcorder, something strange happens, people start to disappear, etcetera.When it comes to these kinds of movies, Paranormal Activity 2 at least gives us a less boring experience then the first one. The awful acting from the first one is gone too thankfully, as the performances are a lot more convincing this time around which to me is the most notable difference. The creators tried to slightly tie in the events from the first movie, and the main actors from the first movie make a appearance here, although this is only a small reference for the people who have seen part one. Apart from that, this movie is completely stand alone and you don't need to have watched the first one to enjoy this flick.There's not a whole lot to comment on the scaryness-factor here. I never thought the first movie was particularly scary, so perhaps less experienced horror movie watchers will get some scares out of this. But for a horror-fan like me this didn't have that much scary scenes to offer, and you can take that for what its worth. The movie does have a couple of moody scenes though, and a few jumpscares, but thats about it.But apart from those things, I do think that the movie is a lot stronger because of the less annoying characters, and the more realistic acting. I feel like that in a lot of ways, this movie is what the first one should have been. That being said though, this series should get a close. I know there's a third one out already, but please stop it with these sequels. The things that went right here only slightly outweigh the sometimes boring scenes and stupid jumpscares, so crapping out more sequels would just ruin everything good that this movie presented.Paranormal Activity 2 is a good movie to watch once with some friends, but after that you probably won't see it again any time soon. If you're a big fan of the whole camcorder-movie thing, then you can buy this movie blindly, but don't expect any big surprises here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, here's the good: 1.) The idea is good. 2.) The acting is good. 3.) The suspense was surprising. 4.) More characters and factors. 5.) Good screen writing and screenplay.Here's the bad: 1.) Same state 2.) Same time of year (fall) 3.) The same method of directing. 4.) Re-used characters (Katie And Micah BOTH PRESENT) 5.) Very slow at beginning. Takes a while to move long. 6.) Same plot.Now honestly I cannot understand what drove them to make this movie (or the supposed 3rd one). I mean, the addition of more people definitely relieved expectancy and prediction. But it goes nowhere for the first 6 nights. I did, however, like the dog being there. Kind of like an extra warning system unheeded by the family. The crazy Spanish woman caretaker who knows of the spirit and tries to rid it from the house. She does get "released of service" quite early in the movie. This movie is a bit hard to follow at points without the first movie under your belt, but it is do-able. I enjoyed it to a minimal degree. But if you have seen the first one and did not care for it, DO NOT watch this. If you fit another bill, go ahead and decide. Oh yes one more thing. The actors really act like a family. They do it well. So take this review and do what you will. I did what I can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For once, a sequel is better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I wasn't impressed by the first Paranormal Activity. It moved slowly, didn't have a very strong plot, and the so-called climax barely made me jump. I genuinely didn't understand it's popularity. After expressing this concern, many friends of mine told me that the second installment was much better, I just needed to give it a chance. I happened upon the opportunity to see PA2, and it turns out, they were right.A lot of things went into this sequel being more effectively frightening. PA2's plot line is significantly stronger and, I found, more convincing. Also, the creators were smart to put in a whole family this time, because you automatically have more empathy for a baby. The film is much darker and braver overall--from the increase in loud sound effects to the night-vision scenes--and it gave a much more fear-inducing atmosphere.I can gripe all day about how the first film wasn't as good, but in reality, the two movies really do need to go together. I won't tell you why (don't want to spoil it for you), but trust me when I say that they definitely complement each other. That may have been another reason why I enjoyed the second one so much--because it helped me enjoy the first one more.So whatever your thoughts are going into this, if you were even intrigued by the first one, give the second one a try. Its not the best film ever, and when it comes to horror, there are films far better, but I still found it to be quite jarring and entertaining all at once--even when I didn't expect it to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie solely for the story behind it. Them telling why things happened in the first film.I did not find this movie to be scary. The only times I cringed is when it had something to do with the baby. There was just no surprise since you already know what to expect from the first film. I liked how the film got into why this "entity" was tormenting them and why it was so hostile. They could've told just a little more behind the whole story but you get a good idea already from what is shared. Good movie, if you enjoyed the first one you should enjoy the second one as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranormal Activity 2: A Miracle Sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it was released in 2009, "Paranormal Activity" had been a box office success from the start, thanks to its ingenious marketing campaign that insisted that audiences "demand" to see it. The first film is not necessarily scary, but ultimately one of the creepiest movies I had seen in a long time. I own it on DVD, and after watching it just twice(once in the theater, the other time at home), I'm afraid to watch it again. The film certainly leaves a lasting impression on you. Even the die-hard boobs-and-gore fans took an interest.So, did I see a sequel happening? Well, at first, yes and no. If it were to only encourage more money-making, then sure. But as another effective fright-fest, I just didn't see a "Paranormal Activity 2" happening. Of course, we learned how something so original and terrifying can go wrong in a sequel(I'm talking about "Blair Witch 2"). However, Tod Williams, three screenwriters, and a natural cast have proved us wrong. "Paranormal Activity 2" is just as good as the original, with more scares, more tension, and characters we care about.Instead of following the standard sequel formulas of "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th," although those are fun and enjoyable sequels, "Paranormal Activity 2" is a prequel, expanding on the events that occurred 62 days before the events in the first film. The main focus now is Katie's sister, Kristy, who is happily married with a beautiful stepdaughter, Ali, and a newborn baby named Hunter, and she is living in a beautiful house. But after a series of mind-numbing break-ins, curiosity ultimately kills the cat. Kristy's husband, Dan, sets up several different cameras around the house so they can see what goes on at night and so they can ensure safety in the home. What is recorded on those cameras is absolutely bone-chilling."Paranormal Activity 2," like the first one, doesn't begin with a bang or a great big "BOO!" It takes its time to introduce us to the characters, so we can like them and worry about them when something freaky goes down. No character is obnoxious and overly encouraging the supernatural phenomena to happen(ahem, Micah in the first film), and that's how we want them to be.For anyone who's seen the first film, we know that all of the paranormal activity that goes on has been happening to Katie and Kristy since their childhood. This is nothing new, which makes their fear on the screen all the more palpable. Why are these entities terrorizing this family? The question is broached about briefly, but not looked into too intensely, allowing for this second film to keep its layer of mystery.There is certainly more tension in "Paranormal Activity 2" than in the first. Instead of limiting our eyes to one room, the second film expands its cameras all over the house. Sometimes we see almost nothing, which brings our anxiety to the highest point. We are so on edge, crouched in our seats, just waiting for something to show up on a camera. The suspense is unbearable, and when something does happen, it leaves us all the more frightened.In the tradition of "The Blair Witch Project," "Paranormal Activity 1 and 2" may have scripts, but all of the performances and the phenomena don't come off forced. They have a natural feel to them, as though everything that is occurring in the house is real.The cast is talented and sympathetic. Katie Featherston returns for another go-round, and once again gives a marvelous performance. The performances of the rest of the cast, including Sprague Grayden as Kristy and Molly Ephraim as Ali, are all-around fantastic.Now, not everyone loved the first "Paranormal Activity," so it's definite that you shouldn't watch it if you're not a fan. Then again, I could be wrong. Those who didn't like the first left the second one feeling truly scared. Overall, "Paranormal Activity 2" will leave fans of part 1 hungry for more. It's scary, entertaining, and you're guaranteed to have more sleepless nights. "Paranormal Activity 3" is up next, and I will always enjoy this series more than I ever liked the "Saw" films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Daniel and his family move to Carlsbad, California. A few days later their residence is broken into, however, nothing appears to be missing.In order to prevent re-occurrences, they install a number of security cameras that will record everything on a DVR.After they hire a Spanish-speaking nanny to look after Hunter, she informs them that there is something wrong in their house and performs prayers, much to the chagrin of Daniel, who lets her go.He will subsequently regret this decision as more inexplicable and strange incidents occur, with Ali concluding, after a research, that their house may be possessed by a demonic entity...It's not as good as the original, as that film came out of nowhere and shook the audiences by storm. Is it as scary as the original? It will be when you are alone at home and you start thinking of certain points in the film.It's a clever idea for the film makers to have the story set at the same time as the original and the performances are above average, and the inclusion of a child gives the film more urgency.Niggles are the amount of times they show the pool cleaner, this appears to be filler for the movie to make it longer, and after the second time you see the pool at night, you become sick of it.Once the mother gets dragged into the basement, the film becomes as shocking as the first one, and there are certain scenes that will make you jump.The ending is more melancholy than the first, and one can only hope that the makers have done something special for the third instalment, as one feels that this is one horror franchise that should stop pretty soon, in order to keep it as scary as it already is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a fair bit of sequel snobbery being talked about PA 2."The original was made for ?20 - this was ?2 million and what's the difference?" That sort of stuff. When really the answer is quite simple. The original was what it was; a super-creepy, lo-fi masterpiece that was low on special effects and relatively high on fear, but not that much in the way of real jumps.PA 2 whilst it cost more (but hey, ?2m? hardly a fortune in cinema terms) also has very few special effects but has a lot more in the way of jumps. But much more significantly than this PA2 is unbelievably clever in the way that it takes the storyline of PA 1 and weaves around it a story that elucidates both parts 1 AND 2.The jumps are largely stock in trade but they are played out beautifully and the movie is paced brilliantly. Once again Katie Featherstone and Micah Sloat convince with their unHolywood looks and performances and the introduction of Katie's sister's family is mostly convincing.This is turning into a really great franchise. If PA3 (in theatres in October 2011) keeps it up (a big ask) it could even challenge the Godfather for consistency because Godfather 3 was naff.Now before any of you think I am mad I am not saying PA1 and 2 compare to Godfather 1 and 2.But let's be honest few horror franchises to date have delivered their first two outings as consistently as this.Fingers crossed for part 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have watched the first installment before watching this one its good as this one is clearly a prequel to the prior one. Its about Katie's sister and her family. The plot is similar to earlier only and nothing much has changed. But I was quite surprised this time and I actually felt that this one is better than the first. Things start happening quite early and so it keeps you on edge since starting. Some scenes are good enough to make you jump. Its quite possible that may be I had least expectations this time but also this one has been implanted with more sudden scenes than prior one. The story is linked nicely and I liked the climax as well. But still they need to improve a lot. This one is not that boring and can easily be watched. I would consider this one as good.</fullReview>

I thought that this was a good film, but I still don't think that it was worthy of the 'horror' title people have given it. I think you do need to watch the first film to understand some of the things like when she finds the picture and also like the first one I think it has to be watched in the right conditions to have it's full impact. Unlike the first film, the characters have some personality and aren't just stupid.

		<fullReview>It had a creepy intense feel to it.... sad in places too. It would be hard for those people who don't have children to understand what I mean by sad. Even harder for anyone to grasp the concept of anything spiritual or "paranormal" if they have not been a witness to it themselves. Paranormal Activity (the first one) reminded me of a slow burning Blair Witch Project. This had a more action &amp; energy to it. The camera angles were much better than the first. I didn't expect it to have the ending that it did. The incidental sounds were spooky and it helped add some thickness/substance to what could be called a bland security clip caught on video.I've read a few negative comments on this movie from viewers that obviously can't comprehend what paranormal means. This is not your typical Hollywood 'boogieman in the wardrobe' blockbuster that horror fans wish for nor is it your run of the mill blood, gore and screaming dumb blond running away from a hideous monster type of movie. I found it intriguing, slightly disturbing but overall, creepy and intense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoilers included*I found it very hard to make up my mind about Paranormal Activity 2. At it's very best it's absolutely brilliant, and at it's very worst it's like being made to watch home video's of your best friends children over and over again.The plot is pretty much what I expected it to be. The night time scenes, even at the start of the film when not a great deal happened, are everything a horror film should be.Sadly for the good part of half the film these are followed by a series of long and boring scenes. The characters are developed well during these times but they are so dragged out and in reality they are nothing more than glossed over time-sinks. I almost felt there were parts where I could afford to grab another beer or go to the toilet and know I hadn't missed anything important.I think I felt more sorry for the dog than any of the cast, but the film managed to come across as being 'real' and otherwise quite convincing for this genre.The film tied in nicely with the first film and I'm curious as to how they are going to progress it in Paranormal Activity 3. They have to move away from the formula in used in the first two films if they want to keep people entertained; Paranormal Activity 2 could get away with being very similar to it's prequel but I'm not sure a third one could make it.I would definitely recommend Paranormal Activity 2. Nobody would pay money to watch a 40 minute film and it's downfall is exactly this, it's padded too much with nothingness to extend what would otherwise have been an all round brilliant film. Whatever the plan for Paranormal Activity 3, it's a real shame it couldn't have been a part of a Paranormal Activity 2 without the unnecessary scenes.A worthy watch nonetheless. I would have to give the 'horror' parts an easy 9 but the rest drags my score down to a 6, but the good does outweigh the bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As soon as I saw the poster at my local cinema, I instantly thought 'I really want to see this'. And I never thought that they would do a 2nd one. And I liked the first film as well. The plot takes place 62 days before Micah Sloat died. A new family is the focus, and the mother, Kristy, is Katie's sister. They seem to be happy, as they have a daughter Ali and a adorable baby boy Hunter who comes home from the hospital at the start. The family has been experiencing a series of what could be so called break-ins. Then, after noticing the break ins, the family resorts to hiring a surveillance team to install a series of cameras around the house, in case any suspicious activity happens. Then what happens during the night is not want they were going to expect. At first, I didn't get the beginning because I thought it was going to be in the same house like from the first one. But I was wrong. Then what shocked me was when Katie came through the door. Everyone in the theatre including were full of shock and they will proper confused and they thought that Katie came back to her normal self. Then when Micah came into the scene and said that the film took place '62 days before Micah died' I then understood the plot. Some of the scenes were really intense as when the room goes quiet, you feel then that something is going to happen. My heart started to beat fast which is a bit weird for me. The scene that really did make me jump was the kitchen scene where all of the drawers open all by themselves. That proves that not everything happens in the dark. I was worried that this film was going to be a daft film as I didn't know how they would continue after the first film's climax. Some of the people in the theatre were laughing at some scenes such as the scene where Kirsty gets dragged my her foot down the stairs. Honestly, I thought that were scary.The problem is .. Will you like it? .. It depends.Overall, Paranormal Activity 2 is full of scares and fully intense. It certainly had me on the edge of my seat.Paranormal Activity 2 gets a 7/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity, which I rated a 6/10 on IMDb, was a pretty decent suspenseful movie - it wasn't scary whatsoever but it did hold my attention and thrill me with the unknown since there was no way of knowing how the film would end, what the climax of the haunting would be - So.. Paranormal Activity 2? Same ole stuff only not as good because it's already been done before, hence my 5/10 rating.I could have done without the religious undertones what with the housekeeper chanting stuff while walking around with some incense &amp; then the ridiculous scene where a wooden cross apparently makes a possessed character recoil- b/c it has magical powers I guess. Ugh..it's just a piece of wood. Housekeeper came off like psychotic religious freak and the wood having powers b/c it was shaped like a cross was utter lunacy.Paranormal Activity 2 wasn't really scary but it was suspenseful and thrilling just like the first. However, unlike in the first movie where Mika vigilantly checks the footage recorded in the home on the look out for any weird behavior, this new family, despite setting up cameras throughout, seem content with barely checking anything and it drove me nuts. Something would happen to someone. There was doubt that said person was telling the truth. Cue to no one checking the camera footage to prove if said thing happened or not. The footage was checked at times but not nearly as much as it should have been. It was ridiculous - cameras are there, check them to see if things happened in your house either while you weren't home or if something weird happened. Ugh.I am assuming PA3 will be made but I don't know what it could possibly be about - the story about what exactly happened to Katie/Kristi when they were little as well as what happened to their Mother is what needs to be told but unfortunately the camera style of PA won't work since back then, people didn't really have video camera systems and if they did they were grainy &amp; black and white. Hand held cameras were huge and people certainly didn't record their everyday activities 24/7 so good luck PA people in coming up with something decent.Lastly - I cared more about the dog, Abby, then I did about anyone else in that house. Not really sure what that says about the film, or me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>definitely not as good as the first one.. but close however. they've gone for the story on this one and it has succeeded. i was scared only doing the second half of the movie but modern horror movies doesn't really scare anymore, they much more disgusts. so this movie was scary in the definition of the word and i had a hard time sleeping afterwords. so if you're a horror fan you should watch it, if you saw the first one you should watch it, but with a mind-setting of "allright lets see what you got" instead of "this is gonna be so great!" its a very decent movie, not a very good sequel. but i mean how would you make a ground breaking original and never before seen movie... twice. it can't be done but thumps up for trying, and the outcome is not to bad and not fantastic either. Pray that there wont be a third.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The second round ain't too bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** out of (****)Who would of thought an inevitable cash-in could be on par with 2007's iconic "Paranormal Activity"? Yeah, neither did I. There's no surprise here folks. If you liked the original, you'll like its other installment. If that wasn't the case with you, it won't be this time around. Sure, this film is completely unnecessary, and now the premise seems redundant, but for all the substandard sequels, this one is a knock-out. The acting is actually more convincing this time around, the film plays with more material, and the ending is rather clever, as opposed to other mockumentaries that recycle the same resolution time and time again.I'm not going to get in-depth with the plot because I'm pretty sure that even if you look at the title, you can take a guess at what this movie is about. Let's get into the good shall we? First of all, I like how this movie was very slow-burn. Nothing really intensifying occurred until the very end. I thought that direction was much stronger than most taken (ala "The Haunting in Connecticut"). Furthermore, while the original had some solid performances, the sequel's have stronger. There wasn't one person that didn't make you think, "hey, this could be me in real life". Moreover, I thought the sequel had more stuff to play with as opposed to the old-school scares. On top of that, I thought the very last shot was clever. Very suspenseful and short-ended, but well-done and didn't feel like a cop-out.Although, there's the bad. The one thing I think is ridiculous with these movies are the ratings. Aside from some occasional profanity, there is no reason these films should be R rated. Are they creepier than your average spook-fest? Arguably so, but I believe the teenage audience should have open eyes and ears directed to more intelligently crafted movies (both "Paranormal Activity" movies). Not only that but I thought the climax wasn't so much of a climax. It was rather anti-climactic, devoid of any chills, and made the film seem more staged. Had they altered the climax, but still kept the ending, I think I would've enjoyed the film more.Folks, here you have it whether you asked for it or not. The question: Is the second time around a run for your money? If you ask me, I sure think it is. It kept everything that was good of the original, and in some aspects, was better. Ultimately, I think both films watched back-to-back would make a decent double feature. Bring on "Paranormal Activity 3"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the first Paranormal Activity came out I had actual liked the flick. When I heard there was a sequel I was curious to see how they pull it off, especially since I thought a sequel was really unnecessary. I just watched the movie last night and I thought it was a okay sequel. The main thing wrong with this movie is that the first half was just a boring rehash of the first movie. However around the second half the movie starts to pick up and gets interesting and by the end of the movie it actually gets exciting. The acting is pretty decent and the security camera idea is a interesting idea. Another thing I do like about the movie is the ironic ending with the father. I did not like how they actual explained why the demon is haunting the family, I thought it was much better when the demon had no real reason for why it tormented people other then because it could and giving a real motive was not a good idea. All in all it is okay, the main thing wrong with this movie was that I found the first half to be really slow and just basically a knock off of the first one. I don't know how they are going to do a paranormal activity 3 when not only is the concept already stale, but there is really not really much left you could do with the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not as good as the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was OK. Not great, but OK. The first one did a better job at "creepy, don't know what's going on here", this one felt more like, "ok, you know something is coming, but you don't know exactly whe-BOO!" SPOILERS!!!!!! This is billed as a sequel, but is really more of a prequel/followup to the original. The events take place two months prior to PA1, with explanations to tie the two films together. The acting is decent, benefiting from there being more than two people in the house.Now for the nit picking.I was expecting a whole new family with a new haunting, but we're re-introduced to Katie from the first film, alive and not possessed. SURPRISE, PREQUEL! Having not seen the first movie in a while, I didn't recognize her at first, and then being slightly confused as to exactly when this all happened. Then they flat out tell you in a text card "60 days before Micah died." Oh... thanks Mr. Film maker! Courteous to the audience, yes. Could it have been done better? Yes.The house is "vandalized" early in the story, prompting the installation of security cameras throughout the property. The father, who had the idea for the cameras, thinks to check the footage only one time, when the pool scrubber keeps turning up out of the water, and only at the request of his family. When the rest of the events happen, its the teenage daughter that reviews the tapes.With all the cameras around, covering so much of the house, it's a wonder as to why the events are never shown more clearly, save for Kristi being dragged down the steps. Obviously, it's scarier for the audience to imagine what's happening, but it breaks the immersion when we know there are angles that would clearly show what the dog is fighting against, or what is casting the shadow on the sleeping girl, but whoever "found" the footage deemed it not important.The deal with the demon for the first born male was a nice attempt at some kind of explanation, but the information was delivered in a very straight forward, spoon feeding expository scene with, again, the teenage girl doing all the research online. (Which I suppose makes sense, with a skeptical father, and a step mother terrified to look any further.) On this note, the "explanation" could have better fit with a totally new family. Most of the fun of the original came from the fear of the unknown. That's why we were never actually shown the demon, aside from it's inhuman footprints. Our minds are free to fill in what scares us the most. We didn't know exactly why Katie was being followed, or by what.We also were left an intentionally vague ending in the first film, not knowing what happened to the possessed Katie after the footage stopped, or the intentions of the entity. In this films ending (SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!), we are clearly shown that the demon was only trying to get back to the baby, using Katie as a new vessel after being forcibly placed there by Kristi's husband. And, of course, Kristi remembers nothing after the transfer. AMNESIA STRIKES AGAIN.While on some level, closure is nice, it comes back to fearing the unknown. We're told (again) that Katie's whereabouts are unknown. The demon has the baby, the deal is complete. We should leave it at that, but they're already planning a third installment. I just hope they don't actually show the demon :/ But I'm expecting some kind of investigation into the events and/or a search for the baby (being documented on film, of course) going incredibly wrong and angering the entity yet again.One last nit pick... when the baby is dragged in the crib, it is possibly one of the most laughable scenes in the movie, since it is quite clearly a puppet. While most effects are obviously wires and puffs of air, this one could have been done better. They managed to drag an adult down the stairs by an invisible hand, they couldn't move a sleeping baby? Just cutting out the lifting against the bars and going right to the baby out of the crib would have sufficed.OK, one more. It seemed like the demon was trying to entice the baby to follow it, like it couldn't just take it. If it could lift it from the crib, couldn't it just carry it away? Why all the build up? Just take the kid on night one and be done with it :P All and all, allowing for what I saw as less-than-impressive execution, the films do flow together well, if you think of them as one continuous series of events. Don't expect something totally new. Don't expect to see something out do the first film. Expect to see a decent addition to the first, that could have been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The biggest obstacle with sequels specially in horror movies is that the element of surprise is not there anymore.Thats not the exception in Paranormal Activity 2.Still,the creative team did a very good job in making this one a joy to watch.Pretty much like its successor the movie stars slow but its starts building up to a very nail biting climax. Like part one it has some very darn scary moments too. The prequel(most of the movie)sequel(the last couple minutes)its what made it worth of being entertaining.It is very important for the viewer to be able to connect this movie with the first one to have watched the ending in witch Katie kills Micah and her ware bouts are unknown instead of the one that she gets kill.Get your blanket,turn off the lights and turn the volume way up.Its going to be a scary night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rent this if you want to see what a real horror film should feel like!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this prequel to the scary 2007 hit of the same name, a family is tortured by an invisible demon that ruins their lives &amp; attacks them at times, all the while being taped from various camera's in the house. After seeing &amp; loving PARANORMAL ACTIVITY &amp; after hearing a sequel was in the works I was sceptical, usually sequels aren't as good as the first &amp; what with Paramounts intentions to get this out for Halloween (which forced the former Halloween time champ SAW franchise to move it's seventh outing out of the time slot it had picked to avoid competition with this film) &amp; the supposed $3 million production tag, I was worried PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 2 would fall into the same trap BLAIR WITCH 2 fell into a decade earlier, when studio's made a better financed sequel with tons of effects &amp; scary music only to have it blow up in their faces, critically &amp; financially. I just couldn't figure out how a "prequel" could be done to the original &amp; maintain it's levels of scariness &amp; tensions. Thankfully I am happy to report that PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 2 is no BLAIR WITCH 2, in fact, unlike BLAIR WITCH 2, this baby manages to retain the same amount of suspense &amp; jump out of you're seat scares the original had &amp; in some ways manages to improve on the first film in many ways! Sticking to what worked in the first film was a wise move by the studio as the acting was pretty decent &amp; the camera angles were well handled in order to capture all of the terrifying incidents. My only complaint? The ending, it tried to be creepy but felt like it was ripped out of another Hollywood produced horror flick (Though it did manage to have somewhat of a creepy vibe to it) &amp; the girl lifted up in the air while trying to hold onto the railing was a bit to "Hollywood" for my liking, but on a whole, the film manages the often difficult feat most sequels fails to accomplish &amp; that is retain the same amount of scares, shocks, suspense &amp; tension of the original &amp; like I said improve on it in almost every way. In fact, I actually prefer this film over the first. However upon reading reviews for the film I was shocked to discover not many liked the film, a lot of them called it "boring" "the worst film they ever saw" "crappy" "stupid" "dull" etc. but I fail to see why, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 1 &amp; 2 is what a horror film really should be, full of suspense, tension &amp; terror &amp; not rely on buckets of blood, profanity laced dialogue, constant nudity or over the top violent kills &amp; loud music scores to scare it's audience. Leaving the theatre &amp; going home, films like HOSTEL, SAW or even HATCHET don't make you afraid of the dark or make you look over your shoulder or make you hear a noise in you're house that makes you wonder what it was, films like this do!, Honestly not since the early days of horror films has a film gotten under my skin like the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY movies &amp; I'm a huge horror fan. Now I realize everyone has a right to his or her own opinion when it comes to fright flicks, what is a hunk of gold in one person's eyes, is a hunk of dirt in another's, that's the way it goes in cinema, always has, always will, but I do pose a question to the haters, did you see this with all the lights on in your house &amp; a group of friends, amidst talking &amp; laughing, playing on your cell phone, on you're computer etc? because if the answer is yes to even some of those, it's no wonder you hated it! movies like Friday The 13th, Halloween &amp; A Nightmare On Elm Street are the films you watch if you want to have a real fun nig ht, cheering, laughing &amp; gasping with friends, but movies like PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 1 &amp; 2 must be seen by yourself, all the lights out, late at night with no computers or phones or video games distracting you, that's when you feel the scares, that's when you feel the tension &amp; that is how the filmmakers intend for you to see this! All in all, I highly recommend this film to any &amp; all true fans of the genre, however if your only idea of a four star scary horror film is HOSTEL or HATCHET, stay well away! Now all that out of the way I have a question, the film is claimed to have a $3 million production tag which makes me curious, the film like the first has no music, special effects, stunts, explosions, monster or chases or any name actors or any 35mm camera on hand, so I have to ask the question, where did the money go? Followed by PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 3**** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off i feel stupid for renting this from the red box on blue ray when the whole thing was shot in the style of hand-held/ hidden cam. Now thats out of the way. This movie got a 5. The reason for that is because it was a middle of the road movie. It was really slow in the start but toward the end got a lot better. It scared me a few times. But the only reason it did is because my Surround sound was on loud and there are parts where it gets REALLY LOUD! SO the loud noises scared me more than any thing.The acting was good. I read online that there was no script for the movie thats why it flowed so well. I think that this is one of those movies that would have been better at the theater. Watch it. I think you'll like it But don't get your hopes up that it is the movie of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 2 ? CATCH IT ( B- ) Who Knew Paranormal Activity will become a Legend like Friday the 13th, A Night on Elm Street, Halloween and Scream? But luckily for the makers it Did! The phenomena led me to watch the first installment which at the time I was little disappointed (Maybe I saw in pieces that's why) but later on after years of listening about it. I also started to believe that there was indeed something natural about Paranormal Activity, which we rarely see in other movies. Last night I saw Paranormal Activity 2 and this time I try to watch it Uninterrupted, so I can feel the terror the family is feeling in the movie &amp; luckily I felt the terror. The most horrifying scenes in the movie was involving the baby in it, those scenes really gave me chills. The New cast "Katie's Sister's family" Brian Boland (Dad), Sprague Grayden (Mom, Katie's sister), Molly Ephraim (Katie's Step-Niece) &amp; Seth Ginsberg (Molly's BF)"were good but Unrealistic at times. And not as real and engaging as Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat were in Paranormal Activity. This time Katie &amp; Micah gave cameo appearance in the movie and did came time to time but the thing I missed the most was Katie Featherston's Screams &amp; Micah's Charm. Overall, Considering the Paranormal Activity Handy-Cam Genre it's pretty darn good! Get your Screamers On ;-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Approach this sequel to last year's mega-hit as you would a haunted house at the fairground; expect to scream a lot, laugh at yourself for it then move on and forget it until next year. If you do, you'll have a blast.The story's the same; family set up security cameras after break-in, only to discover burglars are the least of their worries. There's a neat tie-in to the events of the first movie (this is a prequel) and the spooks have a bigger cast to mess with ? including a toddler and a dog (both used to excellent effect).There's lots to criticize, of course, from the soap-opera performance of the Father through to the laughably clichéd 'hired help' (Latin American and therefore does nothing but waft incense, clutch her rosary beads and mumble to herself in Spanish. As Latinas do).But as a crowd-baiting horror experience it rarely puts a foot wrong and, let's be honest, this is why we're here. The best elements of the first movie are played on exceptionally well, with endless silences and long static shots of nothing kicking the suspense up to often unbearable levels. Sometimes there's a 'big jump' payoff, sometimes there isn't but the fun, of course, is in the drawn-out anticipation. The 'security camera' angle adds a different, unnerving narrative feel and the ratio of actual 'paranormal activity' compared to the first movie is about 5:1 ? with two big scares alone validating your ticket-spend. Slick, quick and mindless and all the better for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prequel to the 2007 (2009 nationwide) smash horror hit, this time concerning Katie's (Featherston) sister Christie (Grayden) and her family. Many scares, perhaps more, to get your heart pumping and keep you on the edge of your seat; but its sadly obvious that this follow up has gone Hollywood. Where the cleverness of the original is absent here is within the story, not the scares; is it that appropriate that the story from the first has to tie in with this one, and it can't be its own story? If not, why? Something Paramount and the filmmakers probably won't be able to answer. But if you're out for some scares, you'll find plenty in this flick.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity was brilliant. Paranormal Activity Two was even better.Both of these films, while not really scary to those used to the horror genre, has a lovely subtlety and class about it that is not often found in scary movies in this day and age. While it is definitely slow to start off there are still little hints of supernatural activity to keep you interested and once the film hits at full swing you can't help but be captivated by what you see on screen. On top of this, it ties in nicely with the first film, leaving you with chills at the end, not due to the special affects which were absolutely fantastic, but because the plot is bone chillingly realistic. Anybody, after seeing this film, can certainly appreciate that there maybe forces that we can't see lingering and waiting for their opportunity to cease us and the Mockumnetary style of the film certainly does leave you wondering. 7 out of 10 for me. It was truly worth the watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A competent sequel, but not very memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last year, the film Paranormal Activity was compared to The Blair Witch Project not only because of its minimalistic production and pseudo-documentary technique, but also for the division it caused among the spectators.Some people acclaimed it as the new face of horror cinema, while other ones found it boring and uninteresting.Now, we have the obligatory sequel, and even though I found it to be competent, I did not find it to be highly memorable or terrifying, not to mention that it is very inferior to the original film, at least by my point of view.To start with, I appreciate the fact that co-screenwriters Christopher B. Landon, Tom Pabst and Michael R. Perry took their time to introduce us to the characters, establishing their personalities well so that we get interested in them.Besides of that, director Tod Williams creates good suspense and an appropriate atmosphere of anguish.However, when we finally reach to the emotional climax, I did not find it to be as intense or satisfactory as I expected, not to mention that it did not generate authentic horror.On the positive side, I liked the performances, since all the actors are natural on their roles.In conclusion, I have to admit that Paranormal Activity 2 is basically more from the same, with the difference that, as I mentioned on the first paragraph, it is far from reaching the level of its predecessor.The screenplay from this sequel is well written, but its structure is too similar to the one from the original film.Nevertheless, I think I can recommend Paranormal Activity 2, because despite not being a great horror film, I had a good time watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The horror film Paranormal Activity 2 is directed by Tod Williams and stars Brian Boland, Sprague Grayden, and Molly Ephraim. The film takes place in a house near San Diego, California.The horror sequel starts off with the Rey family coming home and finding that their house was broken into. After doing some investigation they discover that nothing had been taken except one of Kristi's (Grayden) necklaces that was given to her by her sister. Dan (Boland) makes the decision to insert surveillance cameras into their household for future protection. In the family there is also Dan's daughter from before the marriage, Ali (Ephraim), and an infant one year old son Hunter. As the film goes on the members of the family believe that their house is possibly haunted by a demon due to all the strange events happening to the house and themselves during the night...The screenplay for this horror box office record breaker was by Michael R. Perry, Christopher B. Landon, and Tom Pabst. The group of screenwriters made a successful sequel when by looking to the past we can see how sequels to films like The Blair Witch Project were absolutely terrible because they did not follow the same filming format as the original. Most of the scares were basically just long pause and loud sound to get a jump out of the audience but unlike the first one the fear does not come home with you. The characters in the screenplay were all very realistic except I thought it was strange how Dan Rey installed surveillance cameras in his house and was always so reluctant to look at them. Personally I did not like the ending because of how abruptly it came to a conclusion. It all makes sense in everything but I prefer more than two minutes for a film to wrap itself up.Tod Williams directed the film and he did a solid job following up the original because like the writers he kept it low budget and just in a normal house. All the little jump scares he pulled off very well by keeping up the suspense and picking the right camera angles for the shot to come from. Williams got solid performances from his actors since everyone was very realistic and no one really sounded like they were acting. Did he do as good of a job as Oren Peli did with the original? I'm going to have to answer no to that because the original was just so much more suspenseful and I thought about the original for days after leaving the theatre while this one I barely think about.I thought the editing by Gregory Plotkin was a bit strange. It was fine during all the suspenseful horror sequences and I liked what he did with the surveillance cameras going from the pool to the front of the house to the kitchen but I did not like what he did with the everyday conversations. He just cut in the middle of a conversation to a more important part in the conversation that seems to have taken place about three seconds later. It is partly Tod Williams' fault for not correcting this problem but the two of them should of decided to show a flowing conversation instead of awkwardly skipping through it to get to the main points.The acting for the film was pretty good since most of these actors have not been in many lead roles. Brian Boland probably gave the worst performance of the family members because all he did was basically yell at the other family members to not believe in demons. Now I can see where he is coming from but I think he should have laid his lines down in a more sentimental way instead of constantly yelling at his family. I'm sure many people would act like he did if a situation like this occurred and he in no way was bad he was just not as good as he could have possibly been. He also probably had the least screen time out of all the leads. Sprague Grayden played Kristi Rey, the mother of the family. She gave a fine performance because she was very good at screaming at the right parts and I don't see how a normal person would not react the same way in her situation. I'm sure she studied Katie Featherson's performance in the first one so she could act similarly since their roles are basically identical. Molly Ephraim gave the best performance in the film due to as all the other actors she was very believable. She was probably there during the most scary parts of the film and like Grayden I don't see how she could have acted any differently. Her facial expressions and just the tone of her voice were just spot on.Compared to the original this one is definitely worse. But what is good about this film compared to most sequels is that someone can watch this and would be able to understand everything that has happened. The scares are much weaker than the original as well as the comedic relief was much weaker than the original. Again I am glad that the director and writers stayed so loyal to the original though because this film could have been absolutely awful. Overall I give this film a 6/10. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys horror films, has seen the original, or likes low budget documentary like films. See the original though because it is one of the best horror films of the past decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the Friday of it's release my Girlfriend and I were discussing what movie to watch. She wanted to see "Easy A" but suggested to watch "Paranormal Activity 2"...I won that argument, and thank goodness i did. This is the most entertaining movie you will watch this fall, probably not the best in quality, but the best in entertainment. I think it is sad how bashed this movie is by critics, i think they lost sight on what the important thing about movies is; and that is pure entertainment. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what this movie promises and delivers.Those who are fans of the first one will truly enjoy this one, and those who are new to the series may still share in the scares of the movie but will be totally lost on the plot. Oh and by the way, this movie made me scream 3 times, jump twice and made me tear up like 5 times lol so if you like getting scared just for the sake of entertainment, then WATCH THIS!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Paranormal Activity 2" is inferior to its predecessor?few sequels aren't. I could rag on it for regurgitating the ideas and scenarios that made the original such a memorable theater experience, but what's more interesting to me is where it goes right. Very few people awaited this found footage follow-up with any degree of anticipation, and with a conspicuous absence of the advanced screenings that so stoked public interest in the first, "Paranormal Activity 2" was, to all appearances, shaping up to be an unmitigated disaster.Turns out it was plain bad marketing. "PA2" might actually be the most conceptually creative sequel since J.J. Abram's "Star Trek" reboot. Like that film, this is chronologically a prequel, with the ill-fated original stars, Katie and Micah (Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat), returning in a supporting role as relatives of the affected family. The hand-held camera premise has also been extrapolated on, and after the first paranormal incident (misconstrued as a break-in), the patriarch of the Rey family (Brian Boland) has a series of security cameras installed, by which we monitor his kitchen, living room, patio, bedroom, and nursery.It's a clever natural progression of the first film's conceit, though it never justifies itself as well. Rationality of characters' actions has always been a stumbling block for horror films, and one way the original "Paranormal Activity" distinguished itself was in creating a character who would believably continue filming the bizarre phenomena in his home. Most of the time, our videographer in the sequel is a stuck-up teenage girl (Molly Ephraim). Her interest in cataloging her family's day-to-day lives, along with the increasingly surreal occurrences is never explained. The motive for camera involvement in certain scenes is questionable at best, and her inseparability from her camcorder is completely artificial.That being said, the majority of the film is viewed from the vantage point of the mounted security cameras, which better serve the reality of the story. The sets are designed with the same attention to detail as the first?these are deep, cluttered spaces that keep you scanning the frame for signs of movement. Again, "Paranormal 1" does it better, and the use of multiple locations, though novel, does admittedly kill some of the visual tension.But despite being significantly less effective (re: scary), "Paranormal Activity 2" is neck and neck with the original in spooky fun factor. What I love about both films is their unapologetic simplicity. Modern horror filmmaking has become oversaturated with textbook mood, and artists presume their work scary because it's lit like a horror film, scored like a horror film, and directed like a horror film. Fear cannot be calculated and manufactured in that way ?"Paranormal Activity" and its follow up are refreshing because they are effective without 'trying' to be frightening. Naturally, they both are, but it's so much easier to suspend our disbelief when we aren't watching a Hollywood starlet meander down a flickering blue corridor with a string orchestra phoning in the emotional experience.That "Paranormal Activity 2" manages to avoid all that without taking itself overly seriously? in addition to building an interesting dialogue with the first film?is a miracle in itself. It definitely would have been nice had the film been more original, or upped the ante in the suspense department, but color me pleasantly surprised "Paranormal Activity 2" achieves even that much.Needless to say, this follow-up far exceeded my modest expectations, and though it is inferior to its predecessor in nearly every way, it's still smarter than your average shameless cash-in. It's a worthy sequel, and alongside countless other franchises' many unmitigated disasters, that's praise enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The last bit of this film made up for the first half.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 2 is the story of one family who decide to get some security cameras installed in their home after they suspected they were robbed. What the cameras find is something more paranormal.The first film was made for next to nothing in one guys house with some friends. It had good special effects that seemed more realistic because of the simplicity of everything. It was a huge success based on word of mouth. Ca-ching. Now we have a sequel. In sequels usually the filmmakers will go bigger and better. Paranormal Activity 2 still has the same low key feel to it but at the same time it does feel grander. I was bored to death with the first half of this film. The building of the tension was a bit slower for me than I would have liked. Paranormal Activity, if I remember correctly, did not take as long to get to where it wanted to go. The building of suspense here is too mundane. Luckily for this film, the second half woke me up and it was some pretty exciting stuff. Let me get this out of the way though, it does not have the same affect as the first one. The atmosphere that was in the air with the theatre from the original was gone with this one. We knew what to expect. We knew what the scares were going to be. "Okay, this is where the door closes. This is where she gets dragged on the floor. This is where we hear noises." With that being sad, this film did do a few things differently than the first. The original film relied on visuals to scare the audience. Shadows, hooves imprints, flaming Ouija board, blankets, possession, etc. The sequel however relies more on sound. The sudden loud moments are what make you jump, not the visuals. The jump scares are in this one where the uneasy tension of fear was in the first. The sequel also tries to up the ante by introducing a baby in danger. Babies are defenseless after all. Let's not forget animal endangerment as well. All aspects that overall did nothing for me, but it was a nice addition to change it up a little bit. The film also has some sort of story that goes with it. It gives a little bit of information on why these things are happening and I was surprised that they decided to go this route. I give them credit for making it connect to the first one more than I thought it would. It doesn't come off as a sequel with no purpose (even though it actually is). The story it dives into gives more background to the first events and connects the dots. I must say that the last 5 or so minutes were the best part of this film. Paranormal Activity 2 gets a thumbs up from me, even if it does lack the charm, fear and respect of the first one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scariest Movie Ever is a Paul Bunyan Exaggeration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 2 is a perfect example of a sequel that is not necessarily bad, but simultaneously not needed as well. It stuck to the same format as the original which is already more that can be said about the sequel to Blair Witch and it tied with the original Paranormal film as well which was definitely the film's highpoint. The rest not so much. There isn't much new or surprising. The jump scares are back and at full force in this film. Do they work? Sometimes. Are they needed? Nope.It angers me how much "jump scares" have become adapted as the primary scare in films today. Put the new Nightmare on Elm Street up to the podium. Every five minutes we get a "bang", "boom", "pow", "insert onomatopoeia here". It's hard to even think of a movie that used legitimate scares instead of some cliché synth/raise in pitch. Films in the 80's did use some essence of jump scares, but it would be one "boom" before a murder. Now it's around three or four before something happens. Though in PA2, jump scares serve as the main scare now. The loud noise is now the scare. Not just part of the suspense build up. That didn't bother me in the first one because the jumps in that film were well done and they were new and fresh, this one you see it coming twenty minutes before it occurs.We get a new set of characters this time around; Kristi (Katie's sister from the original film), her husband Dan, her daughter Ali, the newborn infant Hunter, and the family dog. Just by telling someone that sentence already gives a horror movie fan the obvious information to which one will be the primary target of paranormal beings. They put a baby and a dog in the horror film, two sensitive characters that usually know and sense more than the teenagers/adults. So we already know who will get the most attention.Kristi has had her first infant son named Hunter and they settle down in a house around the corner from Katie and her husband Micah (characters in original film). Things start getting creepy when some "paranomal activity", hint-hint, starts occurring in the house and the family begins experiencing odd events in the night, Hunter's lack of sleep, cabinets opening on cue, and many other things that provide one too many loud noises. It gets frustrating to have to keep hearing a clutter and a clank for something as easy as switching cameras.Another thing mindblowingly frustrating is that the film keeps going from day to night much like the first film. But we have to continuously see the same exact scenery. Half the time nothing is happening and it's like watching ongoing security cameras in a closed mall. What fun! We see the hallway, pool, kitchen, living room, entrance way, then Hunter's room in that order. We see the parents room and Ali's room briefly in the beginning of the film, but why we never see it throughout the movie like the other six places is beyond me. Maybe paranormal species do not like visiting parents' bedrooms and teenagers rooms. Maybe the ghost hates posters/various stickers of Jacob of Twilight that are possibly flooding the girl's room? Anything is possible.Upon it's release, Paranormal Activity received various positive reviews from critics/audience. Though for some reason I have not been able to find one person who found it above average. I really enjoyed the first film and it earned a four star review from me around a year ago. The Blair Witch Project is another film that's mixed opinion. Some love it, some hate it. Rarely are there any in between reviews of the film. I enjoy both movies and call them effective Horror films that do more justice than any CGI filled heap we are usually handed to today. Paranomal Activity 2 is fine to say the least, but it's a huge disappointment coming off of the first masterpiece. Horror can go a long way, but to do the same thing twice has rarely been sufficient.Starring: Katie Featherston, Micah Sloat, Brian Boland, Sprague Grayden, Molly Ephraim, and Tim Clemens. Directed by: Tod Williams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly terrifying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start by saying I've not seen the first film and after watching the second I have no intention of doing so - I left the cinema feeling absolutely terrified! (Yes, I was one of those!) The characters in the film are genuinely believable, especially the teenage daughter who deserves more credit for her acting than I'm sure she'll get. And the scares and jumps really do get your heart racing! The film does seem to take about half an hour or so to actually get going, but asking the audience to squint at the screen to see if anything is moving really does build tension with brilliant effect.One of my favourite scares is during a daytime scene (which tricks you into thinking your safe) and our heroine is sat in the kitchen alone. I won't spoil it for those who've yet to watch it, but those who have will no doubt know exactly what I'm talking about! Nearly fell out of my seat!!! It's definitely one to watch in a full cinema, as the audience reactions are as entertaining as the film itself. To look back at it now I can appreciate how great it is...but at the time, I wanted to hide behind my coat!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My rating here reads 10/10... this is no way that great a movie, the only reason being an attempt to have the flick's overall rating up somewhat. Now com'n guys, this doesn't deserve 3 point something like numerous other shaky cam movies in the recent past. this is a sheer celebration of the whole process of outstanding movie making.. this is no way scary or for that matter anything entertaining, but phenomenal camera works coupled with good background score was enough to make me soak in the love of it.. people don't go for a movie to appreciate simply these very intricate aspects of movie making, agreed,.. and hence respect the usual ballyhoo surrounding Paranormal Activity 2 (N.B: no way here m i trying to allude to our highly film-educated CRITICS' reception, in fact they don't even deserve an allusion in movie discussions. God please make me understand this: "a one &amp; half star out of 10 for a cult called The Twi-tards!) Nevertheless Paranormal Activity 2 is a very sincere effort on Tod Williams's part with some renewal of sense yet still holding on to his 'i don't give a sh*t to what u say' infused cinematic attitude.. not sure, but maybe a better finish without really an urge for a sequel would 've been perfect..this is a movie which will remind u of the Hollywood genre known as "grindhouse". the mistakes and editing are intentional and almost all the dialogues have been written and delivered in a grindhouse manner.some parts in the movie will surely make u smile if not laugh. the movie is not scary(i admit), its more like a rom-com movie shot very well with good music and a perfect cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SO not scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Puh-lease. 'Paranormal Activity 2' is pathetic. While the first one, though not exactly a classic, did have some jump-out-of-your-seat moments, the second one is completely devoid of any chills whatsoever. It's silly and clichéd and the acting?oh, my word..they managed to assemble the most talentless bunch of people for this piece of rubbish. It's boring and without action till the last five minutes, which I had to rewind THREE times to work out who and how. Pathetic. The script is silly, having the characters act completely implausibly, ie the parents, knowing their house is full of strange happenings, go out and leave their teenage daughter alone in charge of her baby brother. The teenager, who has already has cleverly (!) worked out her house is haunted, invites her bf over to play with a Ouija board. She also, in her 'research' makes a huge leap from mere haunting to Demon possession in about five minutes. PATHETIC. What a complete waste of celluloid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hey! Who left the front door open?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shortly after the birth of their new son, a family arrive home one day to a trashed house. Although nothing is stolen, they seek the expertise of security professionals and install various surveillance cameras around the house as a deterrent. But the cameras record odd occurrences that turn this film into a creep-fest.Without wanting to spoil anything major for those of you who haven't seen it yet, it's certainly hard to believe that a family wouldn't be more distraught about a trashed house. There's something a bit too blasé about their reaction that bothered me early on. When you're watching a movie filmed to look like a 'real event' these small details always matter.But aside from nit-picking small details it's hard to write about this film without mentioning the first. Sequels are, more often than not, built on the same formula as the original and this one is no different. A bigger budget obviously helped bring the realism to life but the premise and quality are almost identical; and there's nothing wrong with that for what they are trying to accomplish.Direction: 7/10 (Tod Williams builds up a creepy feel throughout the film, but that's about it) Cinematography: 8/10 (Michael Simmonds dumbs achieves an authentic realism) Editing: 8/10 (Gregory Plotkin did well to stick with Oren Peli's formula from the first) Acting: 6/10 (Brian Boland fleshes out his character more than the others, but this doesn't save it) Dialogue: 5/10 (Not that noteworthy but enough to seem like their a part of the film) Sound: 8/10 (In a story where sound is everything the team does a quality job) Effects: 9/10 (They scared me enough not to watch it without the light on) Art Direction: 7/10 (The connection to the first film is obvious when you see the set) Costumes: 8/10 (If anything they add to the authenticity) Music and/or Score: 9/10 (The various sounds create an eerie ambiance to set the tone)Total Score: 75/100It doesn't take long for the horror to start. The film gets to the point quicker than the original and that's its way of refining the formula. If horror is your forte and you prefer a good scare as opposed to mountains of blood, this will be right up your alley. Let your imagination connect the dots and just enjoy the creepiness.</fullReview>

Boring and predictable except for only a few parts.This one, on the other hand, is much better.They've clearly managed to learn how to be more creepy using shadows, lighting, and noises. What little fx there are are much better. The acting is almost infinitely better than the first.

		<fullReview>OK, so I finally saw Paranormal Activity after I ripped at it for two years straight. Well, when I saw it and enjoyed it, I admitted that I was wrong about.Paranormal Activity 2 does come close to being better than the original. However, I find myself looking at the original more because the second's lackluster, less scary, less ominous ending.It's well-written by tying the first and second together and having great continuity. But, the ending, felt forced. Katie walks into the house and the dad gets his neck broken and dies, then she goes upstairs, and pushes her sister violently at the camera (while she is holding her child, Hunter) and then slowly picks up the baby, and walks out. It felt a little forced because, the dad was watching TV and couldn't hear Katie nor could he see her reflection in their very large TV. It also seemed tacky because Katie pushes her sister, which is understandable as she's possessed by a demon, but doesn't concern herself with the well-being of the child in hand. I felt that the suspense of what happens unseen in the original's ending was what pattern they should have followed for this one.Cinematography is almost exact in this film, and I felt one overused shot in this film was unnecessary. They continuously used the shot of the front door looking outward to the front lawn, but nothing ever happens in the frame of it.Katie's acting well improved in this film, despite my belief that they used her presence as only to show her off as eye-candy for the male audience.Overall, I liked it, almost as much as the first. It was almost superior to the first, but the ending makes it fall just a tad short. I'm anxious to see what happens with PA3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing really new, but it does have its moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tod Williams's "Paranormal Activity 2" is a sequel of sorts to "Paranormal Activity" (2007). But actually, it's really more of a prequel, because "Paranormal Activity 2" actually takes place both partially before, and during, the events of its 2007 predecessor. Like its predecessor, this film details the supernatural events taking place in a middle-class suburban home and a family's slow realization that sinister forces have taken up residence in their house. These forces gradually make themselves known to the family, in on-camera footage recorded by the house's security system (which they installed after a supposed "break-in"). This film is nothing really new when compared to what ultimately took place in the first movie. However, I will award "Paranormal Activity 2" some points for the fact that it does have some genuinely creepy moments that are sure to linger in memory (check out that scene with the baby alone in the crib) for a long time afterward, and for the way that it is actually able to create a continuity with events in the first "Paranormal Activity." All in all, "Paranormal Activity 2" is a decent sequel that brings nothing new to the table, but does have a few genuinely unsettling moments to keep you on the edge of your seat.6/10</fullReview>

I know everybody has different tastes and we all know the world would be a boring place if everybody liked the same things, but I just don't get it. There are cheap scares and predictable moving / falling items so I don't see how either of these films are the 'scariest' people have ever seen? The only reason I gave this a 3 (and not a 1) out of 10 is because I thought the actress who plays Hunter's mum was quite good and because the ending was freaky.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before watching this, make sure you have seen the first film! If you liked that enough then you should like this one! The film is aimed at fans of the first one, so try not to be put off by any hugely negative reviews, this isn't your usual kind of film. The film does follow the same formula as PA1 pretty closely but I found it to be a little more intense than the first film. The larger cast of characters helps to bring a lot more life into the film compared to the first, as does occasional bits of humour - although not without creepy undertones. The film is really successful at filling you with a sense of dread at the start of every night scene. And towards the end you really feel like you are taking a genuinely scary step into the unknown/decent into a relentless nightmare with the characters. I really appreciate a film that has the power to make you nervous and have you literately hanging on to your seat dreading what's going to happen next. - That shows the film is powerful(just not in a shawshank redemption kinda way)If you are the type of person who will allow yourself to be absorbed enough by a film to experience it without being too critical you should have a fun time at the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not scary at all. You want to know what's really scary? The fact that I spent 8 bucks to go see this movie. That kept me up for days. On a more serious note this movie seemed way too much like PA 1. Basically, a average family finds out there home was 'broken into,' so they setup security cameras in order to keep an eye out. Eventually, all this weird stuff starts to happen and they freak. The movie is rather boring. You might hear a bang or a door slam and that's it. Of course the real intense stuff happens towards the end. I'll be honest I jumped one time throughout the whole movie, but I won't tell you where because that will ruin it. Save your money, wait for the movie to come out for rental, and either watch it alone or with some friends. That might make it scarier. *What I don't understand is, during the trailer they show you clips of the audience jumping because of this 'scary' movie. Those people are a bunch of wimps. If this movie scared you and you're over the age of 15, then grow a pair and man up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It sickens me to live in a society where "Paranormal Activity" makes a gajillion dollars, yet its far superior and more involving sequel tanks. Perhaps this movie was too intelligent and flew over the head of its collective audience. Perhaps Americans are as dumb as other countries think. Or, that Artisan just didn't try hard enough with this one. I saw it on the opening weekend. I walked in expecting to see another generic and clichéd genre sequel. The ending is one of the best endings ever put on celluloid, ten times better than the first. I left stunned, my mind racing a mile a minute. Weeks after seeing this film, I was still mulling over its complexities and significances. This is the penultimate sequel, far surpassing its predecessor. Maybe, somewhere in the near future, America will wise up and realize what this film truly is. But, knowing Americans, probably not. I highly recommend checking this one out. This is a film that you should definitely have in your collection. No film fan's collection would be complete without it.Earlier time scales used B.C. and A.D. to mark important events. After 12th Oct. 2010, the scales of humanity would mark the world before and after the release of Paranormal Activity 2.My Rating- 5/5 (Exceptional!!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this is becoming really really really bad.. Either Hollywood making movies on crappy video games with no story or emotions with lots of unnecessary sex scene and gore. Or they make sequence one after the other like a factory churning out new model of cars every other quarter. Few examples SAW, Hostel and Resident Evil to name few. So PA2 joins this elite list of crappy sequel. Once they made the PA1 and earned considerable amount of money which was worth considering the fact PA1 was not really scary but at least the movie grow on you and it was something you would not expect. This PA2 directory was concentrating on getting money out of these sequence so much so that he didn't see the obvious flaws, everything was expected and repeated and it was failed attempt to connect PA1 to PA2 in some weird ways. The Laptops were sleek and browsing internet in lawn that too in 1996, it must be some kind of jokes, even alien movies which usually shows future didn't show that much technology based in 1996. To add that Ali, drink the orange juice in couple of scene by pouring into glass, the bottle was clearly visible as Simply Orange juice bottle. Simply Orange brand was introduced in 2001 itself but characters were drinking that juice in 1996 some 4 years before the juice launch:) Overall, its not even popcorn movie. I don't blame the peoples who make these kind of crappy sequel and earning money in millions its peoples stupid peoples like us who spend time and money to watch these movies, as long as we continue to watch sequels they will continue to make them. I guess we should stop watching Hollywood movies altogether and start watching foreign movies, like Spanish, Korean, Chinese, Argentinian, and East European, they are really making classic movies these days. Hollywood only knows few formulas, video games, Super heroes, Sequels and Nazi basing Jews, apart from that nothing else.</fullReview>

I got more suspense and thrill from the Discovery Channel TV show Haunted (which is also pathetic and fake) I do think those who rated this movie above 5 are payed to do so. There can't be so much mediocrity on this Planet.I wish I had something more to write, but I don't. The movie didn't have something more to give.Over and out, Andrei</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What scares some, won't scare others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What scares moviegoers today? Though the landscape of horror has drastically changed over past decade with the rise of torture porn and Japanese horror, the films that stick with us rely on intense story telling and haunting visuals. Last year Oren Peli's bare-bones of a horror film Paranormal Activity wowed audiences with it's guerrilla style camera work and intense realism. That same spirit lives on as Tod Williams takes up the reigns for Paranormal Activity 2.The film is a prequel to the smash hit of last year, where we meet Kristi, the sister of Katie whose demonic episode was the basis of the first film. Kristi and her husband Dan welcome home a new baby boy, Hunter. Along with Ali, Dan's teenage daughter from a previous marriage, the four live in what seems to be a nice home. For those who saw the first movie, this is merely a formality.Following what appears to be a break-in, Dan installs security cameras covering the entire house, inside and out. Though nothing was stolen, it leaves the family perplexed as to why somebody would trash the house for no reason. Martine, the housekeeping/Hunter's nanny, is far too wise to believe this was a simple break-in. When Martine suspects an unnatural presence to have fallen over the house, Dan does what any strong willed man would do and ignore her, later relieving her of her duties. We all know that Martine is right, but in a way we're glad she's gone. Now the fun can begin.What made PA1 (Paranormal Activity) so successful was its realistic and unique interpretation of this new sub genre in horror; the "shaky cam". Rather than plaguing the audience with a complex back-story, Peli lured us in with his terrifying still camera, giving away tidbits of information throughout the movie. PA2 (Paranormal Activity 2) has most of the story filled in for us, leaving only the scaring to be done. Williams certainly have his fill in that regard.What makes this undertaking almost too easy for Williams is that he knows most people have seen or at least are aware of what happened in PA1. I can remember sitting in a packed movie theatre for PA1 last fall, not quite knowing what to expect. With each scene in the bedroom, an audible uneasiness settled over the crowd, getting louder and more uncomfortable as the film rolled on. Now that audiences know what to expect, this uneasy feeling settled in much sooner every time the security cameras went up on screen. You can hear the people shifting in their seats, adjusting themselves for the potentially terrifying sequence about to unfold.Williams has his way with the audience through the first act, never really cranking up the energy until the second act started. Leading up to the second act, there are only a handful of light flickers and loud noises, heightening the suspense for the big scare that inevitably lay ahead. It was almost painful to sit there not knowing what was going to happen the next time the lights went out.There are those who would call these tactics cheap with little payoff. Well, if you're going to see PA2, you already know what you're getting into. Just like someone going to see Jackass 3D isn't expecting a brilliant, scripted performance by Johnny Knoxville or Bam Magera. They pay to see people submitted to stunts Wile E. Coyote wouldn't sign up for. Williams uses the nervousness that the audience is harboring and abuses it. He makes the audience uncomfortable, utilizing long shots to pry the audience off of their seats, forcing them to scan the screen for something to scare them. They all came for a good scare, and he follows through.What makes PA2 a really good scare is how we know what will happen, only when it does, it's scarier than what we thought it would be. It's like jumping off a rope swing into a body of water. You know there is a far drop, only we you know that the water is freezing. Though the images are scarier in this film, the reaction to PA1 will never be matched. Still, when a film promises to scare you, it better follow through on that promise. That's what PA2 is all about. Giving the audiences what they want at a high quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Doesn't even draw a flame to the original and this is how cool original ideas are ruined...Greed! I know indie directors have to make money but you what go on to something newer don't destroy a good thing. Sequels only work occasionally for franchises like Star Wars, Indiana Jones minus the Crystal Skull. Then can work the opposite way and destroy movies such as Jaws,The Exorcist, The Amityville horror etc. Making a sequel to a great film is a huge gamble that this time left director Tod Williams going home with empty pockets. this time around the hauntings happen to Katie's sister Kristy (Sprague Grayden). the one thing i liked storyline wise was the fact that the some unanswered questions got answered from the first one. No I'm not going to deliver any spoilers !. Some scares come loud as in noise wise but the original intenseness that Paranormal 1 brought to it's audiences just wasn't there as the camera crew's obsession with the families swimming pool becomes annoyingly boring. If you are going to make something move, pick something other then a pool vacuum that already moves on its own. Katie Featherston reappears in this instalment as well as Micah Sloat. It's a prequel of sorts as Micah and Katie visit Katie and her family an announcement comes over the screen that this visit takes place 60 days before the death of Micah. Yawnnnn! I knew this was going to flop as you just cant seem to top greatness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring to tears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was going to write this review yesterday, because I believe that reviews should be written just after watching the movie, but I could not - a huge headache, caused by the camera movement and the abrupt, extremely annoying amateur-like "cuts" left me literally prostrated. I experienced other symptoms as well, like having my eyes filled with tears, at the same time that I felt utterly disgusted. The diagnosis was simple and self-explanatory: I was bored to tears.It's not just that his film is bad - it is especially bad, as if boredom were some exquisite dish that could just be cooked by the worst chefs and tasted only by an elite. The unique spices of boredom are all there, masterfully mixed: a non-story, lack of argument, poor acting, a camera that is horrible beyond description and so on. Still, there must be some little secret ingredient, because the result is superb: this is probably the most boring film of all times. For this achievement alone I thought about rating it 10 stars - but no, 1 is enough, considering there is no 0 stars rating available here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the movies tonight not knowing what to expect of this movie. I have herd good things and bad things about it. To say that this wasn't scary would be ignorant of anyone who has watched this.The perfect aspect of the Paranormal movies is the suspense they put you under. For the first maybe 30 minuets of the second movie i was sat thinking it was never going to get started but boy i was wrong. The scares soon came in thick and fast. Very sharp and short i had goose bumps allot towards then end. Come to think of it i have them now thinking about it.There are however a few moments in the film that made me cringe spoiler right hear guys. Two words child, dog. Now i know that there will be allot of people out there that love a good horror movies. See the beautiful chick running from the monster but Paranormal 2 brings a child into it which turns out to be the target. Both the first and second movie wouldn't happen if it wasn't for the "first born male". I will let you find out why in the movie, but they child does get messed around with by the demon. He is moved around in the cote and lifted up not violently but it happens all the same. And the poor dog who tries to protect the baby well lets just say that poor little guy doesn't make it. I found this aspect of the film breath taking and disturbing to which has left me feeling rather creep-ed out.The ending to the movie i find is rushed and could have been better planned. I hope that they do not make another. Reason is that it wouldn't work and the frights would all be the same again with doors and people flying about. Overall a job well done director should be proud but be mindful of any further productions. Please go see this film i hope you wont be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have rather seen something that had nothing to do with the first one but we have the sister of Katie from the first movie here and this one is supposed to take place before the first movie so its actually a prequel and it kind of doesn't fit. Katie makes no mention of this and she would have if it happened before the first movie. but other than that and that i hated the daughter I liked this one. I like having the dog and I think this is exactly how a dog would have reacted in this situation.I just hope they don't try to stretch out this premise to much farther because i don't see how they can. and if they end up doing a real film like blair witch 2, it could really go bad. but they did a good job with part 2 and the theater we were in was loving it so i recommend this movie. I also look forward to the alternate endings on the DVD when it comes out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PA2 is everything you expect from a horror. Big jumpy moments galore. However, i can't help but feel they've strayed from what made the original so groundbreaking.In making this movie a seemingly more mainstream horror i feel they traded in the subtly of the first one. I loved the first movie because of what you didn't see, what you thought you saw out of the corner of your eye but probably didn't. In PA2 they go all out to get the jumps and while you're in for a far more exciting cinema trip you're less likely to take the movie home with you as you were in the first. So it depends what you want from a horror, if you're into the major jump moments then this will be a great cinema experience, but its been seen before, so i'm afraid you probably won't be sleeping with the light on like i certainly did from PA1.All in all, its inevitable that with every sequel in a horror and with every strain of plot revealed it becomes harder to believe. To me, the first PA was scary because it felt real, you left feeling like that could've really happened, PA2 just feels like another horror movie with credits at the end, a solid horror, but perhaps one that sold out a touch on something that could've been a great psychological horror rather than just a great jumpy one in order to score sequels. Still more than worth a watch though for the experience alone!</fullReview>

Not at all Scary, poorly written, the acting--again, if you can call it that--I have seen better on 'Reality Television'. I was amazed I stayed awake through it. If you want to see something more exciting than this. Find some Surveillance footage of the electric turbines at Hoover Dam. To say that this movie is 'scary' would be like saying Vern Troyer is tall. Its just not true. This movie Might be scary if you were completely stoned out of your mind, or 5 years old when you watched it, but to any respecting adult. This movie totally blows.

		<fullReview>Thankfully I waited for Netflix. If you are afraid of your own shadow then this movie is for you. I somewhat enjoyed the first installment but the POV approach is long lost on this one. Instead of going forward, we have a (loose) prequel. Going forward, in real-time, would have been the only way to keep this franchise going respectfully. I'm surprised people didn't riot and torch the cinemas. I have had more enjoyment conditioning my hair... boiling an egg... waiting for paint to dry... and... watching clothes tumble in the dryer. This movie makes no sense and no amount of imagination can save it. Don't let them rope you in with supposed subliminal messages and spooky soundtracks. Paramount is going the way of MGM.

		<fullReview>May contain spoilers!!!!: *Still recovering from the trauma* Yes, I am still recovering from the trauma although I didn't even watch all of it. The first one was unbelievably retarded, yet, slightly better than this one! I decided to be nice to my brother-in-law and watch a little bit of it with him, but here, we continue the most bland, boring, and unoriginal story that has ever been put on film. I mean absolutely NOTHING in this "movie" is original! You have the demon that wants to posses a person's soul, a baby and a dog who are the only ones that can actually see it, and the "paranormal activity" that we used in the ghost stories we told as kids.Just to be fair, yes, things like lights turning themselves on, and toys moving by themselves would be creepy in real life, but it's like these movies are more like parodies of a ghost movie. What makes the least since about Paranormal Activity 2 is how the end claims that the girlfriend and baby's whereabouts were still "unknown". I know I'm nitpicking, and I know it's a prequel, but saying that their whereabouts were unknown, doesn't add up to the story in PA 1. I mean, where's the kid in the first movie? Did the demon eat him or something? Are we supposed to theorize? Tell us what happened! I felt so embarrassed for this movie, and the people in it, that I actually had to leave the room! Even if you don't find my review useful, please avoid it if at all possible! You will get more entertainment out of watching your cat hack up a hairball!</fullReview>

But when i saw the second part....uh, even worse than the shitty first part. Acting average, effects OK, story seen 200 times, direction could have been better. Surely we all have our opinions and different taste in movies and i respect yours, but because all the hassle the first movie has caused and now this second part- i think they could learn a lot from Blair Witch project which is a better movie in every point, better than the both of PA. If you liked the 1 part this one will give nothing new and you could be disappointed and if you didn't like it don't bother watch this one.All in all a total letdown sequel(prequel)caused by its even lamer predecessor</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 2 is clearly one of the worst movies of the year. Using the same kind of approach as it predecessor Paranormal Activity, the characters and the events that unfold in this movie are seen through surveillance and hand held cameras. At about 90 mins in length, the movie seems way too long. Believe me when I tell you that nothing happens in the first half of the movie. The cameras keep rolling, the digital clock in the corner of the screen keeps ticking and nothing ever seems to happen. Building suspense for ....... nothing! Oh, after about 30 mins or so, some dishes fall and an automatic pool cleaner keeps coming out of the water. Scared yet? I hope you didn't wet your pants. The first half of the movie was so boring that I felt that it was morally necessary to entertain my friend sitting beside me. I yelled out a loud shriek trying to stun him; but he had already fallen asleep. I digress. My apologies. The second half of the movie tries to build towards a final horror show. A dog dies; the nanny tries to get rid of the demon; and a teenager researches demons on the internet. The movie also tries to tie the storyline with its classic predecessor (pun intended). Frankly, I was too bored to care. The climax of the movie is probably worse than the entire movie itself. The lights turn off and you can't really see anything. You get glimpses of a few faces every 5-10 seconds thanks to the technology of infra-red cameras. People yelling, loud noises of things falling and a baby crying. No one really knows what's going on. I think the director was confused, and unable to match the level of mediocrity displayed throughout the movie, he decided to shoot the climax in complete darkness. As if he was trying to hide the faces of all his characters in shame. Not sure why the movie has a rating of about 6/10 in IMDb. My recommendation ? skip it.</fullReview>

Playing on the popularity of the first, they obviously decided to churn this one out to line their pockets even more. It's dull, boring, tedious and silly, with much of the same stuff going on as in the first. The "plot" is paper thin and clearly something someone made up as an afterthought and tacked on to the original. It was probably developed and completed in a week or two - it shows. The only people in the audience who enjoyed this was a group of girls aged around 13 years old. Enough said - avoid!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tamer Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 2 follows the same premise as the previous film of the same title (which was shown in 2007). The same underlying premise of horror, of the 'unseen beings' sharing the same space of the home the family lives in.The storyline is almost a carbon copy of its predecessor, but the execution defers a little. I find PA2 to be tamer, watered down version of the the two.The camera-work is a little corny (and shoddy) but it did the work just fine. I also find that the scare factors were a little less harrowing than the first one.I tend to agree the more often than not, sequel would always be seen as weaker than the original. And in this case, I tend to incline to those who think so.All in all, a watchable film . Not as good as the first one, but still okay. But an advice, if you like repetitive films, than it is better for you to skip this one. It IS the same as the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*May contain spoilers* I love scary movies.. whether it be gory or suspenseful. I love horror. For some reason, the movies about evil demonic beings are the most terrifying to me. So obviously Paranomal Activity 1 &amp; 2 hit home for me since they both portray very evil demons. Unlike a lot of others I've talked to, I enjoyed number 2 way more than number 1. I think it was the addition of a baby, teenager, and dog that really helped scare me. More people were being affected, which was cool to see. In Ali's case, I have babysat a child before on my own at night so I definitely related to her being alone in the house at night.I thought the acting was great and the camera work was awesome though simple, just like P.A. 1.I definitely recommend watching this in the theater, as I was still terrified with a hundred people sitting around me. The silent, suspenseful parts were that much more scary in the theater because NO ONE was speaking, just waiting to be scared.I really enjoyed it &amp; recommend it to any horror fan!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the movie on it's own would probably be a 5/10 but the fact that it explained a bit from the first movie and answered a few questions i had bumped it up to a 6. it follows much the same formula and scare tactics. it was nice to see that both the movies tied in together. not that scary a movie, some actually ended up being funny which i'm pretty sure wasn't intended. although the formula gets old quick with the security cameras and just waiting for stuff to happen, i think these movies are good as long as the market isn't over saturated with them. was actually surprised to see both Micah and Katie in the movie, but with the storyline it used, this worked well. although i guess this is the only place they could have gone for a new movie as they pretty much closed it with the first movie's ending.i guess the actual topic it deals with is the scariest part and then just waiting for something to happen amped up the couple of good frights the movie had. not terrible, but not great either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It would have worked if they didn't tie it to the first one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By todays standards, there is no such thing as a universally loved American horror film. There is no "Halloween", "Nightmare on Elm Street", or "Psycho". It's either you love it, or you hate it. However, whenever a pretty decent horror movie comes along that presses the boundaries of originality, the majority of the American audience puts it back in the closet. Why? Why can we not breed great original ideas? Why are they not accepted by the general public? Case in point "Paranormal Activity". Why do the majority of people not accept fresh ideas in the horror department? Does it need to be foreign in order for you to buy into the idea? Never the less, the movie scared the living crap out of me. Because the movie carries on the old horror tradition that what you don't see or understand, is what scares us the most.Okay, now one of the main reasons why i thought the first movie worked so well was because of it's set up and progression of scare tactics. The use of the whole 'Hand-held cam' didn't feel forced or un-necessary. And it's storyline was so simple, yet very elaborate in it's horror. However, with this new one, it tried to use the same ol' parlor tricks......which i am afraid, is what every single American horror movie does. Yes, i know they are being haunted by invisible enemies and there is only sooo much you can do. But i think the reason why the same tricks didn't work this time around, was because they tied this movie to the first one. And i even said from day one, if they want this movie to be just as spooky as the first, it cannot be relative to the original what so ever. You cannot create a Jason, or Michael Meyers with these movies, i don't care how hard you try.....it will never work because your missing one main element.....YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE WHAT'S DOING IT!!!! So i will say this much, the storyline for this one wasn't as easy to swallow as the first. Not only that, it doesn't quiet add up in the long run, and doesn't match the first one as far as accuracy.But, even though the movie tries to mimic a lot of sequences from the first, i was still pretty spooked. Obviously there were some scenes that definitely had your eyes widened with horror. Even though it pretty much stole an entire sequence from "Rec.". But that's okay with me, because your stealing from another good horror flick.Bottom Line.....yeah, you'll be spooked, but it doesn't match the level of horror that you felt in the first. If you make a third one.....which i think we all know is coming. Please don't tie it to the first one......keep the ideas fresh and original. Don't milk the same scenario like every other horror sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abject, in-your-face terror - at least as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the first ten minutes or so feels like needless filler, this sequel to the surprise horror hit of 2009 is ultimately terrifying, sending a surprisingly literal shiver down my spine. It is the rare follow-up movie that manages to incorporate details of the earlier movie without shoehorning them in artificially. It is every bit as suspenseful as you should expect it to be.The events in this film concern the sister of the protagonist, Katie, from the first film, but it's not like a retread of the same events, whereupon A New Family moves into the same haunted house and has just about the same crap happen to them. For this one, most of the events take place before those in the original - making it somewhat of a prequel - with scenes at the end overlapping some in the original as well.The film begins with Kristi and Dan bringing home their newborn, Hunter, while they're visited by Katie and Micah from the first film; also in attendance is Dan's stepdaughter Alli. After the cute-kid-with-an- adoring-family scene has been set, the family suffers an odd burglary, in which nothing is taken except for an old necklace given by Katie to her sister Kristi. This prompts Dan to set up a series of security cameras.As with the first film, strange things are quickly afoot - loud noises, pots falling off racks, doors closing of their own accord. The family's nanny, Martine, believes that evil spirits are to blame, and she attempts to cleanse the house. Naturally, the more pragmatic Dan doesn't buy into this mumbo jumbo, and puts a stop to her efforts. And yet the weirdness continues and even escalates.The movie is shot in the same manner as in the original film; that is, using hand-held video cameras and those omnipresent security cameras to depict not only what the family is feeling but what's happening when they're not around. Many of the disturbances seem to center on Hunter, who by now is several months old. The family's German Shepherd, Abby, seems to sense that something's amiss in Hunter's room, but she's powerless to stop it.As some of you may know, I have seen a few movies. In fact, I have seen a few horror movies, or at least ones that purport to be scary. Many of them aren't, and the more you see, the more jaded you become to them. In slasher pics, for example, you already know when the nubile teen is about to get hacked in half; you're more focused on the actual gore than any terrorizing. You munch your popcorn and gleefully watch blood spatter against the wall. Even suspenseful films often shoot themselves by either showing not enough suspense leading to a horrific moment - or showing way too much of it, causing the audience's mind to wander. It's all timing.What made Paranormal Activity so incredibly terrifying to me wasn't just that things happened with sudden, visceral intensity. After all, having seen the original movie, I expected these things to happen. It was that those scenes were terrifying even though I expected them. Really tough to top that. I won't lay out all of the HOLY CRAP scenes for you, but here's an example. Kristi is in the kitchen. It's the middle of the afternoon. No one else is home. She's sitting at the table, reading a magazine and sipping coffee - and this is after weird stuff's been happening. And then - BAM! All of the cabinet drawers and doors open, simultaneously. If you were sipping your own beverage in the theater at that time... well, you weren't anymore.Paranormal 2 fills in some of the background surrounding its predecessor, and that's a good thing. If you recall, Katie had been experiencing weird occurrences for quite some time and even speculated that her childhood had had something to do with it. That angle is explored a little more in #2, but not to the extent where everything is solved and everyone has a happy ending.In fact, that's the best part about this. The end of the first one was such a kick in the stomach, with a realistic open ending. The end of the second one is the same result achieved through different means; that is, we think we know more about why all of this is happening and has happened to these two families, but we have no clue whatsoever what the big picture is or where it's all leading. And because it's all shot using those amateur cameras, it really hits close to home. The house could be your house. Those people could be you. That could be your child and your dog.Watching this movie is what I imagine it would feel like to watch someone's home movies and discovering a snuff film. There's no aura of artificiality, no hint of contrived messes, nothing that would make you think that this stuff isn't actually happening to these people. The ending is not to be missed - complete, abject, unresolved, eviscerating terror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based from a $15,000-budget film that became a worldwide phenomenon, the second film is about Katie's (from the first film) sister's family. It doesn't cover any more grounds than its original premise, but this one has a baby. Kristi, Daniel, Ali, and newborn Hunter lives in a multi million dollar house and suspected there was a ghost or devil in their house (or at least Kristi did). The movie is supposedly the sequel of Paranormal Activity, but director Tod Williams made it looked like this was before the events took place it the first film. I'm not saying that the idea is unconventional, but for outside audience this maybe hard to understand. The idea of setting Paranormal Activity 2 in the same time as the first is plausible, but perhaps they should spend more time convincing the audience of the setting changes than spending too much time showing footage of nothingness. It may build up the suspense but at the same time it held down the entire film. Days and days of tapes and we know absolutely nothing. The first 45 minutes of the film was the right move to keep the paranormal amount a minimum, but after the 45 minutes, we still see the minimal amount of scares. Ultimately the ending was surprising, but then again I found it still not convincing. Even though it has its flaws and it definitely can't match with its predecessor, Paranormal Activity 2 is enjoyable is so many ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do yourself a favor - Just watch part 1.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in the fall of 2010, "Paranormal Activity 2" is a "horror" film directed by Tod Williams and written by Michael R. Perry. It stars Katie Featherson, Molly Ephraim, and a whole bunch of other people no one has probably ever heard of. It is also not a sequel, but a prequel to the original "Paranormal Activity". The only reason why this film was made was because the first one made millions, so the studio quickly whipped up this snoozefest.I saw this boring film today because I loved the first "Paranormal Activity" so much, but the prequel was pure trash. What a let down! I was so bored. When the audience you're seeing it with is laughing at the scary parts and are yawning and sighing through out the film, that is never a good thing and I was doing it right along with them and looking at my watch a little too often because I was very bored.It was a gag movie. It was no different then someone coming up behind you and going "BOO!". That's all it was through out the "scary" parts of the movie. It might scare preppy teenage girls, and perhaps that is their target audience, but as a horror movie-watching veteran, I was not in the least bit scared.The film also took WAAAAY too long to get to that point of when we the audience are suppose to be scared, whereas the first got right into it. In the prequel, there would be shots of random places in the house, but then it never delivered the scary stuff. It spent way too much time trying to build up to the scary stuff. It was pretty much like watching some stranger's home videos for a few hours. I also understand that perhaps the makers of the film were just attempting to introduce the characters to the audience so we get to know them more, thus care about them more, but again, I felt way too much time was spent on that, and then I didn't think much of the characters because I didn't find them funny, or entertaining, nor was there anything about them that caused me to pity them, or like them, and overall, I could not relate to them much, and they were easily forgettable after the film was over.I've read some people reviews about this film where they claim to hate the first one, but love the second one, and I can see why some people may feel that way - It's because this is the highly censored and G-rated verison of the first "Paranormal Activity". All this movie did was rehash the stuff we saw in the first one, only this just sucked because it was never scary. At not least scary to anyone who watches a lot of horror films. They pretty much took the horror out, and gave us this nonsense.All and all, it's just another bad film that was only made because the first one made a lot of money. The sad part is, as long as people keep going to see these movies, the studio is going to continue to make them, because they are very cheap to make, and they bring in millions of dollars. The writers are not even trying to be creative either. At least with the "Saw" films for example, they made an effort to bring something fresh to the story, but "Paranormal Activity 2" just completely copied everything from the first film, but with less scares. Just a watered down, made for ABC-TV Family movie verison of the first "Paranormal Activity".In closing, the film was one of the biggest disappointments I've ever seen. If you're a parent, and your kid wants to watch a scary film, this is the one to let them watch. I'm serious. It's very mild.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranormal Activity 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Halloween was approaching, and I thought to myself I haven't really seen a horror film in the cinema, especially one that makes me jump a lot, so I hoped this one would. Basically Kristi Rey (Sprague Grayden) and husband Dan (Brian Boland) live together with their baby son Hunter (twins William Juan and Jackson Xenia Prieto) and German Shepherd dog Abby, and one night they apparently have a break-in. Katie (Katie Featherston, from the previous film) suggests they should set-up surveillance cameras to try and catch the crooks in action. So a night or two passes with no incidents, but the camera reveals that it is not even a crook they had visit. Slowly Kristi knows that the house is possessed by an invisible demon, and over the nights she and baby Hunter try to sleep it gets more terrifying. What starts out as some doors being slowly opened turns into loud bangs, doors slamming, a pan dropping, toys coming alive, the dog dragged away, and worst baby Hunter and Kristi being dragged against their will. The biggest threat comes from all doors in the kitchen slamming open, and in the end it ends really badly when Dan faces his fate, and a possessed Kristi disappears taking baby Hunter with her. Also starring Molly Ephraim as Ali Rey and Micah Sloat as Micah. Being the first real horror film I had seen in the cinema it was interesting to hear the reactions of all the other audience members, some admittedly did annoy me, but with their help I was certainly made to jump at the right moments. The only problem is, even with the Blair Witch "found footage" concept, it is completely the same film again, it just doesn't feel original and it is a little slower with the scares, so a slightly disappointing supernatural horror sequel. Adequate!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>stupid. plain and simple, amazing how a movie thrown together overnight can make so much in one weekend. My advice, rent the first one, it's worth the dollar. With all the hype, i was expecting to bite a couple of fingernails, and i did... to keep myself from falling asleep. i jumped twice as much for the movie "Finding Nemo" then for the supposed thriller i saw today. Paranormal Activity 2 is the must see flop of the year and should be at the dollar theaters before Halloween. Overrated is the best word for this, just as the movie seemed to warm up, BAM! it ended. All i know is Paranormal Activity 3 needs to be here before 2011 so i can feel they've earned my money back. For Shame Hollywood, FOR SHAME!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RE-REVIEW (11-11-11)Starring: Katie Featherston, Sprague Grayden , Brian Boland, Molly Ephraim, Micah Sloat, Seth Ginsberg, Vivis Cortez, Jackson Xenia Prieto, William Juan Prieto and David Bierend.Directed By: Tod Williams.Synopsis: (Spoilers towards the end of the Paragraph) Well this is a Prequel to the 2009 sleeper hit movie Paranormal Activity and it follows the events taking place about 2 months before the one in the original movie. i love supernatural horror movies so much specially the one like these. to be honest it was a bit disappointing movie and it couldn't keep up to the first movie which was good but still likable movie if you have seen and enjoyed the first. it takes place in 2006 where a burglary occurs in the house of Kristi ad Dan, every room is like completely trashed mysteriously while their infant son Hunter's room have not been evern touched. the only thing that have been stolen was a necklace given to Kristi by her sister Katie and also a box of videotapes. Dan installs Video cameras all over the house to ensure the safety of their house and their infant son. he fires there Maid Martine when she attempts to apparently cleanse their house from "Evil Spirits". Katie and Kristi also discuss about the activities that happened in their childhood. while Dan's daughter Ali begins to investigates about the weird things happening to their house and discovers that on a occasion, human can make deal with the demons for the wealth or power by forfeiting the life of the first born son in the family, she also realizes that Hunter is the first son born in the family. the weird activities continuous as there Dog Abby gets attacked violently and suffers Seizures. while Dan and Ali takes the Dog the vet, Krsiti being alone in the house with Hunter notices a light flickering in his room and is voilently dragged by some unseen force tow times as she tries to free herself, she is dragged to the basement for many hours and then released. Ali finds Krsiti upstairs with Hunter who tells her not to touch Hunter. Ali begs Dan to watch the Videotapes who then calls Martine back who prepares a cross that will pass that Gemon of Kristi to another blood relative and she wont remember anything of it. and yes that is the cross Micah finds with Katie towards the end of the first movie. the try to do that and that is exactly when the voilent things start to happen in the house, those moments are unbelievable. Movie ends with connecting the first movie to this where we see Katie in a possessed nature coming to Kristi's house killing everyone and taking Hunter with her while Ali is away on a trip.Review: this movie was also a hit like original and broke some box office records. it received quite Mixed to average reviews. the problem that it had according to me was the unbearable slow start and then the folow up wasn't quite impressive enough, it didn't kind of made up for that slow and boring start and doesn't impresses in any sort of way except the shocks that the end of the movie provides. there are some good moments towards the end of the movie like the one that connects the first movie to this one. when the first movie ended it left with the slight thought of why all this happened to them and what was the reason the demon followed her so this second movie really covered all that but still left me with slight confusion and a bit of uncomfortable feelings, which as you know would be clearly solved with the third movie which explains everything. i like this series so much.okay so there clearly was more things than the first movie in it, more of everything, more scares and more people and it took the movie forward but overall, it didn't quite proved or showed anything new or made some new level for these movies but it just was a continuation to a much great movie but didn't quite lived upto it. as i said the start is very slow and quite mediocre. Screenplay of this movie is very weak. the plot is quite uneven and is not good. yes i liked Ali she was nice and the actress who played Kristi did a really good job, not sure with Dan though. it had nice evrerything else apart from the weak writing. i had to struggle a bit to like the start of the movie but got through the movie with that quite scary, shocking and exciting end that at the particular moment makes up for everything.Some scenes are really shocking like the dragging scenes or the ones with baby, was feeling bad for the baby so much. also who it ends just leaves you in shock. watch it if you like the series but this movie was weak.Rating: 2.5/5 C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy Sequel-Prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a bit of a misnomer to call Paranormal Activity 2 a sequel, as part of it is actually a prequel. I won't say how much. That would be giving away too much of a great twist.You don't have to have seen Paranormal Activity to enjoy PA2, although I recommend it, since certain visual cues in PA2 are a hundred times more ominous if you know what happened in the first movie. The basic premise is this: a family with a new baby in the house experiences what at first appears to be a break-in. Concerned for the safety of the little one, they invest in a state-of-the-art security system which includes security cams all over the house, with the recordings accessible from their home computer. As weird things continue to happen in the home, it becomes more and more difficult to explain what they're finding on the security cam footage. You still get a good scary story if you haven't seen PA, but if you have seen it, you get a deepening of that story, with some shocking turns coming directly out of the first movie's events.The improv-style acting from normal-looking people is effective, as it was in the first movie. The filmmakers expended less time and attention to establishing the location as a locus of dread in PA2, but the buildup of events from 'kinda weird' to holy crap' is as well-paced as in the first movie, and the jump scares are even more effective this time around.If you liked the first movie, definitely give this one a view. If you didn't see the first movie, see that one and then go see this, preferably on a weekend night when the theater is packed to the rafters. This is one of those flicks that goes better with a raucous audience around you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm definitely spooked. Saw this today and I have to say that I enjoyed it more than the original. Neither film will impress those who do not care for horror movies that consist entirely of buildup and atmosphere, with very little action moments. I happen to enjoy a wide variety of them, this type including so the slower pacing for 3/4 of the movie didn't particularly bother me. These three quarters consist primarily of some rather creepy jump moments, two in particular that really took me by surprise.At this point I was prepared to say it was decent but not that great....until the ending, which REALLY took me aback.The film does a nice job of giving some exposition on how the Katie/Micah situation came to be. Dates and incidents tie in very well. There's also plenty of explanation for the "why" questions, which I appreciate. The only thing I would have to say is that it tends to drag during the middle, but once it gets rolling, it's great.I haven't been truly scared by a horror movie in several years. This one has changed that. Even better than the original.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original on the preview night. Several people left and didn't come back. This didn't happen tonight. It was a decent flick, good sequel. Pulled in the first movie well; You could actually go see either one and enjoy the other. Love the roller coaster of scaring people, then cutting into a scene that's pretty comical - for example the time lapse with the dog rolling over - lots of laughs, then 20 second later everyone screaming -- good stuff.Only thing that I wish was that it wasn't so predictable, but that's common with sequels. I'd see it again with friend, just to see their reaction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranormal Activity 2 (2010) *1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was one of those people who had been amazed at how effective the first PARANOMAL ACTIVITY had been. After well over 40 years of having seen every kind of elaborate horror movie you could think of, the simplicity of the first film managed to send shivers down my spine on a very limited budget with no frills. It really did not need a sequel and probably is better off on its own without one, but money talks, and that thing made a lot of money.With PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 2, we are introduced to the sister of the young girl who was featured in the first movie. Sis is setting up a gorgeous new home with her husband, a teenage daughter, the family dog, and an adorable newborn baby. The main action takes place about a year later, when the baby is about one year old. His adoring aunt from PA #1 likes to stop by and visit every now and then. But one day while nobody's home, the family returns to find their home has been invaded by burglars, so dad decides to have security cameras installed in every other room of the house, as well as in the back yard and near the front door. These surveillance cameras will catch whatever cheap thrills will manage to transpire during this film. In a nutshell, Part 2 is nowhere near as good as Part 1. What worked wonders the first time around falls flat the second time. Like trying to catch lightning in a bottle twice, it can't be done. The real scares do not really start occurring until way too late in the movie, and by that time we've been bored in between anticipating lackluster "jump" sounds, like amplified "BANGS!," designed to give us a lazy jolt. It is also rather odd the way in which the first movie gets woven in with this one. *1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out on a limb with this one...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I just saw here on IMDb, the Paranormal Activity movies seem to be going to be a franchise, with Parts 3, 4, 5 and 6 already green-lit. What seems to make them different, is that the makers of the first two, still seem to be involved (at least in part 3 that is). And while the follow-up plays at the same location as the first one, it tells a different story. For some the story may not seem that different though.Finally, I got past what the movie's about: demon possession and not an actual virus, as I can't change its intentions, and did somewhat enjoy the ride. It's longer than the first one and not as good. Is it worth going beyond Paranormal Activity? No. But, if you truly must see the continuation, see it. But, you were warned.I am rating Paranormal Activity 2 with a two star salute.</fullReview>

While not entertaining, the plot has more holes than a sponge and there are more continuity errors than I care to list.The Question has to be asked has Tod Williams ever made a movie that is scary? The answer has to be a big NO. There are so many clichés, even for a horror film, and while Tod Williams might be trying to be funny, it doesn't work. The only thing I laughed at was the sorry attempt at coherence.This film's not worth writing much, just trust me, and rent Fraiser season 1, instead. Or a film like "toy story", which at least has some good kelsey grammar voice work. (He also received two Emmy nominations for his original portrayal of Dr. Frasier Crane on Cheers).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprisingly Clever Sequel to a Surprise Hit!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After experiencing what they think are a series of "break-ins", a family sets up security cameras around their home, only to realize that the events unfolding before them are more sinister than they seem.When Paramount announced that they were going to do a sequel to PA, I was skeptical. Let's be honest, it felt like they were trying to cash in on the surprising success of PA. Then the trailers were released, which weren't really special, and the film wasn't screened to the critics. Either Paramount was trying to keep a tight lid on it or it must be a really, really bad sequel. I mean, the only person in the casting list is Katie Featherston, who plays Katie, which is still pretty vague. Fortunately, PA2 is actually a worthwhile sequel that retains everything that made the original scary.With a much higher budget, PA2 boasts a bigger cast and has more elaborate scares and security cameras to capture the events. But, as you all know, bigger sometimes isn't better, and, in this case, it's true. What made PA so great was its amazing simplicity. The scares were limited to doors creaking, lights flickering, and footsteps thumping. In this film, I'm not going to even mention what they do. However, saying that, the film does have some very scary scenes, even more so than the simple scares in the original. It's apparent while watching the film that PA2 relies more on jump scares than on maintaining an atmosphere like PA, which may be good or bad news depending on which you prefer more. However, the film still retains the slow buildup of scares in PA as the film reaches to the end, where all hell breaks loose. It's also agonizing to see things move on their own that our characters don't notice. Don't you just hate that feeling of dread?Most of the cast do a great job because they are more innocent than the victims in the first film, including a baby and a dog. Please, just spare the baby and the dog! I'm also glad to say that the climax is much better than the one in the first film, if you could even call it a climax in that film. However, the sequel does have the same main problem of PA: The ending. It's just as anti-climatic and disappointing coming off from a huge buildup.If you didn't like the first film, just skip this sequel. It's more of the same in terms of structure and style. However, if you liked the first film, you'll definitely enjoy this. I thought the storyline was rather clever in that it ties in with PA. Overall, even though this isn't as scary as PA, PA2 should be an example of how to make a proper sequel to a great first film which stays true to the original's overall tone. And considering the fact that we are familiar of the set up before, PA2 still has its own share of effective scares. Now that's an accomplishment.</fullReview>

Not scary - and the scary bits aren't scary at all! Everyone in the cinema walked out complaining about how bad it was. It was another film where the story had the potential to be really good but the film itself early on.

And in the end you are left with wondering why you just spend, whatever length the movie is, watching it. Frankly there was several times I wanted to just leave because the movie was so terrible.So do yourself a favour and just avoid this movie, it hints at being innovative but what it basically is a money grab as they spent minimum amount of money and then probably claim it is a psychological movie so it does not need any effects.

		<shortDescription>Nothing New Except For The Toddler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not know what is it that made Paranormal Activity such a big hit, that it even had a sequel (actually a prequel), which is now also a hit. The first movie was only mildly disturbing in its videocam style documentation of the strange goings-on in a suburban house. This second film follows in basically the same tread with almost no variation.PA2 recounts the ghostly experience of a woman who is the sister of Katie (the wife in the first movie). She moves into a house in Carlsbad, California with her husband, stepdaughter, her own toddler son and their trusty dog. Because of a "break-in," they set up security cameras around the house, and that is where this "footage" comes from. These events supposedly occur 30 days before the death of Micah Sloat (the lead guy in the first movie).While the first movie had the advantage of novelty, this second one really felt boring already with the very slow build up of action. However, do people really have time to wait for more than 50 minutes into a horror movie before anything that could be called "scary" happens? We get the same gimmicks like sudden bangs and pulling people which already happened in the first movie. I cannot think of anything really new here, except the presence of the toddler, which was tense. After all that nothing, the supposed "climactic" scene in the basement was terribly unintelligible.This second movie ends by connecting to the first installment. However, the epilogue statement seems to hint at still another episode. I think this series has really taken its novelty effect to its full course. Enough already!</fullReview>

Now com'n guys, this doesn't deserve 3 point something like numerous other shaky cam movies in the recent past. this is a sheer celebration of the whole process of outstanding movie making.. this is no way scary or for that matter anything entertaining, but phenomenal camera works coupled with good background score was enough to make me soak in the love of it.. people don't go for a movie to appreciate simply these very intricate aspects of movie making, agreed,.. and hence respect the usual ballyhoo surrounding Paranormal Activity 2 (N.B: no way here m i trying to allude to our highly film-educated CRITICS' reception, in fact they don't even deserve an allusion in movie discussions. God please make me understand this: "a one &amp; half star out of 10 for a cult called The Twi-tards!) Nevertheless Paranormal Activity 2 is a very sincere effort on Tod Williams's part with some renewal of sense yet still holding on to his 'i don't give a sh*t to what u say' infused cinematic attitude.. not sure, but maybe a better finish without really an urge for a sequel would 've been perfect..this is a movie which will remind u of the Hollywood genre known as "grindhouse". the mistakes and editing are intentional and almost all the dialogues have been written and delivered in a grindhouse manner.some parts in the movie will surely make u smile if not laugh. the movie is not scary(i admit), its more like a rom-com movie shot very well with good music and a perfect cast.</fullReview>

Paranormal Activity 1 was extremely entertaining, and the fact that they tied the two movies together in such a clever way made for a wicked surprise ending, and made the entire experience super satisfying. The subtlety of the special effects was very effective, haunted house movies where doors are constantly slamming, and lights are always flickering can be kind of boring... The anticipation of catching something on the cameras made for a suspenseful experience, with a worthy payoff. Also, the acting was good, minus the dad character, but his performance was passable. Both the dog, and the baby's performances were top notch, along with the entire cast. If you haven't seen it, and have seen the first one, definitely go for it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Paranormal as the first in every way... which isn't a good thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I lined up for PA 2 at the local cinema there were a raft of teenagers all gaggling about the place clutching their tickets and $12 Cokes eagerly awaiting the chance to release high pitched screams and giggle like morons? Not that I have anything about vacuous teens ruining my movie *he lied*, but in a film that was obviously going to be about long silent build ups and "BOO" reveals having a bunch of chuckleheads talking and braying through those moments seemed counter-intuitive.So a few weeks later the queues filled with slack jawed yokels were in front of Saw 42 (or whatever they are up to now), so I snuck in to a mostly empty theatre and caught Paranormal Activity 2? And I realized that three weeks ago I could have stayed home and rented the original and seen the same film? EXACTLY THE SAME FILM! PA 2 takes place in the weeks prior to PA 1, but it isn't really a prequel as it is a companion piece to the first ? I can't explain why without spoilers ? you'll see.Dad and Mum bring home baby Hunter. The early going fast forwards us through his babyhood in hand-held home video style to that day until he seems about 2. Hunter can crawl and walk a little, never seems to talk though.Dad might be 45ish and Mum 35ish, their home hosts stepsister to Hunter Ellie (Dad's daughter) who seems about 16, and Mexican (Latin anyway?) housekeeper Marline and a German Shepherd dog named Abby.Mum has sister Katie and possibly one-day-will-be Bro-in-law Micah (from PA 1) popping in every now and then for barbecues, drinks and eerily portentous conversations? We are even informed of Micah's "Deathclock" early in the piece, not sure exactly why they thought that would be handy but there you go.After a night out the family arrives home to find the house absolutely trashed, but nothing is missing. They decide that they would like to see any future trashings ? but not prevent them ? so they install a bunch of pinhole cameras but seemingly no alarms, as much of what follows would undoubtedly trigger them if they had.After this it plays out EXACTLY like PA 1.We spend the next hour watching the corners and background for movement, straining our ears to hear stuff, wondering why that happened or what might have caused that noise or bump.The family ponder how the Kreepy Krawly keeps "escaping" the pool each night (a cool reveal, but I fail to see how it was part of some demon's master plan to have a the pool cleaning device end up on the bricks nightly), why the frying pans fall down randomly and how doors close by their own volition.Marline of course isn't a native to America ? therefore we understand immediately that as someone with English as a second language she is genetically predisposed to sussing out evil way before us English speakers. She performs a little bit of a spirit cleansing involving little more than some incense and muttered chanting? and is sacked for it.The occupants of the home argue over the seriousness of the events around them, a séance is performed, they review the tapes of previous days for offputting proof that shows but doesn't tell, and they wonder openly why the dog keeps barking and why the baby won't look them in the eye? (I have the answer to the last two: because it is a dog and because it is a baby.) I can't say much else for fear of ruining both films, but I would reiterate my point that if you've seen one you've seen both.This year I watched The Descent 2, itself a transparently obvious remake of the first, I gave that a generous 7.5 / 10, which I still feel was fair and a full 2 points below the score the original earned. In the case of PA 2 I can't be that generous for reasons I can't disclose (but will if someone asks), sure in remaking the solid first film they are being a little lazy, obviously maximizing the box-office by replicating what worked 12 months ago ? but if you really think about how the two plots dovetail into each other I find myself a lot less forgiving? By the way, the trailer with all the red herrings and "did I just see what I thought I did?" moments was way cooler than the film itself, watch that 40 times in a row instead.Final Rating ? 5.5 / 10. Steals liberally from the first unexpected box office smash ? a little too much as it turns out. In isolation though an effective replica I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It beat the First</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I was looking forward to this movie, I was also preparing myself for disappointment. Remember that when I was about to watch this, I was one of those people who said that the first Paranormal Activity was the scariest movie I had ever seen. So I was wondering how this would top it. Well it did, this film blew my mind when I first saw it, and of the three Paranormal Activities released so far, this one is my favorite.One of my problmes with the movie is that the first four or five night seem to go by without much going on. Unlike the first film, which gradually built up, this film sort of went several nights with almost nothing weird happening, and then all of a sudden stuff goes completely crazy. Also, I know this may sound weird, but the days go by way too fast. I know in the first film the opposite happened, the days dragged on and you wanted to get to the nights, but here, like we'll get one small thrity second scene of the daytime and then it will be night again.This is a real shame because some really creepy stuff happens during the day. Including the best jump scare I've seen in any movie. I really don't want to spoil it, but if you've seen the movie, you know what it is. So yeah, this movie is scary, and really creepy, but what really pused it over the edge were it's characters and plot. I really liked the family in this movie, they felt like a real family, they loved each other, but they fought a lot, I see a lot of my family in these four. Each one is likable and I was really hoping everything would turn out good for them. And the plot, I think most people know this already, but it turns out that this was a prequel. The trailers never said this, so when I found out it was a prequel, I was genuianlly surprised. And the movie goes on to answer several questions to the first film that we didn't even know we were asking.I won't spoil them. This movie is a perfect horror movie sequel, it's just a perfect sequel. It adds more scares, gives better characters, and builds on the story. And while I love the first and third movies, and am looking forward to the fourth, this still remains my favorite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing to acknowledge with the Paranormal Activity movies is you are either going to be a fan or not. There isn't really much middle ground for this kind of movie as so much of its success will depend on whether you as a viewer can be drawn into the story and the production. If you are unsure the best thing to do is simply ask yourself 'do I really want to be scared?' and if the answer is yes then hit play. If, however, you are the kind of person that will spend most of the movie proudly boasting how you are not in the least bit frightened and that the effects are rubbish then you might as well give it a miss.I personally love a good scare and am more than happy to watch the whole of this movie fully believing the pretense that what I am watching is real footage. In fact I find this kind of horror movie, like The Blair Witch Project to be far scarier than slasher or more recent gorno films. In relation to number 2 vs its predecessor I think there is little to choose from as to which is the better movie. Obviously the first has the advantage of originality (to a degree)and has the benefit of being able to stick to a simpler plot line and for these reasons alone many fans will proclaim Paranormal Activity 1 as the better film. Yet, I actually prefer the set up of number 2, with the use of security cameras instead of sole dependence on the hand held camera. After all towards the end of number 1 you can't help but think 'why are they still running around with the camera?'. The use of the baby boy and the dog are also great additions as kids and animals in horror movies are very creepy. Some of the acting is a little suspect and you do have to take certain plot developments with a pinch of salt otherwise the story wouldn't move forward in any kind of entertaining way. The link in to the first movie isn't too bad though but I would be a little worried for number 3 in the franchise. This movie is definitely best watched late at night, just before heading to bed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Bloody scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i first saw Paranormal Activity back in 2009 it scared the bejesus out of me and even more so my wife. It was the sort of film that people either loved or hated and we loved it. As per usual when a film is so financially successful the movie companies are not slow in making a sequel and i had my reservations about this because it was always going to be difficult to get near to the original but to be fair they seem to have done a pretty good job. What i like about this film is that they stick with exactly the same format as the first. Most of the scares in this film are not what you see , but what you are expecting to see and it raises the tension to boiling point and to a great final conclusion. It's not as good as the first film but it was never going to be because it surprise element is not quite there , but it's still bloody scary and i have to admit my heart rate was pretty high throughout this movie. If you loved the original you will enjoy Paranormal activity 2 ( if enjoy is the right word) if you didn't then don't bother .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A prequel/lead-in that makes the original into an even better film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 2 is sort of a prequel/tie in to the huge hit that was Paranormal Activity. In the prequel, a family's house is tampered with one evening. As a way to fight their fears, the father has a security system installed to prevent the incident from ever happening again. The family soon learns that maybe their house was not broken into but is rather haunted by something that they can't see. Now, the family must try to unravel the events that continue to occur and hope that they can stop it from happening again.When I originally saw the trailer for Paranormal Activity 2, I was upset. All I could think was why the heck are they doing a sequel to that film? I am one of those people who found the original to be very overrated. That might be because I saw the film so late in the game but to me it wasn't scary and extremely boring. I definitely was not on the band wagon when I saw the trailer for the sequel. Avoiding the film in the theaters, I decided to pick up the sequel when I was out and decided to sit down last night and watch it.Paranormal Activity 2 actually serves as a companion piece instead of a direct lead in or prequel to the original film. You SHOULD watch the original before you see this one. There are a lot of connections between the two and the end result kind of plays out like the "Saw" films. This sequel or say prequel actually for the first time makes the original feel like a better film. Its hard to explain but I will try. The original had very little story and not much background. This film has more story and is better explained. Also, Activity 2, probably, because of its bigger budget looks better and feels more realistic for some reason. I thought that was odd since the original was actually filmed for next to nothing and had a smaller cast in a real house but something about the house in this film made it feel more authentic to watch.When you talk about a film flowing, its all about its pace and how the film shapes its story. This movie flows well. It starts off rather rough and I was well on my way to start mocking it within the first 10 minutes. However, when the film hits the 25 to 30 minute mark, it becomes a lot better and actually keeps you on the edge of your seat in suspense. I think the action scenes are much more scary in this film and I actually jumped a few times here and there. I think that bringing in elements like a dog and baby added to the creepiness of the film. We all have seen films with couples being haunted by things but when a baby and a dog are, well that's something new.I realize that Oren Peli, who wrote and directed the original, was trying to pull a Blair Witch Project on its audience. Nowadays, after films like that and the rise of amazing reality television (why oh why does it exist), I know I can't really believe that a film like this is true. I think both films try to be believable and work for the most part. If I wasn't a victim to bad reality television, I would have probably believed the first film was real that is until I saw that the filmmaker released multiple alternate endings. The scares of this film come from the unknown. There is something just simply chilling about the paranormal. It's creepiness comes from that idea alone and it works.I do realize that many have said that this film is poorly acted and I have to agree with that mark but these are suppose to be real people so it fits the tone of the film. I can't say I liked any of the characters in the film, while I actually didn't mind Katie and Micah in the original. In that case, the first film is better for having more likable characters. The characters here were very whinny and actually unlikable from the start. They also seemed a bit more silly than those in the original.In the end, Paranormal Activity 2 does two things that rarely occurs in film. First, its better than the original and the second is that it actually made me like the original film. I know, I am shocked myself. After watching the sequel, I immediately put the original on and watched it from start to finish. The storyline in the sequel helped connect some of those weird what the hell? moments that occurred in the original. It also helped make the original film feel scarier. I think that's a rare feat for movies like this. I admire films that actually create suspense from nothing. It takes a skilled writer or writers to create a story that is scary without actually seeing something. I can't believe I am going to say this but I am now a fan of Paranormal Activity 1 &amp; 2 and am excited to see the third film. I just hope that everyone involved don't overstay their welcome and keep these going like every other successful horror series. They should just stop with the trilogy and not try to push their luck.MovieManMenzel's final rating for Paranormal Activity 2 is a solid 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 2The worst thing about being haunted by a suicide victim is that when they're not stealing your razors, they're leaving your car running with the garage door closed.Fortunately for the family in this horror movie, the lingering apparition in their home is not melancholy, but malicious.When their home is broken into, Dan (Brian Boland) and his new wife Kristi (Sprague Grayden) have cameras installed.Later, it's revealed that a spiteful spirit hell-bent on possessing the soul of the couple's newborn son is the real perpetrator.Set months before the events of the first movie took place, PA2 fills in all the blanks, including the demon's true intent.While its scares are reminiscent of its predecessor, the vindictive spirit storyline that this installment forges is more frightening than the first.But remember, ghosts are just invisible bullies that will back down if you say 'Uncle' in a firm tone.

		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 2 takes a while to get going. Which makes sense, considering the fact that it's a prequel to the first movie, and has to match up with the story presented there. But that doesn't change the fact that the first 45 minutes of Paranormal 2 were just this side of outright boring.&nbsp;Fortunately, the movie does eventually get into gear, and I found it to be just about as creepy as the first. There's more of a reliance on jump scares this time around than the mystery and atmosphere of the first movie, but the tension is still mostly there. The Paranormal Activity "mythos" gets further expanded, and you'll see the events of the original movie in a new light after watching this one.&nbsp;If you liked the first P.A., then you'll probably enjoy this one, too. The same goes for if you disliked the first. This is basically more of the same, and the slow start definitely hurt it, but I still found it to be worthwhile. And yes, I'll probably be in line to see Paranormal Activity 3 when it rolls around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you didn't like "Paranormal Activity", you won't like the sequel, either. If you DID like the first film, such as myself, then this still probably won't live up to all of the expectations you may have. It's all the same ...type of scares and shocks, only not as effective. The biggest letdown is that the first film cost the budget of a 3-bedroom house in a common neighborhood; this one was about $2.5 million. However, it is better than it has any right to be, and what saves it from being a lackluster ho-hum prequel is the way the two movies tie together. It works so well, all grounds are covered, and even though it is not quite as freaky, I was still overall pleased.It has never been hard for me to become frightened over things unseen. I am one of those people that gets the jitters from the house settling, or when my dryer goes off and makes the loud buzzing noise that it ALWAYS makes. If I wake up to the dog barking, or my daughter whimpering in the dead of night, I envision an alien abduction. If my lady wakes me out of sleep because she heard something, I automatically sum it up to a specter, a demon waiting to possess, or even some escaped lunatic who has already been killed a million times. I never think of anything logical; I always categorize it as some supernatural event. It's ridiculous, I know. It's just how I am, it is how I have always been, and this is what keeps me coming back to these types of movies. In a weird obstinate way, I like to be creeped out.Carrying on, the story in "PA2" takes place just mere months before the first film, and follows Katie's sister, Kristi, and her family. She and her husband (whom has a teenage daughter from a previous marriage) have recently had a baby and moved into a new house. They also have a German shepherd named Abby, who sleeps in the baby's room every night right next to the crib (there is no importance to me bringing this up, other than it reminding me of our dog watching over our daughter). Early on, from a day out, they arrive to their home in complete shambles, almost every room. Immediately thinking it was a break-in, the husband has cameras installed throughout - as well as around the exterior of - the house. Things simmer down for awhile; but just like the first film, the happenings start out small, usually when someone is alone, and ultimately build up to chaos.As I mentioned, "PA2" is just not as effective as its predecessor is, how it coincides is what makes it enjoyable. The acting is perfect for what it has to be with everyone involved. It is also hardly noticeable that a different director was behind the camera. The way the characters of Micah and Katie from the first movie weave in and out of the story is really smart and eerie. It's eerie because you already know somewhat of their outcome in all of this. For me it was above average, but I am a sucker for mockumentaries. If you are not into that stuff, or if you are someone that just HAS to see what or who the evil is at all times, AVOID.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, i wasn't sure what to expect. After seeing the first movie i was hoping that this one would bring some more tension instead of the spare moments that we had in the first Paranormal Activity.Despite more cameras and different angles i had a feeling that it didn't create as much tension as a hand held camera. It felt like you had way more overview and could see everything better. Of course there are the usual door slamming and that kind of stuff but the first 40-50 minutes nothing really exciting happens.After those minutes of just waiting for something to happen the daughter gets the hand held camera and just goes walking around with it which increases the tension drastically.The basement scene is actually a little bit of a rip off from REC 2 in my opinion with a little flair of The Blair Witch Project. This scene was perhaps one of the worst in the movie. It had much potential but didn't really feel right which was really disappointing.All in all this movie had some tension and some good scares but nothing really special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch only if a fan of the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of horror movies and was genuinely surprised by the first one. Paranormal Activity has the premise that a family is being haunted and the husband then begins to record these strange happenings in home movie style, which helped to keep the budget. However, since one main character dies in the first and the other disappeared this movie had to pick up at the beginning, before the first one ever started. This time line seems a little complex and the film maker tries to make it easier by putting day numbers and relating it to the time line of other events. This movie unlike the first begins to show strange happenings during the day as well, I suspect because they had ran out of "scary" night images in the first movie. The movies climax was indeed the best part, five minutes of non stop scary action but it takes an hour and a half to get there and the movie seems long and drawn out. Though the acting was not bad, there is little acting besides that of screams at night. The ending also was left open this time, unlike the first in order to film a third movie. If a fan of the first i would recommend watching the second. If the first did not do it for you then the sequel will not either.</fullReview>

It's Paranormal Activity time again". The king is dead ... long live the King.But enough of that and onto the movie. If you loved the first one, who am I to tell you, not to go see this one. If you had your doubts about the first one, I wonder why you are as crazy as me and are (even) thinking about watching the second one. But I had to, just to see what they were going to do with it. And I will watch Part 3 too. Though I will not understand the hype, it is a bit more effective this time around. The characters are not as despicable as in the first one and you might care about what happens to them.Then again, logic goes out the window (or door or any other opening it does find) as fast a ghost might or might not appear. The biggest scares still are the screaming people around you. The hysteria that might get to you ... even if you don't want to ... I would not be surprised if someone dies of a heart attack, just because the person next to them were screaming that loud ... But then again, that's just me saying ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A jumpy 90 minutes?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though it is set to be a low budget film, it had high expectations if it was to out-do the first Paranormal Activity. So just how hard was it to out-do the biggest physiological horror film to ever exist. I think Paranormal Activity 2 just proves how hard it really was because the sequel was some what disappointing. My first advice would be don't watch this until you watch the first one and after you do watch the first one...Don't sleep alone! What was most disappointing about this sequel is that the scare factor had decreased, there is no physiological effect, nothing to make you sleep with one eye open, after watching the first one i couldn't sleep for 4 months and I'm sure neither could everyone else in the cinema, the difference? During Paranormal Activity 2, most of the audience could'nt stop laughing, not at the movie, but the humour content? Bring in a new director the pressures on, Todd Williams could not exceed Oren Peli's 'paranormal' horror. I believe the director tried to hard to make paranormal 2, they forgot about the physiology behind the paranormal saga and just left it to a jumpy, banging, clashing film (just like any other typical horror movie) Had he kept in mind that the whole point of Paranormal Activity was too make another outstanding sequel that will leave people sleep less and jumping up at night at every little noise they hear. They completely lost the plot and went for a jumpy, sudden noises type of movie. It got consistent, boring and started to look like a cheaper version of the first one.However with that being said, it was mildly entertaining. It kept me awake and the plot was fresh and well written (unfortuanly the movie wasn't) more characters were introduced, a family this time which i thought was a really good idea. As much as i hate to admit it, it made me jump throughout the film (note that it wasn't supposed to though)I especially like how they slurred the first one into the storyline that was very unexpected (espeically the ending, woahh!) if you seen the first one you will know what i'm talking about.My final synopsis will be if you have seen the first one and liked it, then definitely watch this but don't be expecting something outstanding. I wouldn't really advice anyone to avoid it, i couldn't call it a waste of money, more like a missed opportunity. Maybe it's just me my expectations might of been a bit to high. It is entertaining, jumpy and ends with quite a twist. See it at your own pace, with an open mind!</fullReview>

This one falls back more on "gotcha" moments with abrupt sounds and doors slamming. I found it quite boring at some parts. If you're a person who gets scared easily you might find this a good thrill, but other than that, there is nothing great about this second installment.

		<shortDescription>better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised with the second installment of paranormal activity. There are many people who will not find this scary - probably due to their own inability to suspend disbelief and engage in the movie. This is very important because what the PA movies do is use the build up of suspense and play on your imagination in a way rarely seen in horror movies since "the Shining". What begins as subtle noises and movement of objects takes a slow escalation to the climax - this allows us to engage in the characters emotional journey - the initial scepticism and then the increasing realisation that something is wrong, and then fear. perhaps more frightening is the subtleties which one cannot fail to notice when going to bed after watching this movie - a slight movement of the door, a whispering in the wind, or a noise coming from the other room.This film is almost a prequel and sequel, where we follow the character of Kristi and her family who after an apparent break-in begin noticing unusual occurrences around the house. Kristi also happens to be the sister of Katie from the original movie. Katie appears throughout the film adding to the sense of impending doom as we wait to see when she will turn.This movie improves a lot on the original - which suffered from poor acting and its one-plot storyline. Here we are given more depth in story and characters, with better acting all round (including from the original cast)If you are a fan of supernatural horror movies you will enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am no paraprofessional movie critic, but I am going to haunt you again with another punabnormal review of another Paranormal Activity movie, which is of course the box office hit "Paranormal Activity 2". Oren Peli's mastermind horror budget bonanza of developing the premise of incorporating a docuhorror-reality formula in the paranormal franchise is ingenious to say the least. "Paranormal Activity 2" changes the demonic address to a San Diego family consisting of married couple Daniel &amp; Kristi, Ali (Daniel's teen daughter from a previous marriage), and Daniel &amp; Kristi's newborn baby weirdly enough named Hunter. Kristi also happens to be the sister of Katie, the female lead of the first "Paranormal Activity". Is there a ghostly connection between the narratives of the two films? I don't want to be a devil spoiler and will let you find out for yourself in your viewing activity of "Paranormal Activity 2". In this sequel, the family gets robbed at the beginning of the film, so therefore they install video surveillance cameras in every part of the house. The video cameras, as in the first movie, become the spirit in the sky and show the paranormalcy go crazy! There are many suspenseful scenes in the movie that will make your heart activity beat a little faster. And credit to Director Tod Williams for following the Peli scary pelicula vision and not deviating with ludicrous scenarios. Peli did not helm this one but served as Producer. The paranormal movies are not much of an acting showcase so it does not really warrant any commentary, positive or negative. And the same could be said of its screenplays. "Paranormal Activity 2" kept the spirit alive in scaring the heck out of viewers and that is what makes a horror flick a hit. So don't keep yourself in suspense anymore, let the devil inside you be your guide to take a peek at "Paranormal Activity 2". **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 2 has definitely raised the bar since the first one. It definitely makes you feel on edge and if you don't jump out your seat at least once, your not human.Sitting in the movie theatre watching everyone scream with excitement and start laughing was amazing. Some parts are predictable and you begin to lose interest with some slow moments but, they bring you right back into it and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The reason for this is because of how it was filmed, it tries to give you that realistic feel. For example, if you sit there and ask a ghost to do something, 9 times out of 10 nothing is going to happen so it's realistic in that aspect.I'm giving this movie an 8 out of 10 because of the great script and how much effort they went into making it possible. The ending for me was a bit disappointing but I'll let you be the judge :)</fullReview>

After leaving the cinema, I was literally shaking from head to foot with fear and excitement.The story is very well done because the story of the first movie develops much more in this one.The acting was great and the connection with the characters was very good. The only I didn't route for was the typical husband and dad who doesn't see the truth and tries to explain the happenings with a pathetic explanation, I'm pretty you get to feel this way about him anyway.The scare scenes were amazing. There a lot of the same scares from the first, for example the banging noises, which still made me jump. There are even some brand new scares in between. They still the same sort of effects from the first which is brilliant The ending climax is even better. The scares were terrifying and the tension rises to the highest limit. There is also much more to the ending. I will say no more This has been the best horror sequel I have seen since REC 2 because usually horror sequels are nowhere near as good as the first. I still struggle to think of which Paranormal I prefer. I'm even going to see this again soon.If you are a horror fan, I highly recommend you give this film a go. I would watch the first one first and then this one</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Paranormal Activty movie, only costing $11,000 to make was pretty good! But how did they spend $3,000,000 for the second movie, i don't know! Most of the money i estimate was spent on buying the house but other than that Paranormal Activity was just more doors moving and things falling off shelves, with the addition of a FRIKEN FLOATING BABY WITH THE POWER TO SCALE A BABY COT ON IT'S BACK!! Don't get me wrong, bricks where shat when i watched this movie, but i don't think it was as scary as the first movie. But i do like the idea that the 2 movies link together and at the end of Paranormal Activity 2. You might as well watch the first movie, first then watch the second because it would be one story line, almost like Part 1 and Part 2.The thing which confuses me is that when Dan (Dad) watches the security footage of Kristie (Mum) being dragged down the stairs violently by some invisible force, he calls Martine (The Family Housekeeper which Dan fired at the beginning of the film because she was setting fires to scare of "Bad Spirits") to help sort out the problem. There plan is to pass the bad demon curse onto Katie. (Kristie's Sister) What i don't understand is that why would you pass the spirit onto someone else? Wouldn't you want to eliminate the problem? To be honest, those where the only criticism's i had with the movie :P</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS, DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM!** This is my first review, so bear with me! Never felt inclined to post before, but having seen the film for the first time last night, and after reading some of the reviews today, I couldn't help myself! Firstly, I'm a fan of the first film, no doubt about that. It had just the right balance of jumpy moments, ever-increasing dread, horrific scenes and sufficient 'fear of the unknown' to make it a perfectly pitched horror film. I enjoyed it at the time, and it was only on the 2nd or 3rd night after seeing it that it started playing on my mind at bed-time! I was so pleased to see that this film wasn't just a similar series of events happening to an unrelated family/household, with Katie making a token appearance at the end. It was genuinely exciting for me that we instantly find out from the caption at the start that we're watching a related story, and little bits of background kept getting introduced which fleshed out the overall story very well, and actually quite cleverly. The way this film sets up, and runs parallel to, the events of #1 is brilliant.The main aspect of the film, and other reviews I've seen, which I wanted to pick up on was the notion that 'nothing happens in the first hour'. I totally disagree! The multiple scenes where 'nothing happens' in the early nights of the story served to build the tension to a point where it almost became unbearable. Not to mention the fact that actually, lots of little things ARE happening throughout; they don't have to be scary in of themselves in order to increase the overall feel of fear for the audience.There's nothing scarier as a viewer than waiting for something to happen, but not knowing when it's coming or what it's going to be. Yes, we obviously have a good idea of the sorts of things the demon is capable of, because we've already seen the exact same demon in action in the first film. That doesn't detract from it though, because we're in a different setting with different people, and a very, very different atmosphere to the house. This was for me one of the most satisfying aspects, the atmosphere. It made it still feel fresh and exciting.****BIG SPOILER**** It probably shouldn't have, but the ending completely took me by surprise. I thought it would be a handover to the first film and that would be that. After all, an exorcism/transfer is a pretty weighty conclusion to a film like this! The fact that we then get one more night at the sister's house is fantastic, and that initial sight of Katie stood behind the Father character will stay with me! For me, I think that should be it with these films. If not, then it needs to either be a completely new family/scenario, or some sort of prequel-prequel, showing what happened to the girls when they were young. It's actually a scarier prospect to think of demon taking Hunter down to hell or wherever it is demons take their prized souls, than have him re-emerge as some sort of Damien character. That would presumably mean taking Katie's body with it, or leaving it behind, alive or dead.Anyway, enough of my theories! Just to reemphasise, this is a great film from start to finish, and a more than worthy sequel. If there are to be more films, I really hope they don't mess up a brilliant premise and story thus far!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Turned out much better than i expected... PA 2 rocks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler free review: Okay so i kept an open mind going into this for reasons i will list in my "spoiler review". I was afraid PA2 wouldn't work and i wouldn't like it as much as part 1 or i didn't know if i would like it at all but this movie kicked serious a$$! I loved PA1 and i am really happy i liked 2. I don't know if i can even call this a complaint but this movie did take a lot longer to get started. The first one took maybe 15 minutes until it picked up the pace... part 2 took about maybe 25 minutes, it was a good built but i was afraid the movie would turn into some crappy rip-off sequel but it turned out scary and fun. It gets really tense. If you liked part 1 you will likely dig this one but remember that the built in this movie is slower. One thing i would want to take back is watching all the clips, trailers, reading interviews, ETC. because that isn't the way to see it. If you didn't like part one you probably won't enjoy 2...***************SPOILER WARNING******************************************SPOILER REVIEW: One of the things that got me "iffy" about this "sequel" is the casting. Bringing back Micha (?spelling?) and Katie confused the hell out of me but when i heard about it i guess i was not smart enough to figure out it may be a prequel/sequel type deal. Like i said a bunch of times already i worried how they would pull this off but they did an amazing, careful job of keeping it consistent with the first one. Everything fit perfectly. I liked part 1 better because 1 had more humor and i related more to the characters (because their less of them) but luckily the characters in this movie weren't annoying and had good acting. This is probably about as scary as the first, its more tense though because the baby is involved. I love the fact that they didn't disown part 1 and the characters, they made it fit! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid, scary and worthy film for Halloween</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's astounding how much punishment Paranormal Activity 2 has already received from critics, audiences and practically everyone since its release on Oct. 22. And yet for all the detractors, it's a very solid, scary film and an excellent entry in the horror- thriller genre, too often dominated by torture porn. The film depends on a steadily-building sense of dread, of terror about what's going to happen next as this family endures the haunting of a malevolent presence. True, we never see the actual presence -- or when we do, it manifests itself in mundane things, such as toys and household objects. But doesn't that make it that much scarier? Our minds are better at scaring us with possibilities than what we see will ever do. It's the thought of the monster in the closet that terrified us as children even though we never saw it...The plot line of the film is like the original film: A family with a young child are startled to find their home ransacked one day upon returning home. To prevent further break-ins they install a camera system to monitor what's going on. We see the remainder of the film through the use of these cameras, some hand-held shaky-cams and even a night-vision view that spooky reminds one of Silence of The Lambs. Things definitely go bump-in-the-night inside the home -- some are mundane, such as a pool vacuum that finds itself outside the pool each morning. While others are not ? doors opening and closing on their own, pots that fall, scaring the characters and audience alike. And then there's the dragging scenes... which aren't a spoiler because they're in the trailer! While the sequel does not build up the same tension as was generated in the first film, there's definitely a building sense of dread as we see what's going on, but the family often does not. The bark of the family's dog at an invisible presence, the terrified and confused look on a toddler's face, these are where the real bone-chilling fear from this film generates. It's also quite ingenious how both films are intertwined and, I feel, one could cut-and-paste both versions together into a three-hour film that would be high-tensioned and enjoyable. There are some short-comings to PA2. As hinted at before, the tension build up is definitely lower-key than the first film, in part because director Todd Williams inserts humour and a certain degree of 'gotcha!' moments to shock the audience, which generate screams and then laughter. Some scenes are definitely repetitive -- such as the pool vacuum sequences. While others seem to have no purpose ? SPOILER ALERT **When the toddler escapes from the crib, it wanders into the basement, yet there is no payoff, no results from this encounter. When we see him next, he's back in his crib** ALERT ENDSBut overall, it's a better visual, visceral and spine-tingling experience than most supposedly scary films this year. This film has more terror in one scene than the entire Saw franchise can claim. Many of the so-called thrillers of today are merely disgusting or filled with gore, like I Spit On Your Grave. True, it's not Hitchcock, and there have been better films made, but the franchise has already created more scares than decades worth of horror-thrillers. Not since Silence of the Lambs and The Exorcist have audiences found a movie that is better at playing on our deepest fears -- that of the unknown, the unseen, and seemingly unstoppable malevolent forces. Regardless of what you might think, Paranormal Activity is now a phenomenon. The first film is the most-profitable in film history and the second cost $1.2 million to make and grossed $40 million its first weekend. Can there be any doubt a PA 3 is in store? I for one won't mind that reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't let the first film down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paranormal activity 2 keeps the conventions of the first film and does nothing to expand it. When watching with, i couldn't help but imagine that PA will be released yearly until viewers finally become bored of the lock off camera scares. PA2 is a worthy film and can be argued that it trumps the original in the fright apartment. But where it doesn't succeeds is in the suspense section. The cameras that are placed around the house enables you to nosey in five different rooms. At times you are on the edge of your seat but mostly, you become bored of watching nothing unfolding. The first few nights show little and when things do happen, its not as frightening or grabbing as the first film. Saying this, there are a several scenes which reminds you why the first film was a success. But i just felt the large home was captivating. Compare it to the first where the camera was guarding the edge of Katie's and Micah's bed. You weren't allowed to see what was happening in the void hallway. It forced one to use his imagination. Paranormal activity 2 on the other hand was like watching a ghost video on youtube. One thing i didn't like was how the poltergeist would suddenly stop moving things when someone walked inside the room,as if he was being sneaky about the whole affair.One major negative for me is the last act. The same is said for the first film. After watching an hour of spooky happening, the stuff you read of in real life encounters, the film suddenly turns into some low budget B movie. The face of the woman becoming warped, bodies go flying into the camera. I don't think it suits the overall effect of the film but that it, this is a film and dramatic measures are going to be taken up to make sure the conclusion is successful. Overall, Paranormal activity 2 doesn't disappoint and many will prefer this than the first. If you watched the first then this one won't be as terrifying. Another note i want to get across is that Micah was probably the worst boyfriend in the world in the history of cinema in the first film. Well in PA2, i think we've found the worst father in the history of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>would they put a "child-resistant" knob collar on a door knob that uses a lever handle.Oh, yeah...back to the movie. Compared to the first movie, this is a bit over-done. The father is unbelievably obtuse in this one, as well as over-reacting to relatively normal situations. The director cheats on many camera angles, choosing a close-up when the security video system couldn't have provided that type of shot. (Check the Ouija board scene with the boy friend.) And (worst of all) all the women wear bras when they sleep. This was also a flaw in the first film. If you want to convince us that this is actual video shot in real-life, you have to pay attention to the details, you know. When real people get up from sleeping, their hair looks a mess and they are dressed like they sleep. I know this seems like a minor issue, but I think that the director is otherwise trying for verisimilitude.Other than that, this is basically the same plot as the first film. It's not really worth a viewing if you've seen the first one.</fullReview>

The one reason and only I'm writing this review was the fact I could not stand the nagging reviews given in here. Seriously,the sequels do not have to suck all the time,grow some originality people,and by the way innovating how they did in a cam format movie like this is some originality. And yes I do know some people are still going to think this movie sucks and all that,but here goes a tip,try comparing the movies before rating them like the worst ones ever done.And oh yeah for that try watching some and by that I mean all the "top rated" maybe then you guys will brighten up an idea. Anyhow the movie has a very well built-in tension,gets the closer you can from reality(the cam recording way) but still has some predictable parts(something kinda hard to avoid because of the great amount of horror movies made till today ;D).

		<shortDescription>Every bit as nerve-wracking and terrifying as the original in exactly the same low-key and insidious fashion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a fair warning for those who haven't seen the first movie- "Paranormal Activity 2" isn't your typical Hollywood horror movie. Sure it does have the occasional loud noises and "jump-scares", but by and large, this sequel sticks faithfully to the origins of its predecessor in keeping its chills low-key and unpretentious. Despite the runaway success of the original, the producers have wisely opted to film this sequel in the same low-budget fashion- and the result is an equally, if not more, terrifying experience that fans of the original will lap right up.See chief among the reasons why many were left shaken by the first movie was how it deftly played on the fears of the dark, especially in the comfort (or should I say, discomfort) of one's home. If you as a kid had ever been afraid of turning off the lights at night, you'll know what I mean. When all is black around you, somehow your senses get heightened and you pay attention to every groan or creak around the house. You'd also become more alert to presence- think of it as the feeling of how you know before someone comes up to you.Those are the fears that "Paranormal Activity 2"- like the original- continues to play on. The setting here is a different house- its occupants Frank and Catherine, Frank's teenage daughter from his first marriage and the couple's newborn son Hunter (played oh so adorably by Sprague Grayden from TV's Jericho). Not long after they bring Hunter home, the entire house is turned inside out. Though nothing is taken, the couple decide to install CCTVs around the house as a precaution.This plot device is a nifty excuse to introduce different camera angles into the final reel, so that director Tod Williams doesn't just have the hand-held or the tripod mounted video cam to play around with. It also allows him to build the suspense more creatively, seeing as how he now has six different views inside and around the house to establish the looming threat. That he does expertly, using the same pattern of shots to first set up the stillness of the house at night, gradually disrupting that pattern with a shadow, a movement, a sound and then more. That deliberate build-up also means there are times where nothing happens, where we are forced to look and observe the presence of something around.While it may have been tempting for writer Michael Perry to simply start from scratch and construct his own story, it is to his credit that he has intelligently crafted a story that fits right into the events of the first film. To say anything more would probably spoil the surprise for some, suffice to say that the original's two characters- Kate and Micah- do make appearances in this movie. This sequel also offers insight into what happened in the original- Who or what exactly is haunting them? What does it want? What becomes of Kate after the end of the first movie?- and those who have seen part one will admire how this sequel ties in perfectly.But also because it follows so keenly in the spirit of the original, "Paranormal Activity 2" is bound to have its fair share of detractors. Indeed, the mixed reaction of the audience when the lights came on at the end of the screening was the exact same mixed reaction this reviewer had witnessed at the end of the first film. The "Paranormal Activity" films were never meant to be Hollywood factory-made horror fare- instead, they were low-key and low-budget affairs that played on our basic fears of the dark and the unknown within the confines of our homes, a place that for most of us represents shelter, safety and security.So you'd do well to remember that is the experience "Paranormal Activity" wants to be- and if you get home after the movie and start feeling your heart beat faster whenever you hear a groan, a creak or some other random noise in your house at night, you'd know how insidious the effect of "Paranormal Activity" is. Fans take note, this sequel is every bit the same disturbing and quietly terrifying movie you loved in the original.- www.moviexclusive.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranormal Activity 2 maintains the essence that it brought one year ago and offers the same scary but yet enjoyable entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film falls under the category of Physiological Horror. While avoiding any type of excessive blood and overly done dramatized scenes, these type of films (mainly referring to Paranormal Activity) will set a camera down and fast-forward through the night, maybe go to normal play for a minute, nothing will happen, keep fast forwarding go to a minute, nothing happens, keeps going, and then goes to normal in still in all complete silence, a door slams. These types of films can bring anyone on the edge of their seats and have revived us from the mainstream horror category. Although in my opinion, something like "Paranormal Activity" is something that really can only happen once. There isn't, and obviously shouldn't be anything new. This is another go around that moviegoers are going to take which are going to involve the same fun scares, just in different situations and environments. To my surprise, this film manages to maintain that low key course and avoids over doing it. Although, the biggest disappointment, for me at least, was as it built tension, it just wasn't the same as the original. There are still little things happening randomly like the last that built tension but overall, it doesn't truly get terrifying until it reaches the 60 minute mark and it uses the rest of the time (about 25 minutes) to unleash for its climax, which was unlike its predecessor which slowly built more on the creepiness but could hold the same fear throughout the film.In respects, some could say the original is better, or that the sequel was better. This sequel/prequel acknowledged the expectations that were given to them, and came up and gave a good comparison to the original. For me, I would give the original more of an edge, but this film shouldn't be looked down upon, and it should definitely meet expectations. For this time around, Paranormal Activity 2 maintains the essence that it brought one year ago, offers the same scary but yet enjoyable entertainment, and connects these two stories in a very chilling way.I give it a BCritics Average: C Critics Liking Percentage: 67%</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Demoniac "Found Footage" in Paranormal Activity 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It might seem that the conceit -- or less charitably, "gimmick" -- initiated by The Blair Witch Project of structuring a film around "found footage" would have run its course, exhausted by other films like Cloverfield and The Last Exorcism, but after so many successful utilizations, it may not be a transient fad but a permanent new technique in storytelling. With the proliferation of digital video devices, it's not only logical, but offers new narrative opportunities never before possible, with the caveat that, so far, those opportunities have been primarily in the horror genre.Besides Blair Witch itself, one of the best practitioners of this new technique was 2009's Paranormal Activity, which delighted Paramount Pictures by returning $107 million on a $15,000 investment, making it statistically one of the most successful films of all time, so there's no surprise that they'd want a sequel.I've got to admit I was a bit confused when, after a nicely structured introduction to a brand new family, suddenly there's Katie Featherston, beleaguered star/victim of the first film, apparently as the selfsame "Katie." But at the end of the last movie, wasn't she -- well, that would be telling. Anyway, it took me a minute to realize that she's indeed continuing the same characterization, and what we're seeing is not necessarily a prequel, but something that occurs contemporary with the events of the first film, involving Katie's sister Kristi, Kristi's husband Daniel, step-daughter Ali, and infant son Hunter. The larger nuclear family nicely opens up the dynamic, as we realize that whatever was torturing Katie in the original was doing similar things to her sister, and seems to be after Hunter.In addition to more characters offering more possibilities, there's another new wrinkle. Instead of Katie's boyfriend Micah setting up a single camera to catch unexplained events, Kristi and Daniel have a multi-camera security system, allowing us to see different perspectives around the house, plus teenaged Ali, the first to be become convinced of the presence, totes around Dad's new hi-def handicam. Like the original, you don't ever really see anything; in fact, maybe not as much. Doesn't mean you won't jump out of your seat when...but that, too, would be telling.The film delivers its required shocks efficiently, but there are, of course, things that bother me. You may recall that Katie's victimization in the original seemed tied to events of her past; now we learn that her sister shared in those experiences too, which prompts step-daughter Ali to try and "figure it all out." I do not for one second believe in ANY paranormal nonsense (so I readily identify with Daniel's dogged skepticism), but if I did, I'd suspect that it would be something beyond human comprehension, thus the film goes too far in attempting to explain itself. Second, skeptic that I am, if my family and dog were convinced these things were happening, I'd get them the hell out of the house, but then there'd be no movie.Even with its contrived explanations and lacking the novelty and elegant simplicity of the original, Paranormal Activity 2 delivers the Halloween fright it promises. You know Katie'll be back again, don't you?</fullReview>

Never the less i really enjoyed it and did what it was suppose to, be scary. The acting performances, just like the first one were great and the fact that a whole family instead of a couple was living in the same house didn't made is less scary. This is a movie that you rather like or don't enjoy at all. I really hope and looking forward to part three but i have no idea how they will make that work to live up to it's former potential.

		<shortDescription>Some flawed logic and less scares this time around.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with sequels is always that you expect more than the first one, you expect bigger, better, faster, more. You figure the first time around was the learning and experimenting, the second time around is the good stuff.Experimenting almost always works out better.The movie opens much like the first, with a car being pulled up into a drive way. This time, the car is carrying a baby boy named Hunter and his parents, being filmed by their daughter. Through the course of events, we are rather subtly told that this couple have been married before, or at least the dad (Dan) has, and the grown daughter (Alli) is his child from a previous marriage, making his wife (Kristi) now her step mother, and Hunter her step brother.Of course, much like the first, this family is pretty well off, living in a rather sizeable house, with a pool in the backyard, a nanny (Martine) and a dog (Abby) We are then shown that Kristi is actually the sister of Katie, from the first movie, and these events are happening prior to Paranormal Activity. Both Katie and her twit boyfriend Micah make appearances in this.One day, we are shown the house has been trashed, tables have been turned over, pots/pans have been thrown on the ground, paintings have been thrown to the floor, general messiness and chaos....except for Hunters room and the basement. Nothing is missing, save for a necklace Katie gave to Kristi at some point (the first of the flawed logic, as from this point on, everyone continuously says that ~nothing~ was taken, and the necklace is never mentioned again) At this point, the family decides to install cameras throughout the house, 5 if I recall correctly, one in the kitchen, living room, main hallway, outside at the pool, and Hunters room. Much of what happens is then shown through these cameras, although periodically people do use hand helds.This is where the movie falls down. Unlike the first, where it was localized to one room, there are 5 locations constantly changing through each and every night, and for a ~very~ long time, nothing remotely interesting happens (a pool cleaner machine keeps being out of the pool each morning, but we are not shown how for quite some time) Instead, the build up is ~much~ slower this time around, and frankly, less scary. Whereas in the first, there was no actual location the so called demon came from, it just appeared downstairs somewhere and kept coming up to their room, this one sets out that it's in the basement, so anytime it really shows up, it's ~always~ in the same place.And whereas the first built up and gradually got worse and worse, this varies in what happens. One night it can be just a sound, or a door closing and locking the daughter out, another night it's footsteps going up to Hunters room and Hunter being slowly pulled up and out of the crib, then left to wander the house on his own (somehow making it back to the crib by himself), but nothing overly BAM, right in your face until very far into the movie.My main gripe is the ambiance. Whereas the first built and built constantly, this weaves back and forth through everything is all right, to it's not, to it is, to it's not, again and again. It constantly shatters the ambiance, which is not good.Furthermore, in the first, there was not always that faint rumbling to cue that something was about to happen. Things just happened, especially when they started to occur during the day. This time, there is ALWAYS that rumbling, it ALWAYS warns you when something is about to happen, save for one scene late in the movie.While it does have scares, it also has flawed logic. The cameras are all set up to one main computer, where they can watch the footage at any point they want. Only twice do any of them do this, Alli after the front door slams and locks her out one night, and to see how the pool cleaner gets out every night. However (MAJOR SPOILER ALERT) When the dog is attacked and you hear that it was seizure like symptoms, AND when the wife is attacked and 'possessed' and drastically changes her personality, SOMEONE would check the footage from the night before. But they don't. And then the movie does something very stupid....when there is hand cam footage taken of Kristi, they omit what happens between her and Alli in Hunters room. All we see is a few hours later, Alli calling her dad to get home right away, crying hysterically, and then yelling at him to watch the tape from the cam. It is NEVER shown what happens, and it's never explained, they just automatically jump to "somethings wrong with Kristi" So a wee bit of flawed logic, less scares, and a LOT more talking about nothing really, choppy ambiance and atmosphere that constantly changes from good to bad to good. As a whole, it doesn't work as well, and it's not better. It's like the dumbed down "american" version sadly.However....it does combine both movies and give fairly good explanation to why this is happening (though you might miss it from boredom) and also serves as a short sequel to the first movie at the very end. Unfortunately, the ending is not anywhere near as spine tingling as the first, and just....ends.Fortunately, this is already doing well enough that they will likely green light a third one. I would seriously suggest they let the guy who made the first make that, as he's much better at it, and go back to simplistic tactics and don't try to take on so much....or if they do, use better cameras!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not a huge fan of the first film but I was happy to see the film-makers stay with the same look and tone of that film as opposed to going the Blair Witch route which was a disaster.I think they were also wise to keep the scares to a minimum so we were not over-loaded with CG that would have ruined the movie.Believe it or not it was actually an ad for some lifetime film (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyQhXUKD85Q) that my sister sent to me that prompted me to see PA2.Weird, I know, but I think it reminded me of how much i like being scared.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got back from the midnight showing. I'm not sure what to vote on it. The first movie could've done without this one, I was hoping for a new method of scares instead of the same ones over and over again (bangs, creaks, etc). Too much happened in a short amount of time and it wasn't as "realistic" as it could be when it came to the resources and options these people had. If I had a security system installed in my home and weird s**t was happening I'd look over the video.. There were red flags here and there and the father was nonchalant about everything. I've got to admit that I am a fan only because I believe in these type of things and I haven't seen a movie franchise made like this before. Totally different experience. Anyway, how was your movie experience like?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranormal 2 Has It's Share of Scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see Paranormal Activity 2 not expecting much just as I did with the first. It is not as good as the first but it still has it's moments of jump scenes. Two scenes in particular will startle you when you least expect it. This time around the movie takes place in Katie's sisters house. Her sister Kristy experiences the same kind of weirdness that Katie did at her house. A pan falls from the hanger by itself in the kitchen. A door moves by itself and another time a door slams shut. It is rather slow at first but gradually gets better as it goes along. Kristy's daughter also experiences strange things going on but the father does not believe in all the supernatural happenings. They install security cameras all around the house after they think the house is being burglarized. They soon find out of course that it is not burglars but something very sinister that is in the house because it wants something. And that something may just be what is very precious to the family..the baby..Hunter. Also returning in part 2 are Katie and Micha because I'm sure by now everyone must know that part 2 is actually a prequel. I won't say much more than that but the writer's did a decent job with the story by including these two characters from the first movie. The family also has a German shepherd who constantly barks because he too senses something evil in the house. There is a scene in the movie when the dog is barking and all of a sudden..let's just say it is creepy what happens. I'm sure there will be a part 3 in the near future. Maybe even next year. I just hope it isn't dragged out too much like Saw and Friday the 13th. Maybe one more will be fine. People seem to have a good time getting scared by this sort of psych movie and I do too. Just as long as it doesn't wear out it's welcome like the entity or demon in the house.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's definitely an 'edge of your seat' movie.. much, much better than the first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a lot of people saying this movie 'sucks' or 'lacks any quality', the bottom line is that this movie is scary.. very scary.. It plays with your mind over and over and exponentially gets better over time. I saw the first movie in theaters and, while it was scary, the only scene that I can honestly say made me jump was the final scene. In this movie, however, there were a LOT more moments that make you jump out of your seat and have the 'wind knocked out of you'.I thought people who said they saw people leaving the theater because it was so scary were exaggerating, but two girls literally up and ran out of the theater only to return ten minutes later when I saw this last night. If you haven't seen the first movie, definitely see it before seeing this. There are some tie-ins between the movies that you won't understand without having seen the first Paranormal Activity!In short, the movie does its job: it scares the living hell out of you and makes your mind twist wondering what's happening. At the end, a lot of things come together so pay attention for the full duration of the movie! Don't miss anything, even little subtle things mentioned. It's all in there for a reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first ... (just not for Saw XII lovers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's only been done before.But to always simply say that a sequel is per definition less than pt1, just because of the "original idea/concept-value" of the first, is ignorant and not true... Proved by the release of this 'pre-sequal'!Off course, 99,9% of the time, an original idea/concept get's milked, gutted, brutalized and/or raped out of context. Just not this one!It remains true to the original concept (the use of only stationary and hand-held cams and taking time for development), and the story-based parallels with pt.1 (incl. Katie), simply adds up to the sheer intensity and build up suspense of this one.IMHO only people who think just "torture-porn" and slasher films (with a killcount over 10, that is) justify/deserve the term horror or scary movie, will obviously bash this film as being dull or "slamming door movie pt2"... It's just far from it.My guess, simply because they don;t get it. They either don't understand suspense (and therefore are emotionally challenged), or are feeling shame (the brawly tough guys they are) for having an uneased feeling (or maybe even being scared for a moment).Don't listen to those folk. If you liked part 1, you will love part two!!! Sequels are practically always bigger, louder, etc, etc. (by the unwritten law of film) and this one does so by using more camera's and having more characters (incl. a baby and dog). That's it.An instant classic, with one of the biggest shock-moment of the decade.(...Hopefully they don't get overboard, should they decide to make pt. 3)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but had some decent scares.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night, i watched the follow-up to last years' horror hit, Paranormal Activity with a couple of my mates. After thinking that their house was broken into, a family sets up security cameras in various areas inside and outside their house so they can view what is happening while they sleep. Just like in the first, they experience things that cannot be explained.The acting was quite good, by everyone, no one really stood out for me. I like how the father thinks that there's nothing wrong, although he does seem smart and one who isn't afraid. The mother could've been a lesser afraid character, not just one who runs around screaming when all her pantry doors open unexpectedly (even though that's what I'd do). I would've liked to seen a lot more of Martine, she seemed like an important character at the beginning but didn't have much impact in the end, but it's pretty obvious that they never should've gotten rid of her.The first half felt dull and repetitive, but the movie showed a lot more in the second, resulting in an all-out fright fest. The ending felt disappointingly lazy, as Katie could've used a much more creative way of killing the husband, rather than just snapping his neck. (e.g: the husband has a wound gushing out of his torso and then Katie appears with a knife stabbing him). Overall a decent fright fest with one scare in particular that will leave you hating complete silence when your on your own in the middle of the day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Top-Notch Sequel That Delivers More Than The Original!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rare is the sequel that surpasses the original. "Paranormal Activity 2" is far more sophisticated and subtle than "Paranormal Activity." Indeed, this is the kind of sequel that should satisfy fans because the filmmakers duplicate the home video camera plot of the original and then supplement it with CCTV surveillance camera footage. Mind you, only audiences that experienced the original will appreciate the way the ambitious sequel seamlessly dovetails the first film into its elaborate storyline. Moreover, "Paranormal Activity 2" qualifies as a prequel to "Paranormal Activity" because Katie Featherston, cast as the frightened wife in the original, visits her younger sister Kristi at her affluent middle class home. Eventually, Katie enables them confront their fears about demonic possession without anxiety. Unlike Katie, Kristi has a husband, teenage daughter, toddler, a German shepherd and a Hispanic maid. Like Katie, Kristi and her family find themselves and their sanity imperiled as they tangle with a demon in a house decked out with closed-circuit security cameras.The filmmakers show us everything that we need to see to make their melodrama more believable. "Paranormal Activity 2" is shot like a television reality show. Furthermore, "Paranormal Activity 2" raises the stakes with a toddler-in-jeopardy subplot as much as a family-at-risk. "Adventures of Sebastian Cole" director Tod Williams takes his own sweet time setting everything up, from a home video tour of the house at the start, to the monstrous acts occur in the last scenes, but it is time well spent. Often, Williams and television writer Michael R. Perry, "Blood and Chocolate" scenarist Christopher B. Landon, and newcomer Tom Pabst pretend like they are going to unleash something horrible, but they never deliver when you expect them. Eventually, the subtle quality of their approach that permeates the first 80 minutes or more ends in a sudden lapse of subtlety during the final few minutes that confirms our worst fears about the original "Paranormal Activity." "Paranormal Activity 2" opens with the Rey family, Kristi (Sprague Grayden of the TV series "Jericho"), her husband, Daniel (Brian Boland of "The Express"), their teenage daughter Ali (Molly Ephraim of "College Road Trip"), infant child Hunter, his Hispanic nanny, Martine (Vivis Cortez of "Patch Adams"), and the family's loyal German shepherd, Abby, making a video of their new Carlsbad, California, home. Nothing is left out of the home tour so that we will be acquainted with the geography of the house. Not long afterward, while the family is away on vacation, something happens that startles the Reys when they return home. They discover vandals have trashed their beautiful abode. Miraculously, despite the widespread chaos that characterizes their house, nothing is missing. In other words, whoever vandalized them didn't take an item; they just left the place in a shambles.Daniel has a home surveillance system installed that covers virtually every square foot of their house, except for closet space. Initially, the Reys are clueless about what occurred. Nevertheless, Martine suspects an evil spirit and Abby knows something supernatural is lurking on the premises. Daniel and Kristi arrive home one evening after Martine experiences the demon. They catch their Hispanic housekeeper polluting the air with some horrendous incense and mumbling a chant. Daniel cannot stand the stench of the incense. Later, he discharges Martine with the promise of a good reference. It takes about an hour before wife Kristi witnesses odd things, like pots falling off hooks. "Maybe you didn't hang them up right," her skeptical husband suggests. When Kristi points out to Daniel that their goofy looking swimming pool cleaner starts out in the water the night before but winds up on the patio the next morning, he dismisses it as nothing. The next member of the household to experience the unseen demonic force is their toddler son Hunter. He knows something isn't right, too. This is about the time that Kristi's sister, Katie (Katie Featherston of "Paranormal Activity"), shows up and convinces Kristi to ignore these portentous omens. Nevertheless, things take a turn for the worst. Daniel and Kristi go out for a date night and leave Ali in charge. Things happen to Ali that prompt Daniel to contact his Mexican maid, but it is too late.Different kinds of horror movies deliver different kinds of scares. Like "Paranormal Activity," "Paranormal Activity 2" strives to be an "unhorror" movie. Call it 'diet horror.' Primarily, "Paranormal Activity 2" relies on sounds and our dread of the unknown to generate goose bumps rather than gore. The second time the demon hits the kitchen is about as rough as it gets and that happens in a finger snap. More often than not the filmmakers are creating atmosphere and "Paranormal Activity" seethes with atmosphere. "Paranormal Activity 2" allows us, the audience, to pry into the life of a family and then watch as that same family slowly disintegrates. Ali spends her time on the Internet searching for information about demons. Director Tod Williams uses humor to off-set the usual genre scares. Ali and her flirtatious boyfriend play with a Ouija board while Daniel and Kristi are out. The boyfriend pulls a stunt on Ali while they are messing with the Ouija board. Afterward, he assures her he was in control the entire time. No sooner does this happen than the Ouija board delivers a message the boyfriend didn't conjure up. "Paranormal Activity 2" loosens the gale force of its ghoulishness in the last few minutes. There isn't a poor performance in this superbly paced film, even the canine and the child succeed in convincing us that they know they are in harm's way. Williams breeds a palpable sense of claustrophobia because most of the action occurs within the house. The ending removes any doubts about the demon's identity. Nevertheless, we still don't know enough about what happened to Kristi and Katie. Although the ending turns it into a conventional horror film, "Paranormal Activity 2" ranks as an above-average thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, Me and My Girlfriend went into this film with very high hopes and then for the first Hour we sat through random flashes between rooms and a few videos of the baby doing random stuff... all sounds good if it wasn't a Horror Movie. Towards the 1 hour mark i was getting really bored of the film and asked if we could leave but the ever persistent girlfriend of mine wanted to stay whether it was because of the fact we paid ?5.50 to see it or she was enjoying the rather boring film, i don't know. But that soon turned into a good idea, it started getting quite scary, bonus. Yeah so, there was some mild scary scenes including the parts where the shadow came up and then the part with the house shaking and everything going crazy but the scariest bits i think were the basement scene and maybe the part where she gets dragged down there, which my girlfriend seriously got scared at... hurting my arm with the squeezing loll but oh well..So to summarize it did turn out to be quite scary but the beginning kinda boringly dragged on and it could be shorter.. but overall 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nowhere near as good as the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is just my opinion and a few observations about this movie. I did love the first PA movie and was very excited to see the second. Between the previews and the hype, I had high hopes for this one.PA2 starts off well enough, but never really gets going. A lot of time is spent on shots of rooms where nothing happens. This is time that could have been spent on character development. This is a short film and way too much time was spent on 'empty' scenes. I didn't really care for the characters - the father was annoying and I found myself hoping he would become a victim. What really put a chink in this movie for me was the fact that it supposedly takes place in 2006. In one of the conversations, the father says 'release the Kraken', which is a line from Clash of the Titans. Now I know that the 2010 movie was a remake of the original in '81, but who was saying 'release the Kraken' before the remake? I'm a huge fan of the original and had never heard that line quoted until the remake in 2010. It may seem like a very small thing to focus on, but I thought it really brought down the credibility of the movie. It did for me anyway.I was never made to care for any of the characters and was kept strictly in observation mode of them, which made me apathetic to their plight. There was one scene an hour into the movie which made me jump, which is why I'm giving this movie 4 stars instead of 2. With the anticipated profits of this movie, they could have afforded better writing I would think. But then again, the budget of the first was minuscule and was brilliant. Yes, a little more 'action' happens in this movie, but the family reviews the footage only twice. And the footage they do review is relatively tame and dismissed by the father. The major things that you would expect them to want to review is never done and that element of fear is never really built up. I would have like to see them review footage of one of the scarier events and have them be frightened by it, this in turn would have frightened me. That concept worked very well in the first and was never repeated.This movie could really have been great, but fell flat. I'm truly disappointed with this prequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoilers* Okay so I was so excited to see this movie. What a let down. I mean it wasn't horrible but no where near as good as the first one. I thought the movie was boring for like the first hour. There weren't very many scary parts. Half the time you are waiting and watching on the screen for something to happen and nothing usually does. In this movie they use the noises more to scare you than the visual. The bad parts included staring at a pool for at least 10 mins of the movie. It uses the opening door and shadow parts like the first one. Other than that the climax is the like the best part. And its not worth it to sit there for an hour and half to see 2 or 3 good parts. I would say waiting for the DVD. It really does suck to be so excited to see the 2nd one because the 1st one was so good and to just walk out of the theatre saying yeah... it wasn't that great. I just have to say tho it wasn't that bad of a movie. At least they tried... It needed to be more creepy. By the way the baby in the road or whatever and the part where Katie is standing in the baby's room didn't make it to the actual film. Paranormal Activity is way better than Paranormal Activity 2 !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Me and my friend went to see this in the cinema today, since it was only a preview the cinema was packed! This I thought would make the experience more enjoyable... I was wrong.Literally through-out the whole film there were people screaming when one of the actors in the film would open the front door, it was jumpy but it was very off putting with people chewing, talking and even laughing at bits in the film, we're all entitled to our own opinion but it really ruined the experience... Just when everything falls silent you get ready for something and then the people behind you go "I'm scared" or "Oh my, look the DOOR IS OPENING", yes we can see for ourselves but shh! I suggest you see it in the cinema as the quality and visual impact of the film is terrifying, but perhaps at a later date when it is quieter and less crowded.The original created more of an impact because it was different, in this film we knew what to expect but that was covered up with a different storyline and a few extra jumpy moments.Superb acting in the film, it was too life-like in some cases that took away that cinematic effect making it all too weird and disturbing...I think the idea that not knowing what was going on a lot of the time was scarier... Not a miss for horror fans!</fullReview>

The father is a stubborn man, the new wife has some dark past, all end up in a big nothing. Not entertaining, not fun, not scary. After the first ten minutes I set my expectations low. I was wrong, it was below expectations. What really surprises me is that some people can finance movies like this. Well, it was in San Diego after all and they used static cameras.

You leave with an understanding of both movies, and the jump-out-of-your-seat moments in this film surpasses the first.Sure, the characters filming during scenes of high intensity seems unrealistic, but the acting isn't bad and the documentary style it's filmed in works perfectly.The pacing is perfect, building the anticipation and tension and then delivering at exactly the right moment.

		<fullReview>It's a wonder Paranormal Activity 2 didn't go direct to DVD, it's scare free script is truly bottom shelf at the video store stuff, the film barely deserves that credit, so forget about the hell it's distributors felt it was good enough for a cinema release, the end result is (I'm sad to say) a disappointing affair.This film fails on every single aspect: badly acted, badly predictable story, mismatched shock effects, no tension what so ever, and worst of all, a plot that blandly contradicts itself at various stages. OK, it's more of a drama than a horror film. And the ghosts aren't all that scary. But there's more going on here than just your average ghoul chase. You have real people with real flaws and yearnings that go beyond life and death. One of the most irritating things about this movie other than the acting, and lack of common sense the characters have the CGI o my goodness were they really serious like this looks just fine? What follows is an absolute disaster. The actors are not even interacting with one another. It is glaringly obvious that one actor was shot doing his or her part in front of a blue screen, then another, then another, then it was all layered together. None of the actors are even looking at one another because they are not there. This movie sucked, they didn't put a lot of work into this one and it shows. Full screen and grainy. It looks like hell.Grab on to this new wave while you still can, because soon this film will be a "classic" in its own right!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 2': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Highly anticipated prequel to the extremely profitable surprise horror hit 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY', from last year. I am not a big fan of the original film. I admire it's low budget creativity and blockbuster success but to me it's not that scary and full of somewhat cheap tricks and gimmick thrills. I thought the lead character Katie, played by Katie Featherston, was extremely annoying and I didn't think either her or her boyfriend Micah (played by Micah Sloat) were very likable or relate-able and I didn't really care what happened to them. This prequel has all of the same flaws and is really just more of the same thing. It adds nothing new to the series until the climax, which is the only good part of the whole movie.This second chapter focuses on a married couple, the husband's teenage daughter and their newborn baby Hunter. We learn early on that the wife is Katie's sister and the events of this film take place prior to the first film (Both Featherston and Sloat reprise their roles). After the house is ransacked in what appears to be a brake in the family has security cameras placed around the house. The movie is played out once again in a found footage narrative. They're of course haunted by a demon, as the couple was in the first film, and through the hidden camera footage we see the demon stalking the family in odd ways (like removing a pool cleaner from the swimming pool every night and shifting a door a foot or two back and forth).This second chapter is directed by Tod Williams and written by TV writer Michael R. Perry. They take over for Oren Peli, who was the writer / director of the first film, who this time serves as producer. The movie is once again excruciatingly slow paced and full of somewhat idiotic gimmicks. It does pay off in the somewhat creepy and suspenseful climax (plus a few shocks here and there) but it's extremely boring getting to it and once again the movie is full of unlikeable characters (especially the dad who I couldn't wait to see get killed off). The jokes are bad and the events of the film (like the first) make no sense. Why would a demon stalk a family for several weeks and then suddenly attack while only playing mind games up to that point like moving a door, dropping a pan or casting a shadow. Anyone could write a film like this and I don't really find the directing that clever either (once again). There are some nice little camera tricks considering the low budget but they're not worth building a whole feature length movie around. If you're a fan of the first film you'll probably be satisfied with this sequel, which like I said is just more of the same, but I expect much more from my horror films.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffxjYiwLUko</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this this afternoon and I have to say, I really loved it. I am one of those people who just goes into the theater and takes the movie as it comes. I absolutely love the slow build-up because it made the jumps even more intense. I think that I said "Holy S***" more than 5 times and actually gasped out loud several times. I know that people think that the self-filming is out, but I really enjoy it. I think that people who watch shows like Ghost Adventures and Ghost Hunters will actually really like this film. The idea of the unknown is absolutely the most terrifying thing and the ending of this movie was amazing. I did not see the transference coming and was completely shocked. Go see it - again, if you like ghost/demon videos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film just felt so forced. The story line intertwined with the first one which was not my problem, it was the prolonged build up which did not create tension but rather a dull bored thirst for some action. When the film finally did open up and all characters were aware of the demon it was a short lived sense of suspense.The idea in itself of a demon in a house haunting a family with demonic references and not just a simple ghost story personally fascinates me. This film on the other hand did not, iv found youtube videos of hauntings "freakier" than this film. Over all i felt like this was a major let down. Whilst trying to fully appreciate the style of a real life film with a more sensible form of a haunting i really did feel bored for the majority of the film.I would suggest to anyone out their who either is not scared easily or who is actually interested in cinematic quality to stay away from this film. A combination of house security tapes and hand held camera even with its particular style does not justify this film being cinema quality in my opinion. A waste of my ?9.</fullReview>

I purposely avoided trailers for this because I didn't want any of the story spoiled and I can safely say I wasn't disappointed. Top notch acting, especially the younger sister - I hope we see more of her on the big screen in future.The original is better but this is a class act too and some very spooky moments.One scare in particular is worth the ticket price alone.Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basically The Same thing all Over again, But Even Scarier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this was basically the same thing as the first movie, but i had to admit even though it felt like a rehash, it was scarier than the first.these are scary movies. i admire them not only for their ability to deliver satisfactory entertainment on a minimal and limited budget, but for the effortless way they create suspense and chills with little or no FX. the scares in these films are staged in a subtle and understated way without a thunderous music score or stagy camera angles. there isn't even a lot of ominous suggestion or build up. things just sort of quietly happen.i try not to believe in things like hauntings or poltergeist, but every now and then around 300 AM in the morning....this is a believable depiction of a haunting however, if you believe in this sort of thing. the movie 'Poltergiest' was overly melodramatic with lots of over the top, far out happenings. things here are more low key and plausible enough. there are even things that are supposedly typical of hauntings, objects being moved or misplaced, a teenager's presence in the house is also something considered to be common with these things.not a profound movie by any means. but it's probably a lot smarter than some audiences will give it credit for. it certainly was scary as all hell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went watching this movie thinking, oh great, they're making a sequel to a film, that is a one trick pony, they're just going to add a new family, it will have no connection to the first movie and be stupid.But i was proved wrong, as this movie isn't stupid, it is rather good. The acting is fine, nothing wrong with it. I liked (Brian Boland) as Daniel Rey. I thought he was superb. I loved that we got to see Katie and Micah again, that was so cool, i was literally saying 'Oh my god' when i saw them again. The directing was great, the writing was fine. The story was fantastic I'm so happy they followed it from the first one. Hopefully the Third one will be as good as these.They're a lot of frighting and intense scenes, sometimes i had to hold my hands over my eyes, or look away. Some parts just really scared me.The ending, was really shocking, and i was just really not expecting it, It just came out of no-where and i was literally saying 'WOW!' I'm not going to spoil anything, just watch it, Its great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranormal Activity 2 didn't fix what wasn't broken!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mitch Hansch/ movieswithmitch.com THEY DID IT!!! I'm amazed, they actually succeeded in releasing a successfully terrifying follow up to the 2009 surprise break-out smash hit, "Paranormal Activity", which grossed over $193 million worldwide on the anemic budget of just $15 G's. They delivered a white-knuckle film worthy of carrying the name of, and I don't say this lightly, one of my top ten scariest films of all time. "They" being director Tod Williams who takes over for Oren Peri who is now a producer this time around. "Paranormal Activity 2" is a spine-tingling success. It may not reach the fright level of the original due to the novelty of that one but by the end of "PA:2" it is an event to behold, that is, if you can hold it.Horror films are the least critically successful genre but when done right they are the most rewarding. To be authentically scared (and scarred) at the movie theatre is something that becomes sparse with age and so must be savored like a fine wine. You may pooh-pooh 2009's "Paranormal Activity" but that film scared the Christian in to me (more that I already am). I couldn't look down my hallway for six months without whispering a little prayer and I can think of no bigger compliment to give a director of a horror film.Sequels are even harder to do but rest assured this is no "Blair Witch 2". I shouldn't say sequel but in fact the brilliant idea of prequel, starting "PA:2" three months before the first film ended. Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat) are back but in smaller roles as this time around we follow Katie's similarly evil spirit plagued sister Kristi (Sprague Grayden) and her family which includes husband Daniel (Brian Boland), step daughter Ali (Molly Ephraim), Martine the nanny who knows something's up, baby Hunter and the family dog who know even more but are both unable to speak.After Kristi's house is mysteriously broken into, a six camera 24-hour around the clock security system is set up. What a simple smart device to record all the bumps in the night to come. Like the first film, Tod Williams keeps the pace deliberately very slow, using repetitious shots of the humdrum house which inches up tension brick by tense freaky-deaky brick. Shots held on pots and pans or a pool-cleaning unit become sinister without anything happening. Until sinister stuff does start happening when the viewer is rewarded for keeping their eyes peeled on the screen at all times (if they can) and on all four corners of the screen. The scares are more frequent and more sustained in "PA:2" and the goose bumps stay on high alert for the last 15 minutes, fantastically giving a better climax than the first.Some of what works for "PA:2" also can take away. Brian the dad, is just the right amount of much needed humor but is basically a carbon copy of Micah from the first film as the wise cracking successful male who's the last one to believe. Maybe Katie and Kristi just have the same taste in men as the added lore invented for this film hints to. All in all, it didn't really bother me as "PA: 2" didn't try to fix something that wasn't broken, using the strengths of the first film and heightening them."Paranormal Activity 2" is the perfect scream inducing, hair standing up on the back of the neck, grab the person next to you film for the season. Let's just hope I can walk down my hallway again.Let's just hope for "this".Psalms 106:35-37&#xfeff; Mitch Hansch/ movieswithmitch.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have seen the first film then it is much better. I'd say it is more jumpy than scary. It does get a little scary as you get deeper into it.People argue to say that, it didn't really show much... but if they showed to much for the paranormal activity, it would lose the supposed 'real life' feel to it. You had to see them living their life normally,as well as the parts where the paranormal activity was occurring.I liked it.. it freaked me out a little, but it is the jumpy scenes that make it kinda fun to watch.I would say, go see it... it is worth it.If you didn't like the first film then I'm not sure whether you would be convinced... I give all films the benefit of the doubt, and the two films were a good watch in my opinion.</fullReview>

I thought the ending was (last minute or so) was ridiculous...people actually laughed at it as they rolled the credits. I really hope that wasn't what the director had in mind as the audience is leaving the theater.I would recommend people see this if they want a treat this Halloween.

		<shortDescription>I didn't know ghosts could be recycled.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 2 is a prequel/sequel to its original predecessor Paranormal Activity. The film explores deeper into Katie's family history and the evil forces that are relentlessly chasing them.This is a very simple film that will receive a very simple review. While this film delivers its share of scares, there is nothing new in the scare department for this film. The addition of a teen daughter, a baby, and a German Shepard make the scares look new however, they were recycled from the original. The best addition to this series that this particular film added was the high-angle security camera installed in the family's home. The high angles supplemented with the hand-held camera create a higher sense of tension which leads to scarier scare scenes from the anticipatory side of things. Quite frankly, this is an enjoyable film, however if you are not a fan of the original film then you will not like this installment. If the original scared the living bejesus out of you then you will not be disappointed with this prequel/sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, this had potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie followed the book of scares to the letter. Starting out in dribs and drabs. Setting up suspense with scenes of inaction. Producung musical cues whenever something was to happen. Setting up a premise as to why it's all happening.The still security cameras worked. But, then they were overworked. The idea of archive footage movies was used brilliantly in Blair Witch. In the original PA in some scenes you were wondering why a camera was on and it was blatant filmmaking (as opposed to the depicting of real life). This time around, the hand held camera was again used to some extent as filmaking. The 5 or 6 five second flashes of nothing from the security cameras each night when some 'activity' was imminent really lagged a movie that went only 90 minutes. You were always waiting a set time for something to happen and you knew you were going to have to 'wait' - not be 'in suspense'. The movie took until the third reel for anything remotely nailbiting to occur. BUT, when they did happen it was genuinely scary. However, since it's a sequel, you find yourself anticipating what's to happen next - and succeeding in guessing. They tried here to integrate Katie's sister's story into Katie's story and as such, the movie had to end a certain way. Unfortunately this meant that the Demon had several chances to accomplish his mission without doing it. You are left to wonder - 'what are you waiting for??' Also, to my memory PA1 had no reference to Katie's sister's troubles yet in PA2 Katie is very much made aware of what's going on.SPOILER There is a scene of what can only be described as an exorcism, that was done so PG that it was not until following scenes that I realised it actually was an exorcism. I can understand the need to not turn this into a slasher flick, but since it's depicting 'real life' some real life would have really clicked this movie up a few notches.People in the cinema were laughing on occasions. The pool cleaner in this movie had a larger role than the nanny. The ending is set up to be a cracker and I'm sorry to say it fizzed. Badly. What a waste.This movie was written with about 20 minutes of quality material inspiring enough to flesh out into a worthy addition to the franchise. Sadly, I recommend waiting for the DVD, and I don't say that about many movies :(</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This second film is much better and scarier than the first, I highly recommend you turn off all the lights to watch this film or you will not benefit from getting the true feeling of it all.It has the same kind of feel to it as the first did, something is in the house and seems not happy with the residents and keeps on moving objects i.e. pans in the kitchen that are hung up or doors that open by themselves.The scenes that I thought were the most horrifying were the bits where you can clearly see the baby moving in his cot and the bit where the mother is forced backwards down the stairs by something that doesn't want her to go into the kids bedroom.The ending is off course the overall most brilliant piece of the film, I won't spoil it for you but don't be fooled by anyone or anything.10 out 10 for this one, go and see it.</fullReview>

The feelings, the terror and the believability of the film stayed with me long after the film was over.In my life, I have experienced paranormal events. Not to the extreme of the film, but weird things nonetheless. The characters in the film were ones that could have been anybody's brother, wife, son, daughter. It hit close to home.

		<fullReview>This is my first review, So go easy on me. I've used IMDb for about 3 years and finally trying to contribute. Anyways...I went to see Paranormal Activity 2 just days after watching the first Film. I've been a fan of most horror movies, as well as criticizing only a handful. I felt the first film was a very good attempt using the "Found Footage" and Cam-effect Point Of View. Hearing that Paranormal Activity was a huge success, and the second film releasing, I decided to see it. I was impressed, then eventually watching the Prequel/Sequel.The main idea was that you know whats going to happen, its just when and how. You wait for something because you know it's going to happen. The film starts slow, but on purpose, and it does work. I liked the way that the film doesn't try to building suspense, but rather to counter the fact that you are waiting for something to happen. I couldn't help myself looking everywhere for anything to move on its own, Anything that doesn't caught your eye in the scene view. The film could have been longer, with more horror scenes and could explain Little more but that's a never ending bargain in any good film out there. The storyline does a very good job to connect the Prequel/Sequel film's storyline with the Original film. No Storyline Continuity between original and Prequel/Sequel (I Thought Anyways) that is usually found in other films and there Prequels and Sequels.The acting was very well concrete but what really got me is that if you were in such a situation, would you run upstairs, outside or even turn on the light? Like stupid reactions, not very well planned out. You would want to get out of the house or at least be with someone with the lights on, watching your back. You hear a strange horrifying sound coming from your closet or basement, you wouldn't just look by yourself with the lights off. On the other hand, it wouldn't be much of a film if they did just ran out of the house and didn't come back. But you would probably try to turn on a light and not just walk in the darkness scared. Then again, thats just me.Evidently, the effects that were used in the film do work. Even though people argue that the first film was better regarding in Horror effect, "Found Footage" Idea and the Recording Camera elements, I felt the second film evolved from first film, as far as the effects go. Typical for Film Makers, If something works well, why not do it again? But you need to live up to the Original. And It did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The TRUE scary movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was relatively pleased with the first movie, it was different, didn't just have nonsense blood and gore, and it succeeded in scaring me at parts or at least holding an intensity which most horror movies totally lack I find nowadays. Paranormal Activity BLEW MY MIND!!! to say the least. It literally took everything they had come up with in the original and just boosted it up. They took the best parts, studied and learned from them in order to create something that was more exhilarating and intense than the first one. 60% of the movie I was on the edge of my seat, jaw dropped. Now I'm no director or film student or anything, but I find this to be a true horror movie, simply because it actually managed to scare me, while others just end up making me laugh (and seriously why do all of them have nudity for no reason, clearly they're compensating). Point is go see it, I found it very fascinating and I had never been at the edge of my seat for so long ever in any movie. P.S. Considering this movie is based off surprises, its really a one time deal. I found the people that remained skeptical and in disbelief or were simply in a too much a giggly mood to take the movie seriously, not only completely rejected the experience of the movie but also denied themselves from ever truly experiencing it properly since they will already know the surprises if there comes a second time. Just be open minded, accept the movie, let yourself be drawn in and the Paranormal Activity will work its genius magic on you. Enjoy :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less novel, but better than original in many ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often when Hollywood orders a sequel, the magic that made the original stand out is lost (BLAIR WITCH PROJECT 2 and other sequels). Producer, Oren Peli, does not write or direct this follow up to his creation, but the new director and writers bring the same "feel" and sense of dread that made PARANORMAL ACTIVITY work.PARANORMAL ACTIVITY polarized audiences. Many couldn't sleep after viewing, while others found it boring. Sure we can blame A.D.D., Fast Info culture and non-belief (LOL!!), but the main reason that many people didn't like the first was because.....they hated Micah's character! Though I liked his brashness, he really irritated a lot of people and his actions were questionable. The good news is that PARANORMAL 2 has a very good character dynamic, that many should find more believable. The acting is quite good and who can't help but feel for the innocents (non-actors) - a German Shepard and a two year old boy?SOME SPOILERS in the following paragraphs: If you are a fan of the first, you should really appreciate this effort. In fact, some who didn't like the original will like this, as there are physical attacks that play out on screen, as opposed to "nothing really happens." "Ghost Hunters" and "Destination Truth" this is not - you know, the old "What the hell was that?!!" Go to commercial....Five minutes later - oh, Josh just slipped when he saw a cat. :&gt;)Like the first, this takes a while to build up (good horror will do this - THE SIXTH SENSE, ALIEN, EXORCIST, HALLOWEEN, etc.), but more actually happens this time (double the possessions, double the dragging), because more characters are involved. You also have the benefit of seeing both movie's scenarios (Katie and Micah/Katie's sister's family) intertwine and explain the events of the first movie - the burnt photo of Katie, why attacks shifted to Katie's house, where bloody Katie went, etc. You get the beginning and endings of both, yet a disturbing open end that could lead to part three.END SPOILERS I like "shaky cam" movies, but not the shaky camera! PARANORMAL 1 was smart to use a tripod, half the time. This movie takes it a step further by using multiple security cameras, so you can jump to the action in any room and it's steady. The step-daughter, dad, etc. use the hand-held camera just enough to make you uneasy. Compared to BLAIR WITCH, REC (remade as QUARANTINE in U.S.) and CLOVERFIELD, this is not at all hard on the eyes. You can leave the Dramamine tablets at home! Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare feeling of actual terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first time reviewing a movie and I apologize if my thoughts are disorganized;The Paranormal Activity series is a really nice break from the "horror" genre that relies on blood and cheap scares to create a sense of "fear". Blood and gore movies just aren't scary, no matter how you cut it (i promise thats the last sh*tty pun i'll use). This movie is a great sequel to the first, believable characters, jump moments and a sense of dread throughout. It's sad that our generation of instant gratification can't appreciate the suspense that this movie forces on you. Yes, it takes a while for things to happen, but thats part of the fun. Having seen the first one I found myself scanning the screen every time it was dark.Yeah, there's a couple cheap "BOOM" moments, but they're executed very well, and constitute my favorite moment in the movie (the kitchen explosion). I found myself both terrified and excited waiting for the entity's next attack. And when it comes, don't expect to be "released" from the sense of fear, cause the problem is still there. The demon is still *in the room with them*.TL,DR version:Pros: not a blood'n'gore movie, genuine fear, good acting, one of the scariest moments i've ever witnessed on a screen, ties in flawlessly with PA1cons: really i guess my only complaint would be that they didn't subtitle the Spanish lady.</fullReview>

Well having watched it yesterday night, i have to say they did a great job with this new installment. Without going in to to much detail about the film, i was impressed with how they stuck with the non Hollywood theme style and simplistic nature of the film. The movie is similar to the first as it slowly builds the tension and horror, although there is one scene where it catch's you off guard since it happens in the kitchen and in the middle of the afternoon (intense). From that point on you are more on edge as you feel that anything is possible in the coming nights and moments. The acting was on par if not better then the first flick, and i liked how they incorporated Katy in to this movie.On the negative i think, there were a few corny moments where you kind of half laughed at the nature of the scene. But this is a very small amount and the film as a whole makes up for this. Overall i think its a must see if you were a fan of the first flick, and one that should be viewed at the movies or at home with big speakers and volume up loud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first film has quite the reputation now and has topped many "Favorite Scary Movie" lists. The plot, characters, and effects were quite simple, but they made the terror "real" and all the more scary for the viewers.This time around, they've upped the ante with a bigger cast, more suspense, and more hair-raising scares. The same filming style works great again, if not better, and the effects are even creepier.I'll spare setting you up with the general plot, and leave you with one piece of advice. I left slightly unsatisfied because I made the mistake of viewing one too many "Paranormal Activity 2" trailers. Do your best to change the channel when a PA2 commercial is coming on, for some of the scenes in these commercials didn't quite make it into the final cut. And some of those scenes, however brief they were in the trailer, were ones I couldn't wait to see in the movie. After finishing, and not seeing them at all, I was a tad bitter. I'll try not to let that get in the way of my thoughts on this movie, but, after seeing what I've seen, and then seeing the movie, I can't help but feel they could have done just a little bit more to go the extra mile and cement this film as one of the greatest of all time.If you go in with no prior knowledge, no idea what to expect aside from something similar to the first movie, you'll have a blast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as good as the original Paranormal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Came back form Paranormal Activity 2. At first I didn't like it so much but by the end they put enough jump scares and terrifying build up moments to finally prove i'm just a coward. The original scared me and I was thinking to myself for the sequel "i'm gonna get scared but i'll control myself". Nope. I was fidgety the entire time but I was by myself like last time, everyone else had someone to latch on to. And someone brought a baby there too, what were they thinking? Poor thing was crying during the loud jump scare moments.I think the original was better overall. It had a better cast and better build up. The acting, ironically, was pretty bad sometimes in this one. Considering they had a supposedly more professional cast this time I expected better. Plus the two person dynamic in the original made it more involving. With this bigger cast, you jump from several points of view and don't see them get more and more terrified over time. Most of the time its just jump scares, a couple were actually so stupid they were funny (everyone in the theater laughed). Like you can tell where things were being picked up by strings and whatnot, something the original was more clever to hide. The only time anyone laughed in the original was when that Micka guy, or whatever his name is, cracked a joke.The ending was good on paper, and expected, but really cheesy on the execution. I mean seriously, look it up sometime. They could've done it MUCH better considering the budget. Also the paranormal scenes were shown with the security monitor system most of the time and they cut to A lot to scenes where NOTHING happens at all. I thought "well, OK, maybe in the end SOMETHING will come out of it" but it never did. At least in this theatrical cut. Hopefully they did film scenes where creepy stuff was happening and restore them/have them in the delete scenes on the DVD release.Despite my complaints, I had a fun time overall. I got just as scared as I did last time and I think it was worth the money despite what any self proclaimed big balled macho guys say. If you liked the original or this genre, i'd definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing on many points.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I have not watched the original "Paranormal Activity", I feel my review is not biased by expectation based on the prequel success.Dan and Christi is a very common couple, living happily in the residential suburb of an unnamed city. But as they have a baby, strange phenomena. As always in such movies, the Latina housekeeper has some ancient knowledge and is getting aware of the presence of Evil in the house. But as always too, nobody wants to believe her visions, and she finally get fired... that is when the Evil is getting into action...As you can read, the plot is very thin, but horror movies are rarely very deep and complex. Unfortunately, the script is very unpolished. In a good horror movie, the atmosphere will get tenser and tenser, until the final climax. In this film, frightening scenes are very rare, and the tension is dropping immediately.Artistically, the show is also disappointing. The actors are all terribly bad, as they never looks really afraid or concerned. This is million miles away from the fear induced by the good acting in "Blair Witch Project", for example.The direction is really boring: - The shot direction does not exist : the scene is viewed from surveillance cameras, installed in every room in the house. There is no camera move, this causes the screenplay to be extremely static. - The camera position (room corner, ceiling) causes the viewer to feel outside of any action during the film. - The film is segmented into days of a diary. At the beginning of every new day, the film zaps between each surveillance camera, displaying an empty room, then an empty alley, then an empty swimming-pool ... every day, the same. Did the director wanted to artificially increase the film duration?Finally, as the recent "Rec" (2007), this film recycles the ideas created by "Blair witch project" (1999). Unfortunately, PA2 can not match the formers in any way, and proves that filming an horror movie still require some skills.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My fiancée and I saw PN2 this evening. I had low expectations due to IMDb's 5.7 rating, but being the horror movie buff that I am, on top of it being October and all, I just had to take the plunge and pay the $22 for two tickets. This movie started out HILARIOUSLY slow. It was almost awkward at times the lack of action; similar to watching footage of a stranger's home video collection. With that said, this movie did deliver on scares. I literally screamed out loud on at least two occasions and I'm a 29 year old man. I've never heard a movie theater be so silent during the suspense building sections, eagerly awaiting a scare. It's a fun Halloween time movie that delivers a couple of scares, but if you're broke, hang onto your money. I figured out that my fiancée and I paid $37 for tickets and snacks. I would say this movie's worth a $3 to $5 ticket. I'm dreamin'!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please ignore the critics who give this movie a low score. This is horror suspense at its best!! The only thing I would do differently is not seeing this in a theater. It is *incredibly* annoying to have teenagers who giggle and laugh at the most quiet and intense moments in the movie! If you have a good home theater (or even if you don't) I highly recommend enjoying this movie in the quiet of your own home - when it comes out on DVD that is.Turn off the lights and crank the sound...you will not be disappointed! :) If you liked the first movie, you will definitely like this one. Great use of cameras also by the way, and there is so much suspense it keeps you on your toes the whole time until something happens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i saw the first movie at one of those midnight screenings with a giggly gossipy audience. i really believe the reactions of the crowd played an important part in the experience. the screams accented the events more than any kind of score could. i left the theater totally refreshed at having been truly scared. all the gimmicks worked. the internet hype. the tease. it worked like the movie. you could tell smart people were behind it. i assumed the worst for the sequel. the first one set such a standard for me. but it hit all the right buttons. this one seemed more COOL than SCARY. one scene in particular. so i don't know. i guess you either love it or hate it. either it all works or it doesn't. i shall say no more.the best movie experiences happen when you don't know what to expect.try to ignore the ads and the trailers as much as possible.see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off I'll start by saying I hated the first Paranormal Activity. I said the marketing department deserved 10/10 for their efforts... at making a 3/10 movie look scary and terrifying. The second movie i actually enjoyed a little bit more because it had the addition of the awesome character.. That is the pool cleaner. The pool cleaner was easily the best actor in the movie.. and has more screen time then most of the other characters. The second best actor was the dog. He actually did a good job of setting the mood and story. This movie is not scary. I jumped once during it and I don't count a real quiet scene during the day.. followed by an extremely loud bang and explosion on the screen to be genuine horror.. just a cheap scare tactic.The only bit i enjoyed was the ending... When the sister/demon from the first one punches the main character in this one and takes the baby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong in it's own right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sequel to the outstanding "Paranormal Activity" certainly wasn't needed, and upon first hearing about it, I wasn't even sure if I'd see it. Well, I was clearly unable to resist the temptation. Taking place before, during and after the events of Oren Peli's original, this one follows Katie's sister, Kristi, and her family as they're tormented by the same demon that was after Katie and Micah in the first. Kristi, along with her husband, stepdaughter and baby, moves into a new house which is soon thereafter trashed during a mysterious break-in. The weird thing is that nothing's missing. This prompts the family to install hidden security cameras all over the house and property. Eventually, strange incidents are caught on the security footage. Kristi and her stepdaughter come to believe that they're being haunted. Dealing with fear and memories of the past, Kristi feels helpless to escape the terror, especially since her husband refuses to believe anything paranormal is truly happening.I just got back from seeing this earlier, and despite my initial reservations, I found myself quite taken with "Paranormal Activity 2". It isn't on par with the first, no, but it gets the general vibe right, it nails the intimate terror and makes a typical suburban home seem like a prison of horrors. There are some intensely effective scenes such as the kitchen bit where everything bursts open at once, the attack on the poor dog and Kristi getting thrown around the house. In fact, everything with the pooch was gold. It was an obvious, but inspired touch to add a dog into the mix. Other smaller occurrences like banging on windows and whatnot also unnerve. The atmosphere in and around the house quickly becomes suffocating, the tension between the family members always as present as the unseen being itself.Sprague Grayden of TV's "Jericho" and "24" does well as the tortured Kristi. Despite being so familiar with her from those shows, she still manages to creep me out when she succumbs to the demon. The scene with the stepdaughter filming her sitting in the baby's room through the cracked door is one of the film's more tense moments. It was also so great to see Katie Featherston again. I love her, so the more she's on screen, the better. Micah reappears briefly as well. The other actors all do fine, though I found Kristi's husband to be a real scumbag and was actually hoping for his demise, a hope which reached a fever pitch following the actions he takes to rid his family of the demon.With all of that said, I didn't care for the direction in which they tried taking the story of the first film. The piece of trash husband sends the demon to Katie in order to save her sister and his son? No, sorry, not in my book. In the first, the demon's intentions are painted as almost romantic towards Katie. Also, the way she describes her past experiences there, it's clear to me that the events as a kid happened to her. In this one, they try and say that her sister suffered the brunt of what occurred. Peli's film paints a far more intriguing situation than the cliché deal with the devil, demonic Rumplestiltskin kind of thing this one has going on. I admire the attempt to bring the two film's together, but I simply don't like this direction when thinking of the original much the same way I was against the sister idea being brought in for "Halloween II".Looking at "Paranormal Activity 2" as it's own entity, it's a damn solid film that, just like it's predecessor, masters the art of sheer terror through minimalism. That's what I intend to do, too, view it as strictly it's own unique story. That way, my enjoyment of both films will not be affected. This one just doesn't work in connection to the first for me. When it comes to it's own merits, I don't think it quite measures up to the the original either, but it manages to be unsettling all the same. Personally, I feel that it's hard to top the creepiness of Katie standing over the bed for hours on end. This sequel never brings the horror into the bedroom. The one thing "Paranormal Activity 2" definitely has over the first, however, is Katie in a bikini. Wow!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...and you thought scary stuff happened ONLY when you sleep!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last year, the horror phenomenon Paranormal Activity was released. The film was probably one of the most polarizing films of the year: Some thought it was scary as hell, others thought it was boring and like home videos. I, personally, side with the "scary as hell" side and loved it enough to file it under my "Best Movies of 2009" list. It reminded me of WHY we watch horror films: to feel fear and dread, to be scared and not watch people get killed in gory ways or having crap jump out at you. There were a few jumps but the film was tension fueled, which made it brilliant.Now a year later, and a sequel is released. And thankfully, it manages to be just as great, and maybe even more terrifying!!! I swear with these movies, the horror genre has some hope left. In a world of crap like My Soul To Take (I didn't want to waste a long amount of time ranting so I wrote a review of MSTT in poem format), jump fueled PG-13 horror and gore/torture porn, for once we're getting horror movies that are not only ACTUALLY scary, but follow the rule that Hitchcock set up when he was making movies: the scariest aspect is what we don't see.This film takes place 62 days before Micah Sloat died. A new family is the focus, and the mother, Kristy, is Katie's sister. They seem happy, as they have a beautiful daughter Ali, and a CUTE baby boy Hunter. The family has been experiencing a series of what could be called break-ins. We see ONE aftermath of them- and the house looks like a tornado blew through it- broken beer bottles, stuff broken, things scattered everywhere, etc. The family then resorts to hiring a surveillance team to install a series of cameras around the house, in case any suspicious activity happens.However, these clearly are no break-ins. Martin, the Spanish maid, has a spooky experience one night when a giant thump reverberates through the kitchen. Things get even spookier when Ali gets locked out of the house, and some even creepier stuff happens too, one involving the baby. And then, from there... things go from creepy to downright TERRIFYING. The same demon that haunted Micah Sloat and Katie Featherston is haunting them. But DOUBLE as scary, and to the point where you can't take the scariness anymore.I was worried this film would not live up to its predecessor, but thank God that worry proved useless. I loved it just as much as Paranormal Activity the first one. Sure the scares are recycled, but they did that for a reason- the same demon is haunting them. That means the household the demon haunted is off to do his tricks to the next household, which, if you ask me, makes it all the more scary to think about. Like the first, this one follows the Hitchock rule. But from the "Kitchen" scene, the terror level increases. the film thereon becomes disturbing as hell and just downright terrifying.Another thing I must praise is that this movie manages to bring a new element to the series- the feeling of being alone, and experiencing a terrifying moment not just at night but at all times of the day. The "kitchen" scene is a good example of this- in fact that scene alone made the movie more effective than the first. Ever had those moments where you have been alone in your home, and somehow knew you weren't alone? That an unseen presence is with you? That something can happen at any time? This movie focuses on that in the same fashion the first movie focused on what happens when you sleep.In short, Paranormal 2 is a success, and proof there is still hope for the horror genre. If you liked this one, give it a chance, and even if you didn't like the first, still give it your best shot. I certainly loved it as much as the first, and it also must be seen on the big screen- whereas the first worked better at home, this must be seen at the theatre with a packed crowd like I saw it tonight. Recommended for sure, and be prepared to be scared out of your mind!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was sadly disappointed. I loved the original, and was very much looking forward to this movie. It's a bummer to say this, but it wasn't very scary and it wasn't very good. Personally, the whole viral campaign was a lot more effective in scaring me than the actual movie. I thought I'd be writing a great review tonight, unfortunately, that's not the case. :( Major problems for me: it took way to long to get into the story, a bunch of the viral clips weren't a part of the movie, Katie was in it for like 5 minutes, the demon did not behave in the same way as the first, there were a lot of plot holes, the end was way too fast and was clearly written the way it was for shock factor alone. Too bad, I was really anticipating this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not terrible, but not great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say that I am very much a fan of the first Paranormal Activity. I feel like at the time of its release, it was on its own level in the horror-film genre. The whole movie thrived off of tension which kept viewers on the edge of their seat (or under their hoodies) from beginning to end. Cheap-thrills were rarely present, and I liked and respected that. Too many horror films these days are based off of quiet scenes followed by loud noises. Was it perfect? Not at all. The ending was horrendous and Micah's character was annoying (yes, he was meant to be, but at some point it I felt like it took away from believing that it was suppose to be 'real').With so much success, I expected the same style to be present within the sequel (it is actually a prequel). Sadly, this wasn't the case. What I loved so much in the first film was rarely present in the second. The film did a 180 degree turn and decided to add cheap-thrills during every scene. Did they make myself and the audience jump? Yes; but who wouldn't jump after hearing something really, really loud? For example, for some strange reason door slam volumes were very exaggerated. To match the volume of the movie, you would need to literally throw someone at a door. Or run at it full-throttle. Now keep in mind that this is just my opinion. I'm sure many will disagree. We all have different doors, I suppose.In the beginning of the film you find out that the family turns to surveillance around the home because they succumb to a 'burglary.' This serves as a decent segue. This also means no more 90-minute handy-cam, which many will appreciate. From there, as I stated before, cheap-thrills all the way. 80% of the time when the ominous music sounds, something really loud happens within 60-seconds and honestly, it became very repetitive. Where is the horror if you know something is about to happen? However, before I too become repetitive, I will say that there were two scenes in particular that really impressed me: 1.) the wife in the kitchen with the cabinets and 2.) the wife being dragged...twice. I must say, "bravo." Those two scenes were probably the two most frightening scenes I have witnessed in a film for a very long time. Even thinking about it now gives me chills.However, the biggest complaint I have has to do with the newly installed home surveillance. -Now, these are *HUGE SPOILERS* so do not read on unless you truly do not care.- First off, why was the room near the entrance of the home the only one without a camera? Two important scenes were ruined because of this. Secondly, when the demonic Katie somehow teleports to the previously mentioned room, why does the camera change to the kitchen instead of keeping focus on the father? One edit later, Katie mysteriously appears behind the couch where she has perfect access to the fathers neck. These silly decisions and edits really bothered me. Not to mention that the ending felt very similar to the first film.In the end I felt as if the movie was average with two or three truly terrifying moments, so I decided to give it a 5/10. The acting was believable. Better all around than the first film (with the exception of Katie and her sister talking in the nursery..ugh, really?) In my opinion, I felt as if the teenage daughter was an unexpected surprise and stole the show. Her scenes did not feel nearly as scripted as the others and her terror felt a bit more genuine.If you enjoy films with cheap-thrills (which a lot of people do!) and supernatural themes, then watch this film and enjoy it! If you are not a fan of cheap-thrills, then I still recommend you watch it. Sometimes films may surprise you. Though I spent a lot of time bashing and only thought of it to be average, you may perceive it to be something much more. With a large audience, you are sure to jump out at least once. I will not watch it again until it is on DVD/Blu-Ray, but I would certainly recommend it to my peers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Paranormal Activity I first watched without knowing anything about it and it scared the life out of me. So much so I squeezed a water bottle so hard at one point that the lid shot off and sprayed the people behind me. I have been building up to seeing Paranormal Activity 2 for a week and I must say, it does have it's moments. A baby, a dog and a teenage girl add to the targets of the evil spirits in this new house. I jumped a few times and had my feet on the seat, but overall I wasn't as frightened. It helps if you have seen the original again recently as there's a few important references that prompt the narrative throughout. A couple believe that their family home is being burgled so security cameras are installed. What follows is indescribable. Be warned, not for children or the faint hearted. The added budget is used sparingly which is a good thing, the effects and bumps through the home camera lenses have plenty of impact. NOT AS SCARY as the first one but if your a fan, see it before anyone spoils it and remember refresh yourself with the first one again, it will help.</fullReview>

I went to an advanced showing last night and to say that I was less than blown away would be an understatement. The trailer made this movie look amazing and well, the best parts of the trailer weren't even in the movie. I found myself falling asleep about an hour in and then there was 1 of 3 really scary parts that woke me up. I sat there for 70 or so minutes watching nothing but a family's life on videotape. It was NOTHING like the first one. After seeing the 2nd, they should have stopped with the 1st. Judging by the ending, there will be a 3rd. God help us all. I found the movie to be a total waste of $23. In a sold-out theatre, to say it was a good movie would've put you in the minority. Tons of boos came from the crowd. People turned away at the doors after asking us how it was and got refunds. Wait 3-4 weeks and go see it at your local bargain theatre. It's worth $3 but certainly not $12.50. What a terrible let down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If ever I need money again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched the first Paranormal Activity (purely out of boredom, I'm not a big fan of horror films) I was outraged. I heard about its success and I was looking forward to some serious entertainment. I was very wrong.The film reminded me of Open Water (another movie that will scare you only because of the knowledge that you willingly waste time on it) due to the fact that nothing ever really happens during the whole movie. I don't know what it is about this "new" style which solely consists of taking a video camera somewhere (any setting you choose) and just leave it there to film long streaks of nothingness.When I discussed my views of Open Water back then some people said that I lacked imagination. I can't see why a boring movie has anything to do with imagination but anyways...(if I wanted to use my imagination I would not have watched a movie in the first place ?)So I watched the first PA. The first thing that really shocked me was that in a world filled with amazing actors who are forced to play poorly written parts, they managed to find two that have no talent whatsoever. Their emotions are so forced and their voice acting so unreal...the thought that these people are seen as actors frightened me(about the only thing that did). Then there was the plot or well I have trouble calling it a plot since apart from a door that closes by itself...(yeah you guessed right "..." means "nothing")Overall it was a major disappointment and I really couldn't believe that so many people were actually frightened by what seemed to me time well wasted.And now there is part 2...of course every movie franchise nowadays has to be at least a trilogy because people get hooked easily enough and always need to know the pre-/se-/anything-quel of a story (however bad and unimaginative it may be) but this ? The movie should act as some kind of prequel...I guess so they have an excuse not to bring anything new into the story (ok the toddler, I'll give you that) and for the rest...same old, same old. And in this case these are no "good ole times".Again the acting is abysmal and the camera (feigning reality - wow that's so new...) annoying and just plain bad. For about 50 minutes nothing really happens which just goes to show how little you need to make money...I could set up a camera in my room and just tape the next 90 minutes of me sitting at the desk (uuuh strange noises come from outside "is that the wind howling or a poltergeist scratching my window trying to get in and strangle me with my underwear ?) and I guarantee you that more things would happen on the screen. (Is he snoring because of his cold or may there be a supernatural entity blocking his airways..who knows --&gt; terror !!!) My advice is to go see ANY other movie that might be on around your place and if you must see this film,don't pay for it, it's bad enough to lose precious time of your life to this fusion of bad acting, dull "plot" and overall breathtaking boredom. Or as some people have suggested, use your imagination (anything you will create in your own mind will be way more interesting and frightening than this movie).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the sequel to the gripping blockbuster PARANORMAL ACTIVITY and is linked to the original. This time the spotlight is on Katie's(Kate Featherston)sister Kristi(Sprague Grayden), who lives in an upscale Los Angeles suburb with her husband Daniel(Brian Boland)and his daughter from a previous marriage Ali(Molly Ephraim). Kristie gives birth to baby boy Hunter. Also occupying the large home is a Latino nanny and a large amiable dog. The young family believe they are the victims of several break-ins and install numerous security cameras. What is puzzling is the strange noises throughout the home. Ridiculous or not, the noises get louder and even angrier. The nanny is sure of supernatural forces at work. Soon the house just doesn't seem safe to live in. When teenage Ali begins researching spirits, paranormal activity starts to rule. Without a good imagination disappointment will set in. Not a real waste, just not as good as the original. And so will be said if there is a third to come. Feel free to scare yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the original Paranormal Activity, lots of people moaned and whined that it was 'too slow' and 'nothing happened until the last 5 minutes', but that was the beauty of it. It was a low budget film that was so simplistic in nature, and yet it hit a nerve.I'm happy to report that the second Paranormal Activity not only lives up to the first, but far surpasses it. With a notably greater budget, the film is a little more flashy, but maintains the simplistic essence of is predecessor. The suspense created by the film is almost artful, and the climax is truly amazing. This is possibly the best horror movie I have ever seen. Clever, original, beautifully done and truly creepy. I've seen it twice now in cinemas, and both times it scared me to a point I didn't think possible. Just thinking about it sends shivers down my spine.10/10, this is a must see. Scary on every level, definitely the movie of the year for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a rule in all the Sequel film, sequel will start form where the first part ends. But in this film it shows the things which happened before Part 1. Which I feel a great attempt and the way they have correlated first and second part in climax is class apart. Let us put all these things behind, what we expect from the sequel and what you need from this film?? I would say I expected lot of freaky and creepy things. This movie gives you all and also gives you more than that which you will take it to your home. Folks be ready for Parnormal activity 3. I feel its all set for the next sequel.Must watch movie and you will have the after effect of this movie for another week .. DISTURBING MOVIE :(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not as original as the first, but still enjoyable...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>firstly id like to say that i thought paranormal activity was amazing. i thought it was scary and it kept me watching more than Blair witch project did.upon watching this i was exited because i thought it would be just as good, what with the security cameras watching the house.i left the cinema enjoying the film, finding it good - and at some parts - scary.this wasn't as scary as the original, what with the budget being bigger, the small scary things that happen in the 1st isn't as good.there was several parts where most people in the audience started laughing. at a couple of parts the whole cinema were just laughing. some of the parts which are supposed to be scary was actually funny. I'm sure this wasn't intended but it didn't make the film any worse. i think people in the cinema realised its not going to be as scary as the first but still enjoyed it.There were parts were everyone jumped and screamed, i think this was an enjoyable cinema experience. hasn't quite got the same feel and originality as the 1st. the demon seems a lot less real in this but it was still a good flick.overall, if you go in hoping it to be better than the first you will be disappointed. although expect to find a few parts funny and a few parts jumpy and you'll most likely enjoy the film overall.6 1/2 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rare Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the midnight showing of PA2 last night and I must say that I was impressed with this sequel. Horror movie sequels tend to add too much to a story or add too much to the gore and violence. This one played it cool (a little too cool at times). The executions of the scary moments was superb. The build up was slow paced, but with a very intense feeling. You never knew when the scare was coming and where it was coming from. The tie in story line from the original played out very well and it made the story more entertaining. It was great to see the plot in a sort of semi-prequel format where you didn't know who or what was going to do what. That is the beauty about PA2... The movie feeds on your fear since you cannot see the actual demon. It takes hold of your imagination and never lets go. Tod Williams (Director) took Oren Peli's idea and added just a few different, but related, elements to make sure the viewers didn't get motion sickness. The addition of cameras in every room was brilliant and yet simple. It shows you that you do not have to move a camera from side to side to get a scare. Overall, PA2 keeps the story simple, but very interesting, because of its mysterious way of presenting it. The scares are meant to be seen on the big screen with friends and strangers.

		<shortDescription>I don't get it (possible MILD spoilers involved)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(you should know that I have not seen the first movie nor did I read much about it, so I really went into this film cold).I saw an advance screen last night. Packed house - about 200 people.we LAUGHED through the ENTIRE 90 minutes.Wait - isn't this a horror film about a possessed house? (keeping it simple to be spoiler free).Okay, the first 45 minutes had some intentionally funny scenes. After that? Not sure the humor was intentional.Not once was I scared or even felt a minute of tension, horror or impending doom.The characters acted so incredibly silly in the face of what was going on, the entire family reminded me of the teenagers in a Friday 13th movie (you know, the young girl that decides to go skinny dipping at midnight in a lake where there is a known killer roaming around? that kind of people).They have the ENTIRE house video taped 24x7 but when strange things go on, looking at these tapes are the LAST thing people look at (in many cases, they NEVER bother to check the tape.) They spend all the time and money getting this complex system installed and they hardly used it. Incredible.NOTHING happens during the first 40 minutes. N.O.T.H.I.N.G. It was 40 minutes of watching someone's home movies. No build up. Characters were still 2 dimensional to me after the 40 minutes. I kept on waiting for something to happen - and nothing did until the movie was almost half over.There were exactly three times where I was scared - and that was the classic 60 seconds of dead silence followed by a loud "BOOM!". So yes, there were some times I was scared, but that is the old 'cat jumping out of nowhere" scare that doesn't qualify as true horror to me.I never felt emotionally attached to any character. when 'what happened' to them happened, I neither felt sorry nor happiness.And the film makes a point of TELLING US IN ADVANCE of the death of a character via text on the screen "SO and SO will die in 60 days".. then "SO and SO will die in 30 days" and then "SO and SO died last night".Huh? we didn't see the death and - from what little plot there was - I could not understand why that person was killed. And I guess the spirit could jump from house to house because it sounded like that person was not killed in the main house. (sorry for the generic language, but trying to keep this spoiler free). Why the build up for that death when we didn't even experience it? Maybe I missed something - I could have dozed off at that point I guess.The filming was too amateurish to be taken as a serious film, yet way too professional to be taken as a serious (even fake) documentary.That being said, it wasn't a total loss. Some things I liked were 1)The use of silence. In today's bombastic soundtracks, it was a relief to be in a theater where you could hear a pin drop. Kudos for that. This worked better in the 2nd half of the film than the first.2) The plot (what little there was) was actually interesting. Wish they would have explored more of this.3) The baby was the best actor in the film and should get an academy award. Seriously - he was the best thing about the film. That says something in itself.4) Some of the security cam shots were effective. I think the film would have been a lot more effective if the entire movie was just made up of that footage. That would be a VERY interesting approach.5) While I was very disappointed, I can't say I was totally bored. There were some (only a handful) of creepy scenes. Just wished the whole film could have been like those.And this film had the lamest ending I have seen in a LONG while. When the movie was over you could people say "huh? THAT'S IT? We watched 90 minutes for THAT?" "Are you kidding me?" etc. It was as if I felt 200 people roll their collective eyes in amazement.The ending was SO lame, about 30 of us stayed after the credits - HOPING that SOMETHING after the credits could redeem this film.But alas, nothing.Now here is the strangest thing of all.As I was walking out of the theater, the SAME people who laughed through the ENTIRE film (and many were sitting right next to me) came out and said "Wasn't that the scariest movie you have ever seen?" "That was SO much scarier than the first one!" "I don't think I will be able to go to sleep tonight after seeing that!" Some folks mentioned how the ending "freaked them out!".I just don't get it. How could people who were laughing their head off - even during the violent and supposedly horror scenes - come out and say this? Was ALL of that just nervous laughter? I know in my case it wasn't.So from my perspective, I would rate it a 6.5 as a comedy and a 4.0 as a horror film. Not a complete waste of time, but then again I didn't have to pay to see this. Judging from the comments of the audience I was with, you might find yourself laughing and still find it a very scary experience.Go figure.Perhaps this would be more effective watching alone at night in your house on a small TV screen. I can see that experience as potentially more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably Scariest Movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much like the first one, Paranormal Activity 2 will give you goose bumps during and after you watch it. Although it is made by different people the film delivers the same expectations as the first movie. The film makers use their twisted minds to start off with simple things that may make you jump. But then it happens! The one that you probably won't expect! From that moment on I guarantee you will be jumping in your seats. Many of the scenes may be familiar but they will still have you screaming like you have never screamed before.Even though I didn't like the first one this is definitely a must see movie. I recommend all horror fans watch this movie even if they didn't like the first one. A must see horrifying sequel/prequel!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less memorable than the first but still pretty scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 2 stays true to the original. Everything that has scared us to death is back and larger in scale. Paranormal Activity 2 is actually a prequel. How else would they have both Katie and Micah back? However there's a strong connection to the first movie and it's all very smartly plotted.There are scenes in the trailer that aren't in the actual movie. However unlike the first PA, the scariest parts are saved only for the movie by not having them in the trailer. Paranormal Activity 2 is full of shocks.There's a lot of horror in this film. Some scares are repetitive in the beginning but as the movie progresses on, the movie releases everything it's got and once again the last fifteen minutes of the film are absolutely terrifying. Jump scares are well timed at unexpected moments and the night scenes are still thrilling and worth waiting for. There's certainly more action in this one; the characters roam around the house with their camera at night. The sequel is less memorable because the shots aren't as creepy. The first movie had a set location: the bedroom and it was terrifying because the characters were haunted in their sleep when they are most vulnerable. Overall, if you liked the first one, this one will please you for sure.The characters are well chosen. All of them have a good purpose and play a different role. There's the frustrating character that will never believe, there's the terrified one and then there's the adventurous one who craves for more. The acting is done well most of the time but at others it bothered me because it felt like they were 'acting'. Another recurring problem I had was that I kept asking myself why the characters were filming certain parts. Yes, those scenes are needed to make the movie make sense but in real life people wouldn't film some of these scenes at their circumstance.Paranormal Activity 2 is not the abysmal sequel people feared it to be. It's got strong relevance to the first movie and it's still definitely shocking. It's an expansion of the first movie which all sequels should be; it's like seeing a part of the first movie that we never got to see. Definitely see it in the theaters where you won't be tempted to skip the movie forward.</fullReview>

After watching the 1st i thought mmmm a 2nd, no way can it creep me out again, i mean, well, its all been done now, but i was pleasantly surprised by PA2, although OK its abit like number 1 its still able to get into your imagination. im not going too write nothing about the storyline of the movie, all i can say is watch this not as a movie but as if you where in the same situation thats what this movie is trying too deliver to the viewers. I thought this movie was as good as the first one in my view. Go watch it and remember try not too watch it as a movie but as a real life documentary. 10/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all you have to watch the first movie to understand the whole story. Otherwise you wont understand anything at the end of the movie. &#x131; have to admit that there are some scary moments in this movie especially in the second part of the movie. And also as the first one, we have some heroic characters who gets the handy cam instead of turning on the lights or leave the place. Anyhow this annoying detail is reduced in this one compared to the first movie. For conclusion handy cam idea is not new but i think this movie is better than the similar ones such as Blair witch project.In my opinion Its worth for paying, go watch it but surely after the first one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Works in building dread and horror effectively.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a year after the first Paranormal Activity, we get the sequel. No one expected it to be good, but surprise, surprise. It managed to follow the original in some of the same ways, and in some other different ones.I am very glad that the filmmakers decided to give us a prequel. I think it sets in the danger that has come with this family and with the two sisters. The original took it's time to slowly build up suspense and as every minute went the audience was getting closer and closer to hysteria. Sequels are done to increase everything the original has, and surprisingly, Paranormal Activity 2 does not. I am surprised to say this, but the sequel, if anything, is slower and subtler than the original. I am sure that many audiences will want more than what actually goes on in the film, but I for one thought it was refreshing. The sequel seems to have matured in a way, not that it is necessarily better, just different. There are also a lot of moments that have you dreading how much it's going to scare you, similar to how the original leaves you feeling.Ultimately, Paranormal Activity 2 was anything but a disappointment. Although the ending was not as great as the ending in the first installment, this is a great continuation of subtle horror, and as a stand-alone film, works as well. I even think that watching this one before Paranormal Activity might also work, so then you know what's going to happen in it and you can't wait for how it's going to all come about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another level of fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity showed why it is much better to imply terror than it is to show terror. Jaws did it before Brody tells Quint he's going to need a bigger boat. Halloween did it with shadows gliding across the wall flickering in the candle light. Texas Chainsaw Massacre even did it as you never do see that girl go through the meat-hook, you just think you do. And even films The Changeling with it's bouncing ball and The Ring with Samara and the well, manage to imply that to show decapitated heads and corkscrews to eyes. This is what made the original so damned scary. Loud noises, shadows and lots of spooky dialogue made for one of the scariest movies ever made, in my opinion.Now Paranormal Activity 2 comes out and it has the daunting task of furthering the story, keeping the tone of the original and not pissing off the fans who loved the original so much. Did it succeed? Absolutely! And not only did it succeed, it set the bar for horror films even higher than the original did. Straight up, this is better than the original, it is scarier than the original and it furthers the story or the original. Paranormal Activity 2 is one of the most harrowing experiences in the theatre. It slowly builds the story and then in the last 45 minutes of the film it assaults you with every imaginable trick it can to manipulate your emotions.Paranormal Activity 2 does everything right. It starts with the fact that this is a prequel. This film follows Katie's sister and her new family. She has just had a new baby boy and they record his every move. Early in the film the house, a very large one, is ostensibly broken into, but nothing is taken, it's only vandalized. This causes the family to get security cameras installed in every room in the house. This allows us to see everything that is happening. And right away two very effective tools are used in this film that were not there in the first. One is that there is a beautiful German Shepherd who senses things that the family doesn't and you have little baby Hunter who supplies plenty of heart-stopping moments of his own.Katie and Micah make a few cameo appearances and they add plenty of panache to the story. In fact, Katie and Micah's appearance are essential to the advance of the story.Katie's step niece is the only one in the film who seems to believe there is a malevolent force in the house. And she does the research in the demonology that essentially knocks you off your chair. Her findings are so shocking that you literally fear the for the family. Introducing a Mephistopheles angle to the film is absolutely brilliant.But the true strength of the film, like the original, is the things that go bump in the night, and there are much more of them this time around. I can count at least 6 instances where the film shocked me to the point of involuntary tears. One scene in the kitchen had me jump out of my seat. It was from this point on I knew the film had me completely at its whim. For a film to frighten me, after seeing more horror films than most people, is really impressive.Paranormal Activity 2 is the best film of the year in my opinion. It is well written, brilliantly filmed, well acted and scarier than the first. Kudos to Paramount and Oren Peli for making such a shockingly brilliant film. Book of Shadows this is not.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Caught the midnight show last night. I actually liked this one better than the original. One thing I enjoyed about it was that you had to keep your eyes moving over the screen to catch the more subtle signs of the haunting when it first began. It had a lot of creepy atmosphere, and now I am afraid to go into my kitchen for more reasons than the fact it's an f'n mess! Seriously, this movie proves you don't need copious amounts of blood and viscera to create a palpable mood of fear and tension.

		<fullReview>Well, Tod Williams congratulations!on taking over the role of Oren Peli who was director of the first film and re-creating that suspense filled atmosphere we all crave and hope for in films like this.Having been a huge fan of the first film and its concept I was very anxious awaiting this release, it hit cinemas in South Australia yesterday and I was at one of the first few sessions, It was great because their were only a handful of people, I wanted to view it quietly and in the pitch black dark to gain the full effect. The cast were all very solid the return of Katie and Micah fit into the plot very well.This is actually a prequel to the first film and I liked the way they gave you a better feel for how things came to pass in the first film. The young female lead who I had seen in a couple of episodes of Jericho (tv show) carried on that creepiness that Katie's character had in the first film. Some very good jumps and sound effects were used once again, a bit of night vision work was added which we never saw in the first gave it another layer all together.I think its exceptional when a director can get that amount of suspense out of a scene without any type of a musical score, bravo! It was interesting to hear Peli's view point on the original idea for the script, he got it after having gone to sleep one night and woken up the next morning to see that his washing detergent had moved over a metre from the position it was in the night before!! eek very creepy, ever had anything like that happen to you?? Anyone who hates on this doesn't understand success or failure, the promotion on the film regardless of what people think, was extraordinary (up there with Avatar) and deserves the mass grossing it has got! so be sure to respect and promote it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>many of you people have some issues that you need to resolve. i will start with the people that say they were not scared at all by this film. this means that either you are a liar or that you lack the imagination and personality to engross yourself into the entertainment medium that you are taking part in.next group: "it was disturbing but not scary." get a clue people! scary, frightening, horrifying, creepy, eerie, disturbing. it's all the same it still invokes the very same fight or flight response that fear is supposed to. you say it was disturbing because it makes you feel better than admitting you got scarednext group: "it looked just like the first one" yes it did because it was the same type of film it is meant to convey a sense of "this just might be a true story" feeling. i would not be as drawn into it if it was filmed like other movies. you are supposed to feel like you are watching a true story and the only evidence that was found was the security and camcorder tapes.the bottom line is this; when you read a review think of the words people use and what it is exactly they are griping about. and as far as my review goesif you want a movie that is going to make you think twice about opening your bedroom door to see what that loud noise was then see this one</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie having been blown away by Paranormal Activity and expecting much of the same. And for much of the movie, it does live up to its reputation. There is no doubt however that this issue is quite a lot LESS scary than its predecessor; despite having 3-4 cannon scenes, the movie is a long ride of nothing happening. Especially for the first 30 minutes, absolutely nothing happens, and it is well past the half hour mark that we have our first scary scene. The characters are a lot less under developed than the first film, but in a film of such genre, character development is not really needed. The actors however perform their parts admirably. For the rest of us, its a good movie with so much potential that its ridiculous. Do watch it as it is still a right sight better than the other horror films in recent times.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthwhile follow-up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About 18 months ago, I was very impressed with Paranormal Activity. The premise of a couple using video cameras to capture the unexplained events occurring in their house, and the escalating sense of menace revealed from the mostly low key incidents on tape, enabled an effective and scary movie to be produced very cheaply and with very little story. I was curious as to what the follow up would be - more of the same, or something new? It turns out that the answer is more of the same, AND something new. The format is pretty much the same - events captured with video cameras and closed circuit security cameras. This time we are looking at a family - mother, father, teenage daughter from father's first marriage, and new baby. We discover that the mother is the sister of Katie, the central character of the original movie, and both Katie and Micah put in appearances - this movie mostly takes place before the previous one. Already we have more people, more of a story, and the raised stakes of an infant being involved.And then PA2 comprehensively ties in with PA1. This is, I think, the film's main strength. Like the first one, it is seriously scary in places, with many of the scares coming from no more than loud noises and, like the first one, it escalates very effectively. But the tying in to the first movie adds an enormous extra dimension.I'm not going to say anything about the ending (which, I thought, was extremely good), other than that the ground is laid for a further movie - the teenage girl's mother is a possible avenue for exploration.</fullReview>

I loved how it involved both the first one and the new one in a crazy way. when Katie first shows up you're like "what the....?!?!" the whole movie keeps you on the edge of your seat. has its share of laughs and scares all together. jump factor is definitely a 10!!! I'm not usually a screamer at movies, but this one got me several times, with its fair share of goosebumps. The actors/actresses did an awesome job. very realistic. definitely leaves you wanting to see a 3rd one, which i hope will be the case! I just hope they don't start to get cheesy or dumb. usually I'm not impressed with sequels but in the case i was MORE than impressed! Would definitely recommend this movie!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a cinematic rarity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying that I very rarely enjoy a movie enough to consider writing a review about it, let alone actually following through with the notion. This film is the exception. I have to preface my thoughts with the fact that I absolutely loved the first movie, and was expecting this film to be unable to top its predecessor. I was mistaken. At the risk of over-hyping this movie, it is (in my opinion of course) a nearly flawless sequel. If you are the type of person that could run with the story of the original and enjoyed the plot and film styling it possessed (ha, possessed, get it?), you will love this movie. Conversely, if you did not like the original, prepare yourself for disappointment. I have very, very few criticisms of this movie (a rarity for me), but for the sake of fairness I will share them with you. The beginning seems a touch forced, with little character development until after about 1/3 of the movie has gone by. This bothered me at the time, but the film quickly remedies this as more and more of the story is revealed. There are additional plot devices they use to connect this to the first one which some people might find a bit contrived, although I thought they worked just fine. I feel like this will probably be one of those "you either love it or you hate it" things. Aside from those things, and one minor detail I would have personally tweaked about the ending, my final complaint is only that it has an ending. At the risk of sounding repetitive, this film was truly a delight to watch. Not only did it have some tremendous "holy sh!t" moments, it had an extremely solid plot to tie it together. If you are willing to immerse yourself in the story and the environment much like with the first one, you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy Sequel *spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from an advance screening of Paranormal Activity 2 and i gotta say, it was good.I have been a fan of the original movie since it came out over here (Australia) in December and have been following this films progress since its announcement. From the first trailer to the last viral video, this film has had my full attention.I must say, i was on the edge of my seat since the first ten minutes of the film. The first night not much happened but like the first movie, it had you wondering what would happened. The entire movie tied in together and yes Micah and Katie are involved. Every element from the the first movie from the hand-held camera to the one camera in the spot are excellently executed.Paranormal Activity 2 is a well crafted, suspenseful horror film and a worthy sequel to a great, original horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the opportunity to view an advanced screening of this just a few minutes ago (I live in Australia) and I must say, I enjoyed the film.If you liked the first one, then I can say you'll really like this one. I know the makers of the film were trying to make whole film seem natural, and real and like this is really happening, however, it just felt a little "staged". Yes, I am aware that it's not real, but some of the acting was... Juat satisfactory.There were moments that left me thinking "when's the next "jump" gonna happen?" Which is what I feel this movie had become; Just a film to make you jump in your seat.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film, and a few parts made my heart skip a beat. I think that the continuity from the first was good and explained a lot about the first film.The majority of the film is a prequel, but I guess it's good in a sense as it explains why the events of the first film actually happened.I think the film was well executed, and wants Me wanting a little more, so maybe Paranormal Activity 3 ? I will say this, I felt some of the effects were a little hard to believe at times, but other than that, I liked it and it made my heart beat fast, which is what I guess the makes were setting out to do. For those who can look past the horror element, there is a believable story behind the whole thing, which I liked.If you like good supernatural horrors, you'll love this, as long as you don't mind having second thoughts about sleeping alone and with the light off.I give this film **** out of ***** stars, as it was good film, but didn't quite amaze Me.Adios ! Y'all</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basically a redo of the first...but scarier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a prequel to the first. It deals with Katie's sister. She's married and lives with her husband and his kid from his first marriage. Then she gives birth to an adorable baby boy named Hunter...and slowly things start to happen. It seems there's something is after Hunter---but what is it and why? In most ways this is virtually a remake of the first film--it's all shown by cameras set up around the house and builds slowly. The first one however only had two people and had Katie being targeted. This one has a family and a baby being in danger. Also the first film never really scared me (until the end) but this one did. There are loud bangs and sudden shocks that really jolt the audience and (like the first) there's an ominous rumbling sound on the soundtrack that warns you that something is going to happen. I screamed and jumped with the rest of the audience and was getting REALLY scared by the time the last half hour kicked in. Also the acting by the entire cast was excellent. Scary movie--but you should see the first or you might be a little confused. One question--WHAT happened to the dog and nanny?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't you just hate repossession?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After what appears to be a break-in, a family has security cameras installed(so that the supernatural events can be shown from more angles, as if that would improve things for this approach... the "found footage" idea, you know, with normal people capturing what they experience, and not always placing it in an opportune place, etc.). Then things begin to happen which they cannot explain rationally. This unnecessary follow-up to the excellent original is very much a sequel; everything is bigger and otherwise the same, and it's not better(or even as good), and it's no longer fresh. Yes, we get subtlety, hints, creepiness, tension, it's all in the sounds, the slight(and "impossible") movement in part of what we're seeing and the phenomena that is not of this world. That worked well in the first one. Doesn't mean we should get it again. Almost a remake, this is a prequel, and expands on the other(unfortunately, not without cheapening it). This is the best part. Trouble is, that doesn't take up much. I'm not claiming this doesn't work. If you ignore that not everything is natural(some things are quite forced and staged), that not everything we see would have been filmed, and, I hear, that a lot of stuff in trailers is not in this(I barely watched them), and you just go with the things we see, this can be effective. There are great jumps and my full theater clearly enjoyed themselves. As did I, without falling for it. We get a larger cast, and it doesn't help things. Characters have personality and are reasonably well-developed(I would have liked to see Martine be expanded upon). The baby is OK, at times cute. This is a tad happy to explain, instead of allowing itself to be as vague as its superior predecessor. The overall plot and concept aren't bad. There is a lot of disturbing content and a little violence in this. I recommend this to those *dying* for a fix of this sort of thing. Everyone else... rewatch Oren's movie. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Movie in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My niece and I went to the midnight viewing, we love our scary movies. I will have to say this is one of the best I've seen in awhile. I watched 1 when it came out on DVD and bought it yesterday to refresh my memory. Im not one to be scared and I can honestly say I wasn't but I must admit this movie makes you jump do to the fact of the noises. So it's a must to see in a dark, loud place. This movie makes you go huh! Which is a refreshing change from the blood baths we see nowadays where the big boobed blonde gets it and there is always someone on the other side of the open door or better yet the leg grab when their suppose to be dead! Classic stuff that is repeated in every movie. Or better yet the remakes. So I would say go see it. Guys were screaming and girls were wigging out. A couple of things to note the baby in the street scene not in movie, but could it be an alter. ending? Loved the dog! Don't worry animal lovers, she wasn't injured. This is a movie that don't make you mad you spent your entire paycheck to get in and buy popcorn. I may take my nephew just to see him jump and scream like a girl LOL</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror movie sequel ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PA1 and PA2 dovetail so exquisitely that they are really two parts of the same movie, like Kill Bill 1 and 2. I literally leaped up in my seat once or twice and thoroughly enjoyed the scares, along with the leading tension.If you loved PA1, I think you will love PA2. If you only liked PA1, you will probably like PA2 even better, although I am not necessarily saying it's a "better" film, per se -- it just makes the story and background of PA1 so much more complete that you will understand PA1 much better in retrospect. If you hated PA1, you'll probably hate PA2, because it is truly faithful to the feel of PA1, even though it also has its own unique feel at the same time.While PA2 won't convert PA1-haters, those who enjoyed PA1 will be pleased to hear that the BLAIR WITCH sequel curse has been broken!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranormal Activity 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was cautious when I heard they were making a sequel because of Blair With 2: Book of Secrets (which was good, but not as a sequel).PA2 turned out to be a great sequel, you could compare it to Rec 2, not as good as the first but better in most ways.Nothing really happens much in the first thirty to forty minutes (kind of like the first one) and I was like "err, better get better" but it did. We see Katie a couple of times in the Katie WE know and love (pre-Demonic possession). She appears in the first half of the movie with Micah a few times, he is is intrigued by the video camera. Katie and her sister realise but try not to think that the Demon from their childhood is coming back. The main adult male character (whose name I forgot along with the others because of engrossed I was into the film) says to his partner/wife (Katie's sister) not to tell Katie and Micah. The Demon is after Hunter the baby and seems to want him bad, maybe he is meant to be the Anti-Christ and that's what Katie's late rich grandmothers deal was with the Devil that he could have the first male born in the family. The film features less character development from the first one, but there still is some. You start off not knowing which new character to like, the dad, the mom, step daughter, nanny, baby or dog. I grew attached to the step daughter, baby and dog.The film is a sequel and a prequel, mostly a prequel until the last five minutes. The ending suggests that there could be another sequel, which there most likely will be. But as long as this series doesn't turn into a new franchise with one every year (even though the first was filmed three/four years ago). If it does then everyone will get probably good to bad. With the film on the bigger budget ($2.7 million I believe) there were more scare features, but not predicable ones. A great scene is when the mom is in the kitchen and suddenly all of the cupboards and draws open like in a super-evil "Poltergeist" way. The mother gets dragged out of the baby's bedroom and downstairs, escapes goes back up but then gets violently dragged back downstairs into the basement. Great effects as you couldn't see anything. The dog Abby gets seriously injured, but isn't confirmed dead at all. The demon attacks her and then the family take her to the vets, nothing is said except the Doctors are still checking up on her.Overview - Paranormal Activity 2 may start of slower than the first and feature less character development but is much more scarier and has more loud noises and unpredictable scares.9/10.This film is like Rec 2 compared the original, not as good but not bad either</fullReview>

When i heard there was going to be a second one i thought wow it will be very VERY hard to make that one just as scary as PA1. But they did it. Last night i saw PA2 and it was just as scary and good as part one. The concept was the same but still it felt refreshing. There were a couple of "jump out of your seat" moments and they totally worked. I also liked that the plot had a big connection to PA1.Usually second parts are bed news but in this case it turned out very good and i can't deny that i'm a little bit curious for maybe a PA3?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Nearly as Effective or Scary as the First Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 2 (2010) ** (out of 4) The original film pretty much came out of nowhere and struck a core with people who made it one of the surprise hits of the year. There's probably a pretty good shot that this sequel will make a lot of money but I can't help but think back to when I was walking out of the original movie thinking what a masterpiece I had just seen and before I hit the exit door I just knew they were going to try and cash in with a sequel. So, here we are and in the current film a happy couple bring home a new baby to their home that they share with another daughter. Soon they experience a break-in so they set up cameras to try and capture who did it if they try again. Sure enough something is going on but it's not human. I'm one who loved the original film as I thought it was masterful in building up great suspense and it worked because each new scene contained even more suspense than the previous one. This movie here is clearly just trying to match the power of the first movie and in the end it falls flat on its face for the most part. There are way too many "BOOM" moments where they try to scare us by having something fall or throwing a loud noise at us. I think the majority of people watching this film are going to be use to this type of movie so these cheap tricks aren't going to work. Each time one of these scenes happen you just sit there rolling your eyes. Another problem is that I never really felt we were watching actual footage of anything. Films like the first movie and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT make you feel like you're watching real footage but that really didn't happen here. Perhaps it's because there were so many cameras being used including scenes where multiple shots were used. Finally, the biggest and saddest problem is that the movie simply isn't very scary. I will admit that there's one terrific scene dealing with the mom trying to reach her child but this is pretty much the only sequence that matches anything in the original. We're given two endings to this film but neither one works and the final stuff just comes off incredibly lame, un-scary and boring. I'm not sure if we'll eventually see some alternate endings but the film certainly needed one. I think the actors, for the most part, did a good job in their roles and especially Sprague Grayden who plays the mother. The characters from the first film are worked into the story here but the twist just didn't work for me. PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 2 is like so many films that follow up great movies in that there's no real imagination and instead we're basically given a rehash of the previous film. There are a few good moments scattered throughout but in the end this comes as a major disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Worthy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So little news about the sequel, I had my doubts. Would it be a bloated budget with big effects but none of the primal charm of the original? Would the novelty be lost in revisiting the subject matter with a new director who might not "get" the material? Tonight I sat in on a screening and shockingly, against any reasonable odds, I am happy to report that 2 is probably the equal of the original. There are genuine scares, the same electric feeling in the audience, and a very jolting denouement. In some ways (plotting), it is actually superior.I will try to review this without major spoilers, but those who want to see it tabula rasa probably don't want to read this next paragraph (the rest is safe).Things start much as the first; we open outside a house and are introduced to the family living inside. The house is similar to the original, though not the same. This house is occupied by a family rather than a couple, and they have a daughter and brand new son as well as a dog and superstitious housekeeper. We don't hover in the bedroom as in the first; in this movie we hover in the newborn baby's room (which provides a different but still lingering kind of dread / suspense.) This house has a pool and interesting stuff happens there and elsewhere as the camera hypnotically sweeps by each night. None of the family living there are Katie Featherstone, the actress from the first movie who is known to appear in this movie, so we quickly realize this isn't a remake or a sequel. (In fact, it turns out to be a prequel, but I can't say much more than that without spoiling a MAJOR plot point... early on we learn, however, that this movie starts 60 days before the murder of Micah in the original movie. Suffice to say that this movie goes a long way to explaining what happened in the first movie. While the explanation is a bit pat and easily arrived at, I thought it was actually a very sly and clever way of explaining why the demon targeted Katie and Micah in the first movie. The movie ends with a shocking but highly satisfying dovetail with the first movie.. I'd say the ending tops the first movie.)We meet the family and get to know them in similar fashion to the first and slowly stuff happens. The family interprets a major messing up of the contents in the house as a break-in, so they install a bunch of motion detector cameras, which are then the POV of the movie for most of the duration. This family is initially mostly NOT believers in ghosts / demons, which helps to ground things as they seek reasonable explanations for the odd things that start to happen. There is one scene where way too much happens to the wife at once and it fails my idiot test (I would have run screaming out of the house and never returned), but then there is another explanation for why she doesn't reveal what she's seen (much to her regret.)About a third of the way in, I was concerned that the things that go bump in the night might grow repetitive in this second outing, but as complications ensued, my concerns quickly went away and I got SCARED. If you were jolted by / enjoyed the first one, I am confident you will feel much the same tingle about this one, especially in the second half. By the same token, if you didn't like the first, you probably needn't bother with this one, as it is largely a variation on the theme.If you haven't seen the first one, I'd recommend seeing it before you try this one because it will definitely help, particularly at the startling end, though it's not mandatory. Overall, this is one of those rare instances where the sequel may actually equal or even surpass the original. I don't know if this is going to become a franchise now (not sure where they go from here, but then that was true after the first), but if they can keep producing movies like this, I'll keep going.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An very superior sequel that had a handful of jump scares that will keep you up at night, if not you have no soul. To visual style, acting, pace, suspense and ending it does it better than the original to shocking results, this is the best haunted house flick in years! This series got me again because when it starts it starts out pretty normally like you were watching some strangers home videos then strange things start to happen and gets creepy and escalates the terror and somewhat raises the bar for the haunted house genre, believe me you will see nothing as scary this year alone or maybe even for the next couple of years because for me I left the theater shaken with goosebumps and breathless! Don't listen to the haters like Roger Ebert because this is good rare horror that you don't see much at all at the theaters these days and I can't freaking wait for the third movie which they better make because this is now my favorite horror series. The other thing that was clever is how they tied their story with the original and the twist was messed up and disturbing, this is a must see for every halloween! GO SEE IT NOW! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well here i am straight out of the theater and ready to put on the world wide web what i think about one of the most attended horror movies of this year .There is not much to say besides that the movie does place the viewer into a certain form of discomfort during and after the movie.I've seen the first movie and it scared me a few times,really enjoyed it. But the second one was really close to make me have a heart attack . That one has the full effect of a ghost movie like in the 80's ( The Entity ).If you want to see a movie with your friends or alone,if you want to have shivers when you step out of the theater. Then i highly recommend paranormal activity 2,you wont even touch your popcorn !! and when you come home you will be in Hyper Alert mode and listen to every squeaks in your house for the hole night .</fullReview>

Rinse repeat for the duration of the movie.The ending is also rather disappointing, and ill-thought out on the directors part.Despite this I give the movie a 5, due to somewhat reasonable acting.
