		<shortDescription>Surreal perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's very rare that I see a movie that is truly, in all aspects, perfect.For example, while The Princess Bride ranks pretty high on my list of movies I'd want to spend the rest of my life watching, I fully realize that the camera angles and special effects of that movie are just plain bad. And while Fear &amp; Loathing In Las Vegas gets a perfect 10 from me, it still completely lacks plot. And so on.Arizona Dream, however, is different.The last movie I saw that was truly, in all aspects, perfect was Dog Day Afternoon, a 1975 true story starring Al Pacino and Chris Sarandon. For the longest time, it's been my obsession, my movified bible, everything other movies should aspire to be. And as of today, Dog Day Afternoon finally has competition in my personal top ten: Emir Kusturica's masterpiece very near surpasses Lumet's vision of captivating dialogue, insane details, and dodgy man-groping.Let's change the subject for a bit. Do you know the scene in Gilliam's Twelve Monkeys, where Bruce Willis is in his cage, and a hamster is running inside a wheel in the corner? Don't say yes, because you don't. It's inaudible. It's impossible to see. But it's there. Kusturica, much like Gilliam, is willing to make his world more detailed than your wildest dreams. His backgrounds are filled with symbolism and surrealism, his dark corners filled with soft puppies. And like Gilliam, he can make you cry with laughter, your only worry in the world being, 'how will I remember all these great quotes in the morning?'But unlike Gilliam, Kusturica has the power to, barely a scene after the happy happy joy, make you sit there in stunned silence, your number one worry in the world being, 'how will I get my brain to understand the sheer tragedy that is unfolding here?'. Your will find yourself thinking, 'how do I get my mind to comprehend how perfectly this music fits the dialogue?'. Your eyes will follow the camera angles, the expressions of the insanely lovable characters, the many things happening in foreground and background-and you know, you just KNOW, that you will have to watch the movie again, and again, and again.If you're a fan of movies such as Big Fish and Amélie, movies about people finding happiness and warmth in a world of surreal ambition, Arizona Dream will be your next obsession. But even if you think massive explosions and a grunting Bruce Willis are the only thing that can make a movie worth watching, you will still want to give this movie a chance- for the 'explosions' it causes will far, far surpass anything you've EVER experienced before.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Arizona set fairy tale about growing up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, the movie Arizona Dream gives a great account of how dangerous it can be to be caught up in your dreams and the little worlds those dreams can create and if you don't move beyond, you're dead alive. The only character that seems to be able to step out of his own little world and capable of reflecting is Axel. All throughout the film nobody else changes, but Axel. Leo, a caring but wallowed in guilt character, can not see his nephew as a real person but just a boy who'd take over his business once he dies. He's so caught up in his own version of reality that he doesn't see that Axel has grown up in the meantime and may want to figure out life for himself. Leo tries to shove down his world as a ready-made future for Axel, who has none of it. At the same time, Axel can grow beyond this when Leo commits suicide and offers to help his uncle in his car-dealer business. Axel seems to have a deep appreciation for life ? a trait no one else seems to have in the movie. Elaine is completely caught up in her childhood dream for flying in order to overcome her own depression. The only thing that matters for her is her own survival. She is unaware how much she steals any independence from her stepdaughter and her self-serving nature makes her empty ? a trait that Axel recognizes by the end of the film. In contrast, Axel is first drawn to this quirky world of flying high as it seems real, but once he discovers that flying is only a form of displacement for Elaine, he sees through her and she looses her magnetic energy for him. Grace is the only other person capable of growing besides Axel in the movie. In her first appearances she seems like a two-dimensional depressed character totally overshadowed by a sexy stepmother and consequently too depressed to be more than a little destructive animal. At the same time she seems to relate to others at least emotionally ? her destructiveness at least seems like a form of connection to others. Towards the end of the movie, she can grow beyond herself and can start showing love and appreciation ? the other side of her negative emotions and thus turns into a real person. But this transformation is too much for her psyche as she doesn't know how to live a healthy life, and even though Axel recognizes the real person in her, she chooses to kill herself ? she has no choice, really. Axel ? who at least makes the effort to connect with characters, symbolizes the strength one needs to grow up and beyond what is around him. He's the most involved emotionally but because he's not caught up in his dream ? or because his dream is abstract enough, he can stay detached while being attached. He's capable of caring and he's the one who's always there for more adult people who need help ? and he delivers: One thing I was sure about: The moment my parents died, my childhood was gone forever. And it was gone forever, he becomes more of a grown up than most grown ups around him. He knows how to keep a distance even when Grace abuses him and there's only one point in the movie when he almost looses it ? when Grace invites him to play Russian roulette. For me, the Eskimo scene wonderfully sums up why we are here and that's something I think Axel finds for himself by the end of the film. Instead of the existential questions brought by the first Eskimo scene ? how do you survive by love; nature can kill you and save you; why do we replicate our lives in inhuman conditions; ? in the last Eskimo scene he just talks about fish with his uncle. The message, for me at the end was that instead of asking all these questions you just get on with your life, learn a trade you love and your life grows into the answers. At the same time, coming to understand this, you may have to go through a real emotional discovery of love, dreams, reincarnation, death ? and if at the end you survive and strong enough, life might be worth living. It seems that Axel was lucky to have had the guidance he received from his parents, but he had to experience them through his own skin. That's how he embarks at living in New York as his Mom suggested that New York has one of the eight magnetic pulls. But initially he chooses a job that not only allows daydreaming but also fosters it; he tags fish for an organization. Later, he's taken or dragged into a more real life, but a life still of dreams and not his own yet ? he moves first into his uncle's dreams and then into Elaine's and Grace's. First he has to discover responsibility by rejecting his uncle and he has to discover love and death through love. It's only after these experiences that he can leave other people's lives and dreams and start his own. It's a wonderful fairy tale where a young boy wades through the quotations from his parents to discover his own place and soul. "Good morning, Columbus." My mother's eternal words, reminding me America was already discovered, and that daydreaming was a long way from life's truths." "For 15 years, he'd smooth down the road between Mexico and Arizona, and every morning he'd be out there looking for footprints in the dirt. But my father always said that work was like a hat you put on your head. And even without pants, you didn't have to be ashamed of your ass."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this almost by accident at the age of 16 (it was the only thing on at the small town movie theater I was at, and hell, it had Johnny Depp in it, so why not?), and fell in love with the story, the acting and the directing.Opened up a whole new world to me, one where movies weren't just "Hollywood spectaculars" or "romantic comedies", and I promise, if nothing else, it'll give you something to think about, and something to discuss. I'm sure its not for everyone, but what movie is? If you can't feel for at least one of the characters in this movie, you're dead. Seriously. The characters may seem offbeat, but each presents something to the story, an element which is more true to real life than first appears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sexy, faultless European masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen this movie, I felt rather strange. This bubbly feeling in my gut kept me up in the night. I felt I had to do something for this film, confess my love in a letter, send it flowers, buy it Champagne. It left me gasping. I wanted more. So the rest of the night I watched the special features on the DVD.I realise that it is sad to have emotions about a film that would usually be reserved for living beings, however I am completely unashamed. If this movie was a man, I'd do unspeakable things to it. I don't care what it's "about". I don't give a monkey's about any "plot" that it may or may not have. I have not searched for anything that everybody conditioned to Hollywood films, however good or bad they may be, inevitably searches for in a film. Why do you need to be spoonfed? Can you not just completely let go and enjoy a work of art for its mere beauty?Sorry, journeying into pretentious land. This is undoubtedly my absolute favourite Johnny Depp film, it used to be a toss up between Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Dead Man, but I admit that this surpasses them by a fraction. I'd actually like to say that I preferred Dead Man, but I, um, didn't. Sorry. I feel I have cheated on Dead Man. There are certain scenes in Arizona Dream that show things about Johnny Depp as a performer that I never would have suspected. In this film he stepped into a realm shared by characters in the films of Fellini and Brunuel. It pleases me that he can do art house as fantastically as this and do mainstream as well, although I do not entirely approve of the stuff that is too mainstream (I.E. Pirates). His character is beautifully complex, he is a kook, but a sexy kook, and he is everything else besides. The other performances are also wonderful. Gallo is a nutcase, Taylor needs therapy, Dunaway is at the same time tyrannical and naive. Sure the characters contradict themselves, but don't we? It just keeps it all the more desirable and fascinating.For anybody who appreciates surrealist art, this is a must see. For anybody who appreciates Johnny Depp, there is no question that this film is absolutely essential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Weirdness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i just read a few of the other reviews and found them quite entertaining. first off, anyone who makes a comment such as Kusturica having lack of direction has obviously been weened on Hollywood fluff. Kusturica is a master director so pull your heads out of the sand or your butt's please! some people comment that the film is confusing. well, yes it is sometimes confusing, it's supposed to be! that's half the beauty of it. is there a law that says films have to make sense at all times?!?!? geeez. considering the title "Arizona Dream" you'd think the viewer would be half expecting something maybe....dreamlike?! correct me if i'm wrong but films are essentially entertainment and escapism are they not? then why do people constantly complain that a movie isn't historically accurate, or maybe too detatched from reality, doesn't follow a linear time path, or is "too weird". anyways, this movie has an excellent cast that work very well together. it has a totally original story and the soundtrack is outstanding. i don't agree with laying out the story line in a review so i'll just leave it a surprise. isn't more fun to watch a movie when you have no idea what is going to happen? for those people who are open to something refreshing and original, seek out this movie. it's a great little adventure well worth taking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What dreams are made of...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies only work if we let ourselves carry away by them. They present a surrealistic imagination world that comes from the mind of their creators. They are hard to watch, especially when they mix real characters that live their lives sometimes awaken, or inside one big dream or their own dreams.Axel Blackmar (Johnny Depp) is a dreamer, and an unusual example of personal choices. His parents died and he went to New York, to work with fish. He could have sold cars with his uncle Leo (Jerry Lewis), but he's there, talking with that monotonous voice about what he does. Maybe it was a simple dream, where an Eskimo catches a fish with two eyes on the same side, and tells his kids to go out with their dog so he and his wife can?And the kid with the dog allow to see an orange balloon that seems to go from Alaska to New York, where Alex sleeps in a truck. "Wake up, Columbus", the words of his mother and Axel's hope to find something in the land already discovered by that man.Alongside fish flying through the air, we join Axel to be the best man of his uncle's wedding. With his friend Paul Leger (Vincent Gallo), the untiring chats go from movies to philosophies about cakes, pies and bananas. Paul is an actor: "I'm having a great performance on Friday", he says. "It's an audition", Axel says to humiliate him. The truth is that it's not even an audition. This stuff lived by Axel is a story for us, but is a personal rediscovering and rethought of decisions in life for the character. When he sees Elaine (Faye Dunaway) he feels something strong, but doesn't know how to call it. Days later he becomes the lover of a woman decades older than him. Elaine's daughter, Grace (Lili Taylor) is also there, and it doesn't goes long until Axel finds himself in a crossroad between the heart of two women, that as he describes them, are "too similar and big to be in the same world".David Atkin's story and screenplay comes plagued of phrases that could come out of a lunatic's mouth, but they fit in the film's context and twist your head at maximum. "I've got to climb?It's a long way to the moon"; "I'm gonna live forever until I become a turtle?They have infinite lives", besides scenes of well known movies in crucial moments. And what music (Goran Bregovic)! And what editing (Andrija Zafranovic)! And what cinematography (Vilko Filac)! And what director! Known for his originality, recognized director Emir Kusturica puts his own signature to his movie, collaborating in the story he must have dreamed a little to; giving life to the dream with his flying camera, full of unexpected turns and in love of its surroundings. What he achieves is greater words, although not everybody could understand it, and, for that matter, appreciate it.And his actors?Jerry Lewis in a total comprehension of his character, and so involved in his work that you wouldn't believe it. So incredibly likable in one of those roles we never give much importance to. Faye Dunaway?Wow! She got to work with some of these actors later, but here, as an old woman in character and, with respect, in person, she maintains that virtue of creating uniqueness, with her laughs, smiles and way of saying things. Lili Taylor was the most interesting character here. The silent daughter that could be crazy but no one can really tell. With imagination and freedom, Taylor makes her character believable and not as overacted as it might be. Vincent Gallo, who I respect mostly as a director and as an actor that does what he wants, the ability he has had to choose his roles is visible here again; as he shines without lights to help him. A wonderful performance his fans shouldn't miss.But Depp?How can I explain? I've said it a lot, surely, but I will repeat it. He's like a magician, but not with the cards and the hat and the tricks. He is with his face, his looks, his way of talking, his perfection of movement?But it's not really something technical: "in the acting world, Johnny Depp is a magician". I'm sure he still has plenty of that for us, but here is where he let us know first.In one scene, Vincent Gallo's character Paul, an actor, requests that no one touches his face, because it's important. "Do you think they touch Brando's face? Do you think they touch Pacino's, De Niro's? Do you think they touch Johnny Depp's face? I don't know then, but not know; and if they did before, they shouldn't have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun, Dreamlike Comedy that many have yet to see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yugoslavian director Emir Kusterica is most well known for his critically acclaimed international films like "Time of the Gypsies" and "Underground"(1995). He did one English language film in Ameica. The film "Arizona Dream" is a highly underrated film that people have seem to forgotten. Which is a shame, since it has an amazing cast of well known actors like Johnny Depp, Vincent Gallo, Faye Dunaway, Jerry Lewis and Lili Taylor. Jonny Depp plays Axel a young twenty something dreamer. In the beginning of the film he has a dream about an Eskimo family. He works at a dock cleaning fish and often drifts away from reality to dreams. Him and his friend Paul (Vincent Gallo) drive to Arizona to visit Axel's uncle Mr. Sweetie (Jerry Lewis)who's a car salesman. I must say Depp and Lewis make a great comic duo. Axel and Paul end up staying with the wealthy Elaine Stalker and her suicidal daughter Grace (Lili Taylor). Axel starts dating Mrs. Stalker, but at the same time has strange feelings for her daughter. The film is very surreal and dreamlike. Mrs. Stalker obsessively dreams of flying, so her and Axel build a flying machine that resembles a Right Brothers style airplane. It's hilarious when the plain repeatedly malfunctions. There's also a floating fish throughout the movie, turtles, an attempted pantie hose suicide and a weird sex scene where Jonny Depp crows like a rooster (must be seen to be believed). Warner Bros. felt that the film was too European. So the film collected dust on their shelf and had a poor limited release. The film does have a magic-realist tragi-comedy style like Emir Kusterica's other Eastern European films. Co writer David Atkins later went on to write the screenplay for Novacaine. Also producer Claudie Ossard has also helped produce other bizarre films like "City of Lost Children". "Arizona Dream" is a quirky and strange masterpiece. Track down a VHS copy, or better yet the 20 minute longer international version. It's quite a cult sensation in Europe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when I first realized that you really learn what people are like when they're drunk. There are the happy lushes who love the world &amp; fill it with hugs &amp; sloppy kisses when they've had too much. Then there are the ones who get mean, real mean - violent even, all the rage coming out. Some movies bring out the same thing in people. This is one of them. Personally, I think it's a superb movie, but then I was always a lovesick sloppy drunk, too.What more can I say? Everyone in this movie, especially Jerry Lewis is a thousand times better than they have ever been in any other movie. And Kusturica? Not only today's greatest living director, but one of the most creative &amp; original visionaries ever to work in the medium. Breathtaking!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They say that "Arizona Dream" is Kusturica's best work because it is American, well, it's not that American despite it was filmed there and probably is about the American dream, it is just a story of people's lives, like in all Kusturica's films, and it's just a great work of a great film director, not depending on geographical factors. The characters aren't sexy lady journalists or successful businessmen , they are those who we call usual people - but no one in the world is usual for we aren't made at a factory, and daily routine is much more interesting, and much more humane then any sci-fi-hi-tech-futuristic stuff. all the characters are a bit crazy and so is everything around. There's some magic in there , and something tragic, and everyone's little private dreams, useless and sweet , and relations between people which seem to be one thing but are absolutely another, though the people tied by them may never notice them or never admit, and love all the way through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A curio that delights in specific scenes and lines but fails as a dramatic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Axel is happy with his life in New York, having long since left what remains of his family behind him in Arizona. When his Uncle Leo is getting married, Axel is forced back home by his friend Paul. He finds his Uncle marrying a much younger woman and, while he wishes to leave as soon as he arrives, he finds himself staying around and selling cars with his Uncle ? a job he maintains he has to desire to do. It is on the lot that he meets the dysfunctional mother and stepdaughter Elaine and Grace, the former of which he falls for and begins a relationship that evolves into an obsession with building a flying machine. Meanwhile, in stark contrast to his current desert setting, Axel's dreams continue to centre on an Inuit family and a flat fish with its face all on one side.Well over a decade ago now I used to make much more of an effort to get to my local cinema. At that time I lived near an independent art-house style cinema that, while it showed all the big releases on its two screens, it did also give over time to smaller independent films. It was here that I saw Arizona Dream ? a film that I then never saw or heard of for another ten or so years until for some reason I remembered it and decided to watch it again. I couldn't remember much about it apart from a few scenes, nor if I had liked it or not so to all intents and purposes I was coming to it fresh. I say this but by the end of the film I had certainly remembered why I could recall specific scenes and my enjoyment of them but had no strong memory of the total film ? the reason being that the film is at its best in small chunks but fails to work as a whole.The story is this wonderfully off-the-wall tale of love and dreams that fires out outrageous characters with abandon, allowing for many memorable scenes and quotable lines. It is comic, creative, silly and enjoyable. But it is also a bit tiring. The scenes don't come together as I would have liked and the general air of silliness undermines how much I was able to get emotionally involved and care about where the story was going. That it is almost two and a half hours long only serves to highlight this and it really does feel indulgent and unwilling to give anything up. The fault for this certainly lies with Kusturica as writer and director. He certainly has a creative flair to him, an ear for dialogue and an eye for a shot but his approach fragments the film and he doesn't manage to pull the heart of the viewer along with him. He does get good turns from his cast well, all of whom trusted him and seemed to go wherever he wanted them to go. Depp is wonderful as always, so willing to go with it, so willing to try anything and it pays off by him being good here. Lewis was a surprise to me then and was again on this viewing, he is solid in his character and he has this great presence that holds the attention. Gallo is also good although he is helped by how many of the better scenes he is the focal point in. Dunaway and Taylor both deliver their characters well and it is just a shame that their characters are the more "difficult" ones to like within the film ? I think they did well though, I just acknowledge that I struggled with them due to their characters.As with all cult films there will be those that see great beauty in this film and love it beyond all reason. I salute them and I envy them to a point and, while I disagree with them, this does not make them wrong and me right. However to the majority of casual viewers this film will come over as a total curio piece that provides delight and enjoyment in specific scenes but doesn't work as a total film and certainly doesn't have enough to it to justify the overlong running time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreaming up a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arizona Dream is about the American Dream, to achieve the American dream you gotta have a beautiful woman, and to get that you need to own a good automobile, in this case a Cadillac, as Uncle Leo puts it. Kusturica is a true artist, he paints in pictures, he makes the bizarre and surrealistic seem natural and plausible. The story unfolds with a lot of unexpected turns, although Axel gently warns us; "If you see a gun in act one, be sure it will go off in Act 3" he's quoting Tjechov, and yes it's a wild film, it's full of hope, dreams, despair and sorrow. It's a bit like a Russian play, it's got it's share of madness; Axel dreams of becoming an Eskimo, the problem for Axel is that he's not the only one with a dream, almost everyone's got one. The older brother's is about acting, Uncle Leo's is about piling Cadillacs in a tower to the moon, the eccentric widow dreams about flying and her depressed daughter about being reborn as a turtle, since she thinks turtle's are always happy. A remarkable film, a European masterpiece. Don't miss out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie. Having only seen it once, and just an hour ago, this may not be the kind of review this film deserves. One question that goes through my mind is that why have i not seen or heard of this movie before? It's pure genius, this is exactly what needs to be in a good film. It's so deliciously quirky, and passionately engaging. Makes you wonder if we're not all insane.Director Emir Kusturica and David Atkins provided a quirky, funny and surprisingly sad story, in which the characters were the organs and the direction the soul. The central theme in this film were Axel's dreams, and how Axel saw the world interpreted through his dreams. And the film revolved around the message that Axel's dream world and the real world were not as different, things that seemed insane or weird happened all the time.The absurdity of this film is unparalleled. *spoilers* Take the first scene at Elaine's house where Grace tries to kill herself with her pantyhose, or when she lets her turtle walk over the dinner. And the flying scene during Elaine's birthday when Paul is re-acting the North By Northwest scene. The absurdity is the purest form of comedy, not the pathetic slapstick you see these days in the Adam Sandler flicks. Kusturica directed comedy so well, and the actors did a splendid job on following his lead.Emotions and atmospheres were represented with such vigour, vitality and craftmanship, emotionally intense scenes took grip of the audience and didn't let them go. I was scared to breathe in case i might miss something. There was an urgency about the whole movie that made you almost uncomfortable. Well played, well directed. Nice music too.I can't say what the meaning of this film is, i would have to watch it a few more times. But I think I've just become a fan of Lili Taylor's. I recommend it to anyone who wants a breath of fresh air, a truly funny and moving movie that you won't forget very soon, unless you're into the Adam Sandler stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... and not liking this movie is a error in taste.There's nothing else to add.We see here that the life of an artist has everything to do with his production, and that it is this very production that makes our lives artistic.Actors are splendid, the script is a masterpiece, the music is exactly what the movie needed, and the whole thing is a beauty bomb. When it explodes in your face, you can just look at it, watch the fire, and wish you'll still be there to get it another time. You can't heal from that artistic injury.This movie is as artistically rich as Brad Pitt is wealthy.If I had to keep only one movie in my life, that would be it.A must see, and a must see again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arizona Dream is a movie that has Eskimos and a flying fish.It seems like a dream.And that dream includes Jerry Lewis.It's a surreal ride into a mind of Johnny Depp and all those weird people in his life.Depp is Axel Blackmar who comes to Arizona to his uncle Leo Sweetie's (Lewis) wedding.He's taken there by Paul Leger (Vincent Gallo).Paul's a movie buff.In a movie theater he speaks the lines of Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci in Raging Bull.And he does the crop duster scene made famous by Cary Grant in North by Northwest.In Arizona Axel meets a mature woman and her daughter.The mature woman is Faye Dunaway (Elaine Stalker) and the daughter is Lili Taylor (Grace Stalker).Emir Kusturica is the man behind Arizona Dream (1993).Johnny Depp was a young talent in 1993.The role of young Axel is just the right part for the man who picks unconventional roles.The funny man Jerry Lewis plays a part less funny this time as the car dealer uncle.But he can do that.He can mix the comic and the tragic matters very well.We all saw that in The King of Comedy (1983).Dunaway and Taylor are terrific as the quarreling mother and daughter.All the other people in this movie do a great job as well.In a minor part there's Michael J.Pollard who drives Jerry Lewis crazy.The music played in this movie is wonderful.There's Bésame Mucho, In The Deathcar is beautiful.Some people would call this a weird movie.I would call it...a weird movie.But sometimes weird is good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another of Kusturica's masterpieces, after Underground and Crna macka, biely macor. The poetic of his narrating is present, however, this time projected into completely different atmosphere.Fay Dunaway and Johny Depp are amazing - their performance is of the rank of the classical music solos.Music is one of the best I have heard and seen - with the Piano, Pulp Fiction, Natural Born Killers... Camera and editing also rullez. I can't recommend a movie more than this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Borderline Genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd have to start by saying that the first time I saw this film I left the theatre confused: I thought the film was very funny and clever, yet I felt sad at the end. I know more than a couple of people who thought the movie was mediocre or even downright boring, but I myself thought this film is just borderline genius.It's very uncommon for fantasy films to hit the theatres these days, but fantasy like this is hard to come across at all. I find it difficult to accurately describe the movie, mostly because I find no other similar examples to use as a frame of reference. Most of the scenes are absurd and completely wicked, yet the film flows in a very natural manner never losing touch with firm ground. The spectator does, however, take off in a series of bizarre events in very visually appealing scenarios and becomes so entangled in the fantastic atmosphere that it reaches a point when no matter how silly or absurd an event, it becomes perfectly acceptable. All of this of course, has a generous amount of humour mixed in. But this isn't your typical comedy, most of the laughs in this film work in a nonsensical, satirical manner that even monty python would find silly. And it works.If you come across this one do see it. This might be a flick that doesn't fit everyone, but if you enjoy it half as much as I did, you'll end up watching it more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Cinema!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man and Fredrick Thor Fredrickson's Cold Fever I knew that there was going to be a great pairing of acting abilities. This, of course, being that of Johnny Depp and Lili Taylor I was not disappointed. The film, at first, absorbs the viewer into a translucent though engaging tale of exploration into the mind and soul. This makes the viewer belive momentarily that the film that they are watching is going to be fanciful and mystic. Hence there at first is no bond between the characters and the Viewer. However, reality becomes less and less of a point or actuality in the film as it paces through the lives of the characters centering on Johnny Depp's charecter. An ifinitity is subconsiously drawn with him as we watch. Faye Dunnaway, who, at first, seemed utterly mis-cast is brilliant, her potrayal of the pre-menopausal cradle-snatcher is brilliant. Jerry Lewis also makes the film great as gritty realism exists in wealth. It feels like there is a piece of everyone in it, there is depression, love, life and death and the exploration of time. Although the film seems like a dream on celluloid it also makes the viewer understand and more importantly empathise with the charecters and at the end the sadness is alleviated by the theme of life, that life goes on, almost in circles. To anyone who has not yet been seriously touched by a film, watch this. It might change you're mind. 10/10 p.s. Watch for the balloon scene at the beginning!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eskimos, Magic Fish, Russian Roulette, Flying Machines, Love?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's weird going from something as dense and epic in scope as director Emir Kusturica's "Underground", to the fairy tale tragic romance of "Arizona Dream". Weirder still is the cast of Johnny Depp, Jerry Lewis, Faye Dunaway, Lili Taylor, and Vincent Gallo.The word "dream" comes up at least a dozen times in this movie, characters recounting dreams, or the film seamlessly showing them on screen, and appropriately it begins with a ten minute dream sequence(You only know it's a dream sequence because you're told it is afterwards), of an Eskimo in the snowy wilderness, catching a strange fish with both eyes on the same side, the Eskimo later becomes sick and is nursed back to health by his wife. From there we meet the dreamer Depp, who tags fish in New York, a job he loves because, "Most people think I count fish, but I don't. I look at them. I look at their souls and read their dreams and then I let them into my dreams." Then aspiring actor cousin Vinccent Gallo shows up, and asks Depp to come back to Arizona with him for his Uncle Jerry Lewis's wedding. Depp goes back and accepts a job selling Cadillacs, his uncles dream for them, until he meets an eccentric mother/daughter pair, the suicidal turtle obsessed accordion playing Lili Taylor and her vivacious, flighty, sexually aggressive mother, the latter Depp becomes immediately enamored with. Depp and Dunaway begin a very matter of fact and all consuming relationship (he leaves his job and uncles house and refuses to leave). After hearing of Dunaway's dreams to fly as a young girl, Depp decides and spends most of the movie, attempting to build her a flying machine. Meanwhile, Lili Taylor is sabotaging the machine, and Vincent Gallo is busy practicing his acting chops (his recreation of the crop duster scene from North By Northwest is one of the best all time comedy moments anywhere).All good performances, Gallo and Taylor, outshining the others though. The writing is also really good, mostly voice over by Depp, it definitely has a Jean Piere Jeaunut vibe (all the little details and phrases) "My dad always said that work was like a hat you put on your head. And even if you didn't have pants , you didn't have to walk down the street ashamed of your ass as long as you had a hat... " or " what's the point of breathing if somebody already tells you the difference between an apple and a bicycle? If I bite a bicycle and ride an apple, then I'll know the difference." The latter quote sums of the naiveté of the main character and the flaw that makes the tragedy. Depps relationships are passionate, sincere, but essentially child like, he doesn't know what to name how he fells about Dunaway so it must be "love". While Dunaway and her daughter are more two halves of the same person, stuck in an isolated country house, both with half the maturity and vitality the other needs.For the most part the movie is all comic smiles, and surreal shots of fish flying in the sky at random, but towards the end, the film takes somber tones, as the dream/relationships end.Not as dense and surreal as I had expected, but it does capture accurately the magical sensation of first love, especially with someone significantly older (without stepping on the toes of similar films like Harold And Maud or focusing too heavily on taboo).There were a few moments of emotional disconnect where the characters actions make little if any literal sense (the Russian roulette scene), but do give a greater sense of the contradictory emotions which almost all of the characters deal with, except Gallo, whose clearly just there for fun.Arizona Dream caught me off guard, the political allegory of Underground is replaced here with a very internal story of dreamy sensations, fleeting passions, conflicting dreams, conflicting loves, growing up, and magical fish. It's not great, but I definitely connected for personal reasons. If you liked Amelie, or Emir Kusturica, or any of the actors mentioned it's worth checking out.</fullReview>

The textured layers of raw realism, the compounded fluff of unfounded love..it truly is but a dream. Surely all who experience this film (I say experience, for one CAN NOT merely sit and let this one flow through one's head as powdery wafting nothingness!) surely all will feel the angst and tremor of love lost. And love is the golden ring we all seek... whether we admit it as our weakness or not. It is the bread of life, and life is for learning.This is why there IS cinema. Devour it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the best of Kusturica's, Arzona Dream puts you in front of many questions that one could have. The movie does not tend to be about philosophy, and it has not a pathetic line. It just shows things. Watch it and say that many other should see it. I first watched it in 1995, but I must confess I need here and then to watch it again, say, at least once a year. It is addictive to see good humor, irony, parody, decent comments on symbols, interesting images and eroticism, in its pure way, but very subtle. What can I say more, it's a must for all, and people should not underestimate it. Johnny Depp is great, Faye Dunaway is marvelous, Lili Taylor is like a genius here, Jerry Lewis is a Lord, as always, and Vincent Gallo shows his talent to a very high rate. It would impress many kinds of people, is more than most of movies can offer: it is a masterpiece. Watch it! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a long way to the moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life can be hard work, especially when you try to make a living counting fish, like Johnny Depp's character Axel, or selling cars, like Leo Sweetie (Jerry Lewis) and Paul Leger (Vincent Gallo), or trying to fly, like Elaine Stalker (Faye Dunaway). Bishop Milton Wright once said that if God had wanted us to fly, he would have made us birds or angels. Take it from him. He was father to Wilbur and Orville after all. In "Arizona Dream", Elaine tries to take off anyway, simply because it's her dream. Emir Kusturica more or less did the same thing, trying to make an impossible movie about Eskimos, a Cadillac dealership and the Man in the Moon. "Arizona Dream" isn't exactly a polished work of art. It's more a ragbag of ideas. But then, these ideas are among the finest you will find. So it may be a ragbag, but it's a ragbag bursting with energy and passion and fine lines and acting, as good as it gets. The cast is superb. Needless to say, Johnny Depp makes a great confused youngster, with early signs of the existential paranoia seen in "Fear and Loathing". Vincent Gallo, you've never seen him so healthy-looking and clean-cut, and chances are you won't ever again. Lili Taylor has her Parker Posey moment as pretty, amazing, self-destructive Grace, and if you don't know that's a compliment, you don't know anything. Towards the end, there is a scene that's literally to die for. Riding with his dying uncle Leo, Axel looks out the back window as the ambulance speeds away from Paul and Millie, Leo's gorgeous twenty-something bride (Paulina Porizkova). Billy Idol is singing "In the Deathcar". Caught in the nowhere land between life and death, Leo mumbles: "I gotta start climbing. It's a long way, Axel. It's a long way to the moon."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arizona Dream, screenplay by David Atkins and directed by Emir Kusturica is an absurd comedy with a surreal outlook on the intermingling lives of some very unusual characters. Johnny Depp stars as Axel Blackmer who works in New York state tagging fish and monitoring their behaviors. He is obsessed with fish and if they dream and when. The movie follow the characters through their quirky encounters and relationships which may or may not be in its entirety a fishes dream, as the simultaneous flashes into a surreal world suggest. Arizona dream was far from a hit when Warner Bros. released it in 1993, but it is definitely a movie worth looking into.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All times film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film you will find many others; it is an allusion to lots of other films and to the concept many people must have of America living outside of it, and even inside, acquired through films. The film pictures a coming to age experience as Kusturica has done it before, an initiation rite for a boy who discovers manhood, death, love and destiny. Performances are excellent and Kusturica's style seems a bit more accessible, maybe because this one is an english spoken film and the mise-en-scene is much more familiar than the yugoslavian and gypsy films. This film is worth the time of seeing it a couple of times, if you like entertainment you will certainly find it, and if you know about film history it will sure give you rejoice. Kusturica makes it seem so easy to create deep, meaningful films, even though they are complex, the sense of what they transmit goes right through the screen; emotions keep flowing through the film and sense of humor as well, reality and dreams mix in what seems to be a combination of Tarkovski, Bunuel, and others . This is true cinema, a film of all times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Watching Someone Else's Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is kind of like across between watching a foreign film, one made in a culture completely alien to your own, and watching someone else's dreams.It is such an bizarre film that I doubt some people would even be able to get through it. I myself had to take it in two parts. But many parts of it are strangely beautiful, and there are a few moments in the latter half of the film of astonishing power.Further more, Kusturica's imagery is absolutely stunning. From a shot of Axel in a red rain coat looking out over the sea near the beginning to one of him lying down with a litter of abandoned puppies in a empty shop at the end, these will stay with you.And of course Kusturica couldn't have a better subject than Depp. He was going on thirty when this came out, but he's has never seemed more innocent. To be honest, its a flawless performance. I don't hand that out a lot, but, in a deeply flawed movie, he's perfect. He never once lets us out of Axel's dreamy, strange world. There's no "winking at the camera" no matter how much it may love him. He gives the movie an emotional center.Its a film that some people will hate, a few will love, and most will simply be perplexed by. Personally, I think you should watch it, not necessarily because you'll like it, but to have an opinion on it.</fullReview>

For example when the fish he sees goes and bangs staff around, like the cars or that thing he builds for her to fly. what does it symbolize (if it symbolizes anything).(i'm supposed to write a minimum of 10 lines so i will just write staff for a while.

One day he meets an eccentric widow (Dunaway) and her unstable daughter (Taylor). He ends up living in their house and having an affair with Dunaway's character. It's refreshing to see a movie in which a woman over 50 gets to be beautiful and sexy, and Faye Dunaway really makes the most of her part. The only thing that irritates me with "Arizona Dream", is that Kusturica sometimes tries too hard to be strange.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This comment is for the "director's cut of 140 or so minutes. I understand there is a twenty minute shorter initial theatrical release. This film seems overlong compared to the "standard," but it is hard to imagine what could be taken out. There is also a four hour cut, which I hope to see some day. This has a strange tone. The space isn't fully filled narratively or visually, so you might get bored. But what happens here is that the narrative elements have room to breath; some of the actors know how to create echoes in this cave: Johnny, Lili and sometimes Jerry. The others know what this is about and how to shrink and rebound dynamically. Its all about drifting with balloons, swimming with fish and baying with dogs, and the insertions are sometimes obtrusive. Allow this and you'll be okay.What you'll experience here are three levels of artifice:? there's the business of narrative folding: its dreams, visions, yearnings, performances and salesmanship, all "causing" the others in a multinest.? the distillation of noir agency in the aforementioned balloon-fish-dog metaphor, the three pieces of which are related to us in a "movie within," provided before the credits of the movie proper.? distinct references to other, "outer" movies. There are dozens of these, the largest being associated with Gallo's character. He is an aspiring actor, and what we see him do (in an amateur show) is an "impression" of Cary Grant's scene in "North By Northwest" where all he does is look at his watch (for a very long time) then be chased by an airplane. He copies other movies as well, but this one is woven into the movie proper. I suppose some of the extra four hour stuff hits the other films he acts: "Raging Bull," "Wizard of Oz" and "The Godfather."See it. You may never see anyone like Lili Taylor in her performance here again.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS ALL OVER ITYesterday I watched "Arizona dream" for the tenth time or so. It's truly a wonderfull film and Kusturica's style is not comparable to that of any director I have ever seen (I've read another comments comparing it to Gilliam's-- I love Gilliam, but nah). The lovely quirkyness of the characters and the odd beauty found by the director's eye hooks me deep like few movies can.As for a more objective criticism, I find the casting to be superb. Johnny Depp is an amazing actor, if not watch "Ed Wood" (one of the best movies ever made-- the third, according to me) and watch him in his best performance. Faye Dunaway is another breathtaking (as an actress and as a woman as well) star, and she's been also in one of my favourite movies ("Chinatown", wich ranks fourth on my list). As for Jerry Lewis, I've never been able to bear him: his comedies have never made me laugh. As a dramatic actor is much better, being a good example of this "The king of comedy".Kusturica wisely chooses to fill this movie with his very personal sense of humor and a certain auto-parody to avoid the messagge from being reiterative and boring, specially considering the unusual lenght of the film (wich, I admit, is its only fail nevertheless).I'd like to find the soundtrack -each time I watch it I mumble the songs for months.SAY NO MORE</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredible story. Terrific cast (Johnny Depp,Faye Dunaway,Lili Taylor,Vincent Gallo and Jerry Lewis.) Beautiful cinematography. Ethereal soundtrack by Goran Bregovic. Cinema with a capital C, at its best. Emir Kusturica and his unique style strike again with this amazing story of a young man (Johnny Depp) "kidnapped" from NY by his cousin (Vincent Gallo) and taken to Arizona to be the best man at his uncle's wedding. Kusturika gives us, in this tragi-comedy, an interpretation of the meaning of life through the eyes of a young man in his early twenties. Kusturika himself said:"This movie is about a young man who wanders into what is actually a hell that exists between two women, because of the tragedy in their lives...It could be that this movie is my reaction on how I see Western civilization. It comes from a kind of philosophy I've established after 35 years of living on this planet. I believe that human beings belong to nature not to civilization. And I see man as being like a fish passing through a huge city. The fish doesn't understand anything about the city, he's just floating through it. What I'm trying to do, always, is to get people wondering." Well Mr Kusturika, Congratulations! you have succeeded! A must see, a must own! My favorite since it came out in France in the winter of 1993. Let me know if you ever run into an European copy of Arizona Dream here in the States. The movie has lost 4-5 incredible scenes(about 3-5 minutes each)on its way to the States.Why? WHY?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since you probably know that Johnny Depp appears in this movie, you have probably concluded that like most other Johnny Depp movies, this particular one is also weird. And you would be right. In fact, this may be the strangest movie Depp has appeared in. It's a constantly surreal movie, with bizarre images and characters acting in extremely eccentric ways. Normally those kind of things might throw me off, but I have to admit that it was made in a way that's pretty compelling and kept me watching. The acting by everyone is good, and this is definitely one movie you won't be able to say you've seen before. I'll admit the last half hour of the movie kind of falls apart, there are a few plot points that seem murky (like how the relationship between Depp and Faye Dunaway evolves), and the movie is definitely not a mass audience film. But if you have the taste for something different, you should probably give this movie a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kusturica's American Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the film of Kusturica that I like less, and still it tells what a fine film maker he is.Pay attention to the year it was made. 1993 was a year of war in the series of wars that lead to the disappearance of former Yugoslavia. With his country split in pieces that were fighting one another Kusturica traveled to the US, took with him his team of musicians, the genial Bregovic, and tried to do an American film. What resulted is a more a Kusturica film than an American one, despite of the American team of actors and of the landscape where the story happens. Yet, it is not one of his best. Emir did not really resonate with the American reality. There are many beautiful scenes in this film, from the flying fish to the emergency medical car taking off to the sky with a dead soul inside. The film also enjoys superb acting from Johnny Depp, painfully young and handsome at his first major role after Edward Scissorhands, Faye Dunaway mature and yet so beautiful, and Jerry Lewis probably in his last great role. The problem is that the story is much too thin for a 140 minutes film, and that many of the tricks that work so well in Kustirica's Balkan movies do not pay off too well here. The film is simply too long, the story is not interesting enough, and despite the many beautiful moments the film leaves the impression it is too long and boring at some instances.Soon after making this film Emir Kusturica return to his tragic and torn up country to make one of his masterpieces, 'Underground' a reflection on the whole history of Yugoslavia in the last half of century. 'Life is a Miracle' was to follow a few years later. There are film makers like Polanski whose move to the West succeeded and they became as big or bigger creators there as they were in their native countries. Some other are destined to make their great movies only in their local ambiance and relating to the stories and history they know too well. Kusturica may be one of these, which does not make him a lesser creator, quite the opposite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clearly one of the best films of the 1990's... if you have not seen all of this directors ( Emir Kusturica ) films yet you are in for a treat! Check out his other work ( Black Cat White Cat, Underground, While Father Was Away On Business, The Time Of The Gypsies ) all wonderful films that deserve a 10! In this film Johnny Depp proves why he is a great and possibly the most underated actor in the U.S.A. along side Faye Dunaway who is creative and moving as his love interest. Lili Taylor is also great in this one too, she steals some scenes in it as well, Vincent Gallo's best work that I've seen, he is actually funny in a dead pan type of way. Jerry Lewis is wonderful as well, maybe his best work since King Of Comedy. You will not be disappointed in this one, a MUST see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Surrealism of Emir K.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Innuit hunter races his sled home with a fresh-caught halibut. This fish pervades the entire film, in real and imaginary form. Meanwhile, Axel (Johnny Depp) tags fish in New York as a naturalist's gofer.This is the sort of strange film that made Johnny Depp famous. In fact, it is arguably even ore strange because rather than the weird, dark Gothic world of Tim Burton, it is more of a surreal world where all the pieces may not necessarily even make sense. What does an Innuit have to do with a used Cadillac lot? Not much. How about Papua New Guinea and a new bride? Not much.Although this movie is apparently not well known today (2015), perhaps it should be. Depp does quite well, Jerry Lewis is expertly cruel, and Vincent Gallo steals the show with a very Quentin Tarantino-esque performance (though predating Tarantino).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite movies, and the one who set Johnny Depp as my favourite male actor. The people who liked and reviewed it have mostly said everything I could say. I just want to point out, that the movie has (at least!!!) actually been released on DVD in France. Along with the movie in French or English, there is a second DVD with an unusual 40 minute Actor/Producer track (unusual as you mostly see Claudie Ossard and Johnny depp relaxing on a couch in what appears to be Claudie Ossard's home, watching the movie and reminiscing instead of watching the movie and just hearing their voice. If you want to see Johnny Depp while he is not obviously acting, that's for you ... though you may want to take a french refresher course, as Mmme Ossard mostly talks in french :) and a 12 minute continuous shot that was cut (because you see a guy getting drunk at his own marriage ... thanks UGC;), in which Jonny Depp dreams about marrying Milly and having taken the place of his long dead uncle as a car-salesman. Depp is in every second of it and it shows once more what a fine actor he is.Of course, it's a region 2 DVD, so you'll need a dezoned player to watch it if you're not living in Europe or Japan.Bye, Sammy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky misfire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think any current player has put his personal stamp on more quirky characters than Johnny Depp. Whether it's Edward Scissorhands or Ed Wood, Depp worked hard to get away from the teen idol image that he could have been plagued with his whole life from 21 Jump Street. There's a lot besides Scissorhands and Wood including his most popular character of Captain Jack Sparrow. But in Arizona Dream I think Depp let quirkiness for quirkiness's sake takeover this surreal project. Johnny plays a young and contented kid who works for the Department of fish and game who left his Arizona roots after his parents were killed in a car crash in an automobile driven by his uncle. The uncle is played by Jerry Lewis who got out without a scratch. Depp's feelings about his uncle are ambivalent, his uncle was a beloved figure yet he also blames him for the crash.He fled to New York where he took the job tagging fish, but comes back to Arizona ostensibly for his uncle's wedding. In reality Lewis wants Depp to work for him as a Cadillac dealer along with Vincent Gallo who is also like a surrogate son.Pretty soon Depp is also involved with a mother/daughter pair of quirky sexual piranhas in Faye Dunaway and Lili Taylor. When Gallo joins in it gets truly surreal and it ends badly for one of them.If there are some life lessons to be learned in Arizona Dreams as some found, I missed them all together. Some good talent, some interesting performances, but the film as a total package missed the mark for me.</fullReview>

After some problems, I was able to find True Romance, which was in cult section then I was talking to DeppsGirl10597 on my TMobile Sidekick and she mentioned about Arizona Dream and I look up and what did I see? Arizona Dream.I seldom have encounter as film such as Arizona Dream, which starring Johnny Depp and Faye Dunaway. The open scene just set the bar for the whole movie. To describe this film is bit hard without giving anything away. Faye Dunaway did wonderful job as Elaine so is Depp as Axel.Now, Arizona Dream is very rare film to get and isn't even available on DVD yet. But I strongly recommend this film to anyone. I feel that Depp should have get Best Actor from Academy Awards from this one because it's such complex character to portray yet Depp pull it off if it was very easy at all.It's just amazing film. I'm kinda sick of North by Northwest references, though. Check this out if you get the chance. I'm going to put this on my top 100.</fullReview>

Yes, it is mind blowing, but I can't say that I liked it. I think it is too far from reality. Yes, this movie helped for Johnny Depp, helped to grow up like an actor, helped for his career path, but only he can say why and how, because I can't understand. Axel (Johnny Depp) was very passive character. He kept a close watch on everything. This movie balance between reality and fantasy. Personally, I prefer reality...

This is just a ruse to get him to work in the family car dealership. He meets an older woman and they form a relationship, much to the chagrin of his and her families. Weirdness ensues... The movie is pretty much just quirkiness for quirkiness sake. Weird stuff happens for no apparent reason. Hardly any character seems remotely sane. Worse than that, the characters are, for the most part, incredibly irritating. Much repetition of dialogue, simply because it then appears more arty. In actual fact, it is just plain annoying.Has a few good moments, but these are very few and far between.Good cast - Johnny Depp, Faye Dunaway, Jerry Lewis, Lili Taylor, Vincent Gallo - but wasted on a pointless script and "look at how arty I can be" direction.Pretentious nonsense.</fullReview>

Vincent Gallo gives memorable impersonations of classic film scenes. The soundtrack is also good, I particularly liked the exotic traditional folk music. However, these are about the good points I can name in the film. From the comments, I understand that the scenes are a mix of reality of fantasy.

		<fullReview>I'm guessing that Emir Kusturica probably wanted to flee his native Yugoslavia after what happened there in the early '90s. In this country, he made one of the most surreal movies that I've ever seen: "Arizona Dream". Looking at the container, you may get a little befuddled by the cast - or just as easily take interest in it: Johnny Depp, Jerry Lewis, Faye Dunaway, Lili Taylor and Michael J. Pollard (I lost respect for Vincent Gallo when I learned that he's a Bush supporter, so I didn't include him here).But the movie's actual plot is what will probably make you feel like your head is swimming. It focuses on young Axel Blackmar (Depp), who moves to Arizona where his uncle Leo Sweetie (Lewis) wants him to take over the family business. But when elderly Elaine Stalker (Dunaway) and her daughter Grace (Taylor) enter Axel's life, nothing will ever be the same.A previous reviewer posed the question (positively): how to make sense of what is unfolding here? I have to agree. A melange of Inuit hunters, a weak imitation of "North by Northwest" (acted out by Gallo's character), and a super-surreal plot, seems like it would be a comedy. But this movie is serious, and some scenes are rather grim.Anyway, it's not a great movie, but worth seeing, if only once. I still do wonder what was the meaning of that fish. And if I may say so, Faye Dunaway is still pretty hot.</fullReview>

There's probably something like a cerebral subtext and maybe the flying halibut is a metaphor for the conflict in the Former Yugoslav Republic, but there's very little entertainment. I'd like to find out how this sort of meandering piffle can be regarded as art, but I fear that the knowledge may turn me into a monster. At parties I shy away from the over-educated, self-important types who spout about things like cerebral subtexts etc. Perhaps it's best if I just stay away from films like "Arizona Dreams" altogether.

		<fullReview>As an admirer of offbeat and unusual movies of all kinds I should have adored 'Arizona Dream'. But I didn't. To me it was a long, pointless, self indulgent mess that was a chore to watch. An interesting cast (Depp, Dunaway, Taylor, even cult favourite Michael J. Pollard), plus the awful Jerry Lewis (who I have only been able to tolerate in one movie 'The King Of Comedy', because it capitalized on his inherent unlikeableness), wander around aimlessly in a smug, self consciously quirky movie about odd people doing odd things dully. For over two hours. Help!!The ONLY reason to watch 'Arizona Dream' is to marvel at the fantastically talented and charismatic Vincent Gallo. Gallo steals every scene he is in, and is especially memorable in the Hitchcock inspired sequences which are hilarious and a joy to watch. Gallo's best work remains his directorial debut 'Buffalo 66', but his work here is first rate and is equal to his roles in 'Palookaville', 'The Funeral' and 'Truth Or Consequences, NM.' My advice, rent this movie and fast forward through any sequences that don't feature Gallo. Otherwise 'Arizona Dream' is a complete waste of time.</fullReview>

Lili Taylor is one of my favourite actresses, so this film sounded like a dream come true, her and Depp in a movie, together, but it wasn't. Vincent Gallo stole the film, he was excellent, as were Depp and Taylor, but the movie lacked a real plot to keep me interested, it's the only Johnny Depp film i haven't really enjoyed. Unless your a fan of the actors(and i am an was still dissappointed) i wouldn't bother</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Failed attempt at oneiric tries to fly high but doesn't succeed, just like the characters. Who, btw, lack of originality, reminding of others seen in so many films (and American films, Mr Kusturica!) The most moving thing here is the performance by Lily Taylor, the best of the cast along with Vincent Gallo: his "North by Northwest" performance is maybe the most original element in the film -and so more surrealistic than the flying of the ambulance to the moon or such scenes! I expected so much, having heard (and read, now) great comments, but any scene from a Gilliam's film is so much more oneiric and powerful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie i've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start with, i'll introduce myself. I'm 18 years old, and i love watching movies - especially movies that make you think etc.But this is simply one of the worst movies i've ever seen. I've never wasted 2 hours so bad - i saw this movie, and watched it to the end because of good comments and ratings.But i really don't see any point in this movie. During the whole movie i just feel like killing something - those two women Alex life with really make me angry. Please tell me what you think is good about this movie, because i really don't see ANYTHINGMaybe it's just me being stupid and too immature to understand it, though i doubt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astonishingly Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arizona dream is an astonishingly ill-executed film, especially when juxtaposed to the director's similarly surreal, "Underground." In "Arizona Dream," the surreal elements, such as the flying fish and the flying ambulance feel amateurishly tacked on, window dressing to a deficient, poorly written script. Depp's intrusive voice over/narration attempts to pin the events of the story to some overarching philosophy, but this is awkward and smacks of the writer's/director's inability to tell an effective story through character to character ideologue and action. The film, I suppose, if about anything, is about dreams: Depp's dream of Alaska snd the Eskimos and their fish; the great grandfather's dream of selling so many cars, that if stacked, they would be a pyramid reaching the moon; Vincent Gallo's dream to be an actor (which sets up for the only truly inspired moment in the film, his performance of the crop duster scene from "North by Northwest" at a competition); Elaine's dream of her flying machine, and so on... While the quirky, enjoyable musical score infuses the film with some pep, it is insufficient to carry stagnant characters and a vapid plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How...bizarre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the cast is desirable (Johnny Depp, Jerry Lewis, Faye Dunaway), the story is much too bizarre to follow. You are never really sure if the storyline is a dream (as the title would lead you to believe) or just one bad trip. The storyline is thoroughly confusing due to the characters' antics and you truly feel like you're watching a dream. A dream which you have no control over, nor can you retell what it was about after waking up. The sole reason to watch it: Johnny Depp. Probably in his prime for gorgeousness, Depp portrays Axel as a young man who truly comes to a better understanding of himself after his escapades with Elaine and Grace (Dunaway and Taylor). He possesses an innocence that is utterly touching. Overall however, a thumbs down. And keep in mind, I'm a HUGE Johnny Depp fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a Johnny Depp fan, then I recommend you watching this to see what is probably the closest to what he was like a few years ago.This was in the early 90's so his acting skills had not taken off to where they stand now 15 years later. I watched this having purchased it for my mother, who adores Johnny. I thought I would watch it before sending it to her. She has seen Dead Man's Chest twice and being a big action movie fan, I could only survive it once on the big screen since the director (and especially the producer both suck when they think that BIGGER is better). But I digress. Johnny Depp is fun to watch in this film but do not expect to get anything from this unless you are on drugs. As I am sure the writer was when he wrote it. One person wrote that he puts this movie right up there with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas so it is obvious that people on drugs like this type of movie. I prefer to watch a movie, like I do in real life and be entertained naturally with NO drugs, alcohol or mind altering substances. This is my opinion and if you enjoyed it, you may be on drugs, seek help.</fullReview>
