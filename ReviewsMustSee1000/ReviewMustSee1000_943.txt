		<shortDescription>Great film in a special way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Audiard film is one that grows on you. For quite some time into the film it seems both the film and its main characters aimlessly sit in their cocoon without breaking out. One feels some very vague potential in people but somehow their very lives seem the greatest impediments to its blossoming. One wonders what the film is about and where it is going. Like its characters, it feels like a bunch of loose ends aimlessly hanging about. But I must say that at the end of the movie it has grown on you: suddenly, as the story progresses, the film hatches, the characters break out of their cocoon and in retrospect one feels one has been witness to the improbable -and yet realistic- birth of an unusual but deep love story between two common people. The story has a hidden intensity of screenplay which is intensely performed by Schoenaerts and Cotillard. It creeps beneath your skin. If you like Audiard's way of developing gradual character drama with an intensity that seems to be implicit, buried beneath trailer-trash but still strongly present, you'll like this film. It's a story of how one can find anew a purpose in life when one feels like wasted trash. I watched this film in a full theatre of some 300 people. At the end most everybody sat silent for some minutes. It seems the film had touched something inside quite some of us there. Film as it should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior craftsmanship on all levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jacques Audiard is the maker of the sensational, Oscar-nominated movie Un Proph?te. Matthias Schoenaerts is the lead actor in the sensational, Oscar-nominated movie Bullhead. Together, they now have made De rouille et d'os. Is it sensational? Well, um, yes. Will it be nominated for an Oscar? Time will tell!Like those other two movies, De rouille et d'os is about strong characters, fighting their way through life against all odds. One of those characters is played by Schoenaerts, the Flemish actor who is on the verge of his breakthrough in international cinema. At least, that's what everyone in Cannes was talking about. Next year's American remake of the Flemish blockbuster Loft might well be his ticket to Hollywood. In De rouille et d'os, Schoenaerts basically plays the same sort of character as he did in Bullhead: lots of muscles, little brainpower. In this movie, he succeeds in embarrassing, hurting or insulting everyone he cares about: his child, his sister and his girlfriend. He seems incapable of showing the least bit of empathy. His rude and insensitive way of treating other people would almost be funny, if it weren't for the sometimes dramatic consequences. The story is about the relationship between this emotionally handicapped man and a physically handicapped woman. Although they have almost opposite characters, they find each other in their mutual experience of being different from the rest. His lack of sympathy and understanding is almost an advantage for her. She lost her legs, but he doesn't ask her how she copes or if she wants a shoulder to cry on. No, he asks her if she wants to take a dive in the ocean with him. 'Do you realize what you're saying?', she replies. He answers by carrying her in his arms to the sea and letting her discover that she can swim by using only her arms. Audiard knows how to let his two lead actors excel. Schoenaerts is completely believable as a primitive macho who means well but screws everything up nevertheless. And Marion Cotillard is cast perfectly as a strong-willed woman who refuses to be confined to a wheelchair. I was amazed by her physical appearance as an amputee - you'd swear that she had her legs cut off in order to be able to make this movie. The visual effects are awesome. But apart from the acting achievements, Audiard also has some nice visual treats. Most of the time, the movie focuses on the actors, but now and then aesthetics take over. The scene with Cotillard in an orca show is an example of superb directing: the huge animals are filmed in such a way, that it becomes clear something terrible is about to happen. De rouille et d'os shows superior craftsmanship on all levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Again a remarkable film by a master film maker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film at the Canes Film Festival, audience expectation was high the huge Palais auditorium completely filled. Jacques Audiard is my favourite director, as with Tahir Rahim in A Prophet and Roman Duris in The Beat that my heart skipped, Audiard managed to get an astounding performance from his male lead Schoenaerts, performed as a brutal man lacking the capability to show warmth or love to his young son and the women that cross his path, his performance as a bouncer come fist fighter for money is always believable though completely unsympathetic. You wish him to succeed though you find it hard to like him so often does his character disappoint, seemingly incapable of love and sensitivity, his straight forward requests for sex come out as comic rather than charming, but his open down-to-earth approach and honesty, often gets him what he desires. Meeting Cotillard he is met and challenged by a very strong woman, damaged she needs to find herself again, he could possibly help, at least initially physically rather than emotionally. As their characters interact throughout the film I was unsure as too who would change who, fascinating highly watchable characters struggle to prevail against bad luck and to pull themselves out of the mire of despair and poverty, my kind of film. Again a remarkable film by a master film maker, completely at ease with breaking the conventions of traditional romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunning achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Co-written by Audiard and Thomas Bidegain, and adapted from a collection of short stories by the American author Craig Davidson, Jacques Audiard's genuinely moving Rust and Bone is the story of two wounded people who form a bond based on recognition and acceptance of the others pain. Supported a lovely score by Alexandre Desplat, the film is marked by astonishing performances by Oscar winner Marion Cotillard as Stephanie, a young whale trainer struggling to recover from a horrendous accident, and Matthias Schoenaerts as Ali, a brutish ex-boxer who is unable to acknowledge or express his feelings.Rust and Bone is not a film that is easy to describe. It is raw and visceral ? a punch in the gut, yet it is also a film of intelligence and sensitivity, certainly an art film but one that is also geared to a larger audience, to anyone who has suffered pain and loneliness. When we first meet Ali, he is a man with dreams of making it big in kickboxing, but who is now at his lowest point. Unemployed, he has just left Belgium with his five-year-old son Sam (Armand Verdure) to live with his sister Anna (Corinne Masiero) and her husband in Antibes, a French resort town on the Mediterranean. As Audiard describes him, "he's nothing, he's a bum, he's nobody. He looks just like the people lining up at soup kitchens." Though Ali appears to have a good relationship wit Sam, he relates to him more like an older sibling than a responsible father, as someone able to provide unconditional love. That the film allows us to see Ali as both a man of ferocious energy and innate sensitivity, a three-dimensional human being who elicits our empathy, is a major accomplishment. Stephanie, who works as trainer of Orcas at a local marine park, is rescued by Ali from an overaggressive pursuer in the club where he is a bouncer and the two begin a tentative relationship. In a moment of honesty, Stephanie tells him that her greatest pleasure in a relationship is to be observed, "I like being watched," she says. "I like turning guys on, Get them all worked up, but then I get bored." The nature of their relationship, however, changes forever when Stephanie is seriously injured in an accident at the pool, losing both of her legs and, with them, her reason to live. The scene when Stephanie wakes up in the hospital to discover that her legs have been amputated is one of the most gut-wrenching I've seen. After a period of recovery, Stephanie, now fitted with artificial legs, reaches out to Ali for companionship and finds him open and receptive but brutally honest. For her, he is the only person she can trust to listen to her without judgment even though, in his brutal frankness, he tells her that she is "dressed like a whore," and casually suggests that they sleep together just to see if "she can still do it." Despite showing concern for her needs, Ali has moments of cruel insensitivity when he picks up a girl for a one-night stand even when Stephanie is with him, prompting her to ask him, "Am I a friend, a pal, a buddy like the others? If we continue, we have to do it right. I mean consideration." Ali is determined to become a professional fighter and becomes engaged in illegal activities such as street fighting and doing surveillance work for his sleazy friend Martial (Bouli Lanners), an activity that damages his relationship with Anna and forces Stephanie to be a spectator from the sidelines. Although the film is raw, there are some moments of exquisite lyricism as captured by cinematographer Stephane Fontaine, in particular, the scene where Stephanie interacts with a killer whale through a glass partition in an underwater tank.Despite the fact that there are some contrivances and melodrama in the plot that do not mesh with the film's gritty naturalism, Rust and Bone is a stunning achievement. As Eli moves to a new level of growth, not only with Stephanie but also with Anna and Sam, a haunting picture emerges of two people whose inner strength allows a crisis in their life to turn into a spiritual awakening, an opportunity to experience a new sense of being alive. As the Greek tragedian Aeschylus expressed it, "Pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two actors make a good film a fantastic one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a moment towards the end of Rust And Bone when something awful happens, and we are about to witness the ultimate tragedy. For that couple of minutes, the rest of the movie becomes irrelevant; we are just totally immersed in this act playing out. It's a brutal but wonderful sequence and, fortunately, it's not the first time we have such a scene in the movie. That's pretty much what Rust And Bone is: a series of wonderfully brutal sequences.The movie deals with the relationship between two fragile individuals from opposite ends of life. Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts) is trying to be a better father and a better man; Stephanie (Marion Cotillard) is trying to rebuild her shattered life after a horrific accident. Their need for each other grows drastically, but their real lives threaten to get in the way.As far as story lines go, this isn't anything overly special. It's the kind of kitchen sink drama that we've seen Ken Loach and Mike Leigh do for ages. Fragile characters, broken homes, comedy out of tragedy, it's the usual stuff. Only difference here is that we're seeing it all play out in France, with French people speaking French and doing French things. But frankly, nothing is original these days; what matters more is the execution.And what sets Rust And Bone apart from other similarly-themed movies is the execution. Working class France is shot brilliantly, looking gorgeous and despairing all at the same time. The special effects are top-notch, and there is a somewhat jarring quality to the editing that really works.But what you really need to see this film for is Cotillard and Schoenaerts. I was trying to decide who I thought was the better actor in the film, but it's impossible to choose. They are both fantastic. I've never seen Matthias Schoenaerts before, but the guy is amazing. He manages to juggle pain and deadpan humour simultaneously, which is quite an achievement. Cotillard, meanwhile, is the usual perfect self that she is. Such an expressive face, and she's able to make even the hokiest of lines come off natural and genuine. I really didn't like her in The Dark Knight Rises but, clearly, she's at her best when she's speaking her natural language. They are what make these sequences brutal and wonderful, through their chemistry and ability to suck the audience in.The rest of the film is scattered with great supporting cast performances, especially Armand Verdure as Ali's son Sam. The young boy is a joy to watch, and can be added to that ever-growing list of strong pre-teen child actors.I'm pretty sure Rust And Bone has won a few awards, and deservedly so. It's amazing to watch, just because it's so fun to see brilliant performances. Like I said before, the story itself isn't probably that amazing. It's been done before; but it's done in such a way here, with those two central performances, that it feels fresh and original. You really should check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing movie! Marion Cotillard is just breathtaking. I still can't believe how beautiful this movie is. The cinematography is just stunning and the score is beautiful. The performances are incredibly powerful and real. Marion Cotillard is able to speak without saying a word and that something extremely rare! She is so expressive you can feel her pain. I think it really touched me because the movie is really real, this story seems to be able to happened to anybody and that's Audiard force. His writing skills are just amazing. Marion should get an Oscar for a performance of this magnitude.I believe she will soon become Hollywood favorite. The way she invest herself in each role she takes is an example for any actress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tremendously enjoyed this movie. Some people think this is a story about a girl who loses her legs. It's not. The story isn't about her. The real main character in this story perhaps is Ali, played by Matthias Schoenaerts. Well maybe it's not about him as well. What this story is definitely about is fighting. This story is not meant to be touching, it is all about coping strategies. With Ali it's really fight or flee, for Marie it's getting back on your feet after a devastating blow. Matthias does an excellent job, acting a lower class man with no real education. He is simple minded and he is quite rude, but he has a gentle side to him. I like the ink that Marie gets done, marking the stubs of her legs 'droit' and 'gauche', left and right. To me that is a subtle way of showing that she is beginning to accept her situation. I found the casting for this movie refreshing. The looks of the characters aren't perfect. I find that I am getting tired of what seems that all actors and actresses are looking less distinctive than ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Healing in the midst of the brokenness of it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨What have you done with my legs? ¨Forget about Amour, Once Upon a Time in Anatolia, or A Royal Affair; the best foreign films of 2012 came from France. The first was The Intouchables, about a quadriplegic millionaire who hires the help of a young man from the projects, while Rust and Bone centers around another unlikely relationship between a killer whale trainer and a boxer. These two were my favorite foreign films by far, and I especially enjoyed this one because I am a huge fan of director Jacques Audiard who in 2009 directed the Oscar nominated A Prophet. That film was much more suspenseful as it centered on a prisoner who manages to survive inside a corrupted prison system. This time, Audiard focuses on a dramatic romantic story between two tortured souls who truly learn to live after they have suffered severe physical injuries. More than a character study, this film is a soul study as the two lead characters find healing under extremely rare circumstances. We are introduced to these characters in a very realistic manner. These people are afflicted in some way or another; they aren't your usual likable lead characters; they are deeply flawed, but we sympathize with them. Like he did in A Prophet, Audiard adapted the screenplay with the assistance of Thomas Bidegain based on the short stories from Canadian author Craig Davidson. Audiard's film was nominated for the Palm d'Or in last year's Cannes Film Festival and is really worth checking out. Some people had an issue with the ending because they thought everything fit together a little too neatly, but I thought the final act was probably the best and most satisfying part of this film. Our physical struggles and bonds can end up strengthening our tortured souls and making us better human beings.A former boxer, Alain (Matthias Schoenaerts from Bullhead), decides to move from Belgium to the south of France where his sister, Louise (Celine Sallette), lives after he is put in charge of his young son, Sam (Armand Verdure). He isn't very responsible, so he knows his sister can help him raising his son while he finds a job. He finds one as a local bouncer at a disco where he meets Stephanie (Marion Cotillard), a professional killer whale trainer at Marineland, after escorting her back home due to a brawl. They exchange numbers but don't see each other again. Alain find a job as a security guard at a local store where he meets Martial (Bouli Lanners) who convinces him to begin fighting again. Martial runs an underground kickboxing tournament where he introduces Alain and they begin making some money off it. Meanwhile Stephanie continues her life at the marine land, until she suffers a freak accident and loses both her legs. Heavily depressed she calls Alain and the two begin to form a special bond. She begins to go out more and even joins Alain when he goes off to fight. The two begin to support each other, and despite their brokenness they begin to help each other out. Audiard is a master at creating depth and pays close attention to these random characters that end up bonding with each other, but he couldn't have succeeded if it weren't for the two terrific lead performances from Matthias Schoenaerts and Marion Cotillard. Cotillard was remarkable and should have received a nomination, and somehow Schoenaerts manages to make his character likable despite all his flaws. There is something in the way he treats Stephanie that seems to erase all his flaws and make us want him to achieve his personal goals. The actors managed to create a rather unique and authentic relationship and for me it worked really well. Every scene that at first felt unnecessary seems to have a purpose or a symbolism later on, like the way Alain looked at Stephanie's legs when he was escorting her home. Later he wins a fight he was about to lose when he catches a glimpse of Stephanie's prosthetic legs. Somehow in the midst of pain, he finds greater strength, and that is what makes this film so appealing. Everything which seemed so random at first seems to come together perfectly at the end. This is one of those films that stay with you long after the credits roll, and it is deeply touching and moving. This is one of those films that is driven by the performances and the overall narrative of the story. The visual effects of Cotillard 's legs (or lack thereof) are also pretty well done. Everything about this film makes it one you will definitely want to check out. It is real, it is raw, and it is touching. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>difficult and charming, brutal and beautiful, melancholic and humorous throughout, exactly when and where it needs to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rust and Bone is new film by Jacques Audiard known largely for his breakout success A Prophet and concerns the burgeoning relationship between whale trainer Stephanie (Marion Cotillard) and street fighter Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts). If you can avoid it, it's probably best to avoid much of the plot, but given it's been fairly publicised this is fairly difficult, but this is a film that deals with disability, image and to some extent, class. It's been mentioned a lot, but what's really wonderful about this film is it's complete sidestepping of exaggerated sentimentality it could so easily fall prey to. In the wrong hands, this could be a feel-good, motivational tale of a disabled person overcoming their hardships and finding love and personal confidence with a emotionally crippled partner who learns to overcome his own shortcomings in a fantastical fairy-tale rather like another rather successful French film that was released earlier this year. In all honesty too, what I just described isn't completely far-off the narrative arc in Rust and Bone. The way the film handles its characters' emotionally however is so much more satisfying due, partly to the brilliant performances by both Cotillard and Schoenaert, but also in Audiard's writing and direction. After all, Rust and Bone is a feel-good tale eventually, but it takes a really long time to get there and doesn't revel in it. The two leads do overcome their physical and emotional traumas through their relationship but it is a slow process of recovery, one that is instantly recognisable in every day life. For a film with such a potentially over-the-top synopsis, it does incredibly well to stay focused on this small set of characters it presents us as believable and relate-able figures. It poses some fascinating questions; is street fighting really any more or less cruel than training beautiful orcas to perform tricks for our pleasure? Why do this father and son move in the first place? We only have to assume that whatever was going on before the narrative was worse than what is happening on screen. What was Stephanie like before her accident? And, like in Beasts of the Southern Wild, is being tough with your child sometimes necessary? These questions leave the film open, even though the main narrative is fairly straightforward. All in all, the sheer range of emotions this film produces is testament to it's strength. It is difficult and charming, brutal and beautiful, melancholic and humorous throughout, exactly when and where it needs to be. My only real criticism is that the narrative dips a tiny bit in the third act, once the central relationship is finally consummated (which again, takes along time and initially is very matter-of-fact in a suitably amusing scene), the narrative begins to drag its heels a tiny bit, as the film seems to completely forget about Ali's son (though his character seems to for a bit as well) but the final coda remains to avoid sentimentality in an excellent closing few scenes. The cinematography and soundtrack are pretty beautiful too, completing a fantastic triumph of an understated film.</fullReview>

She was able to awaken my sense of compassion and admiration. Simone Signnoret in "Room At The Top", Annie Girardot in "Rocco And His Brothers" Samantha Eggar in "The Collector", Charlotte Rampling in "The Night Porter" Those performances by those actresses not only instructed me as a man but inspired me.

		<shortDescription>The power of two united human beings and how they are able to help one another overcome their respective adversities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the astonishing "Un proph?te", Jacques Audiard brings us "De rouille et d'os", a completely atypical love story that he himself jokingly described as "a melo-trash", which perfectly pictures the overall tone of the film and the social classes on display.By the end of the film, you will understand the meaning of the title "De rouille et d'os" (Rust and Bone), as both the elements mentioned in it portray the characters' respective adversities and the constant emphasis on their flaws as human beings.So this is a love story, but like Audiard said himself, the social classes on display are not your typical Colgate-smiled, suit-wearing, warm-hearted yuppie or Beverly Hills blondie shop-a-holic bimbo finding out she's got a heart just as big as her beachside house.This is no Hollywood romance in any way, whether you think of the people we see interact, or the way this whole story unfolds...it's just plain different, and very refreshing. While a majority of female viewers seemed to dislike the character of Ali, as a man, I can tell you, this is a guy most of us can relate to in some ways. Irresponsible, poor, rough, opportunistic with the ladies, questionable manners, not really a good father, but, deep inside, a good human being nonetheless.Stéphanie, on the other hand, starts off as a very narcissistic young woman, who enjoys teasing guys to admittedly revamp her self-esteem.So we've got two characters that will get us to scratch our heads, thinking : "How can I possibly find any of these two people likable?" And the answer lies within the next two hours, where Audiard and his sublime cast organically bring two ordinary characters going through extraordinary circumstances together in what ends up being a beautiful and rewarding fight to becoming better people who love each other.Now, these two characters are portrayed as fighters, as in most of Jacques Audiard's films. Ali is, literally, aspiring to become a pro MMA fighter, while Stéphanie, following a tragic accident, struggles to feel a slight bit of happiness after losing her legs.But "De rouille et d'os" isn't about a woman losing her legs or some guy trying to make it to the big leagues of pro fighting...This film is about the power of two united human beings and how they are able to help one another overcome their respective adversities. It does sound very heavy, but Audiard made it clear when shooting the film (if you watch the making-of, you will see) that, at no point, he wanted this film to be overly dramatic, even when some situations that occur would usually send the characters down that path. In many ways, this is a fascinating character study, a quest for positivity unfolding in an emotional wasteland, with glimpses of affection subtly brought to the surface here and there, avoiding clichés at all times in the process.Visually, "De rouille et d'os" is fabulous. The almost blinding sun crossing paths with the lens, the beach, the ocean, the warm Côte d'Azur setting...If you've ever been to Antibes, you will be amazed at how Audiard was able to capture the essence of that place and take it to the screen. Some people thought the pace was a little slow, and there is a drastic turn of events that will seem to come out of nowhere a little bit. Some of the subplots do feel a tad undeveloped, but no harm done here, in all honesty. The focus remains on the two protagonists and picturing their daily living, where their relationship deepens its roots.Also, to those who thought Ali was insensitive : This is exactly why Stéphanie feels strong when she is with him. Ali couldn't care less about her handicap. He just grabs her out of the wheelchair, carries her on his back, and takes her out for a swim after she spent months behind the closed doors of her apartment. There is this subtle moment when Ali takes Stéphanie to his sister's place, and she is all careful with Stéphanie, constantly feels compassionate about her, and suddenly, Ali, a tad annoyed, tells her to stop. This, right there, is what makes Ali so important to Stéphanie : he's the only person who doesn't look at her with pity. And that is where the bold, "insensitive to some" side of Ali becomes the remedy to her sadness.Matthias Schoenaerts and Marion Cotillard are both amazing. You rarely see such an organic chemistry between two characters. This really is something special that will grow on you.Fantastic cinematic experience. Rich in both flamboyant and subtle emotions. Again, some tremendous work from Jacques Audiard...and the two protagonists!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jacques Audiard's films are always so frustrating for me. They are always marred by the violent male protagonists and his love of violence. The lead character loves his son, yes, but he's a horrible father and should not have custody of him. I kept wishing he would be arrested for his various crimes and put in jail. The extreme fighting scenes were unnecessary - he could have the same basic problems without the extreme violence.Marion Cotillard gives a really interesting performance but I can't say I "liked" her. I found the special effects surrounding her missing legs very distracting. She was very contradictory.It will be interesting to see on Thursday if the academy nominates 2 french actresses - I vastly prefer Emmanuelle Riva and if only one gets a nomination I hope it will be her. They should both get Cesar nominations; they are both Prix Lumiere nominees already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damaged people damaging themselves further. Good but not great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a conversation recently with a friend who stated "The French only make good films." His reasoning behind this statement was that all the French films he's seen on general release here have impressed him. The same may be said for German films. And Iranian. And Korean. And? The reason being that, generally speaking, films that perform poorly domestically aren't worth promoting on the foreign markets. Hence he judges the French film industry on Jean de Flourette, Belleville Rende-vous, La Haine etc. (just don't tell him about Les Visiteurs or the god-awful Asterix films!). Rust and Bone will serve to perpetuate the myth of his own making, though it is certainly not the 'great' that some have implied.More than anything, Rust and Bone is about damaged people and the challenges and relationships that arise from such damage. Alain (Matthias Schoenaerts) is Damaged Goods Number One and arrives in Antibes with his son to stay with his estranged sister and her husband, who have plenty of issues of their own, not least of all financial. Taking a job as a nightclub bouncer, Alain meets Stéphanie (Marion Cotillard), Damaged Goods Number Two, who appears to solve her personal issues via rough sex with strangers. Alain 'saves' her from herself one night and months later, having suffered rather more 'damage' (I'm being cagey here lest I inflict unwelcome plot spoilers on you), Stéphanie contacts him again and a relationship of mutual protection and support ensues.Rust and Bone isn't an uplifting film in the manner of, say, Oscar-bait Intouchables but it does leave the viewer with a generally positive feeling. For those who hate their bodies, it's a little like eating half a Big Mac (it tastes quite good but your body will suffer for it) and for those who look after themselves, it's like running a half marathon (it hurts like hell but the sense of achievement makes it worthwhile). There are some genuinely shocking moments but most of these are the result of realizing how troubled the protagonists are.Performance wise, both Schoenaerts and Cotillard give their all and succeed in making us pity them, judge them and wish that we could show them another way to get through life. Maybe they are extreme versions of what we see around us every day if we care to look, but they are convincingly sad, broken and brutal nonetheless Rust and Bone is a good film. But don't judge the French film industry on it. There is so much else on offer that reaches the both ends of the scale.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rust and Bone follows the story of Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts), a single parent struggling to provide for his young son, Sam, who develops a relationship with Stephanie (Marion Cotillard), a killer whale trainer, which grows stronger after she suffers a horrible accident.Rust and Bone is a film that opened in limited release this past weekend and recently received a nomination for the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. It is carried mainly by the performances of its two stars, Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts, both deliver excellent performances filled with emotion and heart break as their relationship goes through its ups and downs throughout the film. The story is very unpredictable and does a great job of getting the audience to invest in these characters and getting the audience to sympathize for them as the film progresses.However, be warned, Rust and Bone is hardly a film for the faint of heart. Our heroine endures a devastating injury that is depicted and shown afterwords several times throughout the film. On top of that, the film contains several rather bloody kick boxing sequences that may intrigue some of the male audience into possibly going to check this film out. Also, the actors speak French as English subtitles are displayed on the bottom of the screen.All this being said, Rust and Bone is a truly excellent picture that features great performances and an unpredictable story. If you're looking for something a little more than just your average romantic date night movie, I would definitely recommend checking this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-oiled piece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1994 film Forrest Gump Gary Sinese played a double amputee. He didn't actually cut off both his legs for the role (that would've been TOO extreme) but thanks to the marvel of special effects, he was able to go around in his wheelchair and even take a swim seamlessly. Now, flash forward nearly 20 years (Gosh, how time flies) and we have Marion Cotillard getting her legs bitten off by a killer whale, and the technology is even more amazing. There isn't a single scene where we're not 100% convinced she's lost her limbs, and the stakes are raised even higher when she's fitted with artificial ones. How they managed to insert this footage so completely into the movie is anyone's guess. I kind of don't want to know, as this would spoil the illusion.Her characterisation, as a young woman who has to learn to start again after a life changing incident, is a beguiling one. It would probably be enough to carry the film by itself, but combined with Matthias Schoenaerts devil-may-care trained fighter (with a well hidden heart of gold) it becomes a great one. Their tempestuous relationship is the backbone here, and it is never less than captivating. These are two very different people; and yet they are perfect for one another... as long as both are willing to make sacrifices along the way. It is also my pleasure to report the rest of the cast are imbued with the same level of complexity as the two leads... These are REAL individuals we get to know, not dull cyphers. It all adds to a multi layered drama which is a true pleasure to watch. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rust &amp; Bone is the story of two broken people coming together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cotillard and Schoenaerts bring the story of two broken people to the screen in the best way I could have imagined." Famed french director Jacques Audiard is probably most known for his 2009 academy award nominated film "Un proph?te". This time around he makes an unconventional love story between two people. Alain van Versch (Matthias Schoenaerts) is a father who is having a hard time after losing his job leading to moving in with his sister. While out on a bouncer job he meets killer whale trainer Stéphanie (Marion Cotillard), after an accident at her job she loses her legs which leads to her calling him starting up this friendship between the two as she tries to explore her new life without the ability to walk around. When he starts to fight for money she tags along and gets to see a different side of him which leads to the two developing their relationship further then friends.Audriard has made a fascinating film mainly due to the performances he is able to get from his actors. The film seemed so well made to me because these two characters go from either top to bottom or the opposite way round but either way the two characters seem so good for each other as they help the other get through life better. The film contains some very moving scenes which are set to some very modern music. A sequence set to Katy Perry's "Firework" is a continuing trend in the film as it is first played in front of a whale show then set to a scene with Cotillard which is the best sequence in the film. The film can get very violent most noticeable in the fight scenes Alain has to do to get money to provide for his family. There is one scene where Cotillard's character after the accident finds herself in the bed without any legs and it is just heartbreaking to see this once happy women start to descend into depression.Schoenaerts plays Alain and he is stellar as this man who cannot separate his work from his personal life. His relationship with his son has it's bad points when he cannot except that his child is weak which leads to him treating him not in the best way. His relationship with Cotillard is sweet as he try's to help this women get through life. Cotillard plays Stéphanie and once again she gives another amazing performance solidifying her as one of greatest talents working today. This women quickly changes from her happy self to a very depressed women who finds it hard to deal with her life until this man comes into her life. She does transform into a happier person once he comes along to help her which leads to her helping him in the end. These two performances need to other one to make you enjoy them more.Maybe not as good as his previous film Audriard has still made a relationship movie that does not go for obvious but goes for a more personal approach as you care for how these characters develop over the certain amount of time. With fantastic performances by its leads and a great story Rust &amp; Bone is surely one of the best films of the year.MOVIE GRADE: A- (MVP: Marion Cotillard)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raw power and emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely does a film use its source material (in this case, two powerfully devastating short stories by Craig Davidson) and transform it into something new and equally formidable. That, however, is precisely what Jacques Audiard has done with "Rust and Bone," a moving and raw look at how two rather ordinary people respond to extraordinary circumstances. Stephanie, a whale trainer played by the brilliant Marion Cotillard, must face life as a double amputee after a freak accident. Alain?played by the painfully handsome Matthias Schoenaerts?is a single father who must juggle his need to support his son while eking out a living for himself as a security guard. Stephanie's and Alain's lives intersect in unexpected but perfectly plausible ways, and their story generates equal parts despair and inspiration. This is an emotionally difficult but ultimately life- affirming film. And I sincerely hope that it helps catapult Schoenaerts to fame in the US. He embodies an atypical combination of ruggedness and heartfelt emotion rarely seen on film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romance Between Two Damaged People</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rust and Bone a.k.a De rouille et d'os in French is a French-Belgian romantic drama film that stars Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts. The screenplay is based on Craig Davidson's short story collection with the same title. It tells the story of an unemployed 25- year-old man who falls in love with a disabled killer whale trainer. Jacques Audiard directs.The story starts out with an improbable tragedy. Orca whale trainer Stéphanie has an accident at a tawdry seaside aquarium that leads to the double amputation of her legs. Ali arrives at his sister's house in the same ramshackle Mediterranean town of Antibes with his 5-year-old son in tow.Ali's broke, aimless, ill-equipped to tend to son Sam. Stéphanie and Ali first meet before the accident at a nightclub where he has taken a job as a bouncer. She has a boyfriend. He is tough, bruising, confident in his skin and in the sack. He gives her his number. After her trauma, Stéphanie calls and they enter into a relationship.Whatever digital trickery is used to strip Cotillard of her legs, it's so beautifully and simply done that we soon stop thinking of her amputee status as a special effect and accept it as a simple physical truth. When things do get sexual between Ali and Stéphanie, their love scenes together are frequent, naked, graphic, and sizzling hot. It's easy to believe that these two very different people?an educated animal trainer and a barely verbal meathead ? share a powerful connection at the level of their bodies, a bond that they need more than they understand it. Not every viewer will be seduced by Rust and Bone's style, which might be classified as romantic naturalism. There's plenty of roving, intimate hand-held camera in the style of the Dardenne brothers but the movie's tone couldn't be farther from Dardennes' emotional austerity. Audiard is partial to long poetic montages of light on water, copious lens flares, and the pull-out-the-stops manipulative power of American pop music. A short scene of Stéphanie rocking out alone in her wheelchair to the sound of the B-52s' "Love Shack" tells us everything we need to know about the mojo she's slowly recovering. And a later scene, in which Stéphanie returns alone to Marineland to re-encounter the orcas who deprived her of her legs, must surely represent the most exhilarating narrative use to which Katy Perry's "Firework" has ever been put.Looking back at the movie,you may feel surprise, even shame, that you managed to care so much about this none-too-original story of two damaged people whose unexpected connection helps them each find their way out of a bad place in their lives. But it is a movie about letting go of shame and making way for the advent of pleasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apart from the great story the movie is telling (combining two stories, male and female and their complications), this has remarkable special effects. Of course it also had a good budget to play with (for European standards that is). If they do an US remake, you can bet they'll cut off some of the edges (and some of the erotic/nude content too).But until then and if you speak french or don't mind reading subtitles, this movie has to suffice. And it is very well acted. It's about loss, hope, friendship, love and many more things. It is about life, things we take for granted (very well shown in several scenes), passion, but also about broken people and how they try to get back on their feet (no pun intended). A great drama that I can only recommend</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rusty clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The setting is there, the cast well chosen, the topic of a provoking and infinite nature. Yet, this film, blind to all this, manages using rusty clichés to overturn the table. "De rouille et d'os" simply does not succeed neither in making you feel unsettled nor in cinematographically encaspulating the harshness of the situation in which the actors find themselves.A flat character (Ali), whose punches and sexual intercourse outnumber his personality tonal palette, fails to go further the character of a brutal(ish), new age, macho. The character development there, just is not. Furthermore, the inefficiently "shaped" character of Stephanie makes do with presenting more her physical needs rather than the emotional torrent of feelings and sadness one goes through after having his both legs amputated.The whole is, rather, wrapped with rusty clichés, cinematographical Hollywoodesque (sic) clutter that obstruct the viewer from diving into the character interaction, etc. That was a great, yet missed, opportunity to produce a work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, Poetic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, Rust and Bone should have been nominated for Best Foreign Language Film as well as Marion Cotillard should have been nominated for Best Actress at the Academy Awards. This film should have gotten more recognition.With that, this is a very special film. Every scene is given great attention to detail where many moments in Rust and Bone will touch your heart and have you a little watery in the eye here and there. But it's really the attention to detail with the simplest of things in the movie that give this film it's beautiful and poetic quality.The acting is superb, Matthias Schoenaerts is a great and very underrated actor. And Marion Cotillard, well, nuff said. She's one of the best actresses out there today. Truly great acting is not being able to tell when one is acting, and with so much conflict and drama going on in Rust and Bone, it would be easy for the actors to sway into bad acting. But the acting is again superb, all the way around, from the leads to the Under Five Parts.Plus you can't beat some of the fighting scenes in this movie which doesn't show too much, but it shows just enough to leave the viewer wanting more of Matthias Schoenaerts fighting another fight. Matthias Schoenaerts' character fights for his life, and Marion Cotillard's character fights for hers. And as the movie progresses they fight for a love that blossoms between them. Not a film for everyone for the violence, and a lot of sex, but a film for people that just love to watch a great movie where characters go through rough circumstances and find beauty and love through them.I also like the fact that this movie is true and real to life. Families have there ups and downs, but in the end, family members forgive one another and talk once again as is demonstrated at the end of the film with Matthias Schoenaerts' character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing, but not for everyone (and kind of unfinished)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all...How did Marion Cotillard not get nominated for an Academy Award is beyond me. Now. This is why I love French cinema. What an unusual and beautiful love story. And very, very raw. A lot of people are gonna find this film difficult to watch. To anyone expecting a lighthearted, happily ever after, first date movie: this couldn't be further from it. Also, this isn't exactly the most logical couple that ever existed. Their relationship is not meant to be, it's not romantic, often it doesn't even seem loving, but rather desperate. But there's something very poetic about it. It's very brave from the director to portray an amputee in such a sexual way, knowing it will cause quite a stir. It's also a key to the story- seeing that she's trying to learn how to live a normal life with her new disability. Again, to anyone who might find those scenes disturbing- maybe you should stick to a regular romantic film.One thing that bothered me a bit about the film is that, in the end, I felt like they didn't quite know how to finish it. I couldn't help but feel like there's so much more left to be said and resolved, but they added what seemed to be an unnecessary event (the son falling through the ice). However, the movie as a whole makes up for the flaws in the end. One of the best foreign films I've seen in years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Counters a disjointed script with fascinating conceptual details, beautiful images and intense moments of raw acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>French director Jacques Audiard (A Prophet) counters a disjointed script with fascinating conceptual details, beautiful images and intense moments of raw acting. Rust and Bone is equally mesmerising as it is clumsy, but that it is ever touching is a result of some skillful albeit undisciplined filmmaking. The film's story belongs to Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts), a hardened man looking for a place to stay with his young son Sam (Armand Verdure). With little money, they house together in the home of Ali's sister Anna (Corinne Masiero). Finding work as a bouncer at a nightclub, Ali breaks up a fight and escorts Stephanie (Marion Cotillard) home. Stephanie is an orca whale trainer at Marineworld but after a freak accident at a show she is hospitalised and wakes up to find that both her legs have been amputated. Depressed and broken, she calls Ali for assistance and comes to realise that with the rest of her body intact she is still capable of living. Meanwhile, to make money Ali participates in sweaty, unofficial kickboxing matches. As with Audiard's previous film A Prophet, a gritty prison crime drama, the director contrasts agonising moments of pain and violence with images that are brimming with meaning and beauty. The tone is consistent but there are bumps in the script, written by the director and Thomas Bidegain. The book they've adapted, "Rust and Bone", is by Canadian author Craig Davidson, and is comprised of a number of short stories. The idea from these stories have been borrowed and developed for a whole new story and the two central characters were also written anew for the screen. Some of the theories of physicality are smart, but the pastiche format of the book is too evident at times. The story structure feels episodic, which leaves powerful images, like Stephanie's reunion with the whale, as singular, isolated moments. The trajectory of the narrative is often stifled as we wait for new plot points to gain punctuality. An underdeveloped subplot surrounding Ali's security employment for example hinges on a sizeable coincidence to drive the story into its final act. The film is better as a critique of the way people fail to appreciate their own bodies, until they reach catastrophic event that makes them rethink their physicality. The tight framing of the characters from the waist up removes any consciousness of the rest of their bodies. This reflects the lack of self-worth in their lives as they are only concerned by primal instincts of survival, like relying on other people to mentally or physically carry them (a pertinent image), or scavenging for food in this downtrodden economic period.The disunity between belief and the primal thought is shown in two juxtaposing moments. Stephanie is filmed through a long lens, standing alone as the mould for her prosthetic limbs sets. The shot seems isolating but the visibility of her own being reminds her that is she still alive and capable. The film then cuts to shot Ali sitting down at a computer, with only half his body visible, watching brawls on the Internet. It shows the immaturity of his self-preservation in using his body for money and what he calls "fun". In this instance, the combination of theme and content is startlingly articulate. Audiard is less confident with romantic sentimentalism. Both characters begin to inspire each other's belief in their own physical capabilities but it's an uneven theme. Ali convinces Stephanie to sleep with him to see if her body is still functional. We know that he is promiscuous so is he just using her? The question lingers. Less convincing is when Ali claws back into the match when he sees Stephanie walking towards the fighting pitch or when she is hired to become a money handler for the fights, despite seeing the brutality and juvenility. It softens the opportunity for more explosive conflict between the leads.The actors, as naturalistic as they are, are a little reminiscent of the film. There are flashes of brilliance, including scenes of unprecedented emotional strain. But then there are stretches where Cotillard's reserved performance makes you long for more perpetuated tension and drama. It's an affecting and sometimes beautiful film but you will have to wait for its best moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Riveting, anatomic and vital..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>French screenwriter and director Jacques Audiard's sixth feature film which he co-wrote with French screenwriter Thomas Bidegain, is based on a short story from 2005 by Canadian author Craig Davidson. It premiered In competition at the 65th Cannes International Film Festival 2012, was screened in the Special Presentations section at the 37th Toronto International Film Festival in 2012 and is a France-Belgium co-production which was shot on locations in France and Belgium and produced by producers Pascal Caucheteux and Martine Cassinelli. It tells the story about Ali, a Belgian boxer who goes to France with his 5-year-old son Sam to see his sister Anna who lives with her husband Richard. Anna and Richard lets them stay at their house and Richard gets Ali a job as a bouncer at a nightclub called the Annex. As Ali and his young son begins to settle in at their new residence, he meets a woman named Stéphanie. Distinctly and engagingly directed by French filmmaker Jacques Audiard, this fast-paced fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints though mostly from the male protagonist's point of view, draws a moving portrayal of a father's struggling relationship with his young son and his relationship with a female whale trainer who is learning to live again after a close to fatal accident. While notable for it's naturalistic and atmospheric milieu depictions, fine cinematography by French cinematographer Stéphane Fontaine, low-keyed production design by production designer Michel Barthélélemy, film editing by French film editor Juliette Welfling, use of sound and music and scenes of whales, this character-driven and narrative-driven love-story about fatherhood, commitment and interpersonal relations, depicts two entwined and compelling studies of character and contains a great and timely score by French composer Alexandre Desplat. This charming, violent, often humorous and unusual romance which is set mostly in France in the 21st century and where the lives of a man and a woman from two different worlds are connected, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, rhythmic continuity, use of music, cinematic expertise, scenes of whales and scenes between Ali and Sam and Ali and Stéphanie, the fine acting performance by French actress Marion Cotillard and the physical and visceral acting performance by Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts of a contradicting character that is kind of similar though far more heroic than the protagonist he played in Belgian filmmaker Michaël R. Roskam's "Bullhead" (2011). A riveting, anatomic and vital action-drama which gained, among several other awards, the award for Best Film at the 56th BFI London Film Festival in 2012.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since the time I saw the trailer, and I saw marion cotillard was in it, I was so looking forward this movie. the premise was promising: a boxer who doesn't has his life together is with his son, and he encounters a beautiful woman who has horrible accident, after which they bonded a relationship. the movie just puts one thing to happen after another. no reasons behind each occurrence, no building up emotion whatsoever, even the flow doesn't make sense. conflicts happen here and there. the only thing saved this movie was a cinematic directing, superb cinematography, and endearing acting by Marion Cotillard and Mathias. The premise, and cinematography, and the cast. I wanted so bad for it to be good. but i ended up being disappointed. or perhaps I am just not made for French movies, which I have watched quite a few, and they successfully proved to be not having a point. just movies that flow and at some point end.</fullReview>

I feel unable to do it any justice because it is so much more than the sum of its parts( but don't misunderstand me, its parts are v good) It is so subtle and complex that individual viewers will take very different things from it. Whatever else it may be though, it was in my view, one of the most convincing and touching love stories I've ever seen on screen. Top notch performances. Not an easy watch by any means, but so rewarding. What I admire most is the absolute refusal to resort to sentimentality. We feel what we feel, without manipulation. The minute it finished I wanted to watch it all over again and having done so I feel I am only just getting to grips with the many levels the film works on and its message/s. Even after several viewings certain aspects of it still puzzle me, but in a good way. Highly intelligent film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really loved it in spite of some lingering issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I'll say that I really took to this film straight away, so any negative comments are purely to try and explain some of the problems I might have had with the movie if it wasn't so captivating. I initially went into this with slight reservation as the directors previous film A Prophet left me a little cold, I don't know why I just couldn't engage with it in the way that the hype made me think I would. But I'm happy to say this one grabbed me from the beginning, the gritty beauty of the movie works perfectly with the two lead performances which are also impressive. Marion Cotillard is always watchable but Matthias Schoenaerts is equally good, his physical presence and cool demeanour perfectly suited to the role. The story is slightly unusual on paper, Matthias Schoenaerts plays Alain who arrives in town with his son looking for work and runs into Stephanie played by Marion Cotillard. She is a performer at a sea park who has a life-changing accident. She gets in touch with Alain and the rest of the movie basically follows their relationship and individual struggles. As I said before the two lead performances are incredible, the look of the film floats between ultra realistic and at times a dreamlike quality which combines with a gorgeous soundtrack to create some spectacular individual moments. There are definitely flaws in the film and if the story or performances don't grab you this might not be for you. I think the film gets a little bit too baggy towards the end, if it would have been kept a bit simpler the core might have had more impact. And I'm not sure whether the last 20 minutes works with what went before and I think this almost looks at times like a movie that didn't know how to end. But this movie really is as life affirming as it is brutal, kind of like a weird mix of Drive and It's A Wonderful Life, with certain moments almost crossing over from sentimental to unnecessary. And my other gripe is that after Marion Cotillard's incident I'm not sure whether enough time was paid to her recovery and feelings towards it. But like I said these issues might be less bothersome for you, and the performances and direction more than redeem it. Like I said it's definitely worth a watch and a re-watch for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly compelling, a must see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those unaccustomed to French movies, especially dramas like this one, it may take you a while to warm up to the characters, but you will most certainly before the movie is over. In there lies the brilliance of the writing and directing of Jacques Audiard. I have seen only one other of his film so far, A Prophet, and I most certainly want to see the others.The story is a complex one if you consider everything from beginning to end, but let's say the IMDb storyline captures the gist of it, except for how we get immersed in the life of the characters. That is usually what I like about French dramas. Matthias Schoenaerts plays his role, as Alain, with apparent ease and naturally it is all but over done. Take for example the fact the he enjoys engaging in street prize fights; well that side of the character is not the least glamorized nor should it. It also plays out like something that fits the character but does not define him. His love for his son will at some point be the most convincing acting you'll see to be sure.Marion Cotillard is a favorite of mine and has been since first my eyes saw her in the movie A Good Year; I also fell for the delivery of her lines in a big way. Needless to say, she has had a string of good roles and is quite in demand, because she is good. In this movie she plays a very demanding part; her delivery of the paraplegic Stéphanie role is very convincing. In one of the love making scenes she has with Schoenaerts, she makes it sensually beautiful. I'd be remiss if I did not mention that the special effects with regard to her lost legs are the best I've seen and I've seen a few of those over the years. When we see her swim in the sea, it must require outstanding knowledge and hard work to pull that off.Any movie lover worth his/her salt will love this movie. I'll be seeing it more than once and I bet I won't be the only one. The way Audiard makes the love between Alain and Stéphanie simmer and develop is nothing short of compelling; the audience reaches climax when Schoenaerts delivers utterly believable words to Cotillard over the phone. That scene was masterful. This ought to make for a pretty good date movie; guys don't screw this up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Shockingly (and Gloomily) Real Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RUST and BONE immediately drew me in with its arresting cinematography, immediate realism, and so on. The plot is an interesting mix of qualities: compelling but unfocused, surprising but often dissatisfying. As patchy as it is, this story certainly takes you to some interesting places. Several reviewers have noted that we don't know enough about the characters to really empathize with them. I see what they mean, but I think the lack of information is intentional, and I'm not so sure that it would be better if we did know more--not because they're such terrible people, but because, you know, does it really matter in the end? The mere fact that reviewers--even those who give it only 1-5 stars--have found so much to analyze here and have interpreted RUST and BONE in so many different ways says something for the substance of this film.Anyhoo, Ali and Stephanie are both quite real, and RUST and BONE is an interesting mass character study of people at their bests and worsts, who, though it's nothing dramatic, DO experience some change and transformation at the end, discovering what's most important to them. Stepanie's injury and Ali's love coupled with abuse and neglect of his son are vital ingredients, done with sober conviction.Those with a low tolerance for raw violence and/or melancholy should probably skip RUST and BONE. Otherwise, it's an interesting change of pace that stays with you for awhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a splendid movie. not ,only, for acting, image or genius of director but for its force. for the art to have roots in every day reality and in ordinary life of viewer. impressive, powerful, honest at whole. salted, cruel, delicate, speech about vulnerability and need of the other as existence support, a great opportunity to remind the amazing artistic possibilities of Marion Cotillard, it is a necessary film. for understand yourself, for see a magnificent manner to use silence as the most powerful speech, for explore levels of fragility and the subtle science to be part from the other. beautiful images, superb performance. and something else. the deep roots. because it is one of rare films who becomes part of yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What have you done with my legs?' Implacable Forces of Nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: May Contain Spoilers Films that linger in that disrupted corner of the psyche are rare and writer/director Jacques Audiard (A Prophet, The Beat That My Heart Skipped, Read My Lips) has that rare ability to create a strange but believable encounter and develop that into a relationship so unique and yet so seemingly mundane that he jars his audience, leaving them with a more acute vision of our needs as human beings. RUST AND BONE is based on a strange story by Craig Davidson and Audiard along with Thomas Bidegain transformed this touching love tale into an unusually moving and beautiful film.Ali (the strikingly handsome and talented Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts) in his mid 20's, an unemployed father to a young son, Sam (Armand Verdure) travels on a metro gathering scraps of discarded food for sustenance and arrives in Antibes, southern France to look for work. The father son duo crash with Ali's sister Anna (Corinne Masiero) who already has her own share of problems with money and temporary employment. Ali gets a job as a bouncer in a night club but maintains his passion for kick boxing. One evening in the nightclub where he works, Ali meets Stéphanie (Marion Cotillard) and escorts her safely to her home after she is injured in a brawl at the club. Stéphanie works at a marine tourist park training Orca whale's where she suffers a tragic accident during a show and wakes up in the hospital to realize that her legs have been amputated. Ali meets a guy at work who informs him about a kick boxing game where he can make money and enjoy his sport. Stéphanie, now in a wheelchair, is terminally depressed and gives Ali a call. Ali visits her and takes her to a beach where they swim. Over a period of time, Ali and Stéphanie spend a lot of time together and get involved in casual sex 'on call', while Ali hooks up with other women as well, being honest about it with Stéphanie. Stéphanie starts to accompany Ali to the kick boxing matches and a symbiosis forms between both of them. Stéphanie regains self esteem in Ali's company and gets artificial limbs. She starts to walk again and even manages Ali's bets for kick boxing. Ali, Stéphanie and some friends visit the same night club where Ali used to work. Ali goes to the dance floor and flirts with a girl as Stéphanie watches curiously. Ali goes away with the girl leaving a dejected Stéphanie with other friends. Anna is fired from her job as the higher management comes to know of her taking home the expired food products. Anna blames Ali for this as Ali was involved in an odd job where he installed spy cameras in work areas at the direction of the management to spy on the activities of their employees. This results in a standoff between Ali and Anna's partner and Ali leaves. Sam stays with Anna while Ali goes to a training facility for kick boxers in a distant place and loses touch with Stéphanie. Sam visits Ali at his facility for a day and both are shown playing on a frozen lake. A weak spot on the frozen lake cracks and Sam falls into the lake, loses consciousness and floats on. Once Ali realizes Sam is missing and spots him under the frozen lake, Ali breaks his hands with his beating the ice to free the unconscious Sam. Sam survives and in the hospital Ali breaks down while talking to Stéphanie on the phone and confesses his love for her after realizing that he had been cold and insensitive to her all this time. As the film closes, Ali is shown to have gone professional in kick-boxing as Sam and Stephanie stand by him in what looks like a post-fight victory ceremony.The film is enhanced by Alexandre Desplat's sensitive musical score and the cinematography, especially in the fight scenes, by Stéphane Fontaine is exemplary. But it is the powerful performances by Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts that bring this impossibly fragile film to a new height of cinematic brilliance. This is a film to see repeatedly and to purchase for your personal library of exceptional films. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching film, weak ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I appreciated this film for it's portrayal of two people with rough moments in their life. It shows tenderness, compassion between the characters, support through their struggles, pushing each other to succeed, and eventually the commitment of two people who otherwise are used to living very independent lives.Essentially Ali is a man with a history of fighting/brawling, who comes to live with his sister and brings along his 5 year old son. What brings them there to their new life is perhaps the boy's mother being caught by authorities for drug smuggling. It seems that being a father is something new to Ali.Stephanie is a whale trainer at a local marine park, and ends up in a devastating accident that leaves her with her legs being amputated. Her struggle is in making sense out of life, whether to continue, the shame of being a cripple, etc. The general story arch plays with themes of independence and love, and perhaps make the case for love, it's essential need. They originally meet when he is a bouncer at a club that she gets in a fight from, and it shows her in a weak state of desperation to be noticed/thrilled by men. After her accident, Stephanie struggles to cope with life and Ali helps push her back into normalcy. For a while they are just friends and sexual partners, but this is perhaps due to their old habits. In the beginning (prior to Stephanie's accident) it shows her with her boyfriend which is obviously an abusive situation. It's not until near the end of the movie that the two characters realize that maybe love is worth it.There were some incredible ordinary moments that brought the viewer to a profound emotional moment. Ali picks up a girl from a bar, when he and Stephanie are clearly in a romantic grey zone (being sexually active). The movie is not afraid to show the characters making mistakes and their conversation the next day shows some surprises as to how the characters can deal with things without getting too cliché/Hollywood. Stephanie shows a certain maturity and independence not found in chick flicks. Seeing Stephanie ultimately supportive of Ali's fighting was a bit of a surprise. Maybe through her accident she has changed her view of life, become a tougher person. She took on as his manager eventually and she did well. She never blinked, never got scared, especially the one match where he was getting the crap beat out of him. All she did was get out of the van and walked up to the crowd, stood there, and watched, expecting him to do his best. It felt like one of those moments where an authoritative father would walk up to his son in a brawl and simply stand there, implying to him: 'dont disappoint me'. Perhaps in that sense it portrays her love for him, being supportive of him for what he has to do, even if it (brawling) is not the best thing. It's what he's good at and she's supportive.The movie did show a certain lopsidedness of Stephanie realizing how impractical it is for her to have the same casual lifestyle as Ali. She tries, but fails miserably when a man trying to pick her up sees her prosthetic legs. It seems that at this point she realizes that she can't go through life casually anymore. I knew off the bat that Ms. Cotillard actually did have legs so I was curious about the scenes showing her without them. I will say the indoor scenes are convincing, but the beach scenes seemed to not work well, where it was quite noticeable where her legs were erased with colors that didn't match the background (the sky) and blurry legs.Unfortunately I found the movie to have a weak ending. There was a big conflict between Ali and his sister regarding some video cameras he helped install (illegally) at her place of employment, and in the process it got her fired because she took home expired food (yogurt/etc). This conflict didn't make sense. I worked at a produce distributor briefly and they were happy to give employees expired food, simply because the other option was to throw it away. It's too old to remain on the shelf. It's not like they stole sellable food. This odd plot point felt disappointing because I didn't find it realistic. This conflict drove Ali to run away, to some sort of training center for fighters. Perhaps he felt desperate. In the process he totally abandons his son (leaves with his sister), which didn't make sense to me, but perhaps again part of his character flaws.The climax is a crisis with him and his son on a frozen pond and the boy falls through the ice. I felt a bit confused since it doesn't show the boy with any signs of life, not breathing, not choking up water, not Ali giving him CPR. You find out later that he was in a coma for a few hours, but survives. At this point Ali feels lost and in terror and calls Stephanie, perhaps only then realizing how much better and easier life is to love and be loved. They get together, he becomes a big fighter, the boy is OK, the end. It just felt like it overlooked a major moment of the two characters really committing/expressing their love... The movie didn't need to go all Hollywood chick-flick, but I felt that given the entire emotional exploration through the rest of the movie that it was an essential point, that they at least talk to each other and convince each other why things are better together. The ending was undeveloped, and so that's why I rated it down 3 points.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was announced as one of the candidates for the Palme d'Or and a next tremendous performance by Schoenaerts... Although I was overall satisfied and gave it a score of 8, I would like to mention here my disappointments. - it felt as if the success concept of the D'Ardenne brothers was used by Audiard: naturalistic story, long scene of small motorbike driving person thinking..., a kid that has to survive a broken marriage, etc... Why? Why not find your own concept? Why not let the D'Ardennes make such movies, one per year is enough! - Schoenaerts plays very good, but almost exactly the same style and personality as in Bullhead... Of course one can't refuse Audiard, but sad for Matthias to play 2 times the same thing, and let's hope it doesn't mark him to play such roles in his whole career.. - Why does the boy have to falling the ice? It seems squeezed in at the end of this 2 hour movie... Actually the whole part of the story after the father fled, leaving his son behind, is too short and feels like only an annex to the story. - Some of the music used, is not bad... but often doesn't fit the atmosphere, for one part because it are English songs.So, my conclusion, I'll change my score from 8 to 7 )) and hope that Cannes will see it as I did, otherwise will be so disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull film about damaged people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has been recommended to me several times, so I thought I'd give it a watch. I have to say, I've spent two hours far more productively with my feet up on my desk and staring at my toenails.Rust and Bone tells the story of two damaged people that, in finding one another, heal themselves and go on with their lives.Except... that it doesn't. Whilst the male and female leads are damaged (she even before she suffers the loss of her legs), there is no noticeable character change in either of them. Oh... unless you count the sudden scene at the end - more later.The male is thuggish, boorish and uncaring almost to a sociopathic extreme. He feeds his child leftovers from strangers and barely seems to care about the boy.The woman is self-absorbed and dismissive of others, even calling her boyfriend "A small man" at one point early on when he is humiliated in his own home by the thug.Neither of them is remotely likable. He comes across as a dimwit. She as a narcissist.Then they meet. We are supposed to think there might be some chemistry between them but, frankly, I've seen more chemistry in a Christian Scientist's bathroom cabinet than these two conjure up. There's just nothing likable about either of them. They have sex. They discuss it in a horribly disinterested manner and basically agree to be each other's "friend-with-benefits".If there was any chemistry I was hoping to find, it was bleach. Bleach. Thrown into my eyes to prevent me from watching any more of these two's ludicrous antics. But it was not to be, so...I watched them heal each other. Or at least, I think that is what the story was aiming for. But it just fails dismally at this.After getting together, both people do not change in even the slightest. He is still a thuggish street-fighter. She is still a self-obsessed prima donna.The token concession to "everything-turning-out-alright-in-the-end" was the final scene, out of the blue. It shows the thug becoming a world champion martial artist whilst she stands by with the son by her side, his artful manager. A proper family unit at last! It is all ridiculously unbelievable and borderline insulting.I hate to say this, but if the two characters had been given an ounce more humanity, a smidgeon more personality, and made even slightly likable, then the film would have suceeded very well.Instead, the story focuses not on the relationship between the two, but on the two as individuals. It is utterly wrong. It's like someone asked Data from Star Trek to write a love story before he got the emotion chip!Don't get me wrong. I love foreign cinema. The original versions of Girl with the Dragon Tattoo are far superior to the Hollywood remake. Same with Let Me In. But this isn't in that league. Not even close.SUMMARY: Dull, focuses on individuals, not the relationship. Characters that won't grow on you no matter how much Baby-Bio you force feed them. If you are looking for a romantic drama, give this one a miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contrived ending results in downgraded rating for OK romance between emotionally stunted kick boxer and accident victim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does 'Rust and Bone' excite you? Well, it does have a few good things about it. Principally there are those incredible special effects where they've managed to trick you into believing that Marion Cotillard who plays the protagonist's love interest, the whale-training Stéphanie, is actually missing both her limbs in real life. The effects are so real that when Stéphanie is injured at a local marine tourist park in an accident involving a whale she's been training, you begin to believe that her legs were superimposed through special effects, when we're introduced to the character, BEFORE the accident. Rest assured, however, it's the other way around. Ms. Cotillard indeed is fully mobile, walking about in real life, without prosthetics!Of course the most interesting thing about the film is how the romance between the aspiring kick boxer Alain and the now depressed and bereft Stéphanie, develops. Stéphanie has lost her confidence as a woman due to the loss of her lower extremities but eventually begins having casual sex with Alain. She begins spending more time with him, ending up managing his kick boxing bouts. The companionship leads Stéphanie to acquire artificial limbs and she gradually pulls herself out of the worst part of her depressive funk.Alain is much more problematic. He's set up as an unlikeable character so that he can have that big epiphany at film's end and redeem himself. But do you really want to go along for the ride and wait until Alain's big transformation? I don't fault him for most of his casual sex jaunts, especially because he's straight up about that with Stéphanie. Of course, he does act quite crass when he walks off with a woman in front of Stéphanie at the bar before their temporary separation. And what about all the kick boxing scenes? If you're not too interested in the sport (as I am), then you might not be too excited about Alain's quest to succeed in that particular sports arena.Getting back to why and how the films' scenarists strive to paint Alain in such an unflattering light, again they need that set-up to turn him into a hero so we can identify with the character at film's end. Alain hits rock bottom when his sister Anna loses her job and she blames him for setting up a surveillance camera that reveals that she's been pilfering expired food products. As a result, Anna kicks her brother out of her house and he ends up traveling away at that distant kick boxing training facility. You'll notice that Alain's 'crime' in libertarian France, was to align himself with corporate management, and install those surveillance cameras that catch people like his sister, who are only making off with expired food products.Now that tainted Alain must be redeemed, the 'Rust and Bone' scenarists resort to the old sleight of hand. Little Sam falls through the ice and despite the fact that he's in the water for any normal person to experience brain damage, Alain, utilizing those powerful kick boxing hands, cracks the ice and saves little Sam just in time to prevent him from turning into a vegetable.Now the once disgraced working-class Judas, has saved his son and gets the girl back (that of course being Stéphanie). I for one would have liked Alain's redemption to be a little more subtle. But hey, you can't have everything. Looking at Ms. Cottilard is good enough for me, even without those beautiful legs!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen a film from this director before, so in that respect I had no expectations. But I do love Cotillard, and since her break-out year n 2007 with La Vie En Rose she's one of the ones I look forward to the most. I have liked her in mostly all of the American films I have seen her in, but her heavy accent is always what kinda holds her back a little. I think because English seems to come so difficult to her, it seems like her just talking calls attention to itself. So in that regard I was definitely interested in seeing her in a 2nd foreign-language film. I haven't seen many of the Oscar contenders, but she gives what is easily the best performance of the year so far. Here she pretty much lives her character, and there is not one false note in her entire performance. This is key because in the past, although she always has this fierce magnetism, she also is sometimes inconsistent in her recent American films. This reaffirms what I had thought of, that Cotilard just fits better in her native tongue. She can be melodramatic when she needs to play a melodramatic character (La Vie En Rose) and here she gives an acting performance that's the polar opposite. Her many nuances make this is a fairly low-key performance, but I'll be surprised if there's anything bad to be said about her here, and that's a testament to how well she just fits in it.As for the film itself, it was actually very good. It's a film that I can already see myself reflecting on in the future. My only real complaint would be that the ending was perhaps a little bit too neat.</fullReview>

I watched the movie like a year ago and I gave it a 7.5 but after viewing it again I gave it an 8 which looks more appropriate to this amazing movie.I just watched this movie cause I like Marion Cotillard the movie centers around a guy (Matthias Schoenaerts) who is a boxer and also in charge of his son living with his sister meets and develops bond with Stephanie (Marion) after Stephanie suffers a horrible accident. Alain according to me is a careless man and particularly lives life on his own term of a guy on the other hand Stephanie is the completely opposite of him. I totally love this movie the main thing that I like the most is the chemistry of these two its truly amazing. The scene I like the most is when Alain decides to go fight again and Shephanie was shocked. The direction was great and also the CGI which was remarkably marvelous.I would recommend this to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a nuanced fashion of storytelling, Rust and Bone is simply a contemporary masterpiece. This film is compelling story of love, broken love, redeeming love, and everlasting love; a must see for any lover of the cinema. It has surely been a while since I've experienced such a range of emotions on such a deep level. Also one heck of a rousing and resonating performing by Marion Cotillard, worthy of an Academy Award. Most notable is the way Audiard handled the direction of certain sequences including the first beach scene where Stephanie decides to swim, the part when Stephanie steps out of the vehicle during Ali's match, and the climax at the frozen lake. I must say I was stirred. I'm always watching the screen intently, carefully analyzing the way in which things are presented and more often than not I am not fully entertained or should I say inside the movie. However, the film was captivating enough that it made me feel a range of emotions. Through this film Audiard has rendered a masterful love story about the power of human will to overcome the greatest of challenges. So intense yet incredibly understated.The soundtrack is also stellar, featuring some of my favorite musicians including Bon Iver and M83. Jacques Audiard is underrated!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>rust and bone, flesh and soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the second film that I see directed by Jacques Audiard, a cinema personality who seems to have written many more scripts than movies that he had made. I am yet to see Un prophete which is considered his best, but the previous one which was called 'De battre mon coeur s'est arrete' was a fine and sensitive piece of cinema, with Romain Duris, one of my preferred French actors in the principal role. Now comes 'Rust and Bone' a striking, cruel, almost naturalist drama, but a sincere and moving film at the same time. Although based on a story that could have easily slid into cheap melodrama it succeeds to create emotion by a direct and minimalistic approach in describing a reality which is not soft with its heroes.The two heroes of the movies are broken and vulnerable in different ways. Alain (Matthias Schoenaerts) is homeless and just got his 5-years old son on his back, he comes to the South of France to his sister to find a roof and maybe a job to ensure his minimal living. His only credentials are his fighting skills, mostly exercised in the street, but these eventually help him get hired as a security guard in a night club. This is where he meets Stephanie (Marion Cotillard) who is an orca whales trainer in an amusement park. The girl soon will be hurt and lose both legs in a work accident. Broken and lonely she calls the only number she may have had asking Alain for help to overcome the limits of her infirmity. The two come from different worlds, but fate brings them together, a basic solidarity that does not need too many words is at the root of their relation before other feelings develop. He has the force to help her overcome her limitations, the bones that wipe aside the rust. He is no communicator though, and the type of relation they develop needs a crisis to test its strength and eventually bring them together.The film succeeds to avoid melodrama and radiates sincerity to a large extent due to the splendid performances of the the two lead actors. Marion Cotillard lives the transformation from tragedy to recovery, from being broken to being in control. Matthias Schoenaerts plays the type of man unable to express his feelings in words, but expressing his feelings and ambitions in deeds, and sometimes in violent acts. The whole film is quite brutal, physical, but this is the whole idea, the contrast between force and mind, the search for the core of the real strength. Eventually the it is the force of souls that can overcome the rustiness of the bones. Man is flesh and bones, and these may be vulnerable, but where is friendship and then love, there may be hope. Unfortunately the last ten minutes or so are expedited in a manner that makes the ending look like a Hollywood movie, it's not that I disliked the happy-end in this case, but for the first time in this movie the outcome relates to things that do not happen on the screen, so the feeling of being slightly fooled cannot be avoided. Yet, for most of the time there is truth and emotion in 'De rouille et d'os', which may not be easy to watch because of the cruelty of a few of the sequences, yet it leaves a feeling of goodness in the memory of the spectators.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Her story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The general view from critics and moviegoers appears to be that there are two parallel stories, hers and his, the former pitch-perfect while the latter leaving much to be desired. I beg to differ. This is all her story. His existence, and all that happens around him to boot, is only to accentuate her story. I recognize that he has more screen time but a mere quantitative factor should not be the sole criterion.This is a story about how a woman who has lost her legs from knee below struggles to get a normal life back, a story at once simple and profound. Even more importantly, the film is impeccably realistic, telling the story with no dramatic enhancement.It indeed starts with him, showing Ali (Matthais Schoenaerts), a single parent (for whatever reason, probably marital problems), drifting with 5-year-old son Sam (Armand Verdure) and ending up in his sister's place in a small French town where he gets various odd jobs (club bouncer, store security guard). The story really begins with his brief encounters with Stephanie (Marion Cotillard) ending up leaving her with his phone number (circumstances incidental and nonessential). From then on, the focus is her story.A profession trainer in an ocean theme park, she is seen next in an accident where she loses her legs when one of her orcas loses control during a performance. Details are kept vague as the last shot we see before the hospital bed (where it is quite conspicuous under the sheet that she has lost her legs) is a shot from under water showing her floating, apparently still with her legs. The crux of the film, brilliantly delivered with convincing details, is how this perfectly normal, professional woman stands up again (even literally) after this crushing calamity. She has been a self-assured, beautiful woman, used to enjoy attention from men. Now, she is a helpless creature, wheel-chair bound, and sometimes has to resort to crawling along the floor. This is all depicted without contrived sentimentality, but realistically, and is more effective for that. What's more, she still has normal sexual needs. In desperation, she calls Ali just to have a human soul to relate to, choosing him probably because this is not someone who knew her well before as a normal person. That is someone much easier for her to face. An interesting relationship develops, and flourishes likely because there is no particular demand or expectation from either side. Sex comes into the picture, which he describes as "OP", meaning optional, with no strings attached and that seems to suit both parties. She is well on her way to recovery when she is finally able to stand on her own two feet, sort of, with prosthetic legs (and supported by a walking cane).With her old life gone (but she seems financially quite secured), his life becomes part of hers, particularly his moonlighting job of an illegal, bare-fisted prize fighter. Through her involvement with it, we see the tougher side of Stephanie as her character gains more dimensions. Ali's character, on the other hand, does not get developed into another layer of depth. We can see, however, that while he is careless (sometime verging on callousness), he is not heartless, evident not only in his relationship with Stephanie, but also with his 5-year-old boy. I would not go into any further details. The ending is somewhat laboured but achieves its purpose of injecting a ripple of emotion without being over-contrived. Critics have heaps praises upon praises on Cotillard, not only for this film but in general, to which there is really nothing I can add other than to agree wholeheartedly. Schoenaerts provides good support. Little Verdure is yet another bright spot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The lead acting performances and the unbroken nature of the director make the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jacques Audiard was brought to the attention of many Americans in 2008 with A Prophet, the winner of that years Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. This time around Marion Cotillard (Inception, The Dark Knight Rises) and Matthias Schoenaerts (Bullhead) team up for his newest film just released in limited theaters, Rust and Bone. The film stars a single father named Ali who meets Stephanie, an orca trainer at France's version of SeaWorld, and they strike up a friendship based off a need for each other. Both characters are certainly flawed (who isn't?) but for some reason even from the start they seem to work for each other. In the now three films I have seen from Audiard I have never been too blow away, but in this film the lead acting performances and the unbroken nature of this French film untouched by the regular tropes of Hollywood, makes a nice match worthy of anyone's viewing.Due to her job as a whale trainer and performer, Cotillard's Stephanie in a very comfortable position in her life. In a sort of dance to Katy Perry's "Fireworks" she moves herself in a synchronized fashion but the movements of her arms just seem to ooze out of her like she was born to move that way. But then, not even fully explained to the audience, there is an accident where her platform breaks during a show, and both her legs have to be amputated. From this point on Ali and Stephanie must learn to trust each other, because they each have something to offer each other. Ali takes a job as a street fighter to earn extra wages, and Stephanie has to fight the depression of losing her ability to walk. Both actors pull off these aspects of their roles tremendously. Cotillard has been a stellar actress since her breakthrough Oscar wining role of Edith Piaf in "La Vie En Rose" but this role may be her finest. During the course of the movie her character has to deal with a few life changing moments and she handles them all fantastically. Even though she is now becoming a huge star in America and thus the world, Cotillard is not afraid to take her body and her mind to deep places during her performances. The poster of the film is a good example of that, Ali is so strong and fit he is without effort able to carry her to the water on his back while she is only wearing panties. The times like that scene were Ali and Stephanie share the screen are the finest moments of the film even though it is never clear if there is a particular reason why these two people are so drawn together.Audiard is also credited for co-writing the screenplay for this film and I wondered at times if that is a good thing or not. Even though the film does not labor, it really did not put to use the full 120 minutes of its time to enhance the story. There are moments with Ali's character in particular that seem a little obvious. From very early on it is clear that he is probably not the best father in the world, and since he is a street fighter in a movie of course he can get angry and violent at the drop of a hat. The film juxtaposes Ali and Stephanie in these ways seemingly coming to the conclusion that opposites attract, but I never cared about the two together in a romantic sense. They are both attractive people so a connection in that way is not unthinkable but the flaws of the film occur when you are supposed to feel something for them together that I never did. There is also one subplot with Ali's character that was unnecessary and should have never made it to the final draft of the screenplay. Still on the strength of the two performances and how well the journey we take with Stephanie is done, I would easily recommend Rust and Bone to anyone interested in movies even if it is just for a solid one time viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HK Auteur Review - Rust and Bone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Put in charge of his young son Sam, Alain (played by Matthias Schoenaerts) leaves Belgium for Antibes to live with his sister and her husband as a family. Alain's bond with Stephanie, a killer whale trainer, grows deeper after Stéphanie (played by Marion Cotillard) suffers a horrible accident where she loses her legs.I have struggled with writing about this movie for months now. I have accepted the fact hat this review just simply won't do the film any justice. So I'm going to just go straight into it...Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts both give great performances. I don't know if it's because I find Marion Cotillard really attractive or if she's just really engages me an actress, but in every one of her scenes, I feel like I'm watching someone suffer right in front of me. This is probably what people were describing back then when Marlon Brando broke out with method acting in A Streetcar Named Desire.Matthias Schoenaerts plays Ali like a brute animal that wants to communicate but doesn't know how to show his soft side. The way Ali fathers his son Sam is upsetting yet very engaging to watch. It dispels the idea that a lead character doesn't necessarily have to be likable as long as he's watchable. We can see how he is trying to be better, even though he can't help but be himself.Ali and Stéphanie are one of the the most memorable on screen couples I have seen in a while. These two characters cannot be anymore different from each other and yet I believed their relationship. It feels so real the way the two leads play it.The film is gritty, poetic and even elusive at times. It hit a very deep note inside me and that makes it very hard to talk about the film's inner workings. It made me think of how love between two people really is very dependent on need, circumstance and timing. Ali's animalistic alpha male nature is the exact thing that feeds into Stéphanie's trauma from the tragic loss of her legs. He is so straightforward about sex to the point where he almost doesn't even notice she is legless, which in turn is what begins to make feel Stéphanie normal and even beautiful again. This slowly lifts her out of depression and she regains meaning in her life and supports Ali's animal nature (in the form of underground boxing), which is the exact personality trait that always gets him in trouble.Against the film's gritty raw palette, the unfolding of their relationship was very touching and deeply romantic as I felt what every action and reaction means internally and externally to both characters. When two people fall for each other, it feels like they're creating their own private internal world together. This movie made me feel like I am watching that world slowly being created between these two people. I liked being inside their idiosyncratic world. Even though the actual situation would seem depressing, on the contrary, it's executed with such vivid detail with so many poetic truthful moments that it made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. One noteworthy poetic moment was a scene where Stéphanie revisits her workplace and regains meaning to move on from her injury as she watches a killer whale through a tank.Some have said that the ending feels abrupt. I did not feel that way. The melodramatic emotions all properly build powerfully underneath throughout the movie till it wells up and completely geysers its way to a satisfying finish. It did not feel like a jump at all. Some can say it was a hokey cheesy way to end the movie and that can be a legitimate critique but it worked for me. Rust and Bone punched my gut, turned me into a sap and left me speechless.It's one of the best films I've seen in 2012. I tremendously enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone. I need to see The Prophet now.For more reviews, please visit my blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The accidental dreaming child</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is beautiful in its conception. I'm not talking strictly about the relationship story of personal growth, which is a bit too heavyhanded for my taste, or the acting, which is fine, or the camera which is in the Epstein-Malick mode of lush, stolen light from memory. The film is in general an excellent production, but so many are while lacking the richer abstract blueprint. Critics as usual have missed that blueprint, focusing on off-beat romance and melodrama. Admittedly, Audiard has pitched elements of his film too loudly (street fights, amputee sex), which is bound to distract viewers from where the soul of the thing is. So, let's start by discarding the 'hard' aspects. The man is a careless single father who boxes on the side in bare- knuckles street fights. He meets a woman who has lost her legs and the desire to live. He is a boxer so we can have a protagonist who is not involved in some particularly noble struggle, but struggles nonetheless, which is part of the point here and connects to the woman's situation. Nevermind the melodramatic accident, that is only in the story to introduce her character as lonely and depressed, not desired anymore, which is the more familiar experience, though it gets in the way of us relating to simply a damaged self. I would more gently pitch her as a beautiful middle-aged woman confronting time. Nevermind too the powerful but explicit denouement. So far we have visually ambitious melodrama, which is where most critics have rested. It's heavyhanded for my taste, because I don't like stuff that impose hard limits to experience. But that is all here as support for meditation. What is visually inferred is far, far richer. The idea is that as you go through life, all sorts of ebbs and forces chisel away parts of you. It is the memory of gestures left unfinished, things half- said, dreams interrupted, a kind of rust of time that settles on the bones and mind. All you need to know is in a series of images of people seeing and being seen, attempting connection. The first of those is your clue. The film opens with a child asleep, dreaming up the images which are shaping him into the man he is going to be one day. The dreaming child is our narrative center, a powerful device that opens up to everything else. The father works as a bouncer screening people, working one night, he sees her damaged and takes her home. As it turns out, she is a trainer in an aquatic park, putting on shows before people. It is plain when we first see her on the show that she has lost any enthusiasm for what she does (that includes her affair), which translates in the completely random accident that leaves her drained and catatonic. This provides the opportunity?water is deeply cinematic?for one of three images that deeply define what this is, the shot of her, broken and drifting unconscious in the liquid void, which links her back to the dreaming child at the mercy of visions. Then later, she watches from the window of a car as the man fights. He inspires passionate life in her, which she returns to him as determination to keep fighting. Then, the shot of her alone at the balcony?rejuvenated?performing her stageshow signals. And the third shot that defines this, when the man loses his son in the ice, finds him again and helplessly watches as he drifts away?again linking back to cosmic water, and dreaming child. This is followed by the coma and the child waking up a second time. This is great stuff. The dreaming child who by accident one day opened his eyes to the world, we all did. The woman drifting unconscious. The characters as oblivious to forces that shape them as the child is to dream-images. The child waking up again with all life ahead of him, life not unlike what we have seen go. Folks, this is one of this year's best, the film Enter the Void tried to be and failed, all about visions from the soul's disembodied journey back through life, cycles and transience.&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2606;</fullReview>

Fighting against their dramatic odds, events, they learn and became a support each other, stand up and slowly find their way to make things work within their rust and broken bones bodies and life.The actors are good, the story slow pacing, extremely dramatic that touches difficult issues, but never boring and very well told, interesting and gripping. Hard and dry as it is used by the director Jacques Audiard.A film by the harsh colors with positive implications.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Rust and Bone" had Oscar buzz earlier this year, though it did not earn any nominations. This latest Jacques Audiard opus is a featured film in a local French film festival now and is the most familiar title there.Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts) is a street fighter, a selfish brute of a guy. Ali lives largely for himself alone, treating people around him like mere objects. Stephanie (Marion Cotillard) is a killer whale trainer who lost her legs in a freak accident. She is very frustrated by her unconventional relationship with Ali. Will it have to take a major catastrophic event to snap Ali out of his numbed sensibilities?Your attention will undoubtedly be riveted to Marion Cotillard as she is the highlight of this film. This attention will be both for her passionate performance, as well the astounding special visual effect of her without two legs. Those scenes of Stephanie swimming at the beach or in the throes of passion in bed were so realistic. There was also a scene of Cotillard with a killer whale very memorable for its beauty. Too bad Cotillard was not on screen too much for the last quarter of the film, and we will miss her presence. But that last quarter was when Matthias Schoenaerts ups his acting card and comes up with a performance to remember before the film ends.This is not a film for everybody. The development of the story is very slow, in typical French fashion. It took almost two hours to reach its climax, which may not sit well with viewers used to Hollywood films. There were graphic scenes of sex and violence, reflecting Ali's lifestyle, which may be too repetitive. However, those who patiently wait for the ending sequences will be satisfactorily rewarded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rust and Bone is a hard-hitting drama about a guy who is rough around the edges, and the unlikely woman who smooths those edges out.Marion Cotillard is fantastic.The film has a few scenes that are extremely powerful. Truly some of the best I've seen in a while.There's a word in the script here that is used on more than one occasion in the film, and I think it really encapsulates what the film is all about... the word is considerate.Trek up to the Redbox and bring this home for movie night with your better half. You'll look like you're shooting in the dark, but you'll come-out smelling like a box of roses.86/100.Top-10 film for me for 2012 - no question!The film is subtitled(it's french), but the dialog isn't over-bearing, so it doesn't detract from the experience at all.I know I've failed as 'the movie selector' when the wife says, "you don't have to stop it", before she leaves the room. Every time she got up to get a drink or use the bathroom she said, "pause it". She doesn't do that often. good flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is very well done film, with a very good script, has a cast that delivers an excellent performance and is, in my opinion, closer to tragedy than drama. It is clearly not for everyone.In order not to spoil the watching, i won't mentioned the main twists in the plot. However, i'd like to mention what i thought was beyond the obvious. I think that the author explored the people who are alone or prefer to be left on their own. I was under the impression that he tried to show how these lone wolves cope with it and what happens when they meet someone alike or when the circumstances change (for better or for worse).My favorite thing about "De rouille et d'os" is that a large portion of it happens on the French Riviera (Côte d'Azur) and i even recognized some landmarks between Nice and Cannes. Yet we see little of the glamour usually associated with the area. We do see some seaside but even that is a shrouded vision rather than a maritime scenery and adds to the overall atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Rust and Bone" is an emotional, tough yet beautiful adult French drama that punches more in the head rather than heart. Jacques Audiard brilliantly gathering two lonely-damaged soul into a complicated relationship with stylish direction and slow plot. The two leading role, Matthias Schoenaerts and Marion Cotillard confidently portrays two different background character that unconditionally need each other to pass through every hard moment in front. Especially for Marion Cotillard, her ability in acting is unquestionable, she successfully brings a magnetic performance as Stephanie and invites audiences sympathy with her character. Still, "Rust and Bone" is imperfect as a movie. Some non-ethics behavior from Ali, too slow storytelling and soulless romance makes this drama hardly to see more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Rust and Bone" sure had its rusty moments, make no bones about it. Marion Cotillard stars as Stephanie, a killer whale trainer, who tragically loses her legs during one of the shows of the whale theme park she performs at. Matthias Schoenaerts co-stars as Alain, a financially-struggling single father to a young boy who leaves Belgium to Antibes to live with his sister. Alain meets Stephanie before her accident at a bar where he is the bouncer at. After Stephanie's tragedy, the two grow closer together even though Alain still wants to get his bone on with the ladies. Writer-Director Jacques Audiard's orchestration of the film did not have me having a whale of a time, it seemed stagnant at times and very uneven. His rusty screenplay also needed a bit of an entertainment polish. Nevertheless, Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenarts' riveting starring performances is what kept "Rust and Bone" from drowning. If you love "Rust and Bone" I have a bone to pick with you; but I say go see it anyways if it's your last rustort, I mean resort. *** Average</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rust and Bone Review: A Physical Marvel of a Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes, the most memorable moments in life; the most life lasting encounters you make and the people who affect your life the most, are presented to each person at the most unusual moments and rather misunderstood times. Life is a plethora of unknowns; a catalogue of mysteriousness and uncertainty. Jacques Audiard's newest film attests to these simple yet rather complicated notions. Rust And Bone is plagued with beautiful instances of utter truth and stark realities.Based on the short-story from Canadian author Craig Davidson, the film introduces us to two simple yet complex characters. Ali Van Versch, played with such force and acting momentum by the dazzling and captivating newcomer Matthias Schoenaerts, is a broke and down to his luck single father. After arriving in Antibes with his son Sam (Armand Verdure), Ali stays with his sister Anna (Corinne Masiero) and her partner, who are both struggling to make ends meet. Without any money or a job, Ali soon finds employment as a bouncer at a local club; a position he was able to attain quickly given his experience as a kick-boxer and his passion for fighting. Stephanie, played by the always impressive Marion Cotillard, is a killer whale trainer and sea-mammal enthusiast. While breaking a fight, that leaves Stephanie on the bloody end of a fist at The Annex, the club Ali works at, turns into a chance meeting that will change both Ali and Stephanie's life forever. Disoriented and alone, Ali offers to drive Stephanie home. After the night at the club and meeting Ali, Stephanie returns to work. The next day, tragedy strikes at Stephanie's workplace, leaving Stephanie's world unravelling and crippled?crippled of her passion, crippled of her vigour to live and crippled of her beauty. Unable to deal with Stephanie's disfigurement, many of the loving people in Stephanie's life have now disappeared, including her boyfriend. In an act of desperation and impulse, Stephanie calls Ali. Ali, a rough, tough man whose experiences inside the fighting ring and in life, treats Stephanie as if nothing about her has changed at all. Together, the two begin a fantastically revealing and life-changing journey together. A harrowing tale of chance and love, Rust and Bone is the anticipated film following Jacques Audiard's festival wonder Un Proph?te. A stark difference from his previous effort, Auidard opted for the colourful and flaring images of France compared to the grey and cold confines of a prison. Rust and Bone is a film that has no limitations, and if it does, it is shadowed by Audiard's confidence as a filmmaker. Exploring all the beauty and wonders of the small marvels around us, the film is a refreshingly free cinematic breath of fresh air. Saturated with colourful and grainy montages of beaches, sea-life and water, Cinematographer Stéphane Fontaine does everything in his power to make Rust and Bone a natural visual spectacle. Lead by two of the most physically powerful performances of 2012, both Cotillard and Schoenaerts' bring a power to their characters that change your perspective of them, even in their faults. What begins as a friendship, and Ali's successful attempts to reconnect Stephanie to the beautiful world around her with small acts like: swimming, unemotional sex and strolls along the sun-kissed beach of Cannes, turns into something more. The two begin a love affair, although their relationship is anything but romantic. Rusted with hurt in their hearts and frail by the world around them, the two begin a courtship. Both characters are broken physically. Whether it be Stephanie and the loss of her two legs, or Ali, and his persistence to chase his passion of fighting within the French-Underground world of street prize-fighting, the two characters heal each others pains, both emotionally and physically. Surrounded by pain and hurt, Rust and Bone allows for every colour?every drop of blood to appear more viscous; every solar flare to appear more sun-kissed and every emotion on screen, to stay with the audience. Rust and Bone is a fantastic film with overlooked performances. Schoenaerts, who is on my list of actors to watch rise in the next few years, was a personal favourite staple of the film. His chemistry and rawness was the binding factor that interconnected the beauty of France, the elegance of Stephanie and the brutal reality of the economic situation of France (and Europe as a whole), and the attempts of fragile everyday people, trying to overcome it. As the film fades to white and the credits role, Rust and Bone is a long-lasting and hopeful account of everyday people presented with the ability to be the best versions of themselves, as long as hope and acceptance endures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Occasionally slow, but lifted by the strength of its two lead performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've already noted several times before how much I was anticipating this movie, so I won't bore anyone with the details. I'll just get down to why I thought this movie was so great, which it is. It's Jacques Audiard's follow up to the excellent A Prophet from 2009. It's a love story that centers on the lives of a killer whale trainer who has lost both of her legs in an accident, and a man who helps her, a man living with his sister while he tries to raise his son.The love between these two is a very gradual one that takes a lot of time to develop. Sometimes it does feel too obvious, but the realistic light this movie paints itself in is certainly to be admired. Audiard writes the movie in such a delicate and thoughtful way, and he gets the best out of his cast and craftspeople as a director. Indeed, the two leads are what totally make this movie. Matthias Schoenaerts is very good, and believably fragile. Marion Cotillard gets the best role she's had since La Vie En Rose, rescuing her career from middling supporting performances in American cinema. Hers is raw, heartbreaking, and her presence is just so commanding and charming. All of her scenes in the movie are the most phenomenal moments.****1/2 / *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about Us and Them.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rust and Bone is gritty film mostly about "them".I mean that vast swathe of humanity that we co- exist with without taking much notice.They exist to make the world function but their own existence perpetually remains on the fringe of our consciousness, if at all.This film gives us one "distant us" character and one "definitely them" character.The director Jacques Audiard and his co-writers Thomas Bidegain and Craig Davidson take them and changes them till "we" can no longer tell the difference, becoming for some time "somewhat like them".We have Ali played by Matthias Schoenaerts, a strapping muscular man and his son Sam.Ali is a drifter,probably with a checkered past, a definite "them".The mother of Sam, Ali's companion is not the picture.She used Sam to smuggle drugs.Ali seeks refuge in his sisters house.He has nowhere else to go.He becomes a bouncer at a nightclub where he meets Stephanie, the immensely attractive Marion Cotillard.Ali is straightforward to a fault, he wants to sleep with her and leaves her his number. We see Stephanie, she is the "distant us".A smart sexy woman, who is a professional killer whale handler at a theme park.We see her handle the whales and work the crowd, basking in the adulation.Only they are cheering the Whales, not her.A terrible accident occurs and Stephanie loses her legs.The scenes of a Marion Cotillard without her legs are at first chilling and then sexy.This is also one of the major miracles that this film performs.She gets her thighs tattooed with the French words, droite and gauche meaning left and right.Ali treats her much the same way he treats most women he meets, as sex objects first and buddies later, if they so desire.In their first experimental sexual encounter, Stephanie asks him not to kiss her.Ali asks "Breasts OK?".Thats the kind of man he is .The relationship between them follows unchartered territory.Both characters are very confused, Stephanie because suddenly she is physically transformed and Ali, because circumstances have reduced his life to a basic existence of satisfying simple bodily needs, food, sleep and regular fornication, and anything that disturbs this rhythm is an alarm for him to retreat into his shell.The choice of the name Ali is interesting, it recalls another towering ape of a man in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's 1974 film Ali-Fear Eats the Soul.In that film Ali was a conflicted Arab immigrant in post war Germany who gets drawn into a relationship with an old German woman.There too the relationship starts with sex between two very unlikely people and charts an unpredictable territory.Jacques Audiard shows immense audacity in bringing Ali and Stephanie together. The physicality of their relationship contrasts Stephanie's crushing handicap with Ali's overwhelming physique and their sensibilities which are on somewhat different planes.The film uses very credible plot devices to move the story forward and build an ominous suspense about how things will turn out in the lives of these characters that we deeply start caring about.This is a film that examines two people from a primarily physical point of view, its interesting because human beings have overwhelmingly started defining themselves in purely mental terms, driven by new forms of work where physical effort has been reduced to maintaining good posture at a desk.It is this physicality or its lack thereof which has created new class divides, white and blue collars, and in the case of call centre workers light blue collars, working on a shop floor, not with tools but with fake American accents and telephones.Forces of nature which are both within and around us rear their head and force Ali and Stephanie to re-examine and change themselves in fundamental ways.This film is a study of human motivations at a basic level and in the process locates our emotional needs as merely an important piece in our overall composition.The killer whale which attacks Stephanie acted according to its primal impulse, while Stephanie's taming of the whales is nothing but intellectual arrogance.This is a multilayered film that asks disturbing questions, the most urgent one being the sustainability of our behavioral and societal frameworks, that are primarily rooted in the very recent reality of a technology driven human race, pursuing perhaps unattainable utopian goals at the cost of disregarding our bodies and abusing the environment.Rust and Bone as a title could not have been more apt or thought-provoking.Two days back I reviewed Michael Haneke's Amour , which with great sensitivity showed us the confusion that occurs when our body fails us all of a sudden. Haneke's work has been preoccupied with punishing us for becoming consumers of violence while lounging in our Lazyboy recliners.I have heard it far too often,"Its all in the mind, dude", here Audiard probably fed up of hearing the same,twists our arm and asks us to feel real pain.I believe both directors arrive at a complimentary point of view , but from diametrically opposite directions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"One Day the Pain Will Come Back"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man possesses a dualistic nature: we are constantly struggling with our own personalities. Often times we are compassionate, but at other times we are selfish and apathetic. At times, depression creeps into our minds, but then positivity and optimism guide us through our difficult moments. When we are least expecting it we can revert back into our animalistic tendencies of aggression. We can be so cruel, even to those closest to us, but we also enjoy the ability to love. Humans are an enigma, and we can still manage to surprise each other. Rust and Bone, the latest film from French director Jacques Audiard, runs through the gambit of human emotion. The story follows two characters forced to grapple with their emotional and physical malformations. Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts) is an amateur fighter who uproots his young son from a life of squalor in Belgium, and relocates to France. Ali is forced to contend against numerous factors upon his arrival in a new country. Having never before been solely responsible for his child, he is ill-prepared to handle the challenges facing a single parent. As if to confound matters further, he begins a tumultuous career as a street fighter. Throughout the film, he develops relationships that provide him structure, but others that strip away at his psyche. The most interesting relationship that stems from his activities is with an orca trainer named Stephanie (Marion Cotillard). Soon after their initial meeting, Stephanie is involved in an accident with an orca that costs her the lower portion of her legs. Faced with the gravity of this new handicap, Stephanie must learn to adapt to her physical loss, and restructure herself mentally as well. The film has numerous layers, focusing on each uncomfortable transition in its characters lives. Relationships are established, destroyed, and occasionally mended, but the evolution of these characters is enriched by each interaction.Schoenaerts and Cotillard are remarkable in their respective roles. As Ali, Schoenaerts is a hulking brute who displays little emotion when dealing with his son and family, but is surprisingly delicate where Stephanie is concerned. Like his phenomenal character in Bullhead, Schoenaerts is massive in stature, but manages to exhibit a tortured personality. Ali is quite unlikable in many scenes, but never is he unsympathetic. Cotillard commands a level of passion that few actresses have previously achieved. Stephanie is a formidable character, forced through significant hurdles, and in the hands of a less qualified actress would have been overwhelming. Cotillard portrays the character with a restrained vigor. Her face shifts ever-so-slightly with each nuance of the character. Cotillard and Schoenaerts collaborate very effectively, creating a bond between their characters that transcends the script.Audiard and Stéphane Fontaine (cinematographer) give severe concentration to the visuals in this film. Ali's fight scenes are particularly well shot. Each fight appears to be meticulously choreographed, but avoids any appearance of simulation. The scenes beautifully compliment the gravity of this picture and magnify the emotions being articulated. The most stunning scene in the film features a revitalized Cotillard returning to the orca habitat for the first time after her horrific accident. The scene captures a moment of rebirth for the character, and emphasizes the magnificence of her progress. Rust and Bone is a spectacular film, but does have several obstructions keeping it from achieving perfection. Pacing and editing are the main issues restraining this film. Although it only lasts two hours, many scenes seem to drag and several others could have easily been discarded. The film is very heavily layered, which provides an intricate plot line, but also serves to bog the action quite a bit. Audiard's previous feature, A Prophet, also suffered from a convoluted plot, but managed to retain its intensity, as does Rust and Bone.Rust and Bone is emotionally gripping and showcases two remarkable actors at the top of their craft. Ali and Stephanie are two of the most enticing characters to ever form a relationship in a film. The chemistry between Cotillard and Schoenaerts, the rich soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat, and the emotional stamina of these characters make this one fantastic film. This film hits with an aggressive fervor, and pulls no punches. http://flickermotion.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much happens, but it's wonderfully directed and brilliantly acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marion Cotillard plays a killer whale trainer at a sea park who loses her legs to one of the orcas. Her life seems over, and she connects with a lonely immigrant (Matthias Schoenaerts) whom she met a while back at a night club. Schoenaerts has gone through several jobs trying to build a life for him and his five year-old son, but he's kind of a loser and tends to muck things up. The story here is simple, and honestly a tad thin. It feels a lot more substantive than it is because of Audiard's excellent direction and the two lead performances. Cotillard in particular has probably never been better. Honestly, I wish the story had 100% been about her. It's more about Schoenaerts (who came to prominence in last year's Bullhead), and his character is not as likable. He's very interesting, most certainly (and Schoenaerts is nearly as good as Cotillard), but I didn't like the guy much. It's a good movie despite its flaws, and its good aspects bump it up quite a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Character study / slice of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a fan of Marion Cotillard I recommend it, she has remarkable depth. Frankly I wish this were more her story. The actors play their parts well and Jacques Audiard gives a great feeling of isolation and desperation to the film. The film suffers, I think (maybe because it is cobbled together from several short stories) from a lack of narrative and theme. In the beginning of the movie "Alain" seems like a man who would do anything to protect and care for his son, later, he seems not to think much of him at all and comes across as completely self-absorbed and brutish. There's only a vague understanding of why "Stephanie" might be drawn to him. "Rush and Bone" is more of a character study and an exercise in film making without epiphany or closure. It could have gone so many places, sadly it doesn't really go anywhere and as viewer I was ultimately unfulfilled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jacques Audiard's follow-up to the sublime 'A Prophet' is a thoughtful and often bold film, but certainly not a perfect one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts) and his 5 year old son Sam (Armand Verdure) travel from Belgium to the south of France to stay with his sister Anna (Corinne Masiero). With little or no money, Ali plans to start a new life with his son.Ali finds work as a nightclub bouncer, where he comes to the aid of Stephanie (Marion Cotillard) who is involved in a fight, and therein begins a relationship of sorts between 2 very different people. Stephanie trains and performs with orca's at a local sea park, but after a horrific accident seeks comfort in Ali. She barely knows him, but she sees something in his 'operational' approach to life.Theirs is not a relationship as such, both are lost souls who share a mutual unemotional sense of gratification. When we first meet Ali with Sam, he seems the perfect father. But once they move in with his sister and her husband, he immediately disengages, leaving Anna to pick up after him. Ali tends to Stephanie with more affection and tenderness than his own young son, which is often difficult to watch. Ali starts to box again, and gets involved in bare knuckle fighting for the sheer thrill of it. Stephanie accompanies him, fascinated by another side of life not experienced by many and least of all women. Ali's lack of self-consciousness drives Stephanie to overcome her own obstacles, exemplified by a touching scene where Ali encourages Stephanie to swim again.'Rust and Bone' is not an easy film to watch, not least for the gruelling subject matter. You are always questioning Ali and Stephanie's relationship, whether its sexual or platonic. Neither are suited to each other, you couldn't imagine an odder couple, but somehow the director manages to kid you and convince you of their suitability. There is a lack of sympathy from both Ali and Stephanie that connects them to each other. Marion Cotillard yet again shines in a restrained and emotionally complex role, and the pulverising Matthias Schoenaerts is excellent as the uninhibited Ali.Director Jacques Audiard's follow-up to the sublime 'A Prophet' is a thoughtful and often bold film, but certainly not a perfect one. 'Rust and Bone' tries so hard to be unsympathetic and unsentimental that it is hard to connect to the characters, you neither love them or hate them. You accept that Ali and Stephanie are what they are and that tensions will undoubtedly follow, but the manipulative climax negated Audiards brazen intentions that worked so well for most of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just saw this at CIFF, and thought it was fantastic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to expect of this film, having only read the barest of blurbs before I saw it as a part of the Calgary International Film Festival. It caught my notice because it was French language, and it stars Marion Cotillard, who has become one of my favourite French actresses in the last few years. (See in her 'La Môme' as Piaf, and in 'Public Enemies' as Billie Frechette, among other films, if you are not yet acquainted with Ms. Cotillard.) This film did not disappoint. Well, maybe a tad. Everything was great except for the character of Ali. Now, I'm going to get into spoilery detail, so continue at your own risk. Aside from my criticism of Ali's character, I highly recommend going to see this film. It is fantastic.The basic premise is that Ali (Alain) moves with his son to the south, and meets Stephanie, a killer whale trainer who has suffered a tragic accident and lost her lower legs. Stephanie's journey and the progression of her journey is incredibly compelling, and Marion Cotillard plays it subtly; her emotions are portrayed in her body movement and in her face. It's hard to explain, but she is so fully Stephanie, and I was completely entranced. But Ali? I just don't know?.My problem with Ali was that he is so incredibly selfish and that there is really very little progression and growth to his character until the end. He takes his son from Belgium to the south, and essentially leaves the boy with his sister. He spends more time fighting, shagging women, and working nights than he does with his son. He forgets to pick him up from school, and cannot even really be bothered to pay attention to him.He does only very rarely think of others, and though he is kind to Stephanie (Cotillard), he shows little kindness or sensitivity towards others, such as his son and his sister. Even with Stephanie, he is thoughtless (such as when he left her at the club and went home with another woman), and it took her own courage to tell him what the score was for him to start to realize how poorly he'd treated her. It takes his son nearly dying for Ali to wake up, and while I can understand that such an event would be the one to do it, it just seemed a bit contrived.But still, overall it was a good film, and perhaps upon a second viewing I might be just a bit more generous with Ali as a character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I'm just getting cynical but movies like Rust and Bone that tell the story of unexpected love arising from tragic conditions with unexpected characters and happy endings just isn't cutting it anymore.Rust and Bone tells the story of Stephanie, played by Marion Cotillard and Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts) who are both wounded and troubled characters (the former suffering from a physical wound, the latter, from an emotional one) that, for some reason or another, fall in love with each other, through all the adversity and kick-boxing side-plots (oh and the whales.) Tragedies happen in life; they are no laughing matter and certainly warrant respect, examination and understanding. Similarly, stories like the one in Rust and Bone occur too, people do fall in love, people do face adversity, etc. These stories will never get old. But the way in which they are told certainly can and does.Rust and Bone relies on so many clichés to tell its story that it gets hard to truly connect to these characters who seem more like ploys to win awards than real people with a real problem. Cotillard is a great actress who, as always, delivers a great performance to the character she is given. Unfortunately, her character seems to come from the stock of physically-disabled women Hollywood keeps on its sets than from actual experience and trauma. Schoenaerts who plays Ali suffers from a similar problem; although a good actor delivering a performance, if not noteworthy, decent enough, Schoenaerts plays a character whose actions seem influenced by the screenwriter's need to make him as detestable as possible in order for the story to keep going. These clichés and flat characterizations render a film that proves predictable, forced and even boring at times.How many more of these do we need?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sickly Sentimental film for those who don"t see themselves that way!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an insipidly tedious and vacuous film. No doubt given weight and kudos due to the producers previous efforts... Yes, it is gritty, raw, coarse, ribald, brutal, and all the other supposedly illuminating catchphrases applied to films of this ilk (although, most others do have some redeeming qualities)... Yet, it is also excruciatingly clichéd, naive, formulaic, facile and ferociously fanciful. Constantly falling into the lowly laudable realm of idealised, but totally unfeasible perspective of the human condition often succumbed to by parochial practitioners of supposed blunt realism, who subscribe to being in the know, but are not of the know when it comes to the quagmire of human frailties, foibles and fabrications implicit in the worlds of those with fractured lives.From the outset this film is void of any insight. Preferring to present blank faced obstinance, sullen sanctimony, wilful indifference, contrived violence, and gutter imagery to pad out what could only loosely be called a story. Considering the talent at his disposal (the brilliant Marion Cotillard for one,) the producer has forgone any opportunity for character development, depth of emotional exploration, or even a remote semblance of projecting a believable portrayal of the leading protagonists. In its way, although not overtly obvious, this is a silly, sickly sentimental film for those who would feel violently affronted at the suggestion of watching such a thing... a trend which has been going on for some time now, and will no doubt continue to do so!Though totally lacking in scope, the film will surely play into the misguided hands of those who want to believe in the mythological nobility and underlying sensitivity of thugs, which gets reinforced by the vulnerability of a certain kind of woman, who purportedly can see and bring to the fore those noble inner qualities invisible to all others.While typing this review the thought that has constantly been reverberating through my mind is; "Sometimes we need to shoot less film and more producers!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strong performances from the cast and the plot is actually unpredictable enough to keep me watching till the end. I also found it a bit depressing to watch as a movie. The infidelity of the French portrayed in this movie, well is, I would say a pretty accurate portrayal of how they are in real life. It's also quite horrible to watch in a way. I mean the movie glosses over it, like it's an accepted fact so both parties are happy with this. But all I see is that the female character takes so much pain and so much crap from the guy. The relationship is very one sided in that the girl seems to put in more than the guy does... but yes it's also a reminder that if a couple has chemistry and the right opportunities presented by circumstance, then the relationship might work even if the guy is a bit of a jerk. Still the movie's plot is quite unrealistic I think, and lots of sex scenes, which were not terrible but just a note you might want to make sure young children aren't around when you're watching this :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In combat lingo, "rust and bone" refers to the taste and sensation of blood in the mouth from the impact of teeth crushing against the lips. Yet, there is an intoxicating and sensual quality about Jacques Audiard's sixth feature that is unlike most movies dealing with post- trauma recovery. That is the thematic value and central struggle in this film--the conditions required of survival are in constant flux. After life hits you across the face with a hard punch, the ordeal can break you as much as it revives (even empower) you. A free adaptation from two short stories (Rocket Ride &amp; Rust and Bone); this film follows the relationship between a single father and boxing enthusiast, and a killer--whale trainer who suffers an accident leaving both legs amputated.Ali is a brazen and hotheaded man struggling to make ends meet in Southern France. While working as a nightclub bouncer, he has a chance meeting with sultry brooder Stéphanie (played to astute and artful perfection by Marion Cotillard). After breaking up a bar fight involving her and another man, Ali leaves his phone number. The invitation to a risqué encounter was implied in pantomime, but didn't materialize. Months go by before Stéphanie surfaces out the blue and friendship develops--that Ali is the only person with whom she wants to interact is sensible in the context of psychological moribund. His casual directness, unabashed attitude, lack of modesty to embrace any topic and taboo restores her ability to normalize once again. But make no mistake about Rust and Bone being (yet) another sexist drama that reduces either character to classic plot device, it isn't. Without giving away too much, Stéphanie is just as instrumental in causing peripeteia during the film's final act. Rust and Bone explores a wide range of human fragility and potential. The execution is prolific because it captures the protagonists' transformation from downtrodden spirits, to lives soaring in full flight. In the process; Audiard bifurcates from two dimensional narrative, towards a kind of voltaic energy and attitude that is conscious and alive.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Right, Left and OP</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Director Jacques Audiard offers up a much different story than his previous film, the powerful A Prophet. Audiard co-wrote the screenplay with Thomas Bidegain based on a short story from Craig Davidson, and the result is a quasi-love story with very little traditional romance.The two lead performances are simply outstanding. Marion Cotillard plays Steph, a free-spirited Orca trainer at a Sea World type facility, who becomes a double amputee after a freak work site accident. Matthias Schoenaerts (Bullhead) is Ali, an emotionally stunted single dad who has all the qualifications of a big time loser ... though with a glimmer of goodness. Their two lives intersect when Ali is working as a bouncer at a nightclub, and then again after Steph's accident.It's very interesting to see how this story is treated by a French writer/director as opposed to how it might have been handled by a US filmmaker. Audiard allows much quiet simmering by the two lead actors as they both work through their own disabilities - hers physical, his emotional. They both straddle the fine line between human frailty and internal strength, often with the help of the other. It's not difficult to imagine an American take on this story focusing on the Steph's painful rehab and struggle to adjust, while also zeroing in on Ali's physicality as a street brawler and sex machine.Cotillard is a true movie star and Schoenaerts soon will be. It's so rare these days to see two strong talents in such a "little" movie, especially one in which neither character comes close to approaching glamorous - and Ali is not even likable most of the time. This is a well written, well acted character study that points out how a good soul can often save another who might not even care to be saved.Alexandre Desplat provides yet another strong score - this one complimented by many familiar songs. For those who tend to spend there movie time with only American films, this is one that will provide proof of just how different the view can be through the same camera lens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Rust and Bone" is compelling human drama. Marion Cotillard is outstanding as Stephanie a young woman in a perfunctory relationship whose real love in life is performing with killer whales at a local MarineLand. Matthias Schoenaerts exhibits Brandoesque primal instinct as Ali a brooding hulk of a man and an unemployed drifter with a young son. To pick up some cash he works odd jobs and isn't averse to thievery if an opportunity arises. He lives with a sister and her husband and his personal life consists of a series of one-night stands.One night at a nightclub where Ali works as a bouncer a fracas breaks out and fate brings him and Stephanie together when he rescues her from an unruly patron. The two get to know each other a little until tragedy strikes. Jacques Audiard directed from a screenplay he co-wrote with Thomas Bidegain.</fullReview>

His direction is rather dreary. Even the accident that causes Cotillard to lose her legs is so clumsily executed that it's not at all clear what happens. The street fight scenes are gratuitously violent. Cotillard is a fine actress but she's given little to work with here.

		<shortDescription>Two of the Best Performances You're Going to See This Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rust and Bone (2012) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Excellent performances highlight this French film from director Jacques Audiard. Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts) takes his five-year-old son to live with his sister who he hasn't seen in years. As she expects, soon Ali is in and out of the kid's life while he strikes up a strange friendship with a woman (Marion Cotillard) who is trying to get on with life after losing her legs in an accident. Outside the film going on a bit too long and being a little too predictable, RUST AND BONE is certainly a terrific little gem that manages to tell a nice story about two people trying to come together with their personal issues and finding help in one another. The majority of the media attention is going towards Cotillard and for good reason but Schoenaerts deserves a lot of credit as well. The two of them offer up some of the strongest performances of the year and both for different reasons. Cotillard is terrific as the woman dealing with her legs being gone and while there are many scenes of her struggling with this, some of her greatest acting comes from smaller stuff. The most memorable scene happens after she tries having sex for the first time and just watch her face and eyes and you'll see something really special. I'm not going to ruin the scene but Schoenaerts is absolutely terrific during the entire film but especially one at the end. You'll certainly know it when it happens. The supporting cast is also excellent and really help keep the film moving. Director Audiard does a really good job at keeping everything moving at a very good pace and there are a couple truly haunting sequences that her perfectly handles. One involves the accident that puts Cotillard in her situation and another happens towards the end but I certainly won't spoil it for you. The frankness of the film, the characters and their situations is something else that really makes this film stand apart. RUST AND BONE is certainly one of the best movies of the year and contains two excellent performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie that keeps you curious about what makes people tick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really enjoyed this movie. So many of the characters in the movie are very insulated or protected from interacting with others in the world around them. The main character is quite content going through life without much of a conscience and seems blissfully ignorant. He is not without a base level of human decency (very base) but you do sense something in him that is caring, in some of his interactions with his son and the female lead. Yet he remains "normal" as far as his commitment to greater things such as love and family, which for him is very limited. I found the characters of his sister and her husband very interesting as they seem to be an example of a couple doing what they can to be together, modestly, albeit without mass displays of emotion but they do have a commitment and concern as is evidenced by her husbands drawing of a shotgun on Alain when he gets angry with her. No messing around, with his loved one. These two are somewhat of a base or foundation for the movie as they take care of Alain's son and provide for him. His sister Louise is beaten down by life and wears a dour face for nearly the entire film but the hardship she's been through hasn't removed her decency toward her brother, until he goes too far (because he wasn't thinking, as usual).Stephanie has a horrific accident interrupt her life but only after the initial horror do you see her feeling helpless and without hope. Her period of adjustment is long but Alain's attitude seems to be just the right medicine for her without becoming to heavy. Just live. For Alain, when his crisis occurs the period of adjustment is abrupt, desperate and short. Visceral, just like he is. The two main characters manage to gain strength from each other without any overbearing storytelling and you are always curious where it is going to go. Even though the characters are strong and well drawn they are also very fragile at times and you can't be sure what they might decide to to.Strong supporting cast really filled out the movie. Very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A complex friendship/love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So far I've seen only two kinds of films from director Audiard. Excellent (A Profit, Read My Lips), and very good, which covers everything else. This is a complex friendship/love story between a down on his luck, self-involved fighter who is struggling to care for his son, and an injured trainer of Orcas. While it has been derided by some for being a melodramatic film, to me it feels like Audiard doesn't go for the easy emotions past what the basic situation imparts. Indeed there's a subtle, almost delicate sense of remove, of observing, that, for me, keep this from every feeling obvious or manipulative. In fact, it kept me from the kind of deep involvement that would have raised it from very good to excellent. The characters are complex and full of flaws, and the lead performances by Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts are both top notch. The film bitterly divided critics. Most either raved without qualification, or thought it was mediocre at best. I fall in between, but certainly lean towards the positive, and look forward to seeing it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Casey's Movie Mania: RUST AND BONE (2012)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspired by Canadian writer Craig Davidson's short story collection, Jacques Audiard's RUST AND BONE is an absorbing, if overly melodramatic drama about two people who are damaged both physically and emotionally. This French-language drama gained a lot of attention when it was nominated for this year's coveted Palme d'Or (which was subsequently won by Michael Haneke's AMOUR).The movie begins with Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts), who has left Belgium for Antibes on the coast of France and brought along his 5-year-old son Sam (Armand Verdure) as well. He's dead broke and desperately in need for a fresh start after learning his ex has been using him as part of drug-smuggling scheme. He cares about his son a lot, but he's not a very good and particularly responsible father either. He is awfully short-tempered person, and likes to have casual sex with random strangers. He ends up staying at his sister, Anna's (Corinne Masiero) place even though she doesn't like his presence around. Ali used to be a professional kickboxer, in which his physically powerful skill is enough to land him a job as a bouncer at an upscale nightclub.One night at his work, he meets Stephanie (Marion Cotillard) when he has to break up a fight between her and a guy. She ends up with a nosebleed, and Ali is kind enough to drive her home. En route, he finds her sexually attractive and even dare to tell her she's dressed like a whore. After reaching at Stephanie's home, Ali requests for ice to soothe his swollen knuckle. He subsequently leaves her his card in case of emergency when she gets into an argument with her overly jealous boyfriend.The following day, Stephanie goes to work as usual where she trains a group of performing whales at Marineland. It's supposed to be a routine act but somehow she gets unlucky when things goes horribly wrong. Next thing she knows, she awakens in a hospital to discover both of her legs have been amputated. Looking depressed and totally worn out, she slowly adjusts to her new circumstances physically. However she remains emotionally useless until one day, she gives Ali a call. He shows up, and ends up taking her to the beach and willing to help her without much fuss. From there onwards, they become instant friends and slowly becomes on-and-off sexual lovers.Jacques Audiard's direction is quite compelling. His choice of visual and dramatic approach is certainly unconventional, especially the way how he frame his shot in a deliberately fragmented manner. Working with cinematographer Stephane Fontaine, he knows well how to play around with striking contrast between the bright and dark lighting schemes to mesmerizing effect. The screenplay, co-written by Audiard himself alongside with Thomas Bidegain, is appropriately raw and gritty. But it's quite a shame that most of the storytelling method favors over predictable, yet conventional melodrama. It's like as if Audiard is attempting too hard to please both art-house and mainstream viewers, but some of the combined approach doesn't work well together. No doubt the movie tends to be uneven and patchy in places.Luckily the cast is good enough to draw the viewer's attention. Matthias Schoenaerts' blunt performance as the socially irresponsible person fits him well for the role. But Marion Cotillard is a startling revelation. Once again, she's a magnetic presence it's simply hard to ignore her. The scene where she first discovers both of her legs have been amputated is genuinely heartfelt (especially with its frighteningly realistic, yet seamless special effects) and another scene where she and Ali first having sex together. The sex scene may have been unpleasant to look at (she has no legs, go figure) but somehow that scene is poignant without being exploitative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reflexive response while watching this film is an over-stressed anguish-stricken tone which could be elicited from another French-speaking melodrama OUR CHILDREN (2012, 7/10), a thrilling familial calamity engendered by the neglectful repercussions of a mother's puerperal melancholia from director Joachim Lafosse, which has been named as Belgium's entry of the upcoming Oscar season, while RUST AND BONE ruefully missed the quota from France (the 2011 box office monolith THE INTOUCHABLES, 8/10, surprisingly nabbed the opportunity, which is very auspicious to be nominated among the final five). As the masterly Jacques Audiard's follow-up after the awards-sweeping A PROPHET (2009, 9/10), a riveting prison drama about a rookie Arab's staggering ascendancy as the big wheel among the confronting mafias, which heralds the prime period of his career, RUST AND BONE has inherited the narrative's forceful impetus, with staples like altercations, violence (the brutal black market boxing), accidental tragedies and post-trauma syndrome successively strike throughout the main characters' lives and being graphically thrust in front of viewer's retinas, sparking off a quite sophisticated bitterness with certain quantity of compassion. From BULLHEAD (2011, 8/10), a hefty Matthias Schoenaerts proceeds on adroitly with his rough diamond bearing, and utterly radiates his masculinity with his hunky stud physique, seamlessly accomplishes his (rite-of-passage) portrayal of a blood-thirsting but benevolent, playing-the-field but innocent, sometimes irresponsible but ultimately devoting single father with a 5-year-old son; so to speak for the Oscar-winner Marion Cotillard, as the co-lead, a orca-trainer lost her legs during a live-show, thanks to a praiseworthy green screen capture technique and Audiard's deliberate generosity which gives her prolonged lingering close-ups to refract a rehabilitating journey of a despondent heart; Cotillard is almost impeccable in carefully moulding her role's nuanced yet protean traits (please sticking to your mother tongue instead of meddling with American hot stuffs). Although this time, the character is much thinner than her Oscar-snatching one-man show LA VIE EN ROSE (2007, 8/10), Cotillard's chance of a second nomination is quite possible (currently she is my No.4 of the year), but for Mr. Schoenaerts (my No. 2 of the year notwithstanding), his competition will be much more portentous (a lower repute does hurt). By and large, the film is far less intriguing than A PROPHET, there are some palpable (tedious) moments which one may sense the camera really overstays its welcome (e.g. the drama between the brother and sister is awfully cliché), since the script adapted by Craig Davidson's original novel is quite straightforward, it replies too much on the emotional curves of the two leads (in spite of the superb performances) when grappling with their debacles in life to propel the film through its pleasing ending, which is a blunt maneuvre judging by Audiard's talent. But in another way, there are remarkable and mesmerising shots aplenty (a great Steadicam work from DP Stéphane Fontaine), the scenes of Marion and orca re-connecting alone are beyond any ineffable beauty a film could present. Last but not the least Alexandre Desplat's original score has its subtle but competent existence which hones up the film's many theatrical episodes (the ice surface rescue part, to wit).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed Rust &amp; Bone. Not only do we get to see Marion Cotillard's voluminous boobs, we also get a quick flash of her vagina. As for the movie itself, it's good and different. Marion plays an whale trainer at a Sea World in the south of France and meets up with a bouncer at a local nightclub. The bouncer is a bit of a drifter/tough guy who moved to town with his young boy in order to live with his sister. The two are drawn to one another through tragedy and Marion, who was always independent, learns she must rely on someone. I'm really excited for the Robocop remake. I have all faith that it'll be dumb as hell and stupidly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And the Award for Gloomiest Movie of 2012 Goes to.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bummer movie about two wounded people who meet and do good things for one another.Marion Cotillard plays a whale trainer who has to have both legs amputated after a terrible accident; Matthias Schoenaerts plays a former fighter with serious anger issues trying to take care of his little boy. The actors are very good, but the movie is too schematic to be truly effective. Schoenaerts brings out the fighter in Cotillard, while Cotillard tames the beast in Schoenaerts. Get it? The film lays on the gloom and seems to go on forever, which makes a late-act near tragedy, involving a child no less, nearly impossible to stomach. I wasn't depressed by it so much as angered and annoyed.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Rust and Bone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stellar performances by Matthias Schoenaerts and Marion Cotillard makes Rust and Bone a delightful watch, especially since the story by Craig Davidson dwells on the darker parts of people's lives, plagued by the lack of responsibility, or the resignation towards one's fate from an accident. It deals with the despair and hope from the strangest of sources, from strangers who become friends and then more. Perhaps the last act offered a glimmer of hope and reprieve for the leading characters, but to get there, we bear witness to the kind of rut they find themselves stuck in, that the only way to go from there would be up.Rust and Bone is essentially two separate arcs dealing with the issues faced by its two leading characters, before converging them together when they reach out, becoming the crutch in each other's lives, and while this story has been told many times, director Jacques Audiard had two wonderfully crafted characters to work with, and delivered by pitch perfect performances. It's nothing to scoff at in terms of its drama, allowing the characters to grow on you as they overcome various obstacles in their lives. Matthias Schoenaerts plays Alain, a single dad who almost had to beg relatives for a small abode to call home, while he works the odd jobs that included one that would bite him back later on. He's not much of a father as well, perhaps due to circumstances, that his kid is almost always looked after by someone else. Extra income to keep him alive, ironically, comes from beating up, or getting beaten up, in underground fight matches which puts his brawn to good use. But before you condemn him as someone who cannot get his act together, Davidson's story showed a more compassionate side to him, with his stellar and assured assistance rendered toward Stephanie, although it could be argued it came with perks.Stephanie by Marion Cotillard is the larger story here, about a woman who lost both her legs in a killer whale incident that should have been routine since she's one of a few trainers dedicated to the mammals in their Sea World type facility. Stephanie has this extremely beautiful sequence where she stands outside the tank, and communicates with one of them through trained hand-signals, which is probably the sequence that piqued my interest in the film. But it is more than that, where Cotillard's performance wins you over and draws you deep into the plight of someone who has to forever be reliant on others for mobility, at least until prosthetics are ready. The friendship developed with Alain becomes the essence of the story, especially when juggled between one that's platonic, physical, a combination of both, and more.I have to admit though I became somewhat of a voyeur, each time we have Stephanie in the scene, because I would be wondering just how the filmmakers managed to craft scenes that realistically removed Cotillard's legs. I know CG has advanced, but it would be one heck of a job since there were that many in the movie, and I can imagine just how meticulous scene design could be, either to creatively frame it, or physically have Cotillard tuck them in. In honesty I would have loved to like the film a little bit more, but I can't seem to scratch beneath its surface. Sure it's about life, love, friendship and the likes, but oddly something seemed to be missing, that would really hammer some of these emotions in deeply. Powerhouse performances yes, but to touch the heart sincerely to allow empathy with the characters, probably not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Antibes looks lovely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jacques Audiard is 60 now, so it's too late to expect a change in his storytelling habits. You are going to be given a strange love story between a brutish loser who's very hard to like, and a woman who has to put up with his violent ways (and leaves us asking why). Matthias Schoenaerts, a promising Belgian actor I hadn't seen before, is another in a line of men--the others are Mathieu Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and Romain Duris--who solve life's problems with guns or fists.The story is skimpy, not well-developed. There is a sub-plot involving an aerobics trainer (Irina Coito) that is left dangling half way through the picture. With the exception of the marineland scenes, everything looks rushed and clumsy. The fight scenes are brutal enough--that tooth lying on the ground--but are not well shot. Marion Cotillard is obliged to play at least one scene that feels completely out of character, but she plays it with her customary wonderful aplomb. All in all, I have very mixed feelings about this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Implausible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie based on the implausible. Although well-acted by Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts, the story doesn't make much sense. First, why would a marine animal trainer hang out in a raunchy dance club apparently waiting for a pick up? And then be attracted to a thuggish bouncer after he saves her from bar fight? Marine animal trainers are generally well educated, animal loving people who usually stick with their own kind. This is especially true in class-conscious France.Second, the likelihood of an Orca whale not only jamming into a performance float and then apparently biting the legs of a trainer is highly unlikely but not unheard of.Then next question is why would an insensitive slug such as Ali waste his time with legless Stephanie when all he is really interested in is quick scores? Oh, the more intellectual critics would say it's a meeting of two wounded people. Ali, the emotionally wounded and Stephanie the physically wounded. That makes a nice movie rationale but is basically BS. He's a lower class brute who ignores and then abandons his son and she's a middle class professional apparently looking for love in all the wrong places.The movie did show French life in basement of society with Ali working as a security guard, fighting as an amateur boxer. His brother-in law as truck driver, his sister a store cashier living in a seedy apartment on the Riviera. Barely any time is spent exploring the life and world of an marine animal trainer which is where the film should have focused.Kudos, though, to the legless special effects. Well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be sure to watch BLACKFISH first!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What goes around comes around. Life does not always provide poetic justice, which is why screenwriters such as RUST AND BONE's Jacques Audiard (who also directed) and Thomas Bidegain must ladle it in. Americans especially enjoy seeing nature killers such as BONE's Stephanie (Marion Cotillard) get their just desserts, which is why Gary Larson, artist of the Far Side comic strip, got so much mileage out of showing those whitetails turning rifles on hunters in the backwoods (or in the city, for that matter, such as the Gun-Deer lying in wait outside a McDonald's restaurant, saying to his human season shotgun buddy, "I've heard that they hang out here."). It would have been easy for Audiard Et Al to have shown Stephanie slowly sloshing down that slippery slope toward complicity in helping the Sea World conglomerate to commit the closest thing to genocide possible in the zoo world. Instead, early on, it's suddenly "off with her legs," making her an apt human counterpart to the Orcan individuals she'd habitually abused. After watching BLACKFISH and RUST &amp; BONE, why don't you complete your Long John Silver's trilogy with THE COVE? Bon Appetit!</fullReview>

Marion's legs get chomped off by the Orcas she trained herself, lands in a wheelchair and befriends Schoenaerts who plays a rather unlikeable bouncer who does bare knuckle boxing fights with other degenerates for cash money and also he has an annoying kid. Maybe it sounds funny in a certain way but it surely isn't. That being said, it's well acted, Marion really seems to have no legs (in the film) so kudos to the VFX guys and the cinematography is quite good but the film is maybe somewhat overrated.

		<fullReview>Great acting from of course Cotilard but also the supporting actors Corinne Masiero and especially Matthias Schoenaerts. Sometimes uncomfortable to watch. But Schoenaerts gives a great exposition of a person destined to criminality; a man with moderate psychopathic tendencies. He lives his life oblivious of consequences of his actions. So he doesn't take care of his son, he forgets appointments that are important to others, he gets into illegal fights that could permanently disable him and he doesn't see the consequence of his actions on others' feelings. An unlovable character and yet for some reason Cotillard's character finds him attractive. Corinne Masiero gives an impressive performance of a downtrodden woman who no longer looks after herself and does not care about her appearance. She accepts her destiny as a cashier at a supermarket and believes it represents the full extent of her worth.</fullReview>

Before than that there is another very important and hurtful situation in the movie. Wild animals should not be captured and locked in the aquaparks. If the story is very dramatic, the only reason is the whales that are trapped in the aquapark. That's horrible. Making profit from that is even worse... Instead of being against the captured animals, the director of the movie shows the whales in way that they like to stay trapped in bath tub. They are shown as if they can be used a part of rehabilitation of people they have had an accident causing permanent disability.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things happen for a reason. Or do they just happen?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traditional film theory advises this: all things that happen in a movie need to support the overall story, and the overall story bears a theme. To stray from this advise is a choice that needs to be argued. The writer might need a star-vehicle, some locations are just to beautiful not to use or she might think: "All traditional theory is an arbitrary imposition of the white male heterosexual so we will liberate the queer black masses by ignoring it". Any argument is valid.But what if such argument is missing? What if no valid reason to not use the traditional formula is found? Then the movie is likely to end up as a seemingly arbitrary succession of scenes, trying to be a story but hopelessly failing.In this dramatic picture we witness a set of stories that resemble other movies: the handicapped person trying to make peace with her deformation, the single father finding new ways to raise his son and learn responsibility, the low class family trying its best to succeed in life, the illegal fight club where men discharge their fear and loss of power. But none of these stories is connected with a theme or with the other stories. They are just arbitrary "things that happen". As it is a French film, we get lots of sunsets, wind through the trees, scenes in kitchens, and people having sex or going to the toilet. All is beautifully shot, and well acted. Mathias Schoenaerts is brilliant.But there is no logic in the acts of the characters. The acts are borrowed acts: seen in other stories, where they had meaning. Here they are idle shots, loose cannons. The dramatic ending only establishes that: a dramatic ending. We even get the "interesting facts voice-over", tying a symbolic knot. And where do we tie it? In Poland. Why? There is no answer but: just because.And that is the answer from someone who is out of arguments, and has nothing left to say. Was there something to say to begin with? Maybe, but it never made the screen.</fullReview>

Second, I thought the kid will die and the father(Alain) would be so miserable-(but those did not happen at all). Thirdly, the hand of Alain must be broken after that crush.- But how the hell he get the golden belt of boxers with a sprained hand anyway? And this was another unexpected thing. Overall, the movie did not give me what I expected neither the story they followed was interesting! Just guy saves girl from fight take home, girl lost her legs in accident, get back to life in a so close time! by his bed partnership- as he does not care if she has leg or not, then he become successful at boxing while gaining money on gambling on races and Step becomes her gamble dealer and collects money, how happy they are when the belt has come, ... I think this movie as my loss over 2 hours from my life and the money for the ticket. Please do not watch it unless the story above will please you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grotesque and beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my biggest crimes against cinema is that I haven't seen any of Jacques Audiard's work. It's a confession that I am most embarrassed about, with various friends and fellow critics often detailing the mastery of his previous films, such as The Beat My Heart Skipped and the Oscar-nominated A Prophet. Allegedly filled with great machoism and heft, Audiard's latest, Rust and Bone (or De Rouille et d'os, in the native French), sees the auteur change tact, with a majestically acted story of romance through gritted, gnarling teeth.Matthias Schoenaerts stars as Ali, a rugged, neglectful father hitchhiking his way across Belgium to Antibes with his young son Sam (Armane Vendure). Bunking up in his distressed sister's modest home, Ali uses his background training in boxing and Thai martial arts to snap up as a bouncer at a provincial nightclub. On his first night, he meets the perspicacious Stéphanie (Marion Cotillard), an orca trainer at a local, SeaWorld-like tourist attraction. Breaking up a nightclub brawl, the bloody-nosed Stéphanie and the hulking Ali have an energised chemistry from the get-go, which they mutually decide to curtail. Soon after, disaster strikes when Stéphanie is caught in a freak accident at work, causing life-affirming physical and emotional trauma. With no-one else in her life, she calls upon Ali to console her, and together they venture on a journey of self discovery, pain and anguish.Although I described it initially as a "romance picture", Rust and Bone focuses on how people cope with love, without it, and learn to live with humility. Shot in deep-focus by Audiard's regular cinematographer Stéphane Fontaine, we get extreme close-ups of flesh and body-to- body contact. It's a sexualised film, in one way, yet there's often a distinct lack of love on show (we get the first kiss between the pair a whopping 93 minutes in to the movie!). Expressing so little affectation, Rust and Bone hinges on the effervescent chemistry and tension between Cotillard and Schoenaerts, which is so pervasive that it could be juiced, bottled and sold as a potent, French-certified aphrodisiac.Cotillard carries the film with an arresting performance (a favourite for the year, for me). An emotionally and physically demanding role, she embodies an inner strength which topples Schoenaerts' somatic heft. A shoo-in for an Oscar nod, her performance also reflects on the work of a committed make-up and special effects team. Although going into detail on why their work is so effective would tarnish both the narrative shocks and your own personal engagement with the film, suffice to say it's nigh-on perfect.Continuing to embody the same brooding stoicism he did in last year's brilliant cattle gangster drama Bullhead, Schoenaerts is sublime as Ali. A negligent father, polyamorous lover and emotionally vacuumed bare-knuckle street fighter, it's a physically demanding role, which he handles with great, wordless grace. If the film has any narrative issues, it's in Audiard asking for our sympathies for Ali, who spends most of the film being a pretty terrible person, right up until the final act's redemptive conclusion.Following involved scoring in Moonrise Kingdom, The King's Speech, Argo and The Tree of Life, bankable composer-of-the-moment Alexandre Desplat's score carries a brilliantly evocative weight, mixed together with songs from Colin Stetson, Bon Iver, and Katy Perry's "Firework", to surprisingly good effect.Audiard pussyfoots around melodrama territory, but drags the audience back down to the dirt with bloody fight sequences and unflinching sex scenes. Named after the taste one feels after experiencing pain, Rust and Bone is a shrewdly crafted romantic drama, projecting an image of love which is both grotesque and beautiful.Read more reviews at www.366movies.com</fullReview>

She did not disappoint. As she often is she was beyond magnificent. Talk about wounded birds, these two could start their own sanctuary. My only reservation is that Cotillard doesn't need to lose her legs to win Awards, she can do that just by being the great actress she is, witness La Mome where she actually BECAME Edith Piaf.

The character by Marion Cotillard is that of a whale trainer in a marine park. We are introduced to her at a nightclub where she is involved in some fight that leaves her with a bloodied nose. It's never really explained why she goes out clubbing alone while her boyfriend stays at home. It is here she first meets Schoenaerts character.Later a tragedy occurs which changes her live drastically.Once the two main characters meet again and their relationship develops, it becomes very predictable the trajectory their lives will lead.

The story is in fact quite boring and although I'd like to appreciate the effort invested by the actors, I believe the idea, though good, didn't quite work. It's depiction of one soul-searching character and the social difficulties encountered by an other become interconnected to bring a possible closure. But the numerous incidents, apparently meant to be part of a whole are just like leaves on the wind, going everywhere with no direction. I personally didn't really like it and as much of an open mind I always try to keep, this one still failed to surprise me.</fullReview>
