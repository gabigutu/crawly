		<fullReview>(Please excuse my French, it's probably wrong)Roll up, roll up! See the cinematic spectacle of 2001! See the horrible deaths of 2500 or so people commemorated by a film about two guys who fly fast planes really fast. See them go ZOOOOOOOOM, see them go WHIIIIZZZZ! See them reprise the 'flypast and debriefing' scenes from Top Gun. Watch the beautiful love story unfold. See the true love two people have for one another tested and broken when Kate Beckinsale comes between them.See a fine young actor reduced to playing Token Black Guy. Watch as he fights to prove he's more than a Token Black Guy, even though he's given so little to do that he ends up as nothing more than a Token Black Guy (even though, unlike the two guys in the planes, Token Black Guy actually existed).Watch the awful bombing of a military target. Watch the heroic bombing of a city. Watch Jon Voigt recreate Peter Sellars' unforgettable character Dr. Strangelove.Watch the whole reality of war, and the lives and deaths therein trivialised to make a Big Dumb Action Movie that thinks it's some kind of ghastly tribute to the American dead of December the 7th.Or better still... don't!On the other hand, if you want an unrealistic film with ponderously paced romance, fighter planes zooming all over the place and nice explosions, check this out. It's a lot of fun. Just don't take it seriously - you'll only encourage them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historically Inaccurate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ignoring the claims that this movie was so wonderful because Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are "so-o-o-o-o hot," and that the "music was so-o-o-o good," I want to talk about all the historical inaccuracies about this movie. People get the impression that by watching the movie, they will understand not one, but two historical WWII events: Pearl Harbor and Doolittle's Raid. However, this is just not so. While extra care was given for the attack scene (I think WWII veterans would have crucified the producers if this had not been so), the other smaller details give the watcher a false sense of history. For one thing, no Red Cross Army nurses died (as they portray Betty dying). Also, no US soldier would go to Britain to join the Royal Air Force. The US Army Air Force had a unit (the Flying Tigers) in Britain helping out the RAF, but no US soldier would actually leave his unit to join another country's military (regardless of allies). It would mean a total US military discharge AND rejecting US citizenship. Ben Affleck's character could not have done that, especially when he was not a British citizen. Also, Ben and Josh Hartnett's characters were fighter pilots. NOT Bomber pilots. The two are very separate things. Ben and Josh could never switch from being fighter pilots to bombers for Doolittle's Raid. The Army Air Force had pilots for all kinds of missions, and fighter pilots stayed fighter pilots, and bombers stayed bombers. Continuing with Doolittle's raid, it did NOT turn the tide for the Americans. It was not a military victory, and little in Tokyo was affected. It only served as propaganda to help the US citizens on the homefront (also, Doolittle's Raid was long after Pearl Harbor and not a revenge mission). Watch this movie if you're into sappy love stories, but NOT if you want to learn about Pearl Harbor (and/or the Doolittle Raid). Few historical facts can be gleaned from this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great film this could have been! The recreation of the attack on Pearl Harbor is some of the best film-making ever - an extraordinary and moving sequence made utterly believable by state of the art special effects. It ranks up there with the opening sequence from "Saving Private Ryan" and the sinking of the "Titanic" as one of the most harrowing "disaster" sequences filmed in recent years. But like both those other two films, PEARL HARBOR is desperately in need of a decent script to frame the disaster sequence.Okay - I could almost accept the hokey old love triangle romantic plot - certainly the stars are great to look at - but the dialogue really sucked: "I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you". Please! And all those hero shots from the ground, and the slow motion love bits, and the soppy music, and the eternal sunsets...But what this film really needed was an editor! The climax of the film is the attack on Pearl Harbor - an American defeat. But it seems the film-makers decided that the American audience wouldn't be satisfied with this - and so the movie grinds on and on for another hour or so dramatising a revenge attack on Japan. And we're supposed to believe that this attack was fought by the very same guys who were on the ground in Hawaii. I mean we all know that America won the war in the end, so did we really need this long epilogue?Personally I'd cut out all the Roosevelt and the Japanese high command scenes and concentrate on the experiences of the people on the ground at Pearl Harbor. The Japanese stuff was all completely unbelievable anyway. The sad loss would be the superb performance of Jon Voight as Roosevelt - but maybe they could make another film about him. I'd also end the film after the attack at Pearl Harbor, as the survivors pick up the pieces. So why not have a shorter Director's Cut - a novel concept - that makes this film the great film it could have been. If you like I'll lend the scissors!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An utter waste of money, talent and history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is a movie so spectacularly awful that it would be funny if it wasn't so infuriating. There hasn't been a big-budget re-enactment of the Pearl Harbor attack since Tora! Tora! Tora! in 1970, and, due to the utter failure of this movie on every level, it's unlikely it will be attempted again for a long, long time.The writing is ludicrous. It's a series of situations and set pieces strung together without a single regard given to character development or even plausibility. The acting is beneath contempt. Ben Affleck should never have been let anywhere near this film, and in the "love" scenes between himself and Kate Beckinsdale, it appears patently obvious that the actors completely detest each other. The attack scene is filmed and edited like a Saturday morning cartoon. And...excuse me...in real life Pearl Harbor was a DEFEAT. There was none of the stupid garbage with slick fighter jocks dogfighting Japanese Zeros. This film makes it look like a victory! And, excuse me...FDR could not stand up by himself. The scene in the cabinet room where he rises from his chair was simply laughable.This film is beyond bad. It is insulting. It's a 6-year-old's coloring book passed off as history. Aside from that, it's probably the limpest, shoddiest big-budget "epic" produced in the last 10 years. The day it opened in theaters was truly a day of infamy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SpoilersTo borrow and paraphrase from that great orator and writer, Winston Churchill, 'Never in the annals of human endeavor have so many witnessed the butchering of history by so few.'I remember a story on a national morning TV news program that was a major promotion for the debut of this huge waste of celluloid. This interview/promotion took place aboard the aircraft carrier that's on permanent display in New York harbor. The major male stars, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett, along with Producer Jerry Bruckheimer were interviewed by one of the hosts of this TV morning news show. In this interview, all three claimed that they enjoyed talking to veterans and listening to their stories. Well, I don't think they were paying much attention to those vets.Or at least they decided to ignore reality when it interfered with their script!Some historical facts that got in the way of Bruckheimer's blockbuster: It doesn't matter how simple WWII aircraft are compared to today's jets. Ask any pilot and he/she can tell you that you just don't go from flying American P-40 fighters one day, go to England and jump into the cockpit of a British Spitfire fighter and start shooting down HIGHLY EXPERIENCED, COMBAT VETERAN German PILOTS the next! (I don't care that even a blind pig can find the occasional acorn!) Each aircraft's handling qualities, e.g., speed, max altitude, rate of climb, rate of dive, turning, etc., are different. In other words, a pilot has to be TRAINED on that aircraft! To ask us to believe that Affleck's character, who hadn't seen REAL aerial combat prior to England, can shoot down experienced German fighter pilots the VERY FIRST TIME HE STRAPS ON A 'SPIT' is not only LAUGHABLE, it's insulting to the REAL pilots who fought and died in the 'Battle of Britain.'The famous 'Doolittle Raid' took place on April 18, 1942 - a scant 4-1/2 months after the Pearl Harbor attack. Yet, we're supposed to believe that not only can Affleck's character IMMEDIATELY master unfamiliar aircraft (forgetting that a B-25 is a MULTI-ENGINE BOMBER no less for the moment!), apparently so can Josh Hartnett's character. It took EXPERIENCED B-25 bomber crews about that long to train for this extremely hazardous raid on Japan (January 1942 to April 18, 1942). No way in the world could P-40 fighter pilots be chosen to fly B-25 bombers in the 'Doolittle Raid!'What I don't understand is that since Bruckheimer was obviously not interested in historical accuracy, in addition to Affleck's character's superhuman abilities of shooting down EXPERIENCED Germans pilots over England and BATTLE TESTED Japanese pilots over Pearl Harbor, rescuing sailors trapped in half-sunk ships, giving blood, and eventually taking the war to the Japanese in the 'Doolittle Raid,' why didn't Bruckheimer just have Affleck's character pump-out and raise the Arizona and single-handedly save her crew from their watery grave. Thank goodness there are some things even Bruckheimer can't swallow!The special effects and battle scenes were great! Yeah, I know. Bruckheimer wasn't shooting a documentary. BUT, if you want an entertaining, more historically accurate dramatic portrayal of the events of, and leading up to, December 7th, 1941, stick with Tora! Tora! Tora! That movie is based upon the work of a historian considered by many to be the top of his field, Gordon Prange. Although Dr. Prange wrote many books on this topic, I believe his book, "At Dawn We Slept" was the basis of Tora! Tora! Tora! As a MEDAL OF HONOR winner, General Doolittle, and the heroic pilots he led on that raid deserved better than the way they were portrayed in Bruckheimer's schlock film. Despite the romance scenes, and when it was filmed, "30 Seconds Over Tokyo" is a much more accurate depiction of the famous "Doolittle Raid." At least it's more believable! Affleck, Hartnett, and Bruckheimer may have listened to WWII veterans, but they did not hear. They did not learn. Nor did they appreciate the immeasurable costs paid by those members of this country's 'greatest generation.'The only things I recognized as historically accurate about this film were: 1) the US was attacked at Pearl Harbor by Japan on December 7th, 1941; 2) the US Army did fly P-40s; 3) British pilots did do combat with Germans in the skies over England during the 'Battle of Britain;' 4) some British pilots did crash into the Channel; 5) Cuba Gooding's character, a black mess cook, DID shoot down Japanese planes even though he received no gunnery training; and 6) Doolittle did lead a force of 16 US Army B-25 bombers from the carrier USS Hornet against Japan. I can't speak to any accuracies about the nurses, or their quick thinking, e.g., writing with lipstick on the foreheads of the wounded.The only way I'd own a copy of this film is if someone accidentally gave it to me as a gift.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1941 it cost the Empire of Japan 147 thousand dollars to stage the three hour attack on Pearl Harbor.In 2001 Michael Bay spent $132 MILLION dollars to film the event, and ran four minutes longer. Even taking into account 60 years of inflation, the Japanese did a better job with a smaller budget...Due to the ten line minimum submission this may be too short - but sometimes less is more.20th Century Fox already did the Pearl Harbor attack in Tora Tora Tora - and did an excellent job. Michael Bay should have left well enough alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is without a doubt the worst world war 2 film of the past decade! The plot was lackluster and unoriginal, the acting pathetic for the most part, and the history inaccurate.It seems to be more preoccupied with portraying America in the best light than accurately depicting the facts. The love story is out of place and pathetic.At the end of the film is a 5 minute rant about why America is supposedly great; it actually says "after pearl harbour all America knew was victory", obviously the writers had never heard of Vietnam.The only good aspect was the special effects, but they could never make up for this absolutely dire film.My only regret (apart from wasting 2 and a half hours of my life watching the film) is that I can't award zero out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh dear, what a waste of time and money and more importantly, three hours of my life. Titanic with bombs, only take away James Cameron and any sign of talent, story, pacing and throw in historical inaccurancies, clichés and a story that will make you want to throw up from all the cheesy moments.The film is really divided into three parts. The first part, the love story, the two best friends and of course the girl. Then one hour later, develop a love triangle, wow, Hollywood has never seen anything like that before! (sarcasm intended) Also add several less important characters and bit parts that you hope will die in the bombing sequence that you know is coming, unfortunately, only one of them does.Finally, the second hour, the bombing sequence begins. It's good to begin with, its good fun, the only part of the movie thats bearable. The special effects are great along with good fight sequences. Unfortunately, they even managed to spoil that with a ridiculous scene in which the two main characters fly around and save Pearl Harbor by shooting down two pilots.Now you think that with the bombing sequence over, the end of the film is near, you're just about to get your coat and run out of the movies, when all of a sudden, you're subjected to one of the most pointless hours I have ever seen in a movie, in which the survivors, and only the survivors for some reason, fly over to Japan to get revenge. Oh dear. At this point, the movie has completely lost the plot, the acting is horrendous, the editing and direction terrible, and I have lost interest in all the characters. The story has been completely suffocated with the ridiculous sub-plots.Avoid this film at all costs. Three hours of pointless clichés, cheesy scenes, unlikeable characters, historical inaccuracies and the worst direction I have ever seen. This film could have been so more, or less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sappy love story, inaccurate history -- In short, *avoid*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard about this film while it was in production. I heard about how they were going to go out of their way to get all the right aircraft to film so things would look right. I heard how they wanted everything to look as authentic as possible. I heard that the movie would somehow encompass the Battle of Britain, Pearl Harbor, and the Doolittle Raid (??? - an early warning sign). I heard that they were going to stage the premiere on an aircraft carrier moored in Pearl Harbor, for an audience of Second World War veterans. They even managed to get one of the veterans attending the premiere to say complimentary things about the movie. I knew that special effects technology had advanced enormously since 1970, allowing the filming of things that would have been impossible in the previous big-budget movie about Pearl Harbor, Tora Tora Tora.So I thought "Given all this, how bad can it be?".The answer, unfortunately, is AWFUL. This may not be Hollywood at its worst, but it's pretty close.I don't know the origin of the phrase "Titanic with bombs" for describing this film, but it's pretty apt. One difference is that Bay and Bruckheimer together don't add up to James Cameron. Both films feature trite, sappy, predictable love stories (with every chestnut in the Hollywood Cliché guide clearly in evidence) layered over a real-life, tragic event. However, although I don't particularly like Titanic, I have some respect for Cameron's success in reproducing the appearance of the RMS Titanic and the events of the Titanic sinking on screen. I am prepared to watch Titanic (while fast-forwarding over the love story bits) just to see the history parts.Pearl Harbor fails this test. The portion of the film featuring the attack on Pearl Harbor comes off like a video game -- Lots of sound and fury, but no realism whatsoever. The problem here is that this is not only a real event, but an event of pivotal importance in the history of the United States. Worse yet, the event is still within living memory. How will we feel in 2061, when a director decides to make a movie about September 11, 2001, and casually re-arranges the events of that day to make the resulting film "more entertaining/more commercial/more appealing to mass audiences"? Do you feel sick even contemplating that possibility? That's how I suspect that veterans of the actual attack on Pearl Harbor feel about this movie. The late Brigadier General Kenneth Taylor, one of the pilots who did in real life what Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett portray on screen described the film as "a piece of trash...over-sensationalized and distorted."Watch Tora Tora Tora instead. It's not perfect, but it's a pretty accurate telling of what really happened at Pearl Harbor. (Tellingly, Tora, Tora, Tora used veterans like General Taylor as advisers to make sure that they got most of the details right). A newer film with improved special effects is not necessarily a better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic Failure!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK the action sequences are fantastic, the music is wonderful &amp; gripping, the Pearl Harbor attack was intense, it was at many points very emotional and made you a bit teary eyed because you feel for all the brave men &amp; women who died on that faithful day in December 1941. Now lets get down to why this is movie failed miserably: 1.) First off the movie is way too damn long, I mean Jesus I would have to spend have a day to watch it so the makers failed to edit many scenes that didn't need to be in the film.2.) Historical inaccuracies are everywhere. Little and small. I read a list of all the inaccuracies in this movie, I couldn't possibly write all of them down in this review that's how bad this film is. If you'd like to know what these inaccuracies are checkout Wikipedia and search Pearl Harbor (film). Trust me the list of historical inaccuracies are long.3.) Waste of talent: Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Alec Baldwin, and Jennifer Garner are given relatively minor roles in the film.4.) This is what really upset me. The movie is called Pearl Harbor, I thought it would be about the events leading up to that faithful day. in fact it's about a cheesy love triangle, A LOVE TRIANGLE! this entire movie is centered around three stupid &amp; shallow characters surronded by characters just as annoying as they are. The Pearl Harbor attack doesn't come till the middle of the movie. there isn't much attention given to the events that lead to the attack, just these cliché characters. Pearl Harbor just seemed to get in the way. Goddam this is like a cheesy Soap Opera or a World War II version of Titanic. I mean how much more Cliché can we get?5.) The Pearl Harbor Attack was a n intense action packed sequence, but even that was incredibly flawed. First off Why is there a Pee-wee baseball game being played so early in the mourning? second when Hartnett &amp; Affleck get up in the air it seems like they shoot down about 20 planes, in reality the Japanese air losses where bare minimum. third there is too much emphasis on CGI effects. fourth this really made me laugh when a group of about 5 men went up into a tower and shot down an enemy fighter with rifles and automatic rifles ..... right... Damn they must have had good accuracy.6.) Kenneth M. Taylor is a legendary hero of Pearl Harbor. He was one of two pilots who got into fighter planes and began engaging &amp; shooting down Japanese planes. The other pilot was his friend George Welch, Basically Affleck &amp; Hartnett were depicting them. Taylor called this film "A Piece of trash, over-sensationalized &amp; distorted". This was a man who was there and did these heroic feats so you can't discard his opinion. This is proof that this film is a disgrace to our veterans.Overall this movie was a huge disappointment &amp; let down. If you are gonna do a movie based about Pearl Harbor then do it right! seriously! thousand of good men died that day so tragically in one of the most defining moments of American History and you wanna make a movie centered around fake characters and a cheesy love story. Michael Bay whether you realize this or not I think you disgraced a lot of WWII veterans. This film had so much potential and ultimately failed to deliver something spectacular that could have had a major impact in film. My recommendation, watch Tora!Tora!Tora! a far more faithful retelling of the Pearl Harbor attack. Pearl Harbor had a budget, but at least Tora!Tora!Tora! has heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insult to the event</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When previews for this movie began to appear in theatres, I was excited. I mean REALLY excited. Finally, here was a movie that would show what the attack on Pearl Harbor was like, portray the event as it really happened, pay homage to all the men, American and Japanese alike, who died there.Then I started reading the reviews. "Overdone" was a word I came across a lot. And there were the comments from the other girls at school: "Oh it's soooooooooooooooooooo sad! It's just the most beautiful love story and oh my GAWD does Josh Harnett ever look hot!" At this point I started to worry. I even vowed that I would not see the movie. Oh Lord, how I wish I'd stuck to that vow.First of all, this movie should not have been called "Pearl Harbor." It has next to nothing to DO with the battle of Pearl Harbor. Would anyone like to know how much time that battle takes up in this three hour monster? About twenty minutes.Secondly, it shouldn't have been marketed the way it was. The trailers for this movie made it appear that it would be about the battle and the people who fought in it. Nope! God forbid there be anything useful and historically accurate like that. No, what we have here folks is a soap opera. It's kind of like "From Here to Eternity" (great movie) only horrible. Here is our basic plot: Best friends in the air force. One goes off to Europe to fly with the RAF and is supposedly killed, only the audience knows he's not really dead because he got top billing. "Dead" guys buddy has affair with "dead" guy's girlfriend. She gets pregnant. "Dead" guy shows up to announce that he's not really dead. They fight. Oh, and then the Japanese pull a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, but who cares?! Obviously not the writers, director, producer, or anyone who could have stopped this blasted thing from being released.There's so much more I could say, but I do have a word limit here. The one good thing, in my opinion, is the way the Japanese are portrayed here. Not demonized as one thinks they'd be, but shown for what they were: human beings.In closing, I want to say that I have done my homework on Pearl Harbor. I've read the books, I've seen TV specials, and I've interviewed a survivor from the Oklahoma. I can say with all honesty that this movie is a complete insult to the event and all the men who died there, and if this is all that the American public cares to know about something that was so important to our history, we are in deep trouble.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't too concerned about historical accuracies of films which are based on true events, as long as they were kept to a minimum, but this movie changed my mind. Michael Bay completely changed the events of Pearl Harbor. There was just too much historical inaccuracy and fictional characters in the movie. The movie makes no mention of real life heroes George Welch and Kenneth Taylor, the pilots who actually flew over Pearl Harbor. They're instead replaced by two fictional characters.The love triangle is the main focus of the movie, which is completely unnecessary and a waste of time. Kenneth Taylor, who died in November 2006, called this film "a piece of trash . . . over-sensationalized and distorted".The USS Arizona did not jump a few feet into the air when it exploded. There is actual footage of the ship exploding, yet Bay made it more dramatic looking. Another obvious mistake is the A6M Zero, which are all painted green, resembling an army type (navy types were all grey when they attacked Pearl).The Doolitte Raid was surprisingly included in the movie. Although the event is a response to the Pearl Harbor attack, I feel it is merely to give the American audience some relief that at least they get to see some payback. I wonder if Doolittle ever said he would do a 'kamikaze' if his B-25 was hit.Of all the actors/actresses who starred in this movie, only Cuba Gooding Jr. delivered an outstanding performance as Doris Miller did shooting down two Japanese planes with only a machine gun. However, the actor was merely playing a supporting role and his actions in the movie was far different from what he did in reality.The Director's Cut version does not change my opinion of this movie. Until a historically accurate &amp; entertaining remake of Pearl Harbor has finally been formulated, I will remain frustrated and angered at Michael Bay's awful directing.</fullReview>

The fact that they advertised this film as one thing (the attack on pearl harbor) and actually gave us another (love triangle drama before, after, and during pearl harbor).So little time was spent on the actual battle and the memorable instances within it that one wondered if they had even bothered to research it. Heck, they couldn't even bother to take out the modern US navy destroyers still at the harbor during filming (with cgi)!Don't bother with this film, it was horrible. Go rent Tora,Tora,Tora. An excellent and faithful reproduction of BOTH sides of the battle via a joint directorial effort and 2 production teams, melded into one strong movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Pearl Harbor because I heard that there was a 90 minute battle sequence when the Japanese attack the infamous Navy port. What I didn't realize was that there was another 90 minutes of complete BS surrounding that one fight scene. Yes, some moments were spectacular visually, but the rest of the movie was not only bad, but offensively bad. In fact, the way that the entire thing is portrayed is a love story and not even a good love story at that. Right away we know that Affleck gets together with Beckinsdale and then his partner betrays him and has sex with her. So, she's pregnant and their friendship is on the line and they have to decide who'll marry her etc. Oh yeah, and the Japanese attack at some point. Pearl Harbor was a horrific tragedy, but this movie paints it as just another cool fight scene. Cuba Gooding Jr. is completely wasted as this one-dimensional bit part which he overacts anyway. Also, at the end of the movie, when Hartnett gets shot, he's basically being crucified (look at the bits of wood he's attached too). Just another offensive, pretentious factor in this completely ridiculous excuse for a film. And when Hartnett got shot, I actually cheered. A movie is very special when it get's you to root for the Nazis.It's offensive and terrible, don't see it. It's three hours of historical inaccuracy, BS metaphors, sappy messages and terrible acting. Go watch Tora! Tora! Tora! instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains Spoiler!! A matter of weeks before he is due to leave for England having volunteered to fight with the RAF, Capt Rafe McCawley meets and falls for Evelyn Johnson. He leaves very much in love with her but, when he is supposedly killed in action, his best friend (Danny) has to tell Evelyn that he is dead. As they turn to one another for support and healing they gradually fall in love. When Rafe is found alive he returns to America and finds his best friend in love with his girlfriend. This complex love triangle is made even more complex when the Japanese attack Pearl Harbour and draw America into World War II.You can see why they made this film - a major emotional centrepiece, around which a Hollywood love story between beautiful people occurs; sounds like another Titanic right? I do not understand why that film became so very popular and showered with awards, but I do understand why Pearl Harbour did so badly critically (but it sadly still did make several hundred million dollars - something the gloaters tend to forget!). The good thing about the film is the action - it seems to be the only thing that Michael Bay can really do well. You can see where the money was spent and it is pretty exciting. The only reservation I had about it was that Bay cannot help but deliver the action like Bad Boys rather than Saving Private Ryan - in other words the sheer horror of the attack is lost in a sea of glossy special effects, slick camera movements and big bangs, it looks great but it is difficult to really be shocked or moved in the way that the events really should have. Sure, the shots of bodies and the hospitals sort of bring it home but you can't help but feel the majority of the action is rather soulless. Of course, very like Bay, he doesn't know when to end and after the attack he follows the action to America's retaliation - where Rafe `shows 'em what for' - here the action is silly and just far too simplistic for the subject involved.I think it was the other `qualities' the film has that made it such a hated film. The romance that is supposed to engage us with the three main characters is horribly banal and only serves to make the film's first half feel significantly longer than it really is. The romance fails for two big reasons. First of all, there are zero characters; they are plodding cardboard creations with all-American qualities and strong jaw lines. They were never real people to me and I swear this film could have ended with each of them being torn to bloody shreds by Japanese bulldogs and I would have struggled to care less - even the almost constant use of Hans Zimmers' score can't make this emotionally involving. Secondly the script is a woefully inept piece of rubbish that makes the Telebubbies feel like the pinnacle of modern writing. At best the lines just seem clunky and unnatural; at worst they are heavy with cliché and just smack of lazy writing - when I'd heard Afflect shout `get me in a plane NOW' for the third time or Hartnett announce `world war 2 has started' (oh - so it didn't in 1939?) I was already starting to feel my ears bleed. Basically if it is not all clichéd tough talk then it is corny romance dialogue - neither work and only serve to further destroy the foundations of an already weak film.The acting fits perfectly with the standard of characterisation and dialogue and is roundly average despite having a pretty impressive list of names in the cast. Affleck is not a leading man and nothing he has done since Good Will Hunting has convinced me that he can carry a film: like it or not, DiCaprio was part of Titanic's success - Affleck is part of Pearl Harbour's failing. He is nothing more than a rugged face, square jawed hero type American boy - the only silver lining to the film is that at least a good script wasn't wasted on his flat and uninvolving delivery. Hartnett is no better but least is pretty to look at; it's just a shame that that is all he is. Beckinsale is a nonentity who is given nothing to do and therefore does almost nothing. Why (or how) these two men fell for her was never made clear. Gooding Jr is so poorly used that I wondered why the film even bothered to keep him in it. He is poorly fitting to the period (talking in modern ethnic clichés - a further sign of lazy writing) and he exists to give us a vague focus on the ships and also be the first black soldier to get a medal (`but not the last' the film reassuringly confirms). As poorly used as they are, at least it is interesting to see faces like Jennifer Garner, Dan Aykroyd, Adam Baldwin, Sizemore, Voight, Tagawa, Everett, Diehl, Coates and Fichtner. The only shame is that most of them have little to do and that some of them just seem really out of place (Aykroyd and Tagawa in particular).Overall, compared to the mix of spiteful or unfairly adoring reviews that are around, this might seem a balanced one but understand that I really do consider this a waste of film and time. Bay does the action with style but sadly missing the soul that the situation required. The romance is awful and is a major problem since this was supposed to be our foundation and the script shows a complete inability to develop characters or put anything other than clichéd dialogue into their mouths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank you, Michael Bay, for making us laugh about love... again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Hartnett and Ben Affleck star as dashing (as opposed to merely "runny") pilots in love with the same woman, a for the time surprisingly anorexic model type played by Kate Beckinsale. This love triangle gets so convoluted and unbelievable throughout the film that one almost expects Hartnett and Affleck to end up together, or possibly even a sexy soft-core three-way (Beckinsale: "Oh... I just can't decide between the two of you, so I'll have you BOTH!").Equally hilarious is the complete lack of historical accuracy, from the Germans bombing DOWNTOWN London (and where would this be, pray tell?), to the fact that Hawaii is populated by nothing but rich Caucasians, dressing their kids as angels and chasing them down hills in slow motion. Also of course absolutely nobody smokes, despite the fact that this is the frickin' '40s. Not to mention the physically impossible flying scenes during Bays action scenes, apparently an intended homage to Star Wars - or so they would be if Bay's direction didn't immediately disintegrate into a rampageous helter-skelter mess of atrocious takes, clumsy acting, irritatingly gut-wrenching hand-held camera wiggling, and music-video editing.The movie's politically correct portrayal of the Japanese should also not be missed, planning their attack with toy boats in a little pool while lamenting the unfortunate fact that they have to attack the United States. "A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war", Yamamoto says, "but they have given us no choice. Due to some economical reason or other, possibly to do with trade routes or something, we must attack the U.S., even though we really don't want to. In fact, we love America and are really, really sorry for having to attack it. Please accept my most sincere apologies for this heinous act. [*starts sobbing*] Oh, why? WHY must we do this? WHHHHYYYYTY!"FDR: "You see, because I can get out of my wheelchair and walk, our sneak attack on Japan will be successful!"FDR's advisors: "You truly make a persuasive argument, Mr. President!"If this has not convinced you to watch this hilarious comedy, nothing will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasted three hours of my life watching this crap . Sure as hell I won`t be wasting too much time writing a long review .I hated this movie , it`s so full of anachronisms and cliches and I`m so glad everyone else has pointed them out , but the two ones that made me laugh were Josh Hartnett announcing " World War Two has just started " . Hey since the second world war started more than two years before in September 1939 you just know this is from an American ( Read Hollywood ) perspective , not that it was called " World War Two " for a considerable time afterwards , and the scenes where Gooding Jnr bellows " Yo who`s da man ? " Yo right on bro you zap those Jap mofos with your 90s street vocabulary . Most excellent dudeI did like the bit where Ben Affleck screams " Get me into a goddamn plane " because I thought the producers and screenwriter had used up every cliche in the book by that point. Nice to be proved wrong , though I don`t think I`ll be proved wrong when I say Affleck will never win an Oscar for his acting ability .My heart had a nice little holiday when I found out this flopped both commercially and critically . Maybe now the Hollywood system can concentrate on making films with good scripts and little FX before they bankrupt themselves . Though having said that if anyone in Hollywood is thinking of making a blockbuster as ridiculous as this or TITANIC based on 9/11 I`d be quite happy to see Hollywood bankrupted</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A typical Disney/Bruckheimer/Bay action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is a Disney/Bruckheimer/Bay action flick? It is heavy on special effects; includes a dopey love story; lacks historical accuracy and/or scientific reality; and has awful acting (mostly by Ben Affleck), writing, and character development. "Armageddon" is the most obvious example; "Pearl Harbor" is another.The first hour-plus of "Pearl Harbor" is the dopey love triangle. Rafe McCawley (Affleck) goes to "downtown London" (no one says downtown -- it's known as Central London) to serve in the RAF as a fighter pilot. I don't know how, in one night, he was able to train to the point where he can not only fly a completely different aircraft, but shoot down a German bomber. Believing he is killed in action, his best friend Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) comforts--and hooks with--his girlfriend Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale). The two men fight on the night of December 6th, and of course by the time the bombing starts they're best friends again.The attack on Pearl Harbor: The action sequences were well directed and choreographed, but they too were loaded with historical mistakes for the sake of dramatic license. One thing done right was Dory Miller (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), the cook who shot down an enemy plane and was later awarded the Navy Cross. But I doubt the real Dory Miller jumped and hollered when he did it.Then they include a scene or two with the Japanese fleet, which I guess is an attempt to give us both sides of the story, or to give the audience an enemy to hate. But Admiral Yamamoto was portrayed wrongly: he wasn't gung-ho about attacking Pearl Harbor, he lamented the decision.The movie could have ended with Roosevelt's (Jon Voight) address to Congress -- and even *that* had mistakes in it -- but it dragged on for another hour with Dolittle's Raid over Tokyo. James Doolittle is played poorly by anti-war mouthpiece Alec Baldwin, who acts like a cheerleader rather than a military leader. And all of the sudden, Walker and McKawley are bomber pilots?Now, contrast this with 1970's "Tora! Tora! Tora!" which is practically a history lesson disguised as a feature film; or even 1953's "From Here To Eternity," a smartly written and well acted love story set in November of 1941. "Pearl Harbor" tries to be both, but it fails miserably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Risible soap opera (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never before have I rooted for the Japanese in a Second World War flick. Never before have I so loathed the Allied forces.If Pearl Harbor is anything to go by then the American Navy was wholly populated by loud, obnoxious morons who spent their days courting empty-headed bimbos while drinking and whooping like some thief had come along in the night, scooped out their brains and trampled them under foot. The characters here are morons. Conversely, the Japanese come across as smart, resourceful and composed. They feel no need to hoot and holler, and they don't seem to be secretly ogling male bum cakes like the American characters do. They're entirely more likable. Oh, but what about the British? Well, they enjoy fellating beefy, horse-faced Americans ? a British pilot tells Affleck that if the States has more men like him then their enemies should soil themselves. Like I say, the Allied forces in this film are wretched.But I do have to say that even the glorious Japanese forces have their bad moments. In a politically correct effort to 'humanise' them there's one bit where a Japanese officer melodramatically says that a truly brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war. And there's another bit where a Japanese pilot leans out of his plane and apparently warns some children of the impending carnage. It's an incredibly sappy moment. Although I'll change my opinion of said pilot if he was actually taunting the children and saying something like, "I'm going to kill your daddy." Another piece of political correctness is the portrayal of Doris Miller (Cuba Gooding, Jr.). In one scene he even holds his white commanding officer while telling him how gosh darn great he his. But perhaps more insulting is the way he indulges in hooting and hollering as he shoots the Japanese down ? every American character in this film behaves like they're in the audience for some ghastly sitcom. I mean, it's one thing to have a fictional character act idiotically, but it's something else to belittle the efforts of a real person. And really, the character is totally superfluous. Everyone else in the film has some sort of connection to Affleck, Hartnett or Beckinsale, but Gooding exists separately. His inclusion is really just a sad concession to political correctness. His character exists only to prove to stupid right-wing Americans that there were actually black sailors who fought bravely. You know, just in case you're a Grade A moron and thought all the black sailors were hiding below decks eating fried chicken.But far more offensive than the political correctness is the 'romance'. Really, the film is about as romantic as drunken masturbation. There's just not one iota of genuine feeling in the whole movie. And of course the whole thing is completely unbelievable. Oh, some horse-face falls in love, goes to England, is presumed dead, then his girlfriend shacks up with his best friend before horse-face returns, then horse-face's ex-girlfriend finds out she's pregnant with his best friend's child on the day of his resurrection, and then the best friend dies in battle and horse-face and ex-girlfriend shack up again and bring the child up together. Yeah, that sounds plausible.But although the sequence of events is ridiculous, the scenes themselves are far worse. One of the worst is the courtship between Affleck and Beckinsale. She's a nurse, he's a pilot, and she passes him to fly because she thinks he has a cute arse and because he begs her not to take his wings. Then he turns into Inspector Clouseau and smacks his head on things and fires a champagne cork into his face. Somehow this is meant to endear us to him. The only thing I can say in response is that it's a shame it wasn't a gun equine-features accidentally shot himself with.However, I wanted to turn the gun on myself when Affleck goes to England and we have to hear Beckinsale writing her letters. "Every night I look at the sunset and try and draw the last ounce of heat from its long day and send it from my heart to yours." Somewhere Fabio is nodding his head in approval. But there must be about a million sunsets in this film ? Bay has never met a visual cliché he didn't like.And Beckinsale writes her letters while sitting on a beach in a bikini (with a flower behind her ear) as waves crash on the rocks beyond. How old is Michael Bay exactly? It's like its been directed by a 13-year old girl. And just how white are Beckinsale's teeth? They kept on distracting me. Teeth shouldn't be that white. They shouldn't look like someone's painted gloss on them. But I also hated the way that every establishing shot was some sort of swooping crane shot. Is Bay really that short on ideas? Well?yeah, of course he is.But what really makes me laugh is the way that Bay has compared this tripe to a David Lean film. Lean made romantic films that didn't make you want to wretch, romantic films that were written and directed with taste and style, romantic films that were literate and intelligent. Bay's film is none of these things. It's an infantile disasterpiece. It's a film where simpletons have teary intercourse in a parachute hanger; a film where two whooping morons almost single-handedly make the Japanese air force retreat; a film where FDR heroically rises to his feet to show what the American heart is capable of; a film where a dying man says he's cold and then symbolically hands his children over to his best pal; and a film where a bimbo with shockingly white teeth says, "Now I'm going to give Danny my whole heart?but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you." No film has done so much to dishonour the Allied forces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Except for 20 minutes, utter garbage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possibly spoilers (though not much to spoil).Essentially this movie is trying to be both "Titanic" (romance with a historcial event as background) and "Saving Private Ryan" (strarly realistic miltary drama) at the same time. Basic summation of plot: Guy 1 falls in love with this woman. Guy 1 disappears and is presumed dead, so Guy 2 (Guy 1's friend) falls in the love with the woman too. Guy 1 later shows up again, creating an awkward moment. Pearl Harbor happens. The characters involve themselves. Dolittle's raid happens. Guy 1 or Guy 2 dies, leaving the other one to take care of the woman who is pregnant with Guy 1 or Guy 2's child.If you wondering why I only spend one sentence on the event that's the title of the movie, good. I am wondering why the title event takes up only 20 minutes out of the 3 hours of this movie.That 20 minutes, seeing the actual Pearl Harbor attack, is the only redeeming feature of this movie. Special effects and cinemtography realistically and graphically portray the actual attack. See those 20 minutes.As for the rest of the movie...The romance is poorly written, and completely untinteresting. And SLOW. Ben Affleck gives his most wooden perforamnce ever, and for him that's really saying something.As for the historic events leading up to the attack, the historical figures are a tad too prescient, knowing way more than they possibly should (as if they read ahead in the script).A really silly moment is when you see the Japanese attack plans... carved into granite. Not kidding, they actually are, and what looks more like a momument in a park than a military headquarters.After the attack, you hear one of the stupidest lines in the entire movie: "I think World War II just started!" Ridiculous, in that nobody would ever say that in 1941. There is no World War I yet (it was still just called "The Great War") and the term World War II wasn't coined until after 1945 when it ended. It really breaks the illusion of being at the even that the last 20 minutes did such a good job at.You see the charachters get involved in a rediculous unrealistic way (though actions were based on actual historcial events, though they're GREATLY exxagerated here). The movie isn't satisfied with ending at the aftermath of the Pearl Harbor attack, and moved right on to the Doolittle raid (after more boring attention to the romantic plot). Which leads to a predictable end after the raid (one of the 2 dies) in case you still care at this point.Very slow moving, poorly written, boring movie. Except for the excellent 20 minutes of the attack, see that part then return this. Don't recommend you buy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is supposed to be a World War 2 based movie. Its the sort of movie anyone would expect to be an accurate enough dramatisation of events that actually happened.Instead what we get is an attempt to make another Titanic by including a love triangle that is dominant over the whole history aspect. It just doesn't seem right.Being a historic epic, they could have cut down on the whole love story and focused more on what would have been relevant such as the Japanese preparation of the attack and the situation President Roosevelt was finding himself in. The sequence of the actual attack on Pearl Harbour was spectacular! Perhaps if they extended it and made it a more major part of the film it would have been more worthy. Another major flaw with this movie is that after the attack sequence the movie dragged on for another hour trying to give an epilogue which was totally irrelevant.I reckon if these were taken aboard, then Pearl Harbor would have been a much better movie and perhaps would not have flopped at the box office.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most war films delight in playing the victim card. Typically you're coerced into siding with a small group of beleaguered common folk who are forced by an unjust History into a position in which they must valiantly fight back against overwhelming and superior odds. In each case victimhood is conjured up and used as a ploy to justify victimisation. Godard called this Hollywood's "stage wagon" mentality, referring to old westerns which typically pitted outnumbered gangs of cowboys against hordes of Indians.Michael Bay's "Pearl Harbour" spends its first hour on a corny love triangle. Its second hour is essentially an extended action sequence in which the Japanese Navy decimates Pearl Harbour and interrupts the gooey domestic normalcy of the first hour. Its third hour, of course, is an extended action sequence in which Americans bomb the hell out of Japan. It's WWII as "Rocky III"; a poor, innocent, out-of-shape America has to get its butt kicked before it gets "the eye of the tiger" back. A big-budget cartoon - Spielberg and Cameron are the chief influences - the film bolsters all the usual WW2 myths. That Axis imperialism was a reaction to Allied imperialism is ignored. That much money was coming to Germany from "isolationist" countries is similarly omitted. As is the fact that wealthy factions in the US and UK supported Hitler up until 1938, as he was merrily crushing unions, anti-capitalists and communists. That many "allies" supported Hitler's taking "back" of Rhineland, Saarland, Austria, Czechoslovakia, West Prussia and Danzig is also whitewashed. Nevermind the fact that German's later expansions were formally no different to other Empires at the time. Indeed, as the US genocidally spread like a virus throughout the Caribbean, Philippines and Latin America, an equally psychotic Great Britain was ravaging India, the Middle East and Africa. Hitler himself justified his actions by likening Germany's land-grabs to Britain's slave trade. Hitler's allegiances to economist Gottfried Feder, and his defaulting on loans to outside banking cartels, proved even more irksome for the status quo. Cue Western blockades, some implemented as early as 1933. Meanwhile the US was busy sucking up to buddies China and Russia, the former carved up by the UK, US and France, who kept it locked in exploitative trade deals which explicitly excluded Japan. Japan ? a once isolationist country forcibly opened up by US gunboats in the 1850s for "market reforms", thereby setting it upon a path of Imperialism - thus moved into Manchuria, where it replaced dynastic dictators whom the Chinese themselves hated. Russia, China and the US freaked out. Wanting to expand into South East Asia and the Philippines, and wanting to protect Chinese assets and cosy up to Russia, the US began covertly and overtly attacking Japan. They put in place a series of embargoes, oil blockades, asset freezes and banking lock-downs, slowly strangling the country. Spooked, Japan began to back down. It offered to apply in China the principle of non-discriminatory trade relations on the condition that the Americans did the same in their own "acquired" territories in Latin America. The US told them to shut the hell up. The common view is that America then suffered an unprovoked attack at Pearl Harbour, but few officials believed this at the time. "America forced the attack on Pearl Harbor. It is a travesty on history to say that America-was forced into war," Captain Oliver Lyttelton would say. And Captain Russell Grenfell: "It is beyond doubt that Roosevelt wanted to get his country into the war, but for political reasons was most anxious to insure that the first act of hostility came from the other side; for which reason he caused increasing pressure to be put on the Japanese, to a point that no self-respecting nation could endure without resort to arms." Later the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal would come to the conclusion that the US provoked the war with Japan. With the US and Japan now at war, Hitler declared war on the US. The US never intended to enter the European theatre outright, but Hitler was gambling that by declaring war, Japan would come to his aid and attack Russia with their Northern Forces. Japan didn't. They left Hitler hanging. So the US is dragged into Europe, Russia crushes Germany, China pushes Japan back and the US inadvertently comes out on top, holding this position for roughly a century. So essentially you have one huge, childish scuffle over colonies, minerals and cash. Germany and Japan didn't have colonies and wanted some, the US, England and France had many and wanted to keep them. No sooner was the war over, did the West turn their backs on once-allies China and Russia. The conquered Japan and Germany were themselves brought into the economic circles of the West and quickly turned against the sequestered Russians and Chinese.Forget good/bad binaries. Everyone was the "bad guy", everyone fought for old fashioned bounty, on all sides it was the poor who suffered at the expense of the rich, it was the big nations who indebted and bullied the small into violence, nobody had a clue what was going on, everyone read the future outcomes of their own actions incorrectly (the US expected to have big post war economic interests/assets in China; China shut them off) and every action sprung a myriad of unforeseen reactions. Some lessons learnt: disrespecting the wants/needs of other nations (gains) leads to violent blow-back (losses), egos and pride bulldoze all attempts at cooperation/conversation, what we mistake as progress is but the accumulation of time, death and thought (progress is itself always loss, comes at a price), and the best way to topple a dictator is to either do nothing or to act wholly altruistically. WW2 is generally portrayed an an anomaly of a war, different to say, Vietnam and Iraq, but was largely the same thing.2/10 - Worth no viewings.</fullReview>

This is a typical example of film makers at the verge of career ending taking the money from a more than wealthy and generous as well as stupid and uninspired producer and not caring of public opinion or respect of history events. Titanic was better than this and I believe that one has plenty of "worst film ever in cinema's history" awards on its shelf. If Affleck had a chance at acting by taking Damon with him at all times, he definitely proves that he made a mistake in going solo and he never really recovered from this picture either.

		<shortDescription>Bad history, bad movie-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a big-budget "epic" like this one, where to begin? First is the excruciatingly long running-time; I was starting to squirm in my seat before the attack on Pearl Harbor even commenced. Next is a ridiculous (and ultimately VERY tedious) love-triangle; I guess the producers thought the only way they could sell "history" to the public was to wrap it around a romance story. Unfortunately for them, the boring romance angle only serves to turn-off action-movie buffs! But the biggest objection to this film was what it tries to pass-off as history. The same pilot, Ben Affleck, is involved in THREE of the biggest events of WWII -- the Battle of Britian, the Pearl Harbor Raid, and the Doolittle Raid? What's the odds on that happening? 25 million to one??? And SINCE WHEN were hot-shot fighter pilots recruited by Jimmy Doolittle to pilot large B-25 bombers off the pitching deck of an aircraft carrier? Was there anything in the plot that even hinted that Ben and buddy Josh had ever been NEAR a bomber before? As any old combat pilot will tell you, a bomber pilot was one breed, and a fighter pilot a whole other breed. (Also, who thought of casting spoiled little brat Alec Baldwin, of all people, as Colonel Jimmy Doolittle? A laughable decision; I'll stick with Spencer Tracy in "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"!) As for the Pearl Harbor raid itself, a few good computer-generated shots of the battleship Oklahoma capsizing do not make up for truly comic-book scenes of our heroes dogfighting Japanese planes. First we're treated to Ben, Josh and their crews shooting down enemy planes from the ground. Next we see Ben &amp; Josh in the air and working with their ground crews over the radio to lead the Japanese into veritable shooting galleries of bullets. I'll bet real 1941-era pilots would of loved to have had the kind of air-ground coordination this movie shows. Next we see our heroic pair dodging in-between hangers, about 10 feet off the ground! Then they wander out over battleship row and fight among the ship's masts. But the biggest "groaner" is when they "play chicken" and lead four Japanese planes to crash with one another! This is truly Hollywood at it's worst. (Oh, and corny dialog like Josh saying over the phone as the first bombs drop, "I think World War Two just started!" Another groaner). Not only does our dynamic duo almost completely foil the whole Japanese attack with their magnificent flying, but upon landing they show up at girlfriend Kate's hospital to donate blood. As as if that weren't enough, then they volunteer to go out to battleship row and help rescue sailors trapped in the upturned Oklahoma! Whew! Instead of getting a medal, these two should have been nominated for sainthood. Finally at the end of the picture, when they crash-land in China after the Doolittle Raid, our brave boys single-handedly destroy a whole Japanese platoon. (But, alas, Josh is mortally wounded in the process... sniff sniff.) Oh well, that neatly wraps up the love-triangle! I remember the howls of anger from veterans when this travesty of a movie came out -- once I saw it I couldn't blame them. Stick with 1970's "Tora Tora Tora" if you want a realistic depiction of that momentous event.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My turn to bomb "Pearl Harbor" with a bad review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is in league with Titanic. It is a story of a tragedy, turned into a sappy love story, which seems to be a trend in Hollywood. First of all, this movie is historically incorrect in so many ways, that I'm not even going to use up my energy listing the inaccuracies. Then again, when is Hollywood ever historically accurate? The love story itself is totally unbelievable and stupid. Affleck gets shot down, survives, and his friend falls in love with his girlfriend. What a slut! What a stupid story! You got your typical hot-shot American pilots flying around like a bunch of idiots, the sappy love story, the "USA wins the day" at the end, even though Pearl Harbor was far from a victory, the Japanese attacking and killing everybody they see, making the Japanese look like complete evil heartless bastards, etc.Why does Hollywood think that taking a tragedy and turning it into a love story is a good idea? What's next? The Hindenburg? TWA flight 800? The Lusitania? The WTC? Come on! Are people really running out of ideas this much? I'm being very lenient giving this movie 2 stars. The only reason I'm doing that is because I have seen worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shame on the director and writer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can you turn such a powerful moment in American history into a trite love triangle?!! I've been privileged to know and read about so many amazing stories that occurred to sailors, soldiers (on both sides) and civilians alike that defy description. Another film that any decent writer would have a field day with. There is so much grist for the mill you wouldn't be able to include it all. While the earlier movie version of Pearl Harbor, "Tora, Tora, Tora" is done in a documentary style it stays true to the myriad real-life characters and is so well acted by a rich cast of veteran actors. Mr.'s Bay and Wallace could take a lesson from earlier movies like "Tora,Tora, Tora and the classic "30 Seconds Over Tokyo". The latter does have a corny love-story at it's heart but is also a terrific drama and action adventure too that is respectful of the amazing couraqge of those heroes involved. And as far as that central love triangle of "30 Seconds...", we do have to remember the time period it was done in. What might seem dated now was quite meaningful then to the thousands of men that went off to war and the women who were left behind to keep the nation's economy going and support the country and the troops. The love story as depicted in "Pearl Harbor" has none of the vital intensity of the earlier film and the love triangle is just unnecessary.Interesting is the fact that despite the main sell of the film which was it's amazing special-effects; this even suffers in comparison to one key scene in ""30 Seconds...". Compare the scenes in both movies where the first pilot successfully takes off under the required distance needed to safely get off the eventual aircraft carrier. The 1942 version looks real while in the Michael Bay film we see the pilots cheering as the plane passes over the line and doesn't even leave the ground in the shot!Cuba Gooding gives the best performance of the film portraying real-life hero, Doris Miller. The inclusion of Miller as a supporting character was the best idea that the screenwriter had and Gooding as usual, turns in an excellent performance. Other good performances in the film are; Tom Sizemore reprising his excellent Private Ryan performance as a tough soldier and Jon Voight's game effort as Pres. Roosevelt. Shameful in the film is the treatment and portrayal of the Japanese who are treated as caricatures. The wonderful Mako is wasted in his portrayal Admiral Yamamoto. His famous "..waking a sleeping giant." line is done as a throw-away. Yamamoto was such an extra-ordinary person that even the American pilot who shot him down and killed him during the war later came to revere him for his intelligence, honor and vision. There is even the element of the mystical about Yamamoto. He was reported to have had a premonition about his death and on the day he made his ill-fated plane trip, he purposely put on the dress uniform one would wear for a funeral.Ben Afleck and Kate Beckinsale are weak as the main characters. Josh Hartnett, a good actor, just seems whiny. In the face of all that's going on-- you feel like, who cares about these three! What a shame, a waste of money. One more film where special effects are relied upon to carry the film. Just imagine if 1/10 of the effort that was put into the special effects was put into the story itself. It would have been a more worthy memorial to our fallen and living heroes of Pearl Harbor. as "Saving Private Ryan" was to the fallen and living heroes of D-Day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Bay hit an all-time low here, honestly. Usually I can let go a lot of his ridiculous and overdone humor and action sequences due to the fact the stories he tell are of course fictional and hold no real relevance to mankind other than entertainment. But this, especially in the light of the much more realistic"Tora! Tora! Tora!", had already been released, is just plain offensive. Bay delivers a story that is just overloaded with plot holes and historical inaccuracies. It literally feels like a slap to the face; as if Bay was really in such a rush to honor the victims of Pearl Harbor that the studio and crew didn't even check if the damn screenplay for the many errors within it all.Not to mention the love story is poorly executed and overly drawn out. Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character was the only historically relevant in the whole film, and yet his role is more of an after thought. Then he treats us to his usual explosion filled action sequences, which were hardly the point of any war film ever made, so to make special effects the focal point of a war movie instead of the characters and atmosphere was just plain stupid. "Platoon" had a budget I hear of only around $8 million, so how exactly did a movie with more than triple that fail so badly?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Appalling.Four minutes into the movie, Michael Bay starts with the cheesy lines and overblown melodrama. What is with this guy and his cheesy overblown melodramatic romances? He's making George Lucas look like Shakespeare and James Cameron look like Michael Curtiz. This movie is an abomination. Michael Bay is romanticizing what's happening on Pearl Harbor, using and manipulating this dreadful events for his own advantage to sell tickets. He throws in cliché after cliché and never once tries to tell a story. And he rips off greater directors and their films rather than trying to make his own. For instance, is it just me, or does the dogfight earlier seem vaguely familiar? He's ripping right off Star Wars! I'm not talking borrowing tiny elements or being vaguely familiar, I'm talking ripping right from the movie, almost shot for shot! And even using the same lines! Halfway through this movie, I had to ask myself one question: is Bay really using the tragedy at Pearl Harbor as a tool for this romance? I'm assuming he was trying to show how this tragedy affected real people, but this movie is way more about the romance than it is about the bombings! I feel like he *wants* to put the human element in, but he's not! He's completely removing it by giving us so much horrible melodrama. There is just this constant bombardment of melodramatic nonsense! Would it be so much to ask for him to at least stick to one story by the way? Half the time he's giving us this beyond-cheesy romance, but then he'll randomly cut to the Japanese military and US intelligence. Stick to one story! It kind of depletes the purpose of having us fear for the attacks if he's going to show us when and exactly how the Japanese are going to strike. He does not know how to balance the war aspect of this movie with the romance aspect. He either needs to stick to one or the other and not try to do both! And he rips off so many great movies it is pathetic. Bay very blatantly tries to rip off James Cameron's Titanic, Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, and George Lucas's Star Wars. Unfortunately, he has none of Cameron's eye for visuals, Spielberg's finesse with emotion and camera-work, or Lucas's talent for characters and action. And here is something else I noticed while I'm stuck on the director himself: he does not give the audience a sense of what it was like to be on board any of the ships before bombing them. So, we don't really feel an emotional connection to the ships or anyone on-board. By the way, Mr. Bay, could you please stop moving the camera? I feel like the movie is drifting away from me!! Now then, as I said before, I don't feel like director Bay or screenwriter Randall Wallace did their military research before starting filming. Did pilots ever play chicken with the enemy? I highly doubt that. And I really hated the way he made the pilots seem stupid, not knowing their right from their left. It is very obvious to me that he did none of the proper research for this movie.Pearl Harbor has one of the worst and most awfully clichéd scripts I've ever heard in my life. These lines that the actors have to say are just plain god awful, no other way around it. I seriously think Bay was trying to squeeze as many clichés as possible into the first half hour. In the first half hour of the movie, I counted no fewer than twenty clichés. I mean, this screenplay was just embarrassingly bad. There's no other way to say it. He should be ashamed of this screenplay.As for the actors in this film, I hated them all. I didn't enjoy watching them on screen, they were stupid characters, and none of them carried any kind of emotional authenticity with them. They were all as shallow and selfish and pitiful as any character I've ever seen on screen. We're given no other reason to care about any of them other than that they are in love with each other.And why does this movie hate women so much? I have never seen a movie that hated women as much as this movie does. All the women in this movie want are men. They joined the military to meet men. And every time we see a woman she's talking about men. Are these women really that shallow? All they ever talk about is sex and men! And then in the operating room, they're all just incompetent and panicky. Why does Bay hate women so much?? Now, I am going to give this movie a point for some pretty decent art direction and visual effects. Doesn't have anything on Saving Private Ryan, though. And I really wish this movie had paid as much attention to its dialogue, story, characters, historical accuracies, and general logic as it does to its effects and art direction. In fact, everything else about this movie is so bad that by the time we get to those scenes, I don't even care about them. And Bay doesn't really give us a whole lot of time to look at them. He's just running everything around too haphazardly.Also, the visuals are pretty good, but I don't feel like I'm a part of this war like I did with other war films.Bay epically fails with his monstrosity of a motion picture Pearl Harbor. This is among the worst films I've ever seen. Even its good portions-like its music and art direction-are dragged under by the weight of the horrible direction and writing. What the audience is left with is a movie whose good parts are still degenerating factors because they were used merely to try to distract the audience from all its other short-comings.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tora Tora Tora this is not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*****SPOILERS MAY BE INCLUDED********OK, first off I was really hyped up about this movie. However, after seeing it several times, I find myself going back to Tora Tora Tora. The sheer number of errors in this movie are appalling, considering how much was spent on it. Let me name a few.1. OK, Cuba Gooding Jr., playing the role of Dorie Miller on the USS West Virginia (BB-48) runs and grabs a twin .50 cal aircooled MG mount and opens fire. Already all this is wrong. When he fires it, as you look at different scenes, in 1 scene it has 2 closed ammo boxes, then 1 closed 1 open, and then only 1 closed, yet no one is around him and he is firing all the time. Secondly, on US prewar battleships, only single .50 cal WATERCOOLED MGs are used, and thirdly if you look in the background, you see a USN Frigate. Outboard of the West Virginia was the battleship Oklahoma, and on the other side Ford Island. No Frigates anywhere.2. In the movie, when an A6M2 Zero gets shot down, it crashes into a battleships boat crane, and bends it. In all photos after Pearl, all the cranes on all the BBs are still straight, with the possible exception of the Arizona.3. We see a tripod mast from an inboard battleship collapse, and fall on an outboard battleship. Only 4 battleships had tripod masts at Pearl Harbor, and none fell on another ship. Oklahomas broke off when she rolled over, Nevada and Pennsylvanias were undamaged, and Arizona's foremast slumped forward.4. The battleship Missouri sits in for the West Virginia during Goodings fight scene. The Missouri's triple 16"/50 turret can be seen. The West Virginia had twin 16"/45s.5. When the Oklahoma capsizes, it raises out of the water, with the only the deck to the fortop in the water before it sinks.6. Ben Affleck are flying P-40N Trainers in closeups, and in exterior views are flying P-40Es. P-40Bs (2 cowling guns, 4 wing guns, not 6 wing guns) were at Pearl.7. When Josh Hartnett is dogfighting Zekes, he is pulling hard on the stick, firing, and swinging everywhich way. IF he did that in real life, he would 1) Be out of ammo in 9 seconds (only 1,200 rounds total, at 700 rounds per gun), 2) couldn't hit squat, and 3) stall his plan and throw it into a spin.8. When the B-25s take off of the Hornet, In one shot the flight deck is of a 3D modeled Essex (that's not a Yorktown style flight deck), then in another we clearly see the split flight deck of a Nimitz class CVN9. When we see the "Japanese" carrier force (Kido Butai) heading towards Pearl, you can clearly see 2 Nimitz Class CVNs, Arleigh Burke class DDGs, and a surfaced Los Angeles Flight 1 SSN.These are the 9 most glaring errors to me, and the ones I think I can fit in this comment. If you want a good Pearl Harbor movie that is factual, real, doesn't look like a video game, and isn't riddled with errors, go see Tora Tora Tora.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most manipulative movies I've seen in a real long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor comes from that brought you Armageddon (which after further review is actually for me a lot lesser than what I once thought it was and shows what Fellini and Bergman can do to an under-developed mind) of Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer. And like that movie, they make the audience cry and automatically feel patriotism at no extra charge. That is not fair in many respects, especially during Memorial day weekend. For all those who think Spielberg and his company make manipulative films (which is arguable), you should take a gander at this piece of work.Harbor here takes a Titanic type of approach (bad idea) as for nearly an hour and a half before a torpedo is dropped a tree sap filled love story submerges with 2 people falling in love (Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale who deserve better than this) and then when the pilot Affleck supposedly dies (no one feels pity as thanks to the unimaginative innovation known as the trailer we know he's fighting at the big battle), she falls in love with his best friend, played in one of the lesser roles of the year by Josh Hartnett. But of course, this is all before (and sadly also partially after) the big attack by the Japanese on the Hawaiian base.Credit should be given where it's due and that's why this film isn't a complete failure- the battle and action sequences are excellently put together with visual effects helping a lot and chaos giving good tension to the film. BUT, the droning other story of the bad love triangle is so distracting it might just be worth waiting for video (or DVD might be appropriate) and just singling out the fine bombing. One of the lesser blockbusters ever made, and now along side it's co-companion Armageddon (but at least the Rock is still intact).Two little notes though: 1) this is to point out a pretty obvious flaw and goof. Was it just me, or did it seem weird that several months after Beckinsale's character reveals she's pregnant that she's as thin as she was earlier in the movie? I would think that Bay could've at least taken a couple of bucks from the 140 mill budget and supplied some stuffing or something. 2) Randall Wallace who wrote the outstanding Braveheart and good Man in the Iron Mask proves that even though a blockbuster doesn't need 10 writers, one can still botch things up. Oh well, at least Shrek is still around. C-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd give this comic book level history lesson a "zero"{ not the plane} if I could. This film was obviously made for an audience that has no conception on what "Pearl" was all about, and will probably never know the real facts due to the politically correct blame America first attitude in contemporary left-wing dominated Hollywood.Basically it's a love story set against the events. None of the actors show a real sense or clue on what lifestyle was all about at that time.They seem way, way too modern. Their characters have contemporery feel that is totally out of place for the era.Not really too much you can say about them, except that they are very shallow and very, very boring.. Then there are the events themself, which almost seem like an afterthought. The planes fly in, bomb their targets and escape while we are caught with our pants down. The much ballyhooed air raid sequence looks more like a video gamoe or a sequence from "Star Wars" with all the CGI effects looking exactly like what they are. And how 'bout the part where FDR miraculously rises out of his wheelchair on his own? I'm surprised there wasn't a haleullah chorus and "praise the Lord" after that!There are so many anachronisms in this film that you can drive the proverbial Mack truck through them. Especially offesive are the US navy ships that were not launched until at least 30 years after the facts! Since the producers went CGI with it, why couldn't they do it right? I can go on and on ,but you get the picture. If you want the real facts, see "Tora! Tora! Tora!", There may be a few errrors there, but at least they got it right. This movie is so rotten, it's only good for laughs!Zero stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...struggles to put up a valid argument for this movie.OK! Lets not beat around the bush, it's historically suspicious, badly written, badly cast and clearly an hour too long. A splendid "support cast" are wasted as Michael Bay and his production team think they can produce some sort of Titanic of the Skies like epic and fail in their objective. By the time of the brilliantly constructed assault by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor, and "it is" exhilarating and edge of the seat heart pounding, you are left with the feeling that all the main characters in the piece are not really worth our emotional investment.It's not an outright stinker, situations such as the nurses trying to cope in the hospital during the attack are poignant, and there's a jingoistic - cum - romantic fervour that screams out that the film wants to be genuine in making you feel...well...emotionally battered. However, given the budget and time you are asked to invest in the story, it's impossible not to feel cheated as the clock ticks past the three hour mark.Perhaps it's unfair to use Titanic as a template for this type of epic? Especially since over the course of time many have come out of the woodwork to knock Titanic when previously there were nods in appreciation...although grudgingly. But Pearl Harbor doesn't have enough about it to make it a "time waster" recommendation. This even allowing for some quality Bayhem action as the film rolls into its third quarter. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My suggestion: don't bother with this one. While it is beautifully shot, with some good acting (most notably Jon Voight as FDR), it is way too "Hollywood," and too long. I don't understand why the makers would feel anything more than the attack on Pearl Harbor wouldn't be spectacular enough to cover in a film. Why go to the Dolittle raid too? Revenge, I suppose. Get back at those Japs! But we all know what happened with Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and that was way more of a spectacular revenge - - and decisive to the outcome of the war as well as consequential to mankind -- than Dolittle was. Also, what is with the 3 hour running time? I've always felt if a movie needs to run 3 hours, it had better have something good to say. This script just didn't have enough gas to propel its 3 hour span, even with the love story intertwined.Also, for me, a lot of the fighter scenes looked too "Star War-ish" with the CGs, although using real restored fighters exclusively is understandably cost-prohibitive for even a large-budget Hollywood flick.If you want to see a good Pearl Harbor film, check out "Tora Tora Tora." While not as "pretty" as the 2001 version, the 1970 film has way more substance and authenticity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In all honesty, I am sure that this film might have been better on the big screen. But I was greatly disappointed in the special effects of that actual attack. I also felt the film was poorly edited with people and brief scenes that meant nothing to the total film tossed in as filler. A movie this long did not need filler.I also wonder why Hollywood has this need to take tragic events and turn them into love stories. If it we my decisions, war movies would focus on the war. Yes, there can be love and compassion, but a movie about Pearl Harbor should spend more time on the events, tragedies and heroism of Pearl Harbor, not about a love triangle. "Saving Private Ryan" is an outstanding example of showing the emotions of war and evoking feelings whilst telling a war story.Or, make the movie about a love triangle and find some minor battle to get in the way of the friendships without being the main event. Then you have time to develop a relationship between the characters and allow the audience to feel something with them and for them.This movie was ala "Titanic", in the attempt to mix love and tragedy, but "Titanic" was even better able to succeed at mixing the two than "Pearl".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found Pearl Harbor impossible to watch all the way through. I read a review of it which suggested that in terms of plot, it could have easily been a soap opera called "The Pearl of the Harbor" and I have to agree. Plus, I felt as if someone simply forgot that even megabucks productions need a little editing. Or in this case, a lot. It would have been much more tolerable at 100 minutes.Editing or not, the script was the biggest weakness. No depth, no real character development, no decent dialog for much of the time, and no fun moments at all! Come on, even the Big Boat movie had some fun lines! Few, but still... Of course, I should have realized what I was in for considering Randall Wallace also wrote the ridiculously overrated Braveheart, which was an even bigger waste of time than PH. (Though high in terms of unintentional comedy, something Pearl does not have going for it.)All actors - including those who can't act - are sadly wasted, ranging from Hartnett who's been better in every movie I've ever seen him in, to Affleck who's usually more entertaining, the underused Cuba Gooding Jr. (where have you gone, Rod Tidwell?) and on to the rest of them. Well, not everyone, actually, Alec Baldwin had an okay part, much better than what I've been seeing him in lately.Rent something else. Watch something else. 4.5 out of 10, and all of them for production and design, and because I've still got to rate it higher than Braveheart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an embarrassment of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was stunning how terrible it was. I was cringing throughout the movie, trying not to let the inaccuracies and ridiculous melodrama get to me, but once the Day of Infamy Speech was changed I called it quits. It's an embarrassment of a film hiding behind a few big names and a lot of special effects. This is one of those movies that we, not as a nation but as a species, should bury. Watching a bad porn would be less degrading.If you like your soap operas melodramatic by soap standards set in a quasi-historical backdrop with an over inflated budget and have brain power less than or equal to that of a can of Cheese Whiz this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't waste your time with this movie, it will be 4 hours of your life that you will desperately want back after sitting through it. The movie revolves around a love story between a pilot and a nurse and the pilots best friend. The story goes through several dull hours of this relationship and then ends up with a situation that is more suited to day time television. The love story and how it ended made me want to throw up with disgust and boredom. The only redeeming qualities of this movie were the examples of jingoism at it's worst and how pride can be the downfall of nations. Also the Japanese was authentic and it was refreshing to hear some old world military Japanese.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite few good looking effects the movie was boring. It took too long time to get into actual Pearl Harbor attack. Love story part was just boring and too obvious. Sad part was the attack to Japan - made me laugh. Writer could have accepted the defeat but no.This could have been similar to Das Boot, Saving Private Ryan or Enemy at the Gates, which both show well the cruelty of the was but no - naive and very long interpretation (and expensive) of the sudden attack to the Pearl Harbor.It's good that these movies can be rented - what a waste of money it would have been to watch it at the movie theatre.3/10 - don't waste your time to watch this</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>you'd better study the Pearl Harbor tragedy in history books!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made by the same crew that delivered us "Armageddon" (1998), "Pearl Harbor" is a much less stupid movie than its predecessor and a more ambitious one. You find the actor Ben Affleck in both movies but he's better in "Pearl Harbor" than in "Armageddon" because he manages to avoid third-rate acting. It isn't sufficient enough to make "Pearl Harbor" one of the finest movies made in 2001 because Michael Bay's movie contains a quite important number of faults. Michael Bay wanted obviously to give to his movie a Hollywood extent and as a consequence it makes the film uninteresting. Moreover this is an unoriginal film because it borrows several sequences or ideas from other movies. For example, as it was the case with "Titanic" (1997), Bay chose to shoot the Pearl Harbor tragedy through the love affair between Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett but this couple can't make the couple DiCaprio-Winslet forget. In short, this device appears colorless.But the Hollywood side of the movie can be seen at the special effects level. The action sequences are certainly impressive but they are crushed by special effects (when Affleck and Hartnett pilot fighter planes against Japanese pilots, you feel that you are inside a video game!).From a historical point of view, the movie only suggests an academic vision of the Pearl Harbor tragedy and we learn nothing new.Nevertheless when the film focuses on the very moving hospital sequences, Michael Bay knows how to create emotion.At the end, the whole gives a heterogeneous, shaky and conventional movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love WWII movies, I've studied WWII history my whole life. That is exactly why I rate this movie as awful. Because it is. Serious historians continually rank it one of the most inaccurate movies of all time.The list of reasons defy time and space to list, but suffice to say that the basic premise that a fighter pilot with no bomber experience would even be selected to train for as difficult a mission as the Doolittle raid defies belief. This is history for those who actually believe that "Reality TV" bears any resemblance to reality.Seriously, get your WWII history from books that were written by those who were there, and read from all sides. If interested, I can give you a good starter list. Hollywood rarely gets even close. Better yet, go volunteer at your local VA hospital or clinic while we still have some veterans around to talk to, and ask them!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is set during the infamous bombing of, well, Pearl Harbor. This film is not about that. It is about two best friends who fight over a woman.First off, I positively cannot stand Michael Bay. The first Transformers is enjoyable. The rest suck. Michael Bay is the scourge which plaques the film industry. He hacks at quality with a sharp axe of only wanting explosions and box office. Second, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are so WOODEN. So is Kate Beckinsale. Her role would be better played by Morgan Freeman. That would make this production which I struggle to call a film WAY more enjoyable. Third, I think I spotted a plot hiding in a stray piece of dialogue spoken at one point. Plot holes in this film dot the landscape like trees. I won't give it away, but you will see if you ever, ever decide to watch this movie. I highly recommend you keep your sanity and move past it at the DVD store. Get something nice out, like a drama which is actually involving. All in all, Pearl Harbor ignores the subject matter and focuses on a bland and clichéd love story.</fullReview>

Understandably the reality was a complete nightmare and nothing to be made light of, but if you want to understand the true sickness of war watch 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Full Metal Jacket'.If there's a choice of this or some comedy on TV, go out for a beer with some friends...

The part with the space aliens was a little over the top. James Brown was horribly miscast as the Japanese admiral. Blink-182 doing the soundtrack was highly inappropriate. The musical sequence that included the 1970s funk-soul hit "You Dropped A Bomb on Me" by the Gap Band seems a little too silly. But it was nice to see Henry Winkler resurrecting his role as Arthur Fonzarelli for the film. Is this a film? Yes it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film was Stupid. I wished I had Not Watched it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* out of ***This film is an adaptation of the events surrounding the tragic American event that took place on the military base Pearl Harbor. The lives that were lost will forever be a sad reminder of the horrible nature of war. Unfortunately, this film is not a good portrait of the event. I feel bad for hating this film so deeply because the event that it is about is not one that should be screwed around with, and with such a tragic event you would hope that all the people who decide to do stories about it do it with care and respect for the event.Basically what this is is a three way love triangle in which the event of Pearl Harbor just so happens to happen right in the background. And with such an inconvenient event taking place at such an inconvenient time, everybody in the film, for no reason at all, is forced to act stupid and pretend that they don't know what they are doing. The only bright spot of the entire film is the Cuba Gooding Jr. character, who is brave, smart, and very memorable. Unfortunately, he gets surprisingly little screen time.When the event of Pearl Harbor actually occurs, we are left a little underwhelmed. The same things blow up repeatedly over and over with very little care for continuity and humanity, and more for just technical effect. Take for instance the sequence in which a bomb hits a boat and sinks it. The result involves a lot of people flying all over the place in all different directions and being blown to several pieces by different planes. The effect just comes off as gratuitous rather than sad. The CGI is terrible.The director Michael Bay, has made some very enjoyable action films that I cared for hugely. The Rock was one of the most entertaining action films of the 90s, The Island was entertaining, Bad Boys was pretty good though the sequel was just gross, Armageddon was the closest a film has come to giving me a heart attack, and Transformers was alright. So far Pearl Harbor is his worst film yet!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually have another comment floating around here, condemning the movie as extremely lazy on the part of all involved. But the movie is worse than that. Like Grease, no one seems to acknowledge how amoral the movie is(the glorified harassment of Eugene). I have heard defense of the movie as a summer entertainment film, not supposed to be taken seriously. Well, the deaths of hundreds of people is something to be taken seriously. This isn't like Independence Day, where none of it actually happened. People actually died. The movie is barely about Pearl Harbor, it's about acouple of people who weren't even terribly affected. Not to mention the rampant use of ethnic slurs being depicted as heroic(interesting also how black people are respected completely in the '40s). I recognize that that's how it happened, but don't make it look okay. I think we all learned after Saving Private Ryan that war is an awful ugly thing that ruins lives, and not fun thing to make simple enjoyable movies about. If you want a good war movie, watch The Bridge on the River Kwai, where war is simply two forces fighting eachother futily. Not this, where heroes blow away cardboard villains.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm amazed that a film could be so simultaneously good and bad. I gave it a 4 on the ol' IMDb vote-a-meter thing, but it would've been a 1 had the actual Pearl Harbor attack not been so well done.Everyone's right -- the attack's great, everything else bites. Overacted, manipulative filmmaking.Although, once Alec Baldwin shows up in the last hour, the movie shifts into so-bad-it's-good territory. Baldwin adopts a gruff voice that kept reminding me of Kurt Russell's Snake in "Escape from LA". I kept waiting for Steve Buscemi to show up.And oh, is there some magical dialogue. Simply magical. I just wish they would've used the phrase "Jap suckers" a little more. You know, to really get the point across.But the attack sequence is pretty breathtaking. I found myself being quite moved at the harsh reality of it, and I gained even more respect for those who actually experienced Pearl Harbor. Too bad they're all paid tribute by such a bad film.I wish I would've taken everyone's advice with this DVD -- fast-forward to the Pearl Harbor attack, then ejected the disc as soon as that's over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every American Should Be Insulted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me get the good stuff out of the way first (since it will take the least amount of time). The second act of "Pearl Harbor", in which the Japanese attack the Naval base, contains some of the most visually stunning and heart-breaking moments ever produced in a war film.There is nothing else good about this movie. That's not to say it's all bad, although a lot of it is--some of it actually rises to mediocrity. But as an American, indeed as a human, I can't stand to think that the suffering and bravery of those lost in one of the most cowardly acts of war ever committed has been reduced to filler in a COMPLETELY predictable, sub-soap-opera love story.From the opening moments of the film, we are introduced to the poor writing and bad acting that permeates the film as two young boys realize that violence strengthens friendship. They grow up, join the military, fall in love with the same woman, fight each other, fight the Japanese, hate each other, and then move into a final third act that any ten-year-old could predict.Meanwhile, this cartoon actually seems to believe it's being patriotic, that it is somehow paying tribute to those whom it claims to be about. But this movie is just too stupid. Think of it as an after-school special about WWII. It's cheesy, it's uninspired, and it's insulting. To think that after such excellent fictional war movies as "Platoon" and "Saving Private Ryan" one of the most pivotal moments in American history ends up being made as a teen flick . . .Now there's a tragedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action effects do not save this disaster of a film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can honestly say that I can not remember the last time I saw a film this bad.The film tries to do a Titanic by introducing the Pearl Harbor story through the eyes of two friends (Affleck and Hartnett) who go off to war and a love triangle with nurse (Beckinsale) they both meet.The love story is predictable and corny. Over half the film is devoted on the two friends and their relationships to the nurse trying to give a back story to the characters so that you will feel for them come the impending attack. It does not work. It is pure cheese and is boring as well. I kept looking at my watch, wondering if anything would happen. During the film you feel nothing for the characters, seeing them as nothing more than the "pretty faces" of Hollywood, rather than character actors who would add to a convincing (I wish it only was) storyline. If this film wants to replicate Titanic, then it should sink with out a trace.....The attack sequence on Pearl Harbor does liven things up a bit. But being already over an hour and a half into the film, it seems somewhat late to pick up the tempo after so much boredom.During the attack sequence there were many shots that reminded me of the open sequence of Saving Private Ryan and of the sinking in Titanic. I guess that this is unavoidable given the nature of the film. However in both cases I was given the impression that the film makers (Michael Bay) were coping the techniques, and were not improving on them. Bay's typical use of slow motion in the effects was also overly used to the point of yawning with each successive slow shot. This was a shame as the special effects were otherwise excellent and the only saving point of the film.Finally the retaliatory strike on Tokyo was again a master of special effects, but this whole section of the movie seemed like another film and seemed out of place. That as least was consistent with the poor pacing in the rest of the film.I rented the film on DVD. I am glad that I only wasted 4 bucks. The DVD transfer is very good and the sound (DTS) was masterfull.Score:Sound (DTS): 10/10 Effects: 7/10 (let down by too much slowmo) Story: 1/10Overall: 4/10</fullReview>

However as inconsistant as they were it was used for a little bit of the time not 90% of the entire film that got very old very very fast...The original script was changed alot for this movie, the question was why?? What was so different from what we were intended to see, to what we were forced to see? Was it not marketable enough? Was it actually quality writing? What made this different...??Pearl Harbor failed on the same level as Armageddon. The filmmakers actually thought that a small amount of action wasn't as important as a hokey love story, just a b**tardization of their own history..Buena Vista must think that their marketing schemes work as well.. Am I the only one that isnt dumb enough to believe that the film doesnt rely on actual events in history just something that never happened... They should have made the trailers for both the film release and home video release to actually show what the film was all about, wait a minute that's not common sense, thats marketing.. I've seen all the trailers and not anywhere in it there's a hint of the story line and the 3 way love triangle just the action sequences... If they're wanting to sell a movie about the events of December 1941, promote Tora Tora Tora, not Pearl Harbor... Dont just make this as something it's not..</fullReview>

The sappy love story seemed written by pre-teens, Barbie goes to war. The characters were one dimensional cut outs and every war movie cliche had to be included. Events were staged for effect. For example, in one scene in a factory the floors were wetted down to get that nice sheen for the camera. Why would factory floors be flooded on purpose. It made no sense besides getting a nice shot. History was condensed and twisted to fit into quick sketches. Anyone watching this film to gather some sense as to why this attack happened would be very disappointed. The Japanese were portrayed as just the sneaky villains. It is a wonder they didn't have mustaches to twirl. The dialogue was stilted, the subtitles were barely legible, the music was maudlin, it was a bad, bad movie. Don't waste your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Pearl Harbor" or how to transform war into a romantic story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor, by Michael Bay, was a very awaited film thanks to its budget (about 140 000 000 $), to its cast -with a hot Ben Affelck (as Rafe McCawley ) and a oh-my-god-he-is-so-cute Josh Hartnett (as Danny Walker), without forgetting Kate Beckinsale (as Evelyn Johnson)- and also thanks to its subject? Indeed, narrating the attack on Pearl Harbor was an ambitious project. We were waiting for it, persuaded we would understand and learn more about this tragically famous event. Unfortunately the film failed its educative goal? At least about the war, because it could be a sentimental education! And OK I'm a girl, I love romantic films, but I was pretty disappointed of considering Pearl Harbor as one of these romantic dramas. The film intended to be a kind of reconstitution of the attack, mixed with a fictional plot of course, but always with the idea of being accurate to History. Besides, the characters seem to be well-selected because it could have permitted to see the attack from different points of view. Furthermore, the film also shows the preparation of the attack on the Japanese side and what happened whilst in the American White House! But once again, what could have been a good point is not. It isn't enough exploited: the majority of the film is centered on a love triangle compound of Evelyn, Rafe and Danny. That is the major criticism? The film lasts 3 hours and all the first third is about how Evelyn and Rafe met, who they are, how much they love each other... We forget we are in an action film relating the December 7th 1941 attack because everything is so devoted to emotion. But this is "too much" and when Rafe dies you think that it's over. Now, you're waiting for guns and planes and blood and death and action and diabolic Japanese laughs? ! OK, I admit the last one is maybe exaggerated but you understand what I mean you blood-thirsty war-film-lover! However, you're desperately wrong? Evelyn starts a love story with Danny to fill the void left by Rafe's death. But don't be so negative? The second third is coming! And there, the attack begins. Let's start with something positive: the visual effects are good. The sounds of the battle burst in your ears, the torpedoes split the water? At last some action! But unfortunately? didn't you see the remake of Titanic coming?! Yes, I can almost see the deception in your eyes through my screen but don't worry, it remains an action scene. Besides I liked it even if I found it a bit too long and repetitive because the same shots come several times. What I can tell you is that the diversity of points of view saved me from boredom! I stop you: I'm not contradicting what I said earlier, I persist in saying that it wasn't enough exploited but the dynamic it brings at that moment is very appreciable. For example: the scenes in the hospital, with the nurses reflect the panic and the injuries. I felt involved in the action! A kind of "truth" exudes from the scene because we can see the fragility of the characters. However? The attack is a bit ruined by the HEROISM of Rafe and Danny, I wrote it in capital letters because it becomes a burden; we're almost in the caricature! Don't you think that after "saving" the Harbor with two plays in a Hawaiian-printed shirt should our two heroes take break? Apparently they don't think so. I admit it would have been strange so I can understand that they hurry up to offer their help to the overcrowded hospital? and maybe that they give their blood. BUT the close up on the coca-cola bottles filling with this blood is another time TOO MUCH! What a pity! It could have been a testimony of the ingenuity of the nurses in the panic but the way it is done turns it into a TV commercial! And it isn't over: after giving their blood, our two heroes go helping to save the marines stuck in the sinking ships. In all cases, Rafe and Danny show a real brotherhood during this part, they forget their romantic rivalry and all is well that ends well! Mouhaha ! I trolled you! Indeed, the film is not finished! What a pity? Why did Michael Bay decide to relate Doolittle's Raid ?! We are out of the initial subject of the film, it doesn't bring anything but another long part and of course, it permits to reload again the love story. Another time, emotion and heroism are too present! Rafe and Danny go to sacrifice their life, again. And on top of that: Evelyn is pregnant and of course Danny is the father. So when Danny is about to die in China, Rafe tells him that he will be a father so he can't abandon his child. But he eventually dies (well, he had a piece of metal stuck in the neck!) and we witness to an umpteenth "emotion scene". Yeah!! HE IS DEAD! I was almost relieved because it announces the end of the film. You don't imagine how many times Danny and Rafe have been about to die, it becomes tedious?! But here is the end: we find Evelyn and Rafe, in a field, with their child. And do you know what his name is? Danny! With this last tribute which is also an echo to the first scene of the film with little Rafe and Danny playing in the fields... I was surprised because I didn't find it heavy, so it ends well. To conclude it was a long film, with some interesting parts but a lot of unnecessary scenes. I don't think I would advise you to see it? However, I don't regret my choice because Pearl Harbor is in the trend of all other WW2 films, too much but cults. OK, it's over; you can breathe and leave your seat!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was awful to the point of making the new Planet of the Apes look Oscar worthy. Take the story of Titanic, stick it in Pearl Harbor and you have this mess. This movie is so bad that the historians that advised for it asked to have their names taken off of the credits. It is historically inaccurate and an insult to your intelligence. About the only thing they managed to get right was that Pearl Harbor is in Hawaii.Until the actual attack happens, nothing happens in this movie except some poorly scripted love story, but I'm sure they added that because Titanic proved that you can make money with a love story.Needless to say, I recommend passing on this one. I also recommend breaking all the DVD's and burning the original copy. This movie is so bad that Mystery Science Theater 3000 should come back just to ridicule it, and it would still suck.</fullReview>

Why does this no talent hack continue to get work? I'll tell you why, because he has a sure fire formula working for him. He signs on to big budget flicks loaded with oodles of special effects and he knows all he has to do is launch all of the effects on the screen and people will pay big bucks to see it. Never mind the fact that every other element he is in charge of is going to suffer irrevocably. The Michael Bay motto seems to be, Bells and whistles to the point of irritation. I have never seen a movie of his yet where you couldn't stop groaning at the tired clichés, shotgun editing, and junior high dialouge.Pearl Harbor, I think, Is a special turd in the Michael Bay kitty litter box. Not only is it too long, its too trite, too hokey, too dull and too saturated with missteps that only a joke of a director like MB can perpetrate. Mark my words, If they keep giving MB more directing jobs he will soon be on the fast track to beating out legendary schlock director "Ed Wood" for the title of "Worst Director of all Time".</fullReview>

He researches and watches everything about it.War movies liked to have actual accuracy of when the war happened. My father knows all the info in the movie was wrong. That was why he hated it so much. (along with soap oprah material) I was only 9 when it was first released. So of course I could not watch it then.As for me I love a bit of romance. I loved Titanic and Japanese anime oriented romances.Well I watched most of that I could from it. I found it in bits that were so boring. Kate Bekinsale was pretty but.........did it have to be a love Triangle. Really? I watched "Home and Away" (Australian Soap Oprah) with the same basic plot line. Except no war was involved.Titanic captured my heart in the story line. It fitted perfectly with the sinking. Cause they both were in it "Pearl Harbor" didn't.... I found some bits sweet and endearing. But that was before Rafe died. Soon after it was a night fight and best friends next morning. I didn't like the love triangle that much....then she got pregnant with Danny's baby.....and this has to do with the war how? Coober Gooding Jnr did good in it. I wanted to see more of him.I liked the score of the movie. Even though it was cheesy. but I still liked it. Hans Zimmer is a great composer.I saw "Saving Private Ryan" that was an alright movie not my cup of tea. Trying to show as much realism of the war as possible without fully going over the top. To defeat the "Evil" enemies. Thats what I liked about it. That movie made you feel sorry for all the men and women who took part during the war."Pearl Harbor" went WAY! over the top of defeating the evil people. Two model boys in planes. Flying around with no tomorrow. Even though everyone else who tries to take off dies. Defeating every single jap plane that they could come across. LIKE SUPERMAN! It made the Japanese look a bit stupid...... even though in real life during "Pearl Harbor" the Japanese really hurt the Americans bad on that fateful day......But I had to admit before that part when the Japanese began to bomb. "Pearl Harbor" I think was really awesome. great graphics 40 mins of bombing! Just got ruined with "True American Patrionism". The Americans can win the war single handed by two men!!!!! I did not like American patrionism in this movie one bit! Sure it could show the American flag every now and then. But jeez......I'm from Australia. Americans might like a lot of patrionism. But I sure don't like to be reminded that America is the most powerful country every 5 mins. Cause I don't care!!!!!!! Dr Dolittle's raid. I barely remember any of that. But I wasn't sad in the end......My dad offers people to watch Tora! Tora! Tora! If you want a good more accurate movie about "Pearl harbor"overall 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those are no pearls...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was actually working part-time as a projectionist when this movie was released, and had to sit through 3 showings daily for four consecutive days. That's twelve Pearl Harbors, and astonishing 36 hours of incessant, mind-boggling, drab dialog, high-school amateur acting, atrocious plot, irritating musical chores and woefully happy endings. If you want to see where the blockbusters draw the line for too cheesy romance, too cheap patriotism, much too pointless violence and truly too long footage, don't watch this movie, since it's waaaaay past it. There are more worthy movies with Michael Dudikoff, I mean, at least he's got a funny name and a haircut to entertain you for two seconds.It might be funny if you rented Pearl Harbor AND Team America and watched the two one after another, but otherwise... steer well off it. Stay sane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasons why this film got criticized so much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is this film so widely criticized? Here are the reasons I gathered. --May contain Spoilers --1. Too typical "Super Hero" type American action movie for a movie that's supposed to be serious and realistic. Even the main characters are fictional characters, they shouldn't be almost invincible. Too many examples, here are some of them. Rake didn't die or seriously injured crashing his fighter into the English Channel. With Danny, in Pearl Harbor, sitting in the convertible car while rushing to the air field, was direct hit by gun fire from Zeros, yet both guys were unscratched. Even the 7.62mm gun from Zeros can penetrate that car, not to mention if they ever used the 20mm cannon. In the air field, while scores of armies and pilots were shot dead by Zero's strafing bullets, these two guys were completely unharmed so were some of their buddies. During the "dog fight", they were flying way too dangerously low to the ground and close to buildings. One shot showing the fighter going through a tight alley between two buildings diagonally, impossible! At the end of the dog fights, they must have been dead exhausted from all the running around and flying, yet they can still give blood, and later assist on rescue of the capsized ship. At the end of the Doolittle Raid, they're out of fuel and ditching their planes, while Rake's crash landing was sort of realistic, the way Danny's plane crashed and impacted on the ground would no doubt be killing all on board. From the remains of Danny's plane they're showing, there was no way that anyone in that plane can still be in one piece. Yet Gooz and Danny were still alive, aside from moderate injuries.2. Too much historical, factual and technical errors, so much that you can call the producers insincere for making such a high budget film, which the primary purpose is to depict an important historical event, i.e. it's title "Pearl Harbor". The Goof list is a long one here in IMDb, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213149/goofs . The inconsistency of the positions of the battle ships during the battle scenes are completely unacceptable, since that's the most important aspect of the attack. It's an eye sore to see obviously modern Naval warships in the harbor, including 3 pack together side by side, being used as WWII warships that were blown up during the attack. If they're using CGI effects for recreating the battle ships, why not alter these to at least make them look more historically correct for WWII era type ships. Saving budget, no time, or just laziness? Same for the aircraft carriers, obviously are modern carriers, with the two rectangular protrusions in the front of fly deck, which are part of the steam catapult system for modern jet fighters! During the take off sequence of the Japanese planes from their carrier, a fly by showing an even more ridiculous sight -- an aircraft carrier having airplanes take off in the tail end of the ship (you can see the catapult in the front, while planes take off from the other end), completely in the wrong direction! No one, not even for WWII carriers, that you take off from the tail of the carrier, LOL! This is unforgivable mistake, but again it's so easy to correct with their CGI animation. I don't know if these lack of attentions to details are due to the fact that the director "Michael Bay (himself were trying to) quit the movie project four times over various disputes" (from IMDb Trivia of this film).3. This movie is no doubt trying to pack too much stuffs into one film. Romantic stories, jam packed with historical facts / events / speeches, which some of these are just brief add-ins, like all the Japanese planning scenes are no more than 5 minutes combined. Jam packed with tons super action heroes stuffs, and of course all the CGI / explosives special effects, which is the main selling point of this movie. Pearl Harbor not only, but also battle of Britain, Doolittle's Raid, and a bit of close quarter combat with Japs. Too much! Sometimes, trying to do too much can be a very bad thing. And this movie shows.It's OK to have some romance and hot chicks. It's OK to add a bit of fiction to a historical story. But it's not good if you're trying to do too much, with sacrifice to quality / details, and add in too much cheesy actions and dialogs. Especially, when you have a forerunner film like Tora Tora Tora to compare with, this film is simply inferior without compare.This film do worth 5 points though, for its stunning color and picture quality, beautiful ladies, and at least for the effort of filming such complex project and coordinating those dangerous stunts. And this movie did provide additional critical details, that Tora Tora Tora had missed, such as the wooden piece that makes the torpedo able to be used in shallow water, and the Japanese spy activities in the area.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right up front, let me confess to having been a World War II nut since early childhood. You may thus understand the depths of my disappointment with this movie. I believe Roger Ebert said it best: "The Japanese attack an American love triangle." I find it inexcusable that such a pivotal event in history, and one as well documented from just about all angles, can come in for such slipshod treatment at the hands of moviemakers, but I guess I shouldn't be too surprised. Just let down.If the producers can expend so much time, money and effort to make everything look big and splashy, why not go the extra 1/4 mile and make it look *right*? Spielberg managed it for Saving Private Ryan, even with the somewhat far-fetched plot device. Flaws abound, and have been pointed out in great depth elsewhere (the most glaring are the guided missile frigates in the harbor, the off-scale appearance of the Oklahoma as she capsizes (with an impossible torpedo hole in her starboard side, which was shielded by the Maryland *and* Ford Island), no mention of Nevada's dramatic attempt to get underway and subsequent beaching, etc).To my legion of fellow critics I say, "read your history before trashing the 'token black' Dorie Miller subplot". Ship's Cook 3rd Miller did, in fact, give aid and comfort to West Virginia's dying captain, did, in fact, man a machine gun for 15 minutes (during which he believed he shot down a Japanese plane) and was, in fact, the first black recipient of the Navy Cross (awarded in early 1942 by Admiral Nimitz). Aside from the mistaken coffee-service bit (he was actually bagging laundry at the time) that was one of the things the producers got *right*.Focusing on the Dolittle Raid, I saw only lost opportunities - how Dolittle convinced his superiors to let him fly, the fates of the crews (who flew solo rather than in formation and were scattered all over the place afterwards) and Dolittle's dejection at the "failed" raid and his subsequent accolades... all of this was jettisoned as the producers got out the Ritz crackers and Velveeta and went for the cheesy, contrived, convenient resolution of the *important* part of the movie, that cockamamie love triangle.In sum, so many opportunities, so little follow through. Rent "In Harm's Way" for schmaltz, and "Tora Tora Tora" for the attack itself. Better yet, snag a copy of "At Dawn We Slept", and read up on the historical tapestry that this movie never really touched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very skeptical about watching this movie because a lot of my friends and many reviewers told me they didn't like it. I was pleasantly surprised that the movie captivated my attention during the whole length.For those who are skeptical about it, it's primarily a love story, it's a great love story, and yes there is some war fighting somewhere towards the end of the movie. I believe this is where the mixed review came in. Most of my friends that hated it, were expecting a war movie with lot's of fighting, shooting, air battles, etc. I should have known when they told me that I should only watch the movie for the special effects that they really weren't into the movie for the story but they just wanted to see a blood and guts type of movie.I really enjoyed the movie, and recommend it to anyone that is looking for a great story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I had the "pleasure" to watch this movie in cinema, so I have unfortunately paid for it. The first 90 minutes almost nothing happens. I felt like I was watching a low-budged TV production made for people over the age of 70. The Characters just talk, laugh, the sun shines and everything is fine. The only plot is a boring love story between the 2 pilots Rafe and Danny and the nurse Evelyn. After a while you just wait for the Japanese. So far so boring. Then the the attack begins. What now happens on the screen is what you expect of Michael Bay. In great action scenes the hole armada blows up. This is when I thought: "Hey! That movie isn't as bad as you thought." So I give 0 stars for the first 90 minutes and the dreary love story and 5 for the attack on Pearl Harbor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor may be the worst film I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through in the theatres. Boring is probaly the best word to descripe this film, though you good use several others like: corny, crappy, sappy, trite, disrespectful, Titanic-wannabe, or just plain bad. The dialouge is laugable, and the actors delievering it don't do anything to help matters. The movie so badly wants to be Titanic but can because of Michael Bay. He should realize that he is no James Cameron, and that every film he has directed with the exception of The Rock has been horrible; this guy has absolutely no talent what so ever and needs to get out of the film business. Another thing that makes me angry about this film is that it is trying to make money off of one of the worst events in United States history. In the movie soliders bodies are flung across the screen like extras in a Rambo film with absolutely no respect in the least bit. Everyone involved with the film should be ashamed for not only making one of the worst movies of all time, but for being so shameful with their handling of the matter. Take my advice, don't ever ever watch this movie. I give this piece of crap film 0/10.</fullReview>

I thought it was just "bad" after the first time, but now i think that is is simply THE WORST PIECE OF S..T THAT HAS EVER BEEN MADE IN HOLLYWOOD.This movie is an insult to every soldier who fought in Pearl Harbor or any other battle of WW2. The death of these men should be taken more seriously because they have fought for freedom against unspeakable horror and not for Disney`s profit-and-loss account.And, in my opinion, historical accuracy ist important, because (sadly) movies have become an important part of education. In one comment about "A Knights Tale" i read the lines "[...] unlike U-571, from which i learned important historical facts [...]".

		<fullReview>Spoiler!! This i think might have been a good film showing the big history event; pearl harbor attacked by the Japanese, not to leave out a little too patriotic. But the love story sucks. Rafe 'dies' and Evelyn moves on which you are supposed to do... but she moves on together with Rafes best friend Danny. And after a very romantic night she gets pregnant. Shortly after, while expecting Dannys baby, Rafe returns, as it turns out he didn't die. And there is Evelyn standing in front of a big choice. Should she go back to Rafe, her first choice of man, the one she loved first. That would be the logical way to do it, because at least i thought it sucked when he 'died', i guessed he'd come back but not that she would go get pregnant first. The other choice is to go to Danny which she was going to have a baby with. She chose the second choice. Still what kept the first so great Rafe alive was the thought of sweet Evelyn. OK, i accepted it after a while... but when Danny gets himself killed in the war she goes back to Rafe, notice th same Rafe she chose away and lets him be daddy instead. Since this was a history film i already knew about the war so i focused on this love story, which totally sucked. So why bother the three hours with this incredibly weak story-film. buuuuuu.. buuuu.. buuuuu!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie ever? Its a close call</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sitting through 2 and 1/2 hours of bad acting and paper thin storylines was almost worth it for the chance to watch crap blow up for a half hour. Than I realized it wasnt. I guess it was just the excitment of not having to watch Josh Hartnett mug and mumble through his scenes or watch Ben Afflek try desperatley to convince the camera that he's actually not Ben Afflek.Days of our Lives has nothing on Pearl Harbor! Its got the thinnest story, the most handsome fella's, the prettiest gal's and the least amount of talent you'll see anywhere. Theres not much to say about the script, mainly because theres not much of one to comment on. Its over dramatic, predictable and pointless. It couldve been written around any event in time but in order to draw some emotion from the crowd they opted to backdrop the bombing of Pearl Harbor behind this high octane emotional rollercoaster love triangle. Instead of making the audience feel what it was like to live through that time, Pearl Harbor actually has little to do with Pearl Harbor. Obviously they just wanted to blow millions of dollars for a special effects rendition of the infamous bombing, and wrote a quickie script around it.Now the acting. Even though it seems to defy the laws of the universe, they actually found an actor with less talent than Ben Affleck. Josh Hartnet. For a while I wondered why they didnt subtitle his lines. I found out later its because hes actually speaking English. Most of my time was spent trying to interperet his squints and facial scrunches. Ben Affleck as usual plays Ben Afflek playing Ben Afflek playing some good looking guy doing some stuff. at least this is how I imagine him aproaching each roleconsidering every line he's ever uttered is completley devoid of any emotion or thought what so ever. For example; in Boiler Room, his line was "Im a millionaire, it sounds wierd to say it, but im a F*ing millionaire" Even though Ben Afflek is in real life a millionaire, he still delivers the line with no emotional involment. The rest of the cast which consists af many Hollywood A-list cameos arent there for you to enjoy. There only purpose is to bring the attention back to Ben and Josh after a brief history lesson.Any highschool student couldve recounted the events of Pearl Harbor more acuratley than Joel Shumaker and his money hungry cronnies. And by the way, what kids play baseball games at 7:00am on Sunday morning? I guess Im old-fashioned, but you can give me my history straight. This brand new version of history, although very poilitically correct, just doesnt do it for me. And if there going to dumb it down, at least make it good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Where to begin? When I sat down to watch this movie I didn't know what to expect. I thought it would be halfway decent at best. Well, I was wrong. Way wrong. The movie is so long and drawn out it's terrible. You just sit there and think to yourself, "why am I watching this and why should I care about what's going on?" There is NO plot that's worth while and NO depth to the characters. It's just a bunch of Hollywood garbage. The love story and the war were not tied together enough. Actually, they weren't tied together at all. It was like there were two stories going on at once that have nothing to do with each other. The movie is called Pearl Harbor, but it wasn't about Pearl Harbor, it was about a romance that has no depth. Blah. Boring. The only decent scene is when the ships are being blown apart. Wonderful. And I love how Hollywood film makers add in garbage to spice things up. Like the dog fight with the American planes and the Zero's. That never happened. Atleast make something that's SOMEWHAT historically accurate. No history No story. No depth. No plot. Gotta love the special effects, though! BOOM! BANG! POW! Watch everything explode.This is one of the worst movies ever filmed. It's one example that Hollywood would do anything to the public in order to sucker them in to make a buck. This is Hollywood garbage at it's finest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The good points of Pearl Harbour are fairly easy to summarise: 1) Damned impressive-looking and -sounding show. 2) Great recreation of Pearl Harbour itself.However, the counter-arguments are a little more numerous. 1) The portrayal of the Japanese. They're cardboard cutout 'baddies'! I mean, we should be allowed to understand and empathise with the Japanese point of view (that America was heading slowly and inevitably for war under pressure from Western Europe, and that if they didn't strike first, America's Pacific Fleet would be a serious threat when the time came), but this was just pathetic. 2) The portrayal of the whole of Western Europe. For 2 years worth of fighting, we get a few stereotypes thrown in and an odd look from Affleck. And the 'turning point of WW2'? A small bombing raid on Tokyo, included in the film only because the filmmakers thought audiences so shallow that they couldn't cope with a film that ended at its tragic climax, Pearl Harbour. 3) The sickeningly predictable 'love story.' There wasn't anything in this that couldn't be seen coming several hours ago. The plane hits the sea - of course he's alive, it's only 30 minutes into the film! The two best friends go off to war - of course, one of them's going to die, so our hero can get back together with the stock love interest and live happily ever after. Yawn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that this movie is one of the most hated movies ever made (at least reading comments here on IMDb and also listening to people commenting on it elsewhere). But then there's the other crowd who truly enjoyed it and thought it was among the best war epics ever. Myself, i must say that i have seldom seen a movie that felt so much like an endurance test. I was chewing on my seat just to have something to do while sitting in the theater.The problems with this movie are numerous and of catastrophic proportions. While a lot could be said about the atrocious acting and overly pompous style of the movie, that is not the main flaw. Rather the script is the main offender. Seeing that writer Randall Wallace has also written such epic manure as "We were soldiers" and "The man in the iron mask" comes as no real surprise. The scriptwriting here is terrible, and it's completely insane that the demands for the script were not higher on a movie budgeted at over 135 million dollars. Basically this is a script and story worthy of a porn movie. It's one hour build-up, one hour massacre and one hour slowdown in the end. Unbearably boring is the key-word for all three sequences.Because the main problem with this movie is not the keen patriotism, the laughable "acting" from Ben Affleck or the sappy love themes. No it's the combination of all these. It's not awful like "We were soldiers", nor is it crap in a "bad but entertaining" way. Rather it's just an insufferable bore. The only part of the movie where i was not half-unconscious was during the actual attack on Pearl Harbor. In that sequence one could easily see where the 135 million dollars went...Maybe it's just me. But still i personally feel that demands should be a little higher on a movie that cost as much as this one. The least i should be able to demand is that i don't fall asleep in my chair! I rate this 3/10 with an extra point added because it can be used as a substitute for Valium.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most anticipated movies of the summer, Pearl Harbor had the opportunity to be an epic. But it failed miserably. The best description I can come up with for it is an unintentionally comedic, horribly Americanized, Titanic-meets-Top Gun.How exactly did this movie go wrong? Firstly, if you're looking for something historically accurate, don't bother. I'm not quite sure which war this movie was supposedly taking place during, because it sure wasn't World War II. Of course, if you like laughing at how idiotic Americans are, you have plenty of opportunities, for example, when one of the characters shouts "I think World War II just started" - in 1941.The acting wasn't half bad, but unfortunately the actors had very little to work with. The love story, which takes up most of the movie, had a plot more ludicrous than any bad daytime soap opera. The basic premise is a love triangle set against the events leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Ben Affleck plays Rafe, an American pilot who signs up for the Eagle Squadron and goes to Britain to fight, leaving behind Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), his one true love. The plot is complicated when Danny (Josh Hartnett), his best friend from childhood, falls in love with Evelyn. Now, normally, I hate predictable movies, but this one would have been better off staying the course. Instead, its plot twists and and turns are so ridiculous, they turn the love story into a comedy routine.Not that this movie was all bad. It had its good points. The fight scenes in the planes, though short, were fun, as was seeing lots of ships get blown up. The special effects were definitely the highlight of the movie.Unfortunately, Pearl Harbor had far too little excitement and far too much stupidity. At over three hours, it was also far too long, especially considering how the entire battle at Pearl Harbor only lasted two hours in reality. It's really too bad, because with a cast including Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and the surprisingly talented Josh Hartnett, and one of the greatest stories of the twentieth century for material, it really should have been much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect example of brainwashing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so let's sum up this movie: the 2 male characters are handsome, funny, heroic, generous, have no flaws, bla bla bla. Their fellow soldiers are not so handsome (how convenient) but are full of all sorts of qualities bla bla bla.The girl looks and acts like Mary Poppins and her friends are sexy, funny, bla bla bla. Pearl Harbour looks like Disney Land or the Blue Lagoon. Battle scenes are OK,but why not throw the John Doe character (Gooding) who's a cook but shoots down Japanese planes like Rambo.American flag metaphorically sinking in the water.The President is heroic and stands up from the wheelchair in a Scarlet O'Hara fashion and swears never to be hungry again, or to crush down the Japanese, or whatever. The British air squadron commander is so impressed with Affleck's character and delivers one of the cheesiest and stupidest line in movie history: "God save the German Army if there are more like you where you came from", or something like that. People,stop wandering why people generally and Americans in particular are so ignorant about the world, history or whatever if they are given such artistic examples. It is not the lack of realism that I mind so much (afterall it is a movie) it is the pretense of realism that it is annoying. Too bad about the actors. Baldwin and Voight should have skipped this one. Mr. Bay, stop misguiding people, please.I am not saying that was not reasonably historically accurate, it is the WAY that it is presented that is wrong. Hollywood can sometimes be extremely annoying and this is one of the best examples.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is the formula - take a bunch of pretty, young stars, cast them in a bizarre love and uninteresting love triangle and throw in a Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor with some cool special effects. First of all, the actors don't seem to even care about their lines or show any real emotion. The screenplay dialog doesn't help, hurts the character interpretation, and is at times painful. The director must have been out for a coffee break for half of the film. I would definitely pass on this film even if someone paid me to see it.The movie is about an hour too long. It is extremely predictable in it's love story which is almost extraneous to the point of the story. Randall Wallace should stick with TV writing before getting into Hollywood war movie making. Don't even compare this to Tora! Tora! Tora! or the Longest Day. They just don't make them like those anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The cinematic equivalent of defacing a war memorial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This honestly has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Never mind the plagiarism of other, better movies; the empty-headed and monumentally annoying love story; the pathetic so-called "acting" (only Dan Aykroyd and Tom Sizemore make any sort of impact); the banal script and laughable dialogue; the cheesy music and rock video editing; or the gee-whizz attitude to violence and explosions. What really galls about this turkey is its offensiveness: surely none of the poor souls who perished at Pearl Harbor behaved as stupidly as portrayed here! One scene sums up Jerry Bruckheimer, Randall Wallace, and Michael Bay's attitude in making this film. While military personnel and civilians are bombed and blasted, raked with gunfire, drowned and crushed in a sickeningly titillating way (whoever described this as war as pornography was spot on!), the filmmakers are more concerned with the plight of a small dog whose owner has just been shot. When the pooch is rescued, the obvious intent was for a heartwarming moment; but this was the moment at which this trash went from being extraordinarily dumb to being extraordinarily infuriating. Thousands of people dying, but we are expected to relate to a bloody dog!!!Who are these people? I agree that there is a place for mindless action movies and a comic book approach to violence. But when you impose such an approach on what should have been a human (not to mention, humane) drama, evoking the terror of war and remembering, respectfully, the memory of those who sacrificed everything in one of the great turning points of 20th century history, I'm afraid that you have lost the plot in a big, big way.The shame of it is that, given the budget and the resources at their disposal, Bruckheimer and co have missed a golden opportunity to present a really memorable, classic, and respectful motion picture. But, as they count their earnings, I am more than confident that making such a movie was the last thing they ever intended.Cynical, mawkish, cliched rubbish of the highest order, this is the cinematic equivalent of defacing a war memorial.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen war movies of poor quality like Battle Of the Bulge etc. However, they were ten times better than this one. It's been a few years since I have seen this movie, but I have not forgotten much. Of course, there is great special effects in the battle sequences and the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful, especially the Japanese-themed music, but that is not enough to redeem this film from the bad points.DIRECTION: Not too impressed. The camera angles were not so bad and it would look like it is well-filmed, but there were times when the camera just shook way to much and was not in the right position (I will talk about that later). It looked like the scenes were filmed in one take. It looked as though the director was not doing much directing at all. It seemed liked he told the actor/actress to do or say something but not how to, which might be one reason for the horrible acting.CAST/ACTING: Also pretty bad. Why was Ben Affleck chosen for the main role? In my experience he showed one of the worst performances I have ever seen! He looked like a puppet being pulled by strings. He should have won his Razzie Award nomination for worst actor! As for Kate Beckinsale, she was not a bad choice, but mainly because of her good looks. Her acting was okay but would not win an Oscar.SCREEN WRITING: Quite bad. Actually the emotion and settings would make this script closer to average, but thanks to the unbearably simple dialogue and historical inaccuracy and pointless love triangle, it makes this screenplay much below average. I understand that romance was put to reveal an anti war-like message, but that is not powerful enough. It is just so weakly portrayed. And war was not just about leaving your loved ones, but also about children losing their father and ladies losing their boyfriend/husband. They insulted that truthful reality by making Americans look invincible in the second half. I say that if Randall Wallace included something more realistic, and the second half of the movie was edited out (when the Japanese are bombed) he might be able to redeem this film, but sadly he didn't. Another problem is that you don't even care about the characters because they don't seem important. Josh Hartnet's character was decent, but Ben Affleck's character was wooden. The movie is simple American propaganda. It makes them look like invincible heroes and Pearl Harbour their victory. 4 planes shot down expertly by 2 American pilots and them making evasive manoeuvres to clash the Japanese planes. That is not how the battle went. This is not a documentary, but to make a good script about history, you need to stay true to the facts. This is why we should not respect Hollywood films like this for their style.CINEMATOGRAPHY/CAMERAS: I did not last see it at my house so I don't know if the TV had wide-screen, but if it did cameras were not well-positioned. The angles were fine, but in the beginning when Capt. Rafe McCawley reports to his commander at the airfield the camera is aiming at him from his front-right and cutting almost half of his face. Who in the world could think of doing that. Also, earlier on when the kid at the field runs and follows his dad. The crane shot for only one second has the kid in view at the left then it just shows the field itself for a few seconds more. Seeing all this it probably was the TV, but regardless of that Michael Bay should have studied these scenes better and try to make the camera shoot at the right position.I won't say any more because all I wanted to list were the really bad points. So trust me, there are much better films worth 3 hours of your life which are a little bit less than 5.3 stars. Not to mention even better ones. So I have one thing to say . . . this movie is well worth it's rating, if not lower.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That was terrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years ago, I sat down and watched the first half of the movie, today I watched the second half and sadly it's still really bad. With the exception of the bombing of Pearl Harbor itself, this movie is hardly exciting or interesting. A few years before this movie came out, Michael Bay had just assaulted the American people with Armageddon which had insulted anyone with any scientific knowledge at all. Then came Pearl Harbor which insulted everyone who knows anything about US History at all.I won't get in to the fact that Roosevelt had browbeat the Japanese into striking first, or that the government knew the Pearl Harbor attacks were coming, or the fact that the Doolittle raid was a propaganda move, or the fact that fighter pilots would never become bomber pilots or you get the idea. Everything this movie knew about history it learned in Kindergarten. The writer/director were too afraid to do anything remotely challenging, write a decent screenplay, end with the battle of Pearl Harbor (Oh gee, did we win WW2?) and decided to throw in an American victory to make it more pleasant for the average American movie goer.Thankfully this movie was a dud and no more long, boring war/romance movies have been made. United 93 and World Trade Center have proved that Hollywood can make good movies about tragic events. If they cut this movie down just to the bombing and a few tense hours leading up to the bombing, it had the potential to be exciting. Instead, Bay threw in a herd of uninteresting and clichéd characters, nearly an hour of build up, an idiotic last hour where they just had to show the Americans win, and finally where one of the heroes die and his offspring gets to ride a plane a few years later (I'm sure that said offspring likely died in Vietnam anyways...)What next? Is Bay/Bruckheimer gonna make a movie where they show the Gulf of Tonkin (which is a big of a lie as Pearl Harbor) and then show the Americans winning the war in Vietnam?</fullReview>

It really opens your mind to what happened on December 7, 1941, and it really shows you new points of view. For example, the director and script writer gave the Japanese general a conscience, so that he doesn't seem like the "evil tyrant" that some text books classify him to be. The special effects and all of the war scenes are amazingly realistic. Some say that the movie is really "sappy" and "predictable" but even if that is true, the acting, directing, and music goes together so well that you can't help but get sucked into the movie and cry when they cry, pray when they pray, and laugh when they laugh.

God help us if we do the same to the Sept 11 attack.I am a big believer in the power of film, its evolving ability to be the real language of the future. But in these early days of the medium, artists are not just creating films but creating the future of how we think and reason. When the subject is an event like this, it is also coloring how we think of ourselves as a nation.The responsibility is vast. Not one shred of same is apparent here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, for those who liked the movie (and I saw this movie back in 2001, but it still sticks in my craw) or thought that it had a genuine historical accuracy about it, let's get the facts that the movie got right straight.1) Pearl Harbor is in Hawaii, 2) Japan attacked the US at Pearl Harbor, and 3) The US launched a raid on Japan off of the USS Hornet.They built a bad movie around 3 correct facts. This movie was horrible and the dialogue was trite. How likely is it that an American fighter pilot flying for the British would end up in Hawaii just in time for the "big attack" and then be switched to flying bombers days after the attack.If you want to see a good movie on Pearl Harbor, you have to go back to "Tora, Tora, Tora" or for carriers in the Pacific, "Midway". Don't waste your money on this movie, even if they allow you to see it for free! (Hey, you'll buy a Coke and popcorn, of course, that'll be the best part!)</fullReview>

But of my favourite and up and coming actors Josh Hartnett who i thought was brilliant in both Halloween H2O and The Faculty really shines here and hopefully will promote him into the a list.A lot was said about the boring first hour but i thought the first hour really went with lighting pace. A lot was made of the effects and they were absoultely brilliant but instead of making this just a effects movie they have added well rounded characters a interesting storyline and the effects add to the overall movie making it a real joy to watch. Unlike movies like the MUMMY RETURNS the effects characters and script are brilliant.No review would be complete without a mention of Michael Bay a excellent director who makes this film a triumph.10 out of 10</fullReview>

In the middle of it all, were two friends who had been through so much with each other since childhood that they were sure they would get out of the battle alive?I love this film, I could watch it everyday, In fact, I do watch it everyday. Michael Bay couldn't have created a better cast. In my opinion, it was definitely worth all the money and hard work that everyone put into it. Josh Hartnett, is very hot and very good at acting. Along with co-star Ben Affleck who is very talented and could make any position of acting look real. The last half hour, contain some of the most exhilarating scenes of battle, ever seen in a film. The great acting makes the bond between the two friends all the more real during the fight sequences.Pearl harbour is an emotional story containing war and romance; two genres that it combines to make one of the best war films of the early millennium if not of all time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that there are some "Pearl Harbor" fans, and I'm sorry but to be honest this movie is just trash. It seemed to me that the director just wanted to have a huge action movie and lost all the details that this event really happened. They just added a huge love story in it that wasn't memorable and also that they were trying to make another "Titanic". I was looking forward to this movie when it came out, because I had studied World War II religiously and I couldn't believe this monstrosity of a film.Ben and Josh play Rafe and Danny, two American boys who grew up together and are in the army. Rafe seems to just be in love with America and one girl, Evelyn played by Kate, she's a nurse who helps Ben get back to health after a certain mishap with his nose. They have a romance, but when it comes time for Rafe to choose between his country and his love, which does he pick? You just guess. But when an accident happens in England where Rafe is, they assume him dead and send Eve the message of his death. She and Danny then become real close through this lose and you guess it! They get down and dirty! Rafe comes back though expecting everything to be the same as before. Shock! Eve is pregnant with Danny's baby; but that's the least of their problems when the evil Japenese are thinking about bombing an unexpecting army base, Pearl Harbor.The movie then just turns into nothing but action and makes the audience forget that this was real. I didn't feel a connection between Ben and Josh. If could actors just look more like they hate each other or didn't enjoy working together. Kate has a good performance, but unfortunately is not supported well by the other actors. The Japenese are made out to be total villains, even though what they did was wrong, but the movie might as well just should made them into those villains from the old James Bond flicks. The movie just doesn't work and doesn't deserve respect in any way historically.1/10</fullReview>

Sailors sauntering along the decks of their moored vessels when the torpedo planes, armed with special shallow-running devices, headed for the battleships, their prime targets? Bay's cameras move sometimes fast, and sometimes in slow motion to show the savage blow? Scenes, out of focus, evoke the sense of disorientation and fear, also of bravery in the midst of confusion in the island's base hospital...'Pearl Harbor' is a fight between love and glory against a backdrop of America's entry into World War II...

The script is so corny and lame you'll be taping something over your ears to stop the pain. 21st Century anachronisms appear routinely, far too many to list. There is no heart for the people who died that day; the attack sequence is an exploitive, excessive, over-indulgent CGI field day that depict this tragic event as if it was comic book style mayhem.Ben Affleck fights in every battle you ever heard of, from Europe to Japan. I thought any minute they'd show scenes of him strafing Sioux Indians at the Little Big Horn, bombing Santa Ana's forces at the Alamo, or firing lasers at the Galactic Empire's Death Star.Since the whole thing is garbage, the director is to blame.

		<fullReview>I watched it several times and most of all I love that love story, the setting and the atmosphere. As it is said in the trivia to the film here on IMDb Michael Bay received hundreds of letters of elder people who expressed that he got it right at what it was like at those times. And that is what I felt when I watched the movie for the first time. I really do not understand how some critics did not notice and did not respect and acknowledge that Michael Bay and his crew were able to bring us back to the early forties during war times. The behavior of the people, the clothes, the music, the band, the dressing, the make up of the women and the innocence of the (well, some) girls and boys looking for love are so impressive. I love the dialogs and the acting. The other main part of the film - what happened before, during and after the attack - is also very well shown, to my opinion. I love the talks of Alec Baldwin as Dollittle with the two main characters and the acting of Baldwin as well of Jon Voight as Roosevelt or Dan Arkroyd as intelligence officer. Michael Bay got it right. He focused on the main occurrences of the Pearl Harbour attacks and set them up quite well.There are a lot of lines and short sequences in the movie that are worth of watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Est-Ce fabuleux!"Ma, you know who else lived through World War II besides grandpa? I did", I screamed at her from outside the house, while still getting down from the cab that I took from the cinema. What a great movie it was. The images of the gusty air-force combats and the invasions are still in my head, the sounds of the thunderous cannons still roar in my ears, and the gentlemanliness of the army men, with their uniforms and planes, still leave me grasping for more, as did the jam-packed theater.&nbsp;Why did it have to get over? Why couldn't it last just a tiny bit longer? The sky high aerobatics, the machine guns, the fighter jets, the discipline, the pretty army women, the well ironed suits, the line of command, and the bigger than life climax, I adored it all. The chemistry between the leads is something to look forward too. The unconventional romantic relationship and the intimate scenes between the lovers spice up the movie and give a new twist to the plot.If you want to feel the thrill and the emotion of being at war and love at the same time, of being away from home, of being behind enemy lines, and of leading your country to victory, go and watch Michael Bay's extraordinary take on the events leading up to and involving thereof one of the most disastrous catastrophes of the era.Michael Bay never misses a chance to leave his viewers awestruck with his action packed works, with strands of deadly love. And he did it again with Pearl Harbor.&nbsp; The movie, though titled Pearl Harbor, is much more than that just the bombings. The war is twofold: between countries and between hearts. Army Air Corps, Affleck and Hartnett, thick as thieves, become the target of a deadly love triangle, with the potential of encompassing their friendship, falling in love with the ever-pretty Evelyn, which results in a love-hate relationship being fired up between the two captains. But Bay has something new to offer rather than the clichéd. Their friendship is tested when they are sent off to war together, resulting in their hatred for each other ultimately turning, or rather returning, into a brotherly bond. The climax is sort of depressing, but that is overcome by the patriotism of winning the war.The motion picture is certainly not for the faint hearted. It is a mixed bag of emotions, and it is one that has many holes in it. The movie takes its audience through a variety of different emotions, starting at a high with love and patriotism, progressing to hatred and anger, and then ending into sorrow and dismal. The movie throughout, holds its viewers onto their seats and unleashes a surprise, a twist, every few frames, bounding them to think on what may follow next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its the best movie I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing is, looking through all of these other reviews, I don't understand why this movie has such terrible reviews! Maybe by watching this, they were looking for a hardcore war movie. This really isn't a war movie at all; its a story of love and friendship supported by the time period of World War 2.I have never seen a better movie, literally. I cried my face off at the end. Watching Josh Hartnett's adorable character die because he was saving his best friend's (Ben Affleck's role) life is just so heartbreaking and emotional and it makes me want to role up into a ball and die on the floor. And then, on top of that, Ben Affleck tells Josh Hartnett that he's going to be a father (throughout the movie, the female lead changes between loving Affleck and Hartnett and gets pregnant with Hartnett's child) and Hartnett replies with "No, you are," as he releases his final breath and that's when you lose it. Then the end comes with Affleck flying in a plane (he's a pilot) with Hartnett's son that they named after him and all of your heartstrings collapse and shrivel up... K, that's enough with the spoilers.Anyways, the soundtrack for this movie is so pretty.. I had to buy it on Amazon to get the CD copy. The soundtrack reminds you of the devastation of the film; the joy that comes out of an unfortunate event.The whole second hour of the film is dedicated to the bombing of Pearl Harbor. It's similar to the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan at Omaha or the sinking of the Titanic in the movie Titanic. If what you're looking for is a war movie, that's as "war" as you're going to get. You'd be better off watching Saving Private Ryan, Braveheart, We Were Soldiers, or The Patriot.Looking for a tearjerker about love and friendship, watch it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Don't See Why this Movie gets So Much Hate,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is a terrific movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.I really don't understand why this movie gets so much hate,it's a good story and despite the historical inaccuracies,I think it stays true to the events in the way that the characters behave and the drama that develops throughout.Many people complained about the love story,saying that it was unnecessary,but I completely disagree,the development of these three characters and the love and rivalry that occurs makes their story a lot more personal, it is definitely what kept me watching for the whole three hours,it was sweet,romantic and tragic,and I don't think the tragedy at the end would have been any bit as upsetting without this conflict that was shown previously.Ben Affleck,Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett all deliver great performances,they really became these characters and were living in the moment for each scene,there was great chemistry between all three,and despite some of their lines being very cheesy,they certainly didn't deserve Razzie nominations.Where the movie does fall flat is the fact that it tried to be the Titantic of war movies,I get that it was a huge movie at the time and Michael Bay was trying to make his own version of it,but trying to be like another film is never a good mind set for filmmaking and that is certainly a significant part of why many people criticized this movie.It may have a few flaws,but I still had a great time watching Pearl Harbor and certainly didn't consider it a waste of three hours,and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama or war film. Follows the lives of two best friends as they enter the war as pilots and both start to fall for the same woman. Best Performance: Kate Beckinsale</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Bay makes romantic movie and war breaks out!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Michael Bay brings to screen the grand love of two lifelong friends Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) and the nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who comes between them.... Oh! And there's a war.Michael Bay is trying to teach us all about World War II by making us sit through an uncomfortably corny melodramatic romance. Ben Affleck is doing his best Hugh Grant impression. Kate Beckinsale is her lovely British self. And Josh Hartnett is doing the matinée idol. I'm not being sarcastic. More time is spent on the romances than on any of the historical background. For a better Pearl harbor movie, try 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' One thing Michael Bay does well is action. It doesn't start well with the shaky cam fighter aerial combat. It's way too shaky. However, he does know how to create explosive CGI loveliness. The big Pearl Habor attack is very impressive. The big explosions are fun and the big action is amazing. If only Bay would cut out the first half of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie could have been great you know, it would have if they actually stopped to think before jumping into it, they could have still had the love story if only they executed well, but they didn't, they made a sappy, poorly written, boring, full of unnecessary scenes Titanic rip-off of which the only redeeming quality is the bombing scene and CGI.they wanted to make this movie feel like a film made in the 30's, that would have made the sappy writing much more decent had the film A. been black and white B. filmed and presented like an old film from the 30's and C. NOT been about a tragic event in which many lost their lives.they take liberties with history just to tug at our heart strings which doesn't work and becomes either boring or unintentionally hilarious. the dialogue is beyond unbelievable and outrageous, it tries to do what Titanic did and could have succeeded if they didn't wait a long time before living up to it's title, they failed, it massacres even the most well known or well documented history details for no apparent reason and cram the whole thing with stuff that had nothing to do with the Pearl Harbor attack like the Battle of Britain scenes.the characters are all annoying, the movie is directed with no real heart and is mostly a complete bore. the bombing scene is rather decent however, the effects are good, the camera doesn't shy away from the death and destruction that occurred, it's sad, depressing and well put together if only it wasn't ruined by the rest of the film.here's what they could have done differently, they could have TAKEN IT SERIOUSLY, made it for modern times, have the love story but make it less sappy and Hollywood-esch and make it take place at Pearl Harbor, when we see Pearl Harbor before the attack, the movie behaves as though it has no idea what's about to happen, the music is cheerful and the characters are sight seeing, as if WE don't know what's coming, and that's pretty insulting.by having the love story less sappy and in your face, it becomes less boring, more interesting, less stupid and more to the point, there's opportunity for character development, splice in a realistic relationship taking place in Pearl Harbour with the scenes of the Japanese planning the attack, the first hour would have been perfect, but no, we get a terribly written, horribly acted death march that would have pear harbour survivors vomiting from being insulted too much.if they made it like the movie United 93, then it would have been good, because movies about true stories like this attack aren't supposed to be patriotic, self righteous and careless, they should be sad, upsetting, factual, truthful, emotional, brutal and taken seriously.Titanic did it well because the love story takes place on the Titanic, imagine if there was no mention of the Titanic until the first hour, that's what this movie does, it doesn't even show why it's called Pearl Harbor for a while.I really hated this one, if you like it, great, but i personally hated it, it could have been great and should have been great, the only thing they can do now is remake it with someone who actually gives a dam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such A Tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is impossible to avoid comparisons to any "Pearl Harbor" movie (no matter what the title) to "Tora, Tora, Tora".I honestly believe that the producers of this movie had good intentions. However, they obviously had one handicap that they could never overcome.The Hollywood that produced "Tora, Tora, Tora" was a radically different Hollywood than that of today. The main difference was that, in that late sixties and early seventies, may of the people who made up the Hollywood scene were actually veterans. In other words, they understood personal sacrifice and loss.Despite the best efforts of today's Hollywood, they just don't get it.The depiction of the Japanese is two-dimensional and stereo-typical. The planner and executors of the attack on Pearl Harbor (Yakimoto, Fuchida, and Genda) were very intelligent men of honor who deserve much more that what this movie portrayed them as.The defenders of Pearl Harbor (from Admiral Kimmel down to ship's cook Doris Miller) were far more three dimensional and complex than this screenplay would have us believe.The simple fact is, that as much as the writers and producers ("Hey, we have CG effects. So, what else do we need?") may have attempted a salute to our forebears, the fact is that they have failed us (and more importantly them) in their retelling of history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "New" Pearl Harbour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "New" Pearl Harbour of 1st June 2001 is full of war propaganda and has many examples. This might be just typical of a film of this genre and an example like so many others or just relaying the events of the pearl harbor attacks. The release of this movie being about three months before the 9/11 attacks, and the 9/11 attacks being described as the "new pearl harbor", I view this movie as a propaganda machine and for those who watched it at the time being sub-consciously prepared for what was to lie ahead in September 2001 and for the patronization of American civilians. I will list some of the quotes and other relevant examples, these are my interpretations and although might be just coincidental or the nature of the movie, I think it is food for thought........The main character is called Rafe McCawley. Rafe could be an anagram for Fear and pronounced backwards sounds like the word fear.....Evelyn "What is gonna become of us?"Rafe "The future is not exactly in our hands is it"Evelyn "No, I guess you are right "The script here is telling the audience that they are not in control of their own destiny.....First scene of the Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto.....Admiral "War is inevitable. To hide this fact is death. There is only one way, a massive, sudden strike "Could be referring to 9/11 attacks in a couple of months.....Yamamoto "A smart enemy hits exactly where you think your safe"Would the world trade center and Pentagon be a safe place?....Nurse Evelyn mending petty officer Doris Millera's eye wound from a boxing match .....Evelyn "What do you get for winning?"Doris Miller "Respect"Propaganda...... join the forces and you get respect.....Yamamoto "The attack training is progressing??for the success of this operation, high-level bombing and torpedo attack training are crucial "Training had been taking place during the lead up to and on the day of the 9/11 attacks.....Yamamoto "Set up teams of radio operatives to send out messages the Americans will intercept the clutter will be more confusing that way" Disinformation and "clutter" is what the Americans have been subjected to for many years, especially with the five years leading up to 9/11.....Charles Chaplin's film The Great Dictator is showing at the cinema in a scene. During a pre-movie film, this statement was aimed at the viewers "Victory does not come without sacrifice." This is a propaganda movie within a propaganda movie. Victory for who? and could the victims of the 9/11 attacks be the sacrificed?....Scene at the British intelligence office where there is a big table with mini flags that has numbers on, this being the strategists planning board. The main numbers on the flags are 21, 53 and 36, added together gives 11/9, this being the British way of saying the date. During the same scene an officer states.... "I don't know how just two whole carrier divisions can just disappear". This statement together with the numbers could be pointing to the twin towers "disappearing" on 11/9.....Lady in red or red herring? Evelyn really stands out in her red dress, and could be pointing to the matrix movie two years earlier. ....Japanese soldier (thinking voice, first words heard in English without subtitles of Japanese speaking character) "?.I go now to fulfill my mission and destiny, I hope it is a destiny that will bring honor to our family and if it requires my life, I will sacrifice it gladly to be a good servant to our nation"He uses the word our, and therefore he his not talking just about himself and implies we should all be servants. This is the words of a suicide bomber. Viewers might begin to understand how and why a suicide bomber would kill himself for a cause, thus making it believable when "suicide bombers" attack the world trade center. ....President Franklin D. Roosevelt "I regret to tell you that over three thousand American lives have been lost. No matter how long it may take us to over come this pre-meditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory. Because of this unprovoked, dastardly attack by Japan, I ask that the congress declare a state of War."This reminds me of the rhetoric by Bush and his friends after the 9/11 attacks ....TV footage "Back home millions of American workers band together, bring factory life to avenge pearly harbor"Propaganda? ordinary us civilians need to band together to avenge the 9/11 attack, that you don't know about yet but is just around the corner.....Danny talking to his colonel pre-counter attack ....Danny "We might die doing this, we wanna know what it's for?"Colonel James Doolittle gives him some bullshit reply and then finishes on??"we're gonna believe, and we're gonna make America believe to" This is the whole point of the propaganda is it not? ....James Doolittle "There's nothing stronger than heart of a volunteer"After 9/11 more recruits for the war machine would be needed.....Rafe "What would you do colonel?"James Doolittle "I wasn't built to be a prisoner??I would dive my plane smack into the middle of it "Implying suicide bombers flying planes into targets.....Radio Tokyo "?.Watch out the enemy will get you"More fear.....This is just a small sample of examples, there are plenty more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing all the buzz, I saw this movie a month after it came out, I figured I would give it a shot. A couple of months later, I finally went to see it in the theaters, and I thought it was awesome.(Warning: Possible spoilers ahead) I'll start out with the cons: There are a few things I didn't care for in this movie. First of all, I agree with you who say that the romance was bland, etc.; but I don't really care for romance, so my opinion on that doesn't matter. Second, Ben's and all of the other twenty-something actors' acting were kind-of corny and goofy. But on the other hand, I have seen people who act like that. Not everybody in every movie has to act like they are acting. Some of my friends behave in such manners. And they are on Hawaii, where they are (or were) care-free, thinking they were away from the war. Pros: Of course, the special effects were the best part of the movie. In my opinion, they more than make up for the lame romance. I went into the theaters expecting to see some of the best shots I've ever seen, and I got what I wanted. The effects combined with the unique camera angles (following a bomb as it drops above a ship, watching a squadron of jets fly over kids playing baseball and a women drying clothes, etc.) made the attack scene one of my favorites of all time. When "Pearl Harbor" finally comes out on video, I'll probably get the DVD so I can skip to the attack on occasion, but I will be sure to watch the complete film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly underrated, but not overly spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this only a week ago I felt slightly compelled to write a review on it. Let me just say first off though, that while it was most certainly not the greatest movie ever made, it was also definitely not the worst. Pearl Harbour tries to tell us about the ordinary people who were effected by the drama that occurred on December 7, 1941. It's main characters are I guess somewhat believable. Rafe (played very badly by Ben Affleck) is a charismatic, and slightly cocky pilot who just can't wait to be a hero. Standing in his shadow is the much more insecure and more logical friend Danny (Josh Hartnett i thought played him surprisingly well), who looks up to Rafe like a younger brother looks up to his big brother. And lastly Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) who is a slightly stereotypical 1940's girl who just can never make up her mind about what to do. The plot is rather predictable, I suppose. Rafe falls for Evelyn. Rafe goes off to war and is assumed dead. Evelyn and Danny fall in love. Rafe is suddenly not dead. Danny and Rafe get at it over Evelyn. Pearl Harbour is bombed. Evelyn picks Danny over Rafe. And then we all know what happens in the end... Although the romance was a bit Jerry Springer, and there was absolutely no chemistry between Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale, Pearl Harbour manages to keep you interested in the characters and what their fate will be.Positives: - Hartnett and Beckinsale both provide relatively good performances - special effects were extremely breathtaking in the bombing scene - Jon Voight is the highlight of the film as Franklin D Roosevelt (best scene in the movie) - battle scenes are very well developed - supporting actors were just as good as the main actors, providing a bit more interest to the "ordinary" people of Pearl HarbourNegatives: - once again, Ben Affleck was not at all talented in this movie, his acting was very wooden - cheesy script ( way too many cheesy romance lines to count) - Alec Baldwin as a "hero"? eugh - historically inaccurate- not enough of Cuba Gooding Jr.- my main problem is the ending. It was an absolutely awful one in my opinion. To be honest, it wasn't the greatest movie ever, I watched it, it was worth the 4 dollar rental and I did cry a bit at the end. I think the main thing people can debate is who the love of her life was... Rafe or Danny? My vote will always be on Danny. I mean, the parachute scene? =) Anyways, 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I like certain aspects of this movie, it left me longing for Tora Tora Tora. Ben Afleck is a pretty boy and must make the feminine hearts throb, he isn't much of an actor. The acting overall was acceptable and the story was to if one could ignore the dumb romance plot. The absolutely worst part of this movie is the Dolittle Raid. It was totally unbelievable that two single engine fighter pilots would be chosen to fly twin engine bombers a few months after Pearl Harbor. Not only was this sequence unbelievable, it is unnecessary and anti-climatic. What idiot decided to add this to a movie. On the plus side, the attack sequences were quite good and seemed very realistic. The exception to this are the low level fighter scenes created by computer graphics. (The aircraft are flying much faster than they are actually capable of and seems to be an attempt to mimic the Star Wars land speeders on the forest moon.) Also in the plus column is the way the movie is split on the 2 DVD set. It ends with the aftermath of the attack where it should have. The DVD set also includes two documentaries that I found to be more interesting than the movie itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor isn't just another film about love or war; it is an absolute epic which fuses the extremes of both. Given that half of any unsophisticated cinema audience wants to blub over love while the other half drools over death - such a film is only going to satisfy half of the people, half of the time. Director Michael Bay most definitely deserves a Silver Star for trying to pull it off.Let's get one thing straight, the love story is exactly that - a story - and it's not the strongest. However, certain predictable elements (like supposed and impending deaths of central characters) can be forgiven because the tale is so beautifully told. Anybody expecting factual coverage of a historic event is going to be sorely disappointed; although clearly there is a certain amount of accuracy in the portrayal of the horror of December 7th 1941.During the eighty minute build-up to the climatic event, the viewer is slowly immersed into the reality of war when Rafe goes off to England to help fight the Germans. Original amateur cinecamera footage is cleverly blended into produced scenes to keep a sense of history about the film and the dogfighting over the white cliffs of Dover is nothing short of spectacular.When that fateful 'day of infamy' arrives, the breathtaking effects employed could easily have a chronic asthmatic gasping for his inhaler. Never before have I seen - not only visual effects of such a high standard - but such outstanding choreography &amp; cinematography gelling it all together. To see the Pacific dawn as the backdrop for such abhorrent, turbulent and grisly scenes is to witness the amalgamation of beauty and terror. A torpedo speeding beneath the immersed bodies of hundreds of soldiers - alive and dead - is as much a triumph for photography as it is an impartation of the horror of war. And who can forget the planes girating and twirling through the air with such coordination - in order to destroy their rivals with nothing but style, cunning and artistic grace?Whoever thought such a violent event could be rendered so beautifully? Pearl Harbor is quite simply, wartime ballet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a new release, the DVD had a pretty reasonable price, but I wanted to find out more about the movie before spending my money. I had really hoped for a movie on the level of say Saving Private Ryan, as the movie trailers led me to believe, but I now understand that this is not such a film. There are a lot of reviews, here, but none of them really gave what I consider to be an intelligent or convincing argument as to whether this IS or IS NOT worth viewing. Perhaps the following will be of some help to others who, like myself, want to make an informed decision before watching or purchasing this film. In the margin to the left, click on External Reviews, then click on Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times for an insightful review on this film.

		<shortDescription>How hollywood shows history (Minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen the movie Pearl Harbor since it first came out in theaters back in May. But after a recent experience, I could not help myself from writing a review.Recently, in my history class, we were discussing about how Hollywood changes events in history to make movies more entertaining and commercial. One person brought up Pearl Harbor, asking if Hollywood messed up the history or not. If I weren't so in control of myself, I would have gone off on that person! I asked him that why should an important and violent event such as the bombing be toned down for a PG-13 rating and why we pay to see a three-hour love story that should have been a war movie. Being in a classroom full of MTV Generation morons who wouldn't know good movie making if it smacked them in the face, I was told by several people to shut up. But whose has the last laugh.Pearl Harbor, admittedly, is entertaining. But should this awful event in our history be turned into a duel by the visual effects artists for the explosions? Considering the time period this movie was made in and the filmmaking techniques available today, this could have been as realistic and brutal as Saving Private Ryan. Also, since it was unrealistic towards the attack, it defeated another purpose of the producers; to encourage young people to study more about the attack. If that student in my class had read a book on the attack, he might not have asked if the movie was unrealistic. He would have already known.There are several other problems with the movie. One of the big ones is the reasons why Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. In the movie, the only reason given was that the U.S cut off fuel supplies and trade. Japan decided to show the U.S not to mess with them. If one were to study up on the attack, they would realize that Japan was invading islands and lands in the pacific. Thus, the fuel that the U.S was providing would have been used for the wrong purposes. The Japanese, who launched the air strike and thus brought the United States into war don't even have a big role in the movie. Even the title place of the movie doesn't have a big part, being only the mere backdrop for two young lovers.One might call me a hypocrite, for I trash a movie like Pearl Harbor for lack of combat accuracy and praise something like The Longest Day, which has some inaccuracies in its view of the D-Day landings. But one also has to know that these movies were made in two different time periods: The Longest Day came out in 1962, a time when censors had more control over film content and thus wouldn't permit Longest Day's producers to show a bloody D-Day landing (This was also the era of the war epic). Pearl Harbor, however, has been released in a time of more leant censors and could have been the definitive movie of December 7, 1941. Instead, it was only made as the ultimate M.M.M (MoneyMaking Machine). When will Hollywood learn to stop cashing in on the dead?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailers for this movie I thought it was probably going to be great. It looked like a Saving Private Ryan level movie about Pearl Harbor rather than the Normandy invasion. Boy was I wrong. In a 3 hour movie we have about 40 minutes dealing with the attack. O.K. I wasn't expecting one long battle scene but the actual battle is the only part that has ANYTHING to do with the attack at all. Except for the American attack at the end, the rest of the movie is just a love story/romance novel. Simply as a movie it really wasn't bad at all. The problem is that if you title your movie "Pearl Harbor" you might want to actually deal with Pearl Harbor. This movie was merely SET in Pearl Harbor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT The previews I repeatedly saw in the movie theatre for Pearl Harbor made me really want to see it. It has an ensemble cast (Affleck, Beckinsale, Hartnett, Voight, Sizemore, Gooding, Akroyd, Baldwin). However, as I watched the movie, I couldn't understand it. I didn't like it the way I thought I would. The story, at times, seems to make no sense and is at times, rather disturbing to me. For instance, the whole love triangle. Most of it makes sense but the outcome doesn't (guy meets girl, guy ships off, guy "dies", girl mourns, guys best friend mourns, friend and girl mourn together, friend and girl sleep together, guy comes back from the dead, gets mad at friend and girl for being pregnant with friends baby, friend and guy go on mission together, friend dies, guy mourns, girl mourns, guy and girl get together again, guy and girl name baby after deceased friend). The acting wasn't as good as I thought it would be. At times, it was mediocre (like Baldwin, as always, overacting). Yet, the cinematography was excellent and the relationship between Affleck and Hartnett from childhood to adulthood is touching and is cleverly woven throughout the story. Also, the movie, to me, didn't provoke a great feeling. It didn't make me feel anything for any of the characters. I didn't laugh or cry or think. That's what great make movies make you do. They are so great that they can make shivers go down your spine. Pearl Harbor failed, in that aspect.</fullReview>

Cause the way i learned it in school was that they got slaughtered during that battle and it wasn't till WAY later that the Americans and they allies won!? Well i don't know, maybe I have it wrong.

This is certainly not a great movie, although there was some solid acting and an amazing 40 minute battle scene that made me feel both sad and patriotic. But the majority of the movie is a love triangle between the three leads, and I only found myself only slightly interested in it. In TITANIC (9/10), I found myself almost in tears during the sad parts because I cared about the main characters. In PEARL HARBOR, I didn't care about them as much, (I didn't MIND them, but I didn't care much about them) and so during the sad parts I was mostly bored.I blame this not on the actors, but on the screenplay. I know Randall Wallace, who wrote for us the brilliant BRAVEHEART (10/10), is capable of better. Most of the dialogue is unsatisfying, and some is laughable. As I mentioned earlier, I feel the acting was one of the PEARL HARBOR's best qualities. This was the first time I was impressed by Ben Affleck as an actor. This was also the first time I had the pleasure of watching Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale, both of whom I can't wait to see more of in the future. I also enjoyed the (brief) performances of Cuba Gooding Jr, Mako, Tom Sizemore and especially Jon Voight as President FDR. Jon Voight stole the show for me, especially in the scene in which he stood up from his wheelchair in order to demonstrate to his associates that nothing is impossible.The battle scene was incredible. So incredible, in fact, that it's enough for me to call this movie recommendable. Maybe because there was no (bad) dialogue to ruin it, but I felt the sadness I was supposed to feel for the victims while being impressed with the overall coolness of it at the same time. I never felt the kind of emotion during the romance of the movie as I did during the attack scene. I was speechless during this part of the movie, which is exactly how I felt during TITANIC, and the exact feeling any film-maker could hope for or movie-goer could wish for.The redeeming qualities of this movie is enough for me to give a thumbs up. I just might buy this movie just so I can watch those redeeming qualities, and rewind through the rest of it.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not see Pearl Harbor in the theater, just on home video. I was expecting the worst and that is exactly what I got. The hokey dialog is the worst that I have ever seen in a movie. They should have spent the first 90 minutes on the Japanese preparation of the attack instead of what they spent it on. I personally will now skip any movie that Randall Wallace has writing credits for in the future.I enjoyed the music soundtrack of the movie. That is the only good thing that I could say about this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>yes it may have good special effects. yes it may have some popular actors. but for non-american viewers this film is far too patriotic without hardly any historical evidence. what's sad is that because it comes from Hollywood, everyone without much knowledge of history thinks that it is "based on true story." having studied history myself, i feel that the Japanese in the film are depicted in a more barbaric way than they should be, and many other things (like the president standing up) is just put in to make it arouse more patriotism. (it's even in school textbooks that he might have known about the japanese attack.)as a typical "summertime movie aiming for box-office records", i say it's okay (although the storyline was poor and shooting scenes too monotonous). but people making the film should be aware of how much misunderstandings or biases can come out from a movie. especially war movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Bay should not have directed this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin my comments on Pearl Harbor by saying this could have been a good movie if it weren't for Michael Bay. Now I have nothing against Michael Bay. I believe he is capable of directing fun, excitingly big stupid movies. But should a film detailing an infamous attack where thousands of Americans be big and stupid. No. Bay is just not the type of director that should be directing an epic picture of this scale. In my opinion Pearl Harbor could have been much more. There are scenes here that in a better directors hands could have been staged differently and perhaps more succesfully. A better director might have eliminated the cliche riddled plot, and axed the mundane storyline. He might have hired better actors or at least helped the ones he had into crafting a skilled performance. As I see it a movie detailing the attack on Pearl Harbor all the way up to the famous raid by General James Dolittle would be a very interesting movie indeed. But the problem lies with Bay and him alone. Its the way he directs. Scenes are too short that should be long. There isn't enough time to flesh out characters that are interesting, and with the fact that the three you have are about as interesting as a fly on a windowsill, thats a bad thing. Even the Japanese should be more insulted by this tripe since they are shown to be bloodthirsty war mongers who only wish to attack America so they can continue raiding China unabated. The only interesting character I found in the movie was a dog aboard one of the destroyers. This movie feels more like a three hour music video instead of an epic the size of The Longest Day, or The Godfather. If you should even be interested in the least of seeing this, be smart and do like I did; rent the DVD. That way you can at least skip to the battle scene (the only thing Bay seems able to do right) The only qualm I had with this is one bad special effects shot that shows planes that look the size of model air planes zooming by the sinking ships, and the fact that the overall feel of the scene made it feel like Independence Day, which dosen't really show any respect for an event of this magnitude.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Banal and unimaginative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason to see this movie is the battle scene toward the end, but in contrast to the scenes at the beginning of "Saving Private Ryan," it is not complemented by the rest of the film. After a not-so-bad start, the screenplay of Pearl Harbor degenerates into the insipid and uninteresting. Altho the acting, while not great, is not terrible either, it does not matter. There is very little character development, especially of the women, and of course, none of the Japanese (contrast this to the great film "Tora Tora Tora"). The cinematography shows some good sunsets, but overall loses the backdrop in favor of unneeded continual close-ups of the characters. Very little of Honolulu and inadequate as to other surroundings --"Tora" was also much better here.From everything to lines like "I just want to matter," to the insipid love lines, to the reappearance of Rafe after the fall in the sea, Pearl Harbor exudes banality and triteness, hackneyed and clicheish lines, and predictability. A further downside is achieved by including the Doolittle Raid (suddenly, fighter pilots are bomber pilots)--is not Pearl Harbor enough of an event in itself, with the focus partially lost by the filmmakers' need for a cheap vindictive counterraid? Is not the implied result of the sneak attack on America enough? And how many total unentertaining minutes does that give this turgid film?As one who sometimes thinks the critics are unfair, for various reasons (including self-aggrandizement) in trashing movies, this time they certainly were on target. A blockbuster disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If the Doolittle Raid, why not Hiroshima?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(This contains no spoilers about the love story. I'm assuming, though, that most viewers know some of the historical events). Mixed feelings about this movie. A terrible and memorable time in US history. Terrific special effects, beautiful photography, gripping and hair-raising attack and piloting scenes. Could have been much tauter and more cerebral, had the film not bloated itself on the love story in its attempts to combine The Titanic with Saving Private Ryan. The graft diminished it. It didn't have the cleverness of Titanic, and Saving Private Ryan is a far better film; for one thing, it did not condescend to the audience by trying to sanitize the violence and grisly mayhem that is war--as Pearl Harbor does. Compare the harrowing opening forty minutes of SPR to the forty minutes of PH's attack scene. Impressive explosions, people scrambling around on sinking ships, just like the Titanic; but few if any severed hands, no faces blown open. No blood in the water even. That's because SPR's main point is that war sucks, and PH's main point, God bless it, is that America emerged victorious. One of the best lines in PH is the one given to Yamamoto: "A brilliant commander would have tried not to go to war in the first place." Straight out of Sun Tzu. The movie was too long. You've got the two best friends, you've got love story, you've got the Japanese strategies, you've got the love story, you've got the tension in Washington, you've got the love story, you've got the attack, you've got the love story, and then you get the Doolittle Raid and the love story... if you've come this far why not make some reference, SOME reference, God help us, to how America ended the war with the Japanese? But that wasn't heroic. And I guess it wasn't Pearl Harbor, either. Just think of Jacques Aumont, film theorist in _Esthestique du film_: cinema shows "the recorded shadows of objects that are themselves absent. In effect, the cinema has the power to 'make absent' that which it shows." Spot on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie STINKS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is garbage, genuine trash, but not the kind of trash that previous Bruckheimer blockbusters like The Rock and Con Air were. They were at least quite fun, but this is just trash as in complete rubbish. Bruckheimer movies are usually passably entertaining, but their non-existent characterisation, terrible dialogue and tacky storylines didn't really become overwhelmingly apparent until you watched them on video, for the movies themselves were so fast that you didn't really notice. With Pearl Harbor you do notice, because Michael Bay, actually believes that he can handle drama, and slows the &gt;pace to fit this drama in. He cannot. Bad Boys and The Rock were fun because they were mostly tongue in cheek and action-based. Armageddon was pitiful because there was a worryingly major amount of sentiment, and all of a sudden you realised that Bay was actually trying to make us care about the characters, which is all very well if you're actually good at that sort of thing, but Bay isn't. (SPOILER ALERT FOR ARMAGEDDON)When Bruce Willis died at the end of Armageddon it was funny! That can't be right. Still, at least that film was ten percent good (the start, any action sequence), but there are literally no redeeming features in Pearl Harbor. The fact that it is historically inaccurate didn't bother me that much, for there were far more obvious flaws apparent to make me care about that.REASONS WHY PEARL HARBOR STINKS!!!1. Pearl Harbor is COLD. As in totally dead. There is literally no emotional involvement, except for that of boredom and suicide contemplation. It's characters are so unrealistic and corny that you're hoping the whole film is a parody, but it's not. Are we actually supposed to care what happens to these "people"? Obviously. Why would Bay devote an agonisingly long amount of screen time about their laughably pathetic romance?2. The script is awful. But it's not even bad enough to be unintentionally funny. It's just boring.3. The action stinks. Everyone's going on about how good the actual Pearl harbor attack sequence was. It was rubbish! The shot following the missile was so ridiculous that it belonged in the hilarious excesses of Con Air, not this nonsense! I felt no fear for the characters under attack because they weren't characters, which made the attack (I heard it was bordering on the terrifying when it happened in real life, just a rumour)completely ineffective. I was so bored with the first hour or so of terrible cinema that this spectacular but completely uninvolving sequence was too little and too, too late.4. The song at the end. Makes Celine Dion sound incredible.5. The overworked camera movements. Notice how the camera moves for no reason in all Bruckheimer travesties. It doesn't add ANYTHING. Bay's just desperately trying to look cool. He fails.6. Too long. Top Gun is the best Bruckheimer film becasue it's under two hours long and doesn't outstay its welcome. Top Gun is still rubbish, but at least it isn't boring. Pearl harbor is THREE hours long. Every 180 minutes a total waste of my time.All in all, Pearl Harbor is the worst blockbuster i have ever seen along with Wild Wild West. The thing is is that i have actually contributed money towards this terrible film and I am, in the filmmakers' eyes, no different from someone who paid the same amount of money as me to see it yet enjoyed it. I am therefore no longer seeing rubbish blockbuster films simply for the sake that they are the biggest films of the year. You see other films this year like Almost Famous, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and realise that films can be good, and that's a relief, for I become very cynical with the state of current cinema after watching this. What has happened to blockbusters? They were always just entertainment (with the Indiana Jones films and Ghostbusters being golden examples), but now they're not even entertaining. I was never expecting Pearl Harbor to be profound, or a masterpiece. All i wanted was to be entertained yet not insulted for a couple of hours (or if you insist, THREE hours). You did not entertain. You definitely did INSULT. Of all the blockbusters coming soon, i will only watch AI and Planet of the Apes because they have good directors behind them who can make entertainment. As for Tomb Raider and Jurassic Park III, not a chance. They won't be as bad as Pearl Harbor, but they'll come close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When watching Pearl Harbor you slowly begin to realize that Michael Bay's intention is not to make a great, historical picture, not to make an entertaining action-drama, but just to make a 180+ minute movie because that's exactly what Titanic did too, you know.The difference with Titanic, however, is that Pearl Harbor doesn't have enough material to fill those epic 180 minutes and therefore the audience has to endure the crap Randall Wallace made up to reach the 180 min. mark. And what does the audience get in return??? Pain. Not just the pain in the ass from sitting down so long, but the pain of watching the crap thrown at us by Randall Wallace and Michael Bay. They recycle concepts and exact scenes from movies like Titanic, Saving Private Ryan and even Top Gun, and the result is a mess of a movie that's never as romantic as it wants to be, or as dramatic as it ought to be.I'm not saying Pearl Harbor is an awful movie, but it's definitely bad, especially towards the end when Bay doesn't have a clue how to end his movie. Maybe kill of one of the key cast members??? Maybe a secret mission to compensate for Pearl Harbor??? He should have considered to end it with Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but that would be too historically correct, and America wouldn't look good.(4/10)</fullReview>

Forever. ...the love story wasn't so shallow. So Rafe is lost and believed dead, but -surprise!- turns up again. ...Ben Affleck's character was more sympathetic to the audience. This guy keeps moaning and groaning about his best friend stealing his girl while he was dead. Anyone can understand the Danny-character, this Rafe is a sad guy. He was dead! What would you, witnessing audience, have done?! ...they hadn't divided it so clearly into pre-bombing, bombing and after-bombing. Now everyone is waiting for the first part to be over and get to the action, and after the action everybody's bored again. Some people actually left after two hours. ...the scenes where you're supposed to cry, make you cry. Now we have some violins by Hans Zimmer pretending to orchestrate Titanic, but no tears. It's way too theatrical. See also: shallow love story. ...someone could explain to me what Cuba Gooding jr. is doing here. His storyline has nothing to do with the major plotline of the film: the shallow love story. And why does he always play these 'I-am-a-true-and-honest-fighter-for-the-good-cause-which-is-banning-racism'- character? He did the same trick in Men of Honor and it didn't work there too. ...if only there wasn't so much American chauvinism in this film. You (they) pulled the trick with Men of Honor and I could barely live through it, but why here again? This is an international released film, and why do we foreigners always have to see what a brave men and women those Americans are? ...the American flag wasn't shown so obviously waving in slow-motion in the wind. We all look what it looks like... ...the woman's voice didn't lecture me afterwards. I am seeing a film to be entertained, not to have a lesson in death counts and explanations of how America got into WW II. ...if only director Bay had taken more care about the acting of some figures. Kate Beckinsale runs to the hospital whilst avoiding bombs and bullets, and all with a look of extreme boredom on her face. Some major player has a piece of metal sticking out of his neck at the end, but still he moves his head up and down and sideways. That must really hurt... ...if only some sequences didn't look very similar to Titanic (see also music). Picking dead bodies out of the water and dozens of terrified people hanging from everything they can grab. And -oh- how original, this boat doesn't go down vertically, but it capsizes! Same effect and screaming people, but now featuring the full length of the ship! ...if only FDR and the Dolittle figure hadn't been such parodies of themselves. How brave and courageous, how strong and faithfull are these men! FDR shouldn't have been president, but Pope instead! Dolittle could then tackle business at the White House, adressing everyone to do the best they can because their country demands it.but really. Apart from all this, the special effects and the airplane and flying sequences are pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action bogged down by a sappy, banal love story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon exiting the theater after "Pearl Harbor," I was set upon by a man who referred to the American officials portrayed in the film as "bumbling idiots." It's a good thing he said "Americans," because he easily could've been speaking about Rafe, Danny and Evelyn, the trio involved in a love triangle plot that is one of the movie's pitfalls. The sequence of the attack itself is magnificent, but is bookended by the development of the sappy love story and the American attack on Japan. It's not a good sign when, forty minutes into the movie, you find yourself favoring the trailer over the actual movie.Beginning a movie with character development is a good thing, but only if you know how to iron it out. The film opens in Tennessee, with childhood friends Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) playing pilots in a barn. Moving along a couple of years, they are pilots in the United States armed forces, and like most pilots do, they spend their leave chasing nurses, who are just as man-hungry as the cadets.To make a long and tedious story short, Rafe meets Evelyn, falls in love with her, and is called away to duty in Britain. Circumstances intervene, and Rafe returns to find that Danny and Evelyn are now lovers, casting the whole relationship into strife just in time for the bombing of Pearl Harbor by Japanese air forces.The movie tries unsuccessfully to balance the love story with historical facts and events. Every now and then, we leave their happy lives together to venture to the United States War Department, where Captain Thurman (Dan Aykroyd) and President Roosevelt serve little purpose except to foreshadow the impending attack that we already know is imminent (the title, duh!). We're also given a dosage of Japanese movements, from their planning of the bombing to Japanese naval craft and planes making their way to Hawaii. If we had more of this kind of material, the movie just might work.But instead, it loses focus from the real story behind Pearl Harbor, settling for the love story in hopes of bringing out some sort of human drama to bring out our emotions for the tragedy as a whole. This brings out the ever-present "Titanic" machinations, as it also included fiction with history. Now, I cannot begin to criticize the historical aspect of the film; I know too little about the whole sequence of events to make a comparison. But what I can tell you is that "Titanic" was able to provide us with likeable, involving characters amidst a very accurate historical setting.For some reason, the same formula applied here fails. We can't really care for Evelyn, Danny and Rafe because of the story they are given. There's toomany romance clichés which bury the characters in a mess of break-ups and budding romance similar to the switches that an everyday, stereotypical teenage girl would make. Maybe that's an audience-targeting tactic, or just an honest mistake. Either way, the love story does nothing but add on the baggage, filling the cracks with sappy one-liners and unconvincing dialogue.And the movie's turn of events after the actual bombing itself is ludicrous and draggy. It makes Rafe and Danny out to be heroes known among all, hoping to instill some air of patriotism alongside flag wavers and cheers from the men in the water as they successfully down two Japanese fighter planes. Soon after, they must leave on a mission to Tokyo, where they set out to perform a counterstrike against the Japanese. At one point, one of the characters (I think it was Doolittle, played by Alec Baldwin), makes the statement that the mission is "to avenge Pearl Harbor." Obviously an attempt to connect this action with the previous sequences, but no such luck. It goes on for too long, and wouldn't you know it, there has to be more of the love story involved as well.Which brings me to my discussion of the actual attack portion of the movie. This is the section to see, if you are willing to stick it out until then. The intensity really does reach a high note as the planes begin descending on Hawaii, and although we know what will happen, it's quite exciting and moving to watch it all unfold onscreen. The bombing of the ships does not happen too fast, but gets it just right by taking its time in showing us the panic in and out of the ships in the bay. Another high point is the events that take place in the hospital ward, where thousands of wounded soldiers begins appearing. The movie does well with this entire sequence, not only because of some spectacular special effects, but because the love story characters are left alone to perform their real duties, leaving behind the sap and giving us a real taste of human drama.In summation, "Pearl Harbor" does not live up to the hype surrounding it. The human drama and excitement of the attack on American forces is drowned by the love story, which never reaches a level of reality, while the ending flatlines completely. I had many questions at the end of the movie: is this really the work of Randall Wallace, who also wrote the magnificent "Braveheart?" Do the filmmakers think that by ignoring the actual focus of the story, it will become more involving? I have one thing to say about the movie: the trailer is better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is definitely not what I wanted or expected. Instead of being a movie that was the total favorite for the best picture Oscar next year, we get one of the worst films of the year. The attack scene is fine, no question. But the love story is flat out BORING. I am going to compare this movie to Titanic, because it's like Titanic (Only Titanic was MUCH better.) Titanic at least has an interesting love story and great chemistry between Dicaprio and Winslet. Pearl Harbor has Affleck, Hartnett, and Beckinsale in this love triangle that leaves a viewer totally unsatisfied. The love story is intense in Titanic. The love triangle in Pearl Harbor is sleep inducing. The really unfortunate thing about this movie is that it had great potential, I thought, and decided not to use it. It would have been in much better hands with a director like James Cameron. Alot of characters are wasted in this movie, because they don't need to be there. As much as I like Cuba Gooding Jr., he is just wasted in this movie, along with Dan Aykroyd, and Alec Baldwin. The length of this movie totally turned me off. It's a three hour movie that would have been alot better if it were two hours. Some historical accuracies left me unsatisfied, especially not getting FDR's December 7, 1941 speech right. There are only two really good things in this movie. The attack scene (visually stunning), and Voight's performance as FDR. Although the speech wasn't correct, Voight sounded just like FDR. Instead of being a best picture contender, all it's going to contend for is best sound and stuff like that, hopefully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a European I saw Pearl Harbor, and after three of the most boring movie hours of my life I wondered if in Hollywood they realize that also non-Americans go to the cinema.This is another Patriotic load of crap. It has got an uninteresting love triangle, bad acting and some (ok) nice special effects.This was going to be the Blockbuster of the year??? Those crazy Americans. Do they really believe that the audience would love this crap? I heard that Disney expected it to beat Titanic. They are so arrogant over there. How long did it last as the no.1 movie? ...A week? and rightfully so.As an audience you do not feel compelled with any of the characters. In fact you don't care if they live or die. And (in opposite of Titanic) you certainly don't want to see it once again. It's much too long and boring to go through it once more. In an effort to make a new Titanic they forgot that the strength of that movie was the emotional binding with the characters together with the great visual spectacle. That same thing made Gladiator a big hit (or did you think that it was the sight of the digitally built arena that did it for this movie?). No, this one (Pearl Harbor)just has some great effects and that's it. But maybe that the Americans think differently about it. They are in fact very patriotic (when I saw "the Shadow" in the states in '94, there is a line in that movie where Baldwin as the Shadow says to his opponent something like: "Hey watch it, that's the US of A your talking about" Every proud American soul in the theater started to clap their hands and cheer, I think that says enough) but then again, maybe it's even too much for them to handle.However as a European I could not appreciate this long movie. Bad acting and no story made it give me a 1 out of 10. Sorry but in my eyes it didn't deserve any more.</fullReview>

Yes, the same we took during the shooting of that Coca Cola commecial" You've got it?Especially during other scenes this trademark was very frustrating. Now a few words about the editing. Four editors worked at this film. Sometimes it's so fast you can't recognize it. Thumbs down! In this review I don't want to talk about the story,the persons. All what you've heard, it' true.

Clocking in at a feels-like-every-minute-of-it 3 hours and 3 minutes long, Pearl Harbor starts off at a leisurely pace and then gets slower as it introduces two kids from farm country dreaming of flying fighter planes. They filch Dad's crop duster, and the dream becomes a real ambition. Flash forward to 1940, and viola!, the two corn-fed flyboys, Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) are student fighter pilots on the same squadron. How lucky is that?Rafe falls hard in love at first sight with an army nurse, Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), who is coolly pretty, but about as exciting and sexy as a dress form. Before long Rafe volunteers to go out and fight the good fight, leaving his love behind (she seems surprised... she's the only one who didn't see that one coming). When Rafe is lost on a dangerous mission over Britain and presumed dead when his Spitfire plunges into the English Channel, I didn't miss him. But, I knew he'd be back (after all, Affleck's name is above the title). It's completely predictable when Danny, the concerned, grieving boyhood pal, believing his buddy is in a watery grave, takes the despairing Evelyn under his wing... and under the covers. Of course, Rafe does turn up in Hawaii just in the nick of time for the attack on Pearl Harbor. All that kept him alive as he recuperated was the sweet face and true heart of his girl back home, he says (I wonder if he was rubbing his thumb and forefinger together -- playing the world's smallest violin -- as he delivered that corny dialog). When he finds out about the betrayal he's spitting mad at first, but seeing as this is a buddy war flick, Rafe and Danny kiss and make up... Evelyn keeps kissing them both.Sappy cliches abound as Rockwell-era Americans look helplessly into the bomber-infested heavens above, and a black mess attendant (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), in the midst of the death, destruction and falling debris, cradles his white commander and tells him everything is going to be okay as the higher-up expires in his arms. The good die young here, and the Japanese attackers are little more than cardboard cutouts (the marvelous Mako, who portrays Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto is believable but sadly allowed only to be one-dimensional).Actually, I only have a few minor complaints about Pearl Harbor: the writing, the casting, the cinematography and the direction. Other than that, it's a fine film. Seriously, Michael Bay, whose films I usually enjoy, does not seem to concern himself with the actual directing here: Ben Affleck is playing Ben Affleck; every bit of dialog Josh Harnett has is delivered with fierce, furious intensity for no apparent reason; Cuba Gooding Jr. looks like he'd be much more comfortable doing back-flips and shouting, "Show me the money!" (show us the money, indeed: the attack scenes are cool, but are they worth $180 million?); and Kate Beckinsdale's flavor is about as bland as a tongue-depressor. Alec Baldwin was well-cast as Jimmy Doolittle, but he takes the waving flag, Mom, and apple-pie patriotism thing just a tad too far. If John Voight was directing himself as well, kudos to him: he's the only one who can truly be proud of his Pearl Harbor performance. As President Roosevelt, he practically disappears into the historical character, putting a real, three-dimensional and believable person up there on the screen for us to enjoy.The cinematography, by John Schwartzman, has its moments (particularly early on, in the train station), but those moments become eternities as he goes back to his shallow, limited bag of tricks again and again: how much steam can there actually be rising off of every paved street? Does he know any other way to shoot a close up that isn't decapitatingly extreme and claustrophobic? Most unforgivable is the footage shot inside the chaotic base hospital, moments after Pearl Harbor is bombed.Like Grandma's home movies, the camera shakes and shimmies so hard ones fears it might fall apart. Almost as annoying is the inexplicable blurring. This is a feature film, not an amateur docudrama. What does work, and work exceptionally well, is the attack scenes. The Kate dive-bombers soaring, and downward-spiraling birds-eye views of bombs shattering ships are awesome; but Industrial Light &amp; Magic had more to do with that eye candy than Schwartzman did.When it comes to writing a script based on romance and tragedy, one must be careful to strike a believable balance. James Cameron accomplished that with Titanic. Randall Wallace does not achieve it with Pearl Harbor. Everyone knows what happened at Pearl Harbor in 1941. The film's reenactment of the attack on Pearl Harbor is spellbinding and edge-of-your-seat exciting (if a bit too long). There is no doubt Bay knows how to convey chaos fraught with fear and flair. It's an awesome visual assault but is it worth sitting through the first hour and a half for what we already know is coming? Unlike Titanic (everyone knew the ship was going to ram that iceberg and people would perish), Pearl Harbor (everyone knows the ships are gonna get bombed and people will perish) doesn't have a love story that compels us to care.Pearl Harbor is no gem. I want my "I survived Pearl Harbor (the movie)" tee-shirt!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pear Harbor is Starship Troopers without the irony, wit and intelligence. It has the same plot as Troopers; the same mindless gung ho (it's remarkable that America, which panics these days at the thought of just one US bodybag, should produce a film extolling the merits of sacrifice); and the same homoerotic, fascist aesthetic - Leni Riefenstahl meets Norman Rockwell. Perhaps this was the screenwriter's little joke - pretend to write a serious film about war and then smuggle through a camp satire of American self-delusion, patriotism and political correctness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This confirms it. Hollywood is run by idiots. I can't believe they wasted so much money on such an awful story. Granted, this film did have it's emotional moments and I did get choked up a few times, but it was when the film focused on the real events and the real people caught up in it. It was never during the lame, blandly acted love triangle. Who approved this love triangle story? And three hours of it? Example &amp; semi-SPOILER: the movie hit rock bottom right after the bombing, after we've witnessed an unbelievable - and true - horror story. Ben and Josh show up in the hospital - full of dying men - and Ben gets all cranky because his feelings were hurt. Are we really supposed to care about what happens to this flat love triangle after we've witnessed such real life carnage? And since everything is shot so picture perfect (aka antiseptic), these characters never become real. They look like models in a detergent commercial. Another low was the second half of the attack sequence, when the movie goes Star Wars and Ben and Josh become superhero flyboys ("Yee-haw! I got me one!") I won't even get into the shots that were ripped right out of Titanic. They even threw in the Queen Mary, and ruined the scene with some corn ball hijinx. I could go on, but life is too short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>spectacular action, mediocre melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Randall Wallace (Braveheart) was commissioned to write this script, they must have made him sit through at least five screenings of Titanic. They wanted a Titanic success and the best way to do that would be to recreate Titanic. but in a different context. They reviewed Titanic's salient story points:· A three-hour long movie with. · a glamorous look and evoked a period feel that had... · a love triangle leading up to. · a terrible, massive disaster will occur that the audience knows is coming because this is based on a historic event well-known to American audiences during which time. · Sympathetic main characters (e.g. Dicaprio) are allowed to die.Then they started casting about for a scenario that could include the love triangle, and have a story in which it was obvious to all what would happen because it was historical fact. When you add in the Bruckheimer/Bay requirements for explosions and bullets whizzing by, the answer has to be a war film, specifically about a famous battle with historical resonance. They settled on the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, a salient event in American history. In addition to providing the requisite characteristics of a well-known story of an epic disaster, the Hawaiian vistas would provide a glamorous backdrop. They turned the screenwriter loose, got a heck of a lot of change out of Disney (even while cutting their own fees to stay in budget), shook well, stirred once or twice, added a Maraschino cherry, and have served it in a massive marketing campaign and over 3,000 screens for its American debut.The High PointsThe Pearl Harbor battle scene is first class spectacle. The battle scene runs 40 minutes, which are almost flawless from a technical standpoint. Mr. Bay has enormous ability at creating exciting carnage, and given a task force of five Japanese aircraft carriers, 300 attacking aircraft, and an entire naval base to destroy, he has done a remarkable job. This is one battle scene meant to be seen on a big screen. If you don't see it in a theater and wait for video, you will be missing some outstanding images. Almost all of the battle scenes, including the earlier ones at the Battle of Britain, are done remarkably well. They might have spent $140 million on this film, but they left all of it on the screen. The scale of the attack is evident and its details are incredibly well done.The Middling PointsIn spite of following of Titanic's formula, the ability to create interesting characters and emotional interest is not something that can be done in an FX studio. Although the actors are not incapable, there is no Oscar-worthy performance here to draw the audience in. Kate Beckinsale is the female love interest, an American nurse who first falls in love with Rafe (Ben Affleck as a square-jawed good ol' boy) and then Danny (Josh Hartnett) after Rafe is (seemingly) killed fighting the Nazis over Britain. She is winsome and pretty, but this is not Kate Hudson. Affleck's Rafe is earnest, but Affleck always seems to be Affleck, just with some different words in his mouth. Hartnett is quiet and sincere, and probably turns in the most grounded performance of the three main characters. None of them are served particularly well by the script, which distances the audience from the characters by putting them in situations where they are in danger of dying of corn poisoning. Cases in point include Affleck's meet-cute with Beckinsale's nurse, where he pretends to be another soldier so he can keep getting shots from her until he keels over, and the scene where Beckinsale regales her boy-crazy nurse colleagues of that particular meeting while the girls are riding a train to New York. It's bad enough watching it once, but then have running commentary from a hen party kind of doubles the displeasure. Rafe's fake death is the catalyst for Beckinsale and Hartnett to come together, and Rafe's sudden unsurprising return on December 6, 1941 in Hawaii causes some poorly done scenes of 'I-thought-you-my-friend' and 'but-we-thought-you-were-dead'. Finally, the Japanese arrive.The handling of the causes leading up to Pearl Harbor are perfunctory but serviceable. Jon Voigt as Roosevelt is a bit more blustery than the sturdy patrician ever came across in the newsreels. The scenes of the Japanese point-of-view are also a bit short but to the point. This movie isn't about causation, it's about explosion.The Low PointsAlthough the movie proves to be middling to poor melodrama and great action spectacle, it doesn't truly run off the rails until after the battle scene at Pearl. In response, Bruckheimer/Bay tacked on a pointless third (fourth?twelfth?extended denouement?) act about the Doolittle raid on Tokyo in April, 1942. The Doolittle raid was a propaganda event meant to encourage American morale with virtually no military impact. The main characters even question the value of the raid themselves and never get a good answer. Furthermore, the narrative about the raid itself is never established as being important - the movie feels over the whole time we watch this. The least redeeming feature for this hackneyed, wasted hour of screen-time is that there is virtually nothing of interest happening in these scenes aside from the childhood buddies tying up some loose-ends for a bittersweet ending and an incredibly bad voice over about how the Doolittle raid marked the end of America's losses in the Pacific and the beginning of the victories, and how America was changed forever by the war. Oh yeccchhh.There were also parts of the first hour that were so bad I was really concerned I was about to see a terrible movie.Final Score Pearl Harbor isn't going to get anyone a James Cameron night at the Oscars. The first hour had moments of truly insipid melodrama but looked gorgeous and had nice-looking leads who seemed earnest while they fell in love. It was enough to keep my attention until the battle scenes, which were spectacular. Then, for all intents and purposes, we had a one hour denouement that makes this film's rating drop from a hopeful 6 to a 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say that this film was rather cheesy. I don't want to be too critical of it because I understand that different films are made for different people, but this was not a great film and I hope many don't believe this to be one of the best films of the year. It was entertaining nonetheless. The story of Pearl Harbor is captivating and great care was taken to make sure the plot was not offensive to anyone. Now for the criticism. For a movie that cost this much to make the editing is awful. The acting is not great either. Lets face it..Ben Affleck is no future Al Pacino, but this role does not actually do flattery for his talent. I know so many people that claim this to be the next Titanic. Well, the Titanic was actually a solid all-around film. This is not. Therefore this film does not serve a place among the other modern epics that have become the norm in the last few years such as Titanic, Saving Private Ryan, or Gladiator. The plot is very predictable and suffers from many holes. Not a single actor in this film will deserve an academy award nomination. The casting definitely had flaws with so many great actors in small roles or with poorly developed characters. But hey..I'll stop criticizing. After all, this is no more than a Hollywood blockbuster so not much else should be expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An embarrassing so called historical epic!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer Of Pearl Harbor last year and saw that the team of Bay/Brukheimerwere behind the film I was a little apprehensive, the trailer was great it showed what would hopefully be an old fashioned war epic, but a movie that would do justice to the historical event that it was depicting.these guys are better at making mindless but really entertaining action movies like Armageddon, and The Rock. Those movies could get by on being just entertainments, this movie had to be something more. My fears came true, Pearl Harbor is nothing more than a chance for Michael Bay to blow things up! The movie has no heart, the characters are so shallow that you feel nothing for them. True the attack on pearl harbor is impressive technically, but it has been directed and edited as an action sequence not a terrifying surprise attack. The tone of the sequence is all wrong. Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Hartnett are given nothing to do except look pretty for the camera. The love triangle between the characters is one of the blandest, most uninvolving love stories that I have ever seen. They say there lines as if they were reading them of cue cards. The screenplay is embarrassingly bad, even by summer movie standards. The movie wants to be very patriotic, Jon Voight as FDR does what he can to add honor to the film, but it rings hollow.This movie is a more than obvious attempt to repeat the Titanic formula. That film is far superior to this one. It was a grand Hollywood spectacle, but the screenplay at least created two characters that the audience could care about. Pearl Harbor didn't have to be Saving Private Ryan, but it makes no real attempt to be a historical account, forget accuracy, most films of this kind take dramatic license, but this film doesn't even try to offer any insight or perspective on what occurred. So the movie outright fails as a love story and historical drama. What is left if 35 minutes of well produced action. Too bad that the filmmakers paid so little attention to rest of their story. This movie will make a lot of money, but it will be remembered more for what it should have been, not what it is.Grade: D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I seriously do not understand the utter hate toward this film by critics when writing their reviews. "Historically inaccurate" or "Just another love story" or "boring!"... If you want to see a film that is totally historically accurate, watch a documentary for heavens sake. This movie goes way out of proportion to what really happened that day in Pearl Harbor, but it is a MOVIE! Get over it. It's not supposed to be real. The film as a whole is brilliantly written; it's not too soppy with the romance and not too over the top with pure action. People are saying that it's just too much shoot 'em up and too many explosions. Well, I got news for you... They're at war! Bombs will go off and guns will be fired from all places possible. If you want to see a movie that's not so explosive, watch Twilight. To me personally, character development is very important in a movie and I believe Pearl Harbor succeeded with this. I grew attached to individuals and felt vulnerable as a member of the audience at the best of times. Absolutely superb watch, and I'd highly recommend it! If you're offended by a film not being entirely accurate, steer clear and stick to your documentaries. 9/10! Excellent!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is so bad, it's almost worth unclicking the 'contains spoilers' box, then being banned from ever reviewing again by including them anyway. But I won't, I'll be good.Please, I beg of you, for the sake of all that is good and pure and right in this world, don't watch this moronic abomination of a film! As one can see by watching anything else Mechael Bay does, he's great at making things explode at slow motion montages, empty romance and irrelevant hot women, but who thought these were good ingredients for a real-life war film? Transformers, yes. The appalling opening actions (for the Americans, that is) of a catastrophic war spread across the entire globe? No. It's a real shame, because there was a window for the actions of Pearl Harbor to be retold for a new generation; Tora! Tora! Tora! was 30 years old when 'PH' (the film will be 'PH' now) was released. Instead, a great chance has been missed. History takes a back seat and in its place we're given a clichéd love triangle, a brainless script and a over- sentimentalised score. We're all familiar with the notion of girl and boy people falling in love, boy going off to war and girl hooking up with boy's best mate. If such a cliché is to be used, it's bearable if it's used only as a vessel to tell a real story by proxy. What Bay has done quite expertly is make a boring storyline the centrepiece, then blow up everything around it to make it seem exciting. What is unforgivable is that he has used real events to do this, cheapening the real loss of life and harrowing scenes that actually occurred. History is bent and twisted to make it seem more heroic and and thus palatable, yet Pearl Harbor was nothing of the sort. It was a calculated first strike from the Japanese that failed totally in its main goal and a mixture of dumb luck and bad calls with occasional moments of good sense from the Americans that combined to cause a colossal amount of damage and more importantly, a huge loss of life. If an alien came down and you used 'PH' to show what happened on Dec 7 1941, he'd be forgiven in thinking the Americans won the battle! The Doolittle Raid was almost 5 months later and in that time the Japanese ran riot in the Pacific, most notably in the Java Sea, Guam and Wake Island. All of this is glossed over! If you want to see just how historically inaccurate this film is, check out the list of anachronisms and factual errors listed on IMDb.Sadly, all you are left with is an extremely patchy romance and the odd big explosion. In other words; classic Michael Bay. He should not be allowed anywhere near history again, to make up for the faked that he wasn't anywhere near it for this film.Do yourself a favour. Watch Tora! Tora! Tora! and then watch Princess Diaries. You'll get historical fidelity, some big explosions and then some good clean romance as well. And not a Michael Bay in sight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Defense of Michael Bay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen 'Pearl Harbor' before until recently; it wasn't that bad. I get why people hate it, but I don't get why the hate is put on Michael Bay. Most of the qualms is with the story, which should be put on the writer Randall Wallace. Had there not been the ending- and they cut out the Pearl Harbor attack- it would have made for a nice romantic movie (of course they would have had to re-title it!). The cinematography was great and Bay's direction was pretty good. I feel like a lot of people don't understand what it is that directors actually do and are responsible for. If Bay were an auteur and had written the script then- yeah, his bad. But he wasn't, so to judge his work you have to see it from a visual standpoint, taking camera angles in consideration, composition and how all the scenes flow together. In those regards he did a fine job. Again, I get why people are so angry about it; as a film about Pearl Harbor it fails completely. But as an homage to cheesy old school Hollywood romances it succeeds. There's a good movie in there somewhere, it's just not about Pearl Harbor.</fullReview>

This film is shallow, historically inaccurate, dumb, loud and jingoistic. It's an insult to the Americans, the Japanese, and the film industry. John Wayne's guilt at dodging the draft caused him to churn out war movies that are more watchable than this turkey. The acting is woeful and the characters are paper thin. Affleck and Hartnett mumble through their performances.Alec Baldwin has a few good lines as Jimmy Doolittle, but he's wasting his time here. Beckinsale is underfed eye-candy. Cuba Gooding Jr plays Token Black Guy, and the normally watchable and engaging John Voight is reduced to a caricature of FDR. The attack on Pearl itself is kinda shoehorned in there as an afterthought, oh yeah we've spent 2 hours doing this love story, we might as well put some ships blowing up while we're at it. There are some good VFX in the attack sequence, but slick graphics and explosions do not make a film. Oh wait, I forgot, Michael Bay directed this, didn't he. Oh well.

		<shortDescription>This Movie Sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the title of my review suggests, Pearl Harbor, directed by Michael Bay, sucks. It is a ripoff of Titanic as well as Saving Private Ryan, without the majesty or believability of the characters. The writing is very poor, the direction is below sub-par, and the acting is beyond clichéd and hammy. The only redeeming grace is some of the action, but I'll get to that later in the review.The story, or lack thereof, is the love between a pilot (Ben Affleck) in the army, and a navy nurse (Kate Beckinsale.) He goes off to England to fly with the RAF (historically makes no sense as no American officer could ever do that before Pearl Harbor) and is assumed dead. His best friend from childhood (Josh Hartnett), also a pilot, looks after the nurse and they begin to fall in love. But *SHOCK* *AWE* GASP* he's alive and the dreaded love triangle forms. All this entails really really really bad dialogue, love scenes that are extremely awkward, and absolutely no character development. All three actors are at their worst pretty much (only Affleck has saved himself through the power of directing later in his career.) Right now you're thinking, what does all this have to do with Pearl Harbor? Well, the Japanese are planning the attack while Hartnett and Beckinsale kiss and say stupid lines, and are on their way when Affleck shows up again. Then after an HOUR AND A HALF, we get the attack. This is the only pretty good part of the movie, and the special effects are really good. But even the bad writing can get in there. One of the worst moments of the movie is when the Oklahoma capsizes (great sequence by the way) is marred by a NAVY SAILOR says "I Can't Swim!" WHAT THE ****???? This movie makes the U.S. Military look like complete morons and total idiots when it comes to fighting a war. It's humiliating to those who really died on December 7. Then Affleck and Hartnett get in the air and shoot down some Japanese zero fighters.Those 40 minutes of action are over and we're right back to the love triangle, but thank God ever so briefly. The Doolittle Raid occurs, also a good part of the movie. The ending I don't want to talk about because I'm getting sick of talking about this movie. Typical ending though. Danny dies Affleck gets Beckinsale back. Happy Ending!! Hooray!! HELP! There's a "happy ending" in a movie about Pearl Harbor. that's just wrongThree hours of total abomination. While I do praise some of the action, the rest of the movie is insufferable. Michael Bay is at his lowest here, and "Bravehart" writer Randall Wallace has effectively destroyed his career in Hollywood with one of the worst scripts I have ever heard. Avoid this movie at all costs. It's inaccurate, boring, terrible, and should be destroyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Special Effects But Weak Storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is a war film that mixes action and romantic drama elements.It features a large ensemble cast, including Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight, Kate Beckinsale, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Dan Aykroyd, Colm Feore, Mako, Tom Sizemore, Jaime King and Jennifer Garner.It is a dramatic re-imagining of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.The film was written by Randall Wallace and directed by Michael Bay.When the Japanese military launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on that fateful day in December of 1941, the United States was caught completely off guard by the formidable force of 350 heavily armed aircraft and leading to one of the most tragic events in U.S. military history. How could the military base not have known about such a massive attack? Was it due to the amazing strategy of the Japanese pilots, or did their fighters just hit the right place at the most unexpected and vulnerable time.Pearl Harbor tries to be the Titanic of war movies, but it's just a tedious romance filled with laughably bad dialogue. For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress as he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance - the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England - works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo from Titanic but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else in Pearl Harbor - from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR - is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold, Pearl Harbor is quite a thrilling ride.The 40 minute action sequence is spectacular though.It's just a bit unfortunate that such an incredible, noble story, one which turned a nation around and galvanized a generation into action, should be told by such weak storytellers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is almost an embarrassment to the legacy of the Pearl Harbor attack and the men and women who lost there lives that day, and through out the war. When I started watching this cheesy movie I thought someone had put the wrong DVD in the case, seriously. Michael Bay should be ashamed of himself for this one.The action sequences were the only slightly redeeming quality of this movie. The script was atrocious. The acting even worse. I expect bad acting from Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett, but how did they get Kate Beckinsale to do a horrible job as well?You would think after the success of a GREAT war movie like "Saving Private Ryan" that a director like Michael Bay would want to present a great movie, that stays a little close to history, and has some semblance of the real life and times of the people of that generation. Instead he gives us a cheesy puff piece that pretty much uses every cliché of the 1940's era, and doesn't even come close to resembling real life.Let's face it, this was more like some horrible dime story novel romance, and bromance set against the backdrop of WWII. If you want to see a war movie either don't bother with this filth, or just fast forward to the attack sequence and watch that ONLY. It gets worse as they drag out this disaster to give a even worse bromance sequence loosely based on the Doolittle raid.This movie is trash!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most atrocious excuses for historical fiction in recent memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stating that this film does not accurately depict history is unfair to the numerous historical fiction works that have preceded and followed it. Others have said it; I'll say it again: This film is an abuse of artistic license. Bay (in increasing order of egregiousness) colors planes inaccurately, misrepresents both Americans and Japanese as one-sided extras, throws in a romantic plot with no sympathetic characters, lifts a story from history without acknowledgment (more on this later) and dares to title this bloated mess "Pearl Harbor."An elaboration on the third point, that of the plot: it is only 30% about Pearl Harbor, I would estimate. The female lead is wholly unsympathetic in her actions, the two male leads are nearly indistinguishable, and again, it has nothing to do with Pearl Harbor. The plot even continues after the attack to the Doolittle Raids...with a male lead taking part in those, too!Now, the "lifted story": During the attack on Pearl Harbor, two American pilots, Kenneth M. Taylor and George Welch, managed to get airborne and between them downed six Japanese planes. This event is used in the film...except that the two valiant pilots were replaced by the aforementioned indistinguishable male leads, and the credits treat the event as fiction, with no acknowledgment to Taylor or Welch. Having an event fabricated for the film would have been less disrespectful than this.The only relatively good parts of this film are the soundtrack (reminiscent of a Hans Zimmer score) and Jon Voight's performance as President Roosevelt. I can honestly say that he was the best performance in the film. These are the two elements that keep me from giving this a 1.As I write this, it is the 70th anniversary of the attacks, and this abomination of a film is 10 years old. I found it appropriate to review this horrendous film on this day, as a kind of respect to those who were disrespected by this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Bay's worst movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is as terrible as you have heard. It is bloated, overblown and tediously overlong. It is very slow paced, the performances are absolutely deplorable and laughable. And it is an absolute bore. The only good sequence in this movie is when the Japanese are bombing Pearl harbor. The visual effects were outstanding, but that does not make up for the awful performances. Michael Bay should have done his research on the events around the time Pearl Harbor was bombed. Reason being, if he did that research, the movie might have been much better than it actually is. On the whole, this movie is just a downright atrocity. Do not bother with this movie. It is just a waste of your time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbour is a fantastic film, it's exciting, romantic and even makes you cry a little bit! The film in my opinion has been misjudged by overly serious people who pick faults in everything and have completely missed the point of the film. Pearl Harbour is loosely based on a historical event and therefore contains some historical references but it never claims to be a film 100% accurate and it never claimed it could pass you your history test. Pearl Harbour is a love story which just so happens to be set during WWII and Pearl Harbour. The film contains action, romance and it's simply fantastic to watch. Several times during this film I was in tears. I'd call Pearl Harbour a woman's action film which is perhaps why it has received so much negativity. It's a chick flick with a tinge of history and a bit of action. Kate Beckinsale puts on an amazing performance full of emotion and you really feel it, it's a great film that deserves more credit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Calling this film awful is an understatement. I can't even begin to explain the historical inaccuracies in this film. Every director and screen is allowed and expected to take some artistic license with a story but to totally ignore facts is pathetic. What were the writers thinking? This movie is worse than The Memphis Belle and that is saying a lot. Now for what I consider the worst part of this piece of junk; the casting of Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Doolittle is an INSULT to that great man's memory and legacy. Baldwin, politically stands for nearly everything that Doolittle stood and fought against. Over and over in his long life, General Doolittle put his life on the line for his country and what he believed in. Many of the safety standards in aviation today were pioneered by Gen. Doolittle. He made the world's first instrument and helped to develop the first ILS systems. Volumes have been written about what he did. And he lived by a code that a person should do what ever they could to leave the world a better place than it was when they entered it.</fullReview>

The Affleck and Hartnett's heroics are far fetched. You might even be surprised that they weren't shown flying the Enola Gay when bombs were finally dropped on Japan. The story centers around a love triangle you couldn't care less about. Much of the time and resources used to embelish the bad soap opera storyline squash any hopes to see a realistic portrayal of serious and factual events and history makers that are real American History, and the very real reasons the United States entered World War II. The Japanese military portrayal in the attack is whitewashed. Don't expect to see anything remotely honest about this Roosevelt, who in actuality had hoped to enter the war on the side of Great Brittain since 1939. Wow, what a lousy movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie allegedly about two pilots involved in Pearl Harbor in 1941</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Welcome to the worst war movie ever made, the technical details on the aircraft, ordnance and use are mostly erroneous. The legal requirements for service personnel prior to US entry into WWII are totally misquoted.Examples, the view of the bomb propeller spinning in the galley of the Arizona and then the bomb going off is impossible. This propeller (and one like it in the tail), is a safety. It operates by screwing itself off in the airstream as the bomb falls. If the bomb is stationary, the propeller will not spin and come off. Therefore the bomb will not go off.Additionally Fighter pilots in the US Army Air Corps, would not and could not fly bombers. The criteria for joining Doolittle's squadron was to be very proficient in the B25. No fighter pilot would have made the cut.Prior to WWII, service personnel who wanted to fight for any other country, had to totally resign from the US military. A naturalized citizen had to relinquish their US citizenship. This was due to the Neutrality Act.On top of that the love story is, at best,inane.I guess the writer and producer wanted to cut costs and omitted the Technical Advisers. As a result they made this monstrosity. What a waste of money to make it or to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the Japanese military launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on that fateful day in December of 1941, the United States was caught completely off guard by the formidable force of 350 heavily armed aircraft -- leading to one of the most tragic events in U.S. military history. How could the military base not have known about such a massive attack? Was it due to the amazing strategy of the Japanese pilots, or did their fighters just hit the right place at the most unexpected and vulnerable time. Perhaps it was a bit of both. Now, thanks to Eagle Rock Home Video, viewers can explore this landmark day of infamy and find out how the attack on Pearl Harbor still resonates with the U.S. military over half-a-century after the fact.well i was really surprised to see such a low ratings from Critics for this movie but i realized once i saw this movie. i realized very well why such a low rating for it. i really don't actually know about its historical inaccuracies, i really don't know what actually happened there or what really was not there or was mistreated or missed out from the original history here so i can't really talk about that but if it is true than that is not a good thing. i am not one of those people who horribly to death hate Michael Bay nor i am his fan or his movies fan but here i think i really don;t think if the name of your movie is Pearl Harbor then you should have at least known or tried to understand what really happened there, if he had to add his own views or his own things in it then he should have called it a fiction movie.the reason why i don't like this movie is that it just don't work, its awfully written and maybe one of his worst movies. i am even surprised to see that its been mentioned here the running time is 1 hr. 39 min which clearly while watching this movie felt to me above 2.30 hrs. editing was just not done it seemed that bad. story seems nice and plot too but its very dragged. plot could have been far more better. as i said screenplay is bad, it has many hollow places, very dull and uninterested. movie is filled with so much of romance and is shown in such an over the top over done way that a romance lover like me felt really bored after a while.cinematography is good and so is art direction and costumes, score is nice too. it looks good and so is those war and action scenes really looks good. all the flying scenes i loved them. and that was the only thing i liked about this movie. it is a sad war movie with romance in it but the movie just doesn't work. it should have been better. i think Michael bay is not good with romance in his movies, it actually is right. it stars Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale, Cuba Gooding Jr., Tom Sizemore , Jon Voight , Colm Feore , Mako , Alec Baldwin , William Lee Scott , Michael Shannon , Scott Wilson , Peter Firth , James King , Catherine Kellner , Jennifer Garner . acting performances were not that good either.you may like it for a while but at the end you will feel what i felt, emptiness. NOT RECOMMENDED to those who watches a movie with critical eye and brain but for the entertaining value or for the director or one of those actors you may like to check it out but i didn't liked this movie the way i thought i will.</fullReview>

I can't even waste time on the details because those things are so terrible in a most frightening way, but I will say the actual attack sequence was nicely done computer graphics. After the attack is over, you can stop watching the movie.I would have loved more detail with respect to the war INTEL on both sides, and perhaps more focus on the Japanese preparation of the attack. Instead this film focuses on poorly acted love interests, the worst FDR I've ever seen, and moments that I wanted to kick the TV. But please, don't let me discourage you from watching this.

		<shortDescription>All over the place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is way too long, way too all over the place and it takes itself way too seriously.With its blatant ignoring of historical facts, Pearl Harbor is disrespectful towards victims of the tragedy. But it's hardly the only movie of the sorts (Titanic, I am looking at you). It's also hardly the only one that tries to mix overly sentimental romance story with real life historical events. So, what went wrong here? First of all, it's too long, and it focuses on way too many things, which in turn makes the film lose its point. The bombing of Pearl Harbor is hardly the central theme of the film, and it's a huge mistake. Because of the need to end the movie with victorious note for the US, the film continues long after the Pearl Harbor attack, telling us, completely unnecessary and out of the place, another story, of the Doolittle Raid. The film completely loses its pace and coherence. Cheesy dialogues and uninspiring love triangle don't help, nor does the fact the plot is completely predictable 20 minutes into the film.The cast does its best with the lines given, but the acting is wooden and forced. Supporting characters prove to be more interesting than the main trio. Kate Beckinsale's Evelyn seems bland and without any personality. Ben Affleck's Rafe is cocky and egoistic, not at all a noble hero he's supposed to be. Josh Hartnett seems completely confused as Danny and you can just feel he doesn't want to be there. In a way, it works for his character, and he almost makes us believe he's this shy farm boy who doesn't know how to ask a girl out on a date. In a way, he proves to be one of the few things that draw people - teenage, female people - to this film.Is it the worst movie in history? Hardly. It is watchable, once you gave up on the historical facts or clever writing. At the end of the day, it proves itself to be a breathtaking romantic film for those who are too young to know history, or real romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lesson learned, but not very well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cameron's brainwave when filming Titanic, in order to avoid the charge that he was making light of a real life tragedy, was to provide a romance between a fictional couple for audience identification purposes, and then dress it up in the genuine events. In so doing, the identification with the fictional characters drives home to the audience just how harrowing the sinking must have been.Pearl Harbour attempts to do the same and, to be fair, the Japanese raid, the centrepiece of the movie, is very well staged (albeit marred by moments like Tom Sizemore emerging and popping off a shotgun at Zeroes overhead without even aiming it).But the fictional characters inserted for audience identification purposes and their plot line - oh dear. Despite having a liking for all three of the actors involved in the romantic triangle, a) this is seriously drippy stuff, and b) there is oh so much of it. I got to the point where I was hoping that the Pearly Harbour raid would polish them all off so that I wouldn't have to endure any more drippiness.My recommendation is that you should try to catch the hour in the middle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood at it's worst..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I watched this title, I already knew that it had been nominated, and narrowly lost to seven Razzies, and I felt slightly sorry for that fact, as I knew the money, time and energy that went into making it. However, that was BEFORE I watched it. Post- Pearl Harbour, I'm shocked and mildly appalled that this dismal movie didn't win all of them. I have never sat through a film whereby ten minutes in, I was praying for the end. The only reason I didn't turn it off was the naive hope that it would pick up. It didn't.The story is an American love triangle that gets interrupted by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in 1942, no I'm not going into more detail than that, as I purely cannot be bothered to waste my time on it. The worst and most sickening part of the movie for me, as an English girl, is the amount of victimisation that the Americans place upon themselves during this, and the blatant racism to the Japanese attack, weeping at how cruel, and how defenceless a military base was. I'm sorry Micheal Bay and crew, have you never heard of Hiroshima or Nagasaki? The movie makes me almost feel physically sick at the amount of Hollywood that is just sprayed all over every frame, to the drippy acting and stupid love triangle, to the monologue at the end about how amazing America is, to the over the top and costly special effects. By all means, add the CG, after all, it would be hard to conceive the film without them, but at least support it with some form of storyline.The only comfort for me is the knowledge that at least it was recognised by Hollywood and critics alike, that this movie is awful. I have nothing against America or the movie making system, but there is a way to make a film, without patronising everyone non- American and giving it a decent storyline. Do what I didn't, and save yourself the near 3 hours of sitting through this rubbish, and put on something decent to the war genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thing I can say about this movie was that I was driven to emotional extremes. At some points I was near to tears, and at others laughing hysterically. Problem was not at the points or for the reasons intended by the filmmakers.First of all, if you're going to make a film about a major historical event, do some basic research. There so many ways this story could be well told while sticking to the basic facts, there's no need to insult your audience's intelligence with garbage. There are so many things wrong other reviewers have already documented that I won't bother going over them again here.If you're going to try to introduce a romantic sub plot (which this doesn't need), write a decent story/dialogue or don't bother, particularly if you're incapable of directing these kinds of scenes.Pearl Harbour was a pivotal event in world history, why not examine that aspect rather than following it up with a fictitious exercise in flag waving. I despair.Still, the actual attack sequences looked pretty impressive, so I generously give this a 2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad case of Titanic copycat syndrome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some differing qualities to Pearl Harbor but pieces of the film are direct copies of Titanic. The plot is the same: a whirlwind love triangle, set against catastrophe, has star-bursts of comedy but ultimately ends in tragedy. The flying scene between Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale, as breathtaking as it is, is an obvious theft from the "flying" scene between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in Titanic. "There You'll Be," the love song for Pearl Harbor in the end credits... think "My Heart Will Go On." A ;ove song written for the film in the end credits is not unique to Titanic, but still, come on, in the case of Pearl Harbor, it's obvious where the idea came from, as fine a song as "There You'll Be" is. Also, and you can't disagree with me on this, Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay made a two-hour movie into a three-hour movie. Why? Because Titanic was three hours long. Now, here's the key difference: every bit of Titanic is necessary. Every bit of Pearl Harbor... not so much. It's bad when a film feels like three hours. There was no need for the revenge sequence, and definitely no need for the prologue. That was ridiculous. Aside from its lack of creativity, Pearl Harbor also has lacks in several other crucial film-making fields. First of all, Michael Bay as a director... no. Second of all, Jerry Bruckheimer as a producer... yes, if it's a popcorn flick, not an attempt at a masterpiece. Third, Cuba Gooding Jr, as competent as he was in this movie... no. Fourth, Ben Affleck... definitely not. Who wrote the script? I hope it was his or her first and his or her last, so that the trash is limited to only one piece. No, Pearl Harbor is pretty bad. I don't think I'd ever recommend it to anyone. But I have a soft spot for it. Have you ever seen a movie that you know is bad but you watch it anyway? That's how it is with me and Pearl Harbor. Maybe it's because my mom liked it, maybe it's because my grandma likes it, both cases giving me a sense of childhood nostalgia, I don't know. All I know is: don't watch Pearl Harbor. Watch Titanic instead. Just because I watch both of them doesn't mean you should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signature Michael Bay - Great effects, yet weak in almost everything else.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of big war films, like Platoon, We Were Soldiers, and Saving Private Ryan. When I saw Pearl Harbor six years ago, I thought it would reach the ranks of those films. But in like the recent Michael Bay, it was all effects, no movie.It follows U.S. Air Corps 1st Lieutenants Rafe McCawley(Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker(Josh Hartnett), buddies since childhood. Rafe goes to join the Royale Air Force Eagle Squadrons while Danny is transferred to Pearl Harbor. Before he leaves, Rafe falls in love with Evelyn(Kate Beckinsale), a nurse who is also going to Pearl Harbor. Soon, while in battle, Rafe is shot down and presumed dead. Danny and Evelyn are shocked, but then they begin dating. Three months later, Rafe returns to find this out, but soon forgives Danny. Then the big one happens: the attack on Pearl Harbor, which Danny, Rafe, and Evelyn are swept into.Here's the positives. The score by Hans Zimmer is great and I think "Tennessee" one of his best pieces ever. The cast is A-grade, with roles filled by Jon Voight(President Frankin D. Roosevelt), Dan Aykroyd(Captain Thurman), Alec Baldwin(Lt. Colonel Jimmy Doolittle), Cuba Gooding Jr.(Petty Officer 2nd Class Doris Miller), and Tom Sizemore(Sgt. Earl Sistern). Watch for small roles by Eric Christian Olsen and Never Back Down star Sean Faris in the Doolittle Raids part. The best part, which I I do have to give my thumbs up to, is the effects. The explosions and aerial fights are excellent. The attack, while extremely flawed in historical accuracy, exploits all of those in a adrenaline fueled ride.Now for the negatives. The acting is TERRIBLE. Affleck is a joke, and Hartnett is no ace either(at least he did great in Black Hawk Down). The film is also highly inaccurate. I mean I know this is a love story/ action film so there's supposed to be some inaccuracy, but this is way over the legal limit in my opinion. It's even inaccurate on the Doolittle raids. The only good parts are in the fighting and in total that only racks up about an hour and 10 minutes, leaving nearly 2 hours of boredom.Overall I give this film a so-so 5 out of 10 for the effects, cast, and music. Nothing more, nothing less.P.S.: I recommend viewing the director's cut, only in the fact it's rated R and has a couple of extra scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Japs One, Yanks Nil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was one of the most important events in twentieth-century history, but from an American perspective it is a difficult one to film. The Japanese fly in, they sink the American ships, they fly out again. Japs one, Yanks nil. No American audience is likely to take kindly to a film which ends with that particular scoreline. Although the attack was not as decisive a victory as the Japanese high command had been hoping for (only two out of eight American battleships, the USS Arizona and the USS Oklahoma, were permanently put out of action), it was nevertheless an American defeat. The solution adopted by producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay was to make the attack itself the central act of a three-act drama. Act I, hoping to copy the "Titanic" formula of adding a fictional human-interest story to the spectacular recreation of a real historical event, deals with a love triangle between two American pilots and a Navy nurse. The story opens early in 1941 when Lieutenant Rafe McCawley, an American Army Air Force pilot, volunteers to serve with the Royal Air Force's Eagle Squadrons. Later, he is shot down in combat over the English Channel and is presumed killed in action. In fact, he has survived, and after three months in occupied France returns to his base at Pearl Harbor. (Exactly why he did not return to his squadron in Britain is not explained). Unfortunately, two people are less than overjoyed to see him - his best friend Danny Walker and his girlfriend Evelyn who, presuming him to have died, have commenced an affair during his absence and who make it quite clear that Rafe's unexpected return from the dead will have no effect upon their relationship. Unsurprisingly, this development causes a rift in Rafe and Danny's friendship (although, rather more surprisingly, the rift proves to be only temporary). Act II deals with the Pearl Harbor attack itself. Act III tells the story of the Doolittle Raid of April 1942, in which Rafe and Danny, by now once again the best of friends despite Danny's continuing affair with Evelyn, take part. (It is not explained how the two, originally fighter pilots, have now learned to fly bombers). According to the film this raid avenged America's defeat at Pearl Harbor and was a major turning-point in the Pacific War. Japs one, Yanks two. Actually, the Doolittle Raid, although undoubtedly daring, had little effect on the course of the war; the real turning-point came at the Battle of Midway two months later. Indeed, the film, and Jon Voight's rather over-the-top performance, inadvertently left me with the impression that the raid had been a piece of reckless bravado on the part of President Roosevelt who, desperate for a propaganda coup, was prepared to send America's carrier fleet into danger, even though he had been advised that it was needed to defend the West Coast against a possible invasion.The love-triangle story is unnecessary and overlong- indeed, it is the main reason why the film itself is overlong-, and the attempt to emulate "Titanic" falls flat. Although neither Leonardo di Caprio nor Kate Winslet gave a particularly good performance in that film, at least their characters Jack and Rose were two likable young people that the audience could empathise with. In "Pearl Harbor", by contrast, Danny and Evelyn both come across as thoroughly unlikeable; shallow, self-centred and rather cruel in their treatment of Rafe. (Kate Beckinsale looks gorgeous, but this is not one of her better films). Of the three main characters, Rafe is the only one who engages our sympathy, and even in his case our sympathy is limited by the fact that he is played by the stiff and wooden Ben Affleck, the man with a bigger collection of turkeys than Bernard Matthews. Probably the most interesting way of making a film about the battle would be to explore the reasons why the Japanese leadership took such an insane gamble, but I suspect that American audiences would not be interested in a film which paid more attention to the enemy side rather than the American one. The portrayal of the Japanese characters is not as hostile as in some earlier films about the Pacific War ("The Purple Heart" being a notorious example) but even so it is rather perfunctory, and there is no serious attempt to trace the origins of the conflict. The action sequences are good, particularly those depicting the attack on Pearl Harbor itself, and are the main reason why have given the film an average rather than a below-average mark. Nevertheless, there is little else that is good about the film- not the plot line, not the script and not the acting (with a couple of honourable exceptions, notably Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Doolittle and Cuba Gooding, Jr. as the black navy cook who unexpectedly proves to be one of the heroes of the attack). Roger Ebert described the film as "a two-hour movie squeezed into three hours, about how on December 7th 1941 the Japanese staged a surprise attack on an American love triangle". Bay called this the most offensive review he had received in his career, but to me it seems like fair comment. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Appalling Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly can say that I can not remember the last time I saw a film this bad.The film tries to do a Titanic by introducing the Pearl Harbor story through the eyes of two friends (Affleck and Hartnett) who go off to war and a love triangle with nurse (Beckinsale) they both meet.The love story is predictable and corny. Over half the film is devoted on the two friends and their relationships to the nurse trying to give a back story to the characters so that you will feel for them come the impending attack. It does not work. It is pure cheese and is boring as well. I kept looking at my watch, wondering if anything would happen. During the film you feel nothing for the characters, seeing them as nothing more than the "pretty faces" of Hollywood, rather than character actors who would add to a convincing (I wish it only was) storyline. If this film wants to replicate Titanic, then it should sink with out a trace.....The attack sequence on Pearl Harbor does liven things up a bit. But being already over an hour and a half into the film, it seems somewhat late to pick up the tempo after so much boredom.During the attack sequence there were many shots that reminded me of the open sequence of Saving Private Ryan and of the sinking in Titanic. I guess that this is unavoidable given the nature of the film. However in both cases I was given the impression that the film makers (Michael Bay) were coping the techniques, and were not improving on them. Bay's typical use of slow motion in the effects was also overly used to the point of yawning with each successive slow shot. This was a shame as the special effects were otherwise excellent and the only saving point of the film.Finally the retaliatory strike on Tokyo was again a master of special effects, but this whole section of the movie seemed like another film and seemed out of place. That as least was consistent with the poor pacing in the rest of the film.I rented the film on DVD. I am glad that I only wasted 4 bucks. The DVD transfer is very good and the sound (DTS) was masterful.Score: Sound (DTS): 10/10 Effects: 7/10 (let down by too much slow mo) Story: 1/10 Overall: 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie tries to do too much - fails on many levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some good effects in the battle scenes overlook the fact that other movies before this one did a better job sticking to the actual history. Few people research historical documents and Hollywood knows this, which is why they are able to abuse artistic license this way. So if you are looking for historical accuracy this is not your movie. If on the other hand you like a half-decent love story, lots of eye candy of both genders and good war action scenes, this flick is for you. The story centers on the relationship of the two main characters played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett, who grow up in time to go off to join the Army to be combat fighter pilots. With the U.S. on the sidelines, one of the newly-minted pilots goes off to fight for the Royal Air Force during the Battle of Britain. Important plot complications arise from his action, as he is shot down and no one either in England or Hawaii knows his status for months. He reappears in Hawaii just in time for Dec. 7. The scenes involving the actual attack do a good job of portraying the chaotic effects upon the military and civilian populations. There are realistic scenes in the harbor among the damaged and capsized ships that may be disturbing to younger viewers. There is also no shortage of the carnage at the hospital, in the city and the airfields, although not too much of the bloody raw liver and hamburger variety.The aftermath of the attack and scenes related to immediate retaliatory action against Japan seem anticlimactic and abbreviated to the point that they are made almost gratuitous. This movie turned out to be more of a mini-series condensed to fit an extended format DVD. For that it suffers by telling portions of the story to a greater or lesser degree, that looks like it was rushed to print. Some good footage and passable acting was squandered to put this film together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plodding film with impressive Pearl Harbor destruction segment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is worth seeing only for the forty minutes when Pearl Harbor is being bombed. It would have been a disaster without those impressive CGI-enhanced scenes of destruction. The rest of the film is a plodding love triangle with mediocre actors and a script that's packed with clichés. Jon Voight plays a scarcely believable President Roosevelt. The film is useless as a history lesson beyond the most rudimentary details. For a reasonably accurate and engrossing look at Pearl Harbor, 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' is your best bet. Otherwise, this is just a typical Michael Bay film with very few signs of intelligence.Overall 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Bay will most likely never win an Oscar for his movie-making career, which consists of awesome films like "THE ROCK," BAD BOYS I &amp; II, TransFormers and THE ISLAND and, as a executive producer, helped finance the "too-awful-for-words"TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and THE HITCHER remakes. He's known for hating the critics, getting praise from Steven Spielberg himself and making "popcorn" movies. To explain the trend, he merely did "Okay" with Armageddon and then went downhill on this dumb excuse to sit through THREE HOURS OF FILM!!!! 3 hours!!! That's just enough to make everyone walk out of the theater unless it's an entertaining movie that can only tell that much in that time period.Bay has enlisted the help of Bruckheimer, who also is good at creating too many unnecessary sequels like BEVERLY HILLS COP II and PotC: At World's End, and BRAVEHEART screenwriter Randall Wallace to give us this mess of a film. I don''t even recommend it for the actual attack scene because it's so fake-looking with all the cheap computer graphics. I can't even get into the experience because I don't ever feel like the characters are in danger nor do I care if they die or live. This movie should be deleted from Bay's record of films( some of you would even suggest he not make movies anymore) and Bruckheimer should retire from this career. Wallace should go back to college and re-read his history or watch Discovery Channel. Or maybe, YOU, the viewer, can just not watch this movie. End of Discussion!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this were the only way to make modern generations aware of historic events, I'm glad it was made. However, the creators obviously think the audience is simple minded and grasping for familiarity. Yes, the Arizona is the most recognizable casualty of the depicted day, but the name was dropped so incessantly, you'd think it was the only one. That's the trend of the whole movie. Only the well known events are explored, and even then in a shallow manner. The dialogue is predictable and recycled, as is the plot. The imagery is excellent, but beyond that, I can find few other merits to this film. It is an excellent example of Hollywood's lack of hope in the intelligence of its viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrible movie: "Titanic" meets "Tora! Tora! Tora!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why I agreed to sit through this movie five times is beyond me. Jerry Bruckheimer produces yet another meaningless blockbuster crowd-pleaser with lots of big explosions, gratuitous violence, and even a little bit of sex.That's right-- it's "Pearl Harbor," starring Ben "Talentless Hack" Affleck, Josh "Who Am I?" Hartnett, and Kate "Too Interesting for my Career" Beckinsale. Bruckheimer and Michael Bay certainly don't skimp on the special effects. Maybe if they did, this would feel like a real movie. However, we are too drawn in by the things that go "boom" and "rat-a-tat-tat" to care about the characters, their emotions, or even the horrible real-life tragedy that surrounds them. Everything about this movie is terrifyingly staged and even horrifically filmed. If you want to watch a bearable version of the Pearl Harbor story, watch "Tora! Tora! Tora!" It still sucked, but at least it wasn't a complete and total dog like this. If I could, I would give this 0.1112 out of 10. But I can't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Besides the amazing computer graphics, this movie is one of my all-time anti-favorites. In fact, it is so bad that after a while it became enjoyable simply to poke fun at it. Now, I have always wondered about movies that are this bad because, as in this case, it took a lot of creativity to get it to be so. For example, at every opportunity for a time worn cliché (and there were plenty) the best groaner was always picked. Not the second best, not just an ordinary groaner, but the very best one. Now that takes a deep knowledge of bad lines, a good memory to save them all, and a flawless retrieval system to have one ready for nearly every line spoken. The writers were so good at being bad, that the film seemed like a well-engineered spoof. Though improbable, it still has me wondering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bruckheimer vs History---History Loses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, most everyone has panned the film and for all the right reasons. Let me toss in a few pet peeves from an anal retentive who reads the occasional history book. First (and this is classic Bruckheimer), he takes exceptional pains to do extremely accurate CGI renditions of the Jap aircraft---then he has many of them whizzing around Pearl Harbor at sea level doing 400+ knots. The Aichi "Val" dive bomber could only manage 200 knots at altitude (like most dive bombers they used air brakes to limit speed in their dives) and best the Mitsubishi "Zero" could do was 289 knots at 15,000', less at sea level. The ships---again great representations but here are several squawks in ascending order of significance. First, he left out the sun awnings which all the battleships were sporting while in port (I was stationed on Oahu---it gets hot in the sun even in December). Second, the bomb that destroyed the Arizona went off after a millisecond delay, not after some poor sailor in the damn spud locker had time to look down and contemplate his pending misfortune. Lastly and most egregious, after the attack when the long boats are poking about battleship row recovering survivors and the dead, the battle ships have changed positions AFTER THEY SANK! For those who care, of the ships moored on the south side of Ford Island, only the USS Nevada, tanker Neosho, and repair ship Vestal went anywhere except straight down. Another thing that gets lost in most of the Pearl Harbor lore, this flick included, is that Ship's Cook 3rd Class Doris Miller earned his Navy Cross for assisting his mortally wounded captain and manning a machine gun under fire, NOT for shooting down any aircraft (if he hit any, the record is silent on the fact)---manning the gun under direct fire with no training was more than enough to attest to his bravery. He died in the service of his country when his ship, USS Liscombe Bay was torpedoed in November 1943. This movie reminded me of a graffiti epitaph reportedly seen on John Belushi's grave paraphrased somewhat: "It could have been so good but Oooh Noooo!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shameful Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me explain what I mean when I say that this movie is shameful crap.First, the crap part. It's pretty obvious in watching this that the screenplay is junk the director doesn't know how to direct actors at all, and as a result the acting is terrible too. It brings new meaning to the word "trite." There are a few scenes that look good on the screen, such as the part with the Japanese planes flying over the kids playing baseball and the like. Never mind that there probably weren't many kids playing baseball first thing in the morning on Sunday, but whatever, the image was at least striking. I'll give it that. It can't really make up for the junky love story, however.Now, why I use the word shameful. This isn't some fictional event, it was an actual event in relatively recent history (in the grand scheme of things) in which quite a few people actually died. Not only that, but it started in motion a chain of events that was very serious, resulted in a tremendous amount of sacrifice, and should be treated with at least some respect. It deserves better than a crap-o treatment by Michael Bay, the king of schlocky movies.I'm hoping that in a few years people will forget that this thing was even created.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for Pearl Harbor, I imediately wanted to see it because I had studied it at school. Friends of mine however hadn't and paid no interest in wanting to see it. However, i dragged them to the cinema and i can safely say that they were glad i did. Even though it is useful to have some background knowlege of the horrific event that shook America, Pearl Harbor grabbed and kept the attention of everyone I know.It tells the tragic story of the day Pearl Harbor was attacked by Japan in 1941. At the same time, you follow the story of two best friends and the beautiful lady that they are in love with.If I had to sum the film up in one word it would be: fantastic. From start to finish you feel as if you know the characters and you are gripped untill the end. Not only is the film entertaining, but it also tells the story that everyone should know about. The effects are amazing and the music captures the scenes.I highly reccomend this film. Even if you know nothing of the event, see the film! It is not one to miss!!</fullReview>

The Japanese did *not* retreat as a result of Doolittle's attack. They fought extremely hard until the bitter end, 3 years later. To suggest otherwise means we won right there. The inevitable death scene sucked, and reminded me of a bad 50's B-film. (" I'm so cold " !!). Not to mention the "crucifixion" symbolism. Awful. Truly insulting. Thank God for rentals.

The effects are spectacular.Michael Bay is not a bad director, he just recycles a lot of stuff. I swear there are scenes in this movie that are exactly the same in Armageddon. In fact, you could actually sneak in a couple scenes here and there into the film and I bet no one would know (With Affleck in both films and lead actress in Pearl looking so much like Liv Tyler). All his films have the same music and a lot of the same low camera angles, half done in slow motion.But as pure entertainment, I really liked this film. A lot of people seem to be complaining about its accuracy, yet I've seen many Pearl Harbor vets say the movie is dead on. It was way before my time so I can't say, but as an entertaining film, I can.

This is one of the longest movies I have ever sat through (at least that's what my back tells me). It has some of the worst writing I have ever heard. The set-up and the romantic intrigues are predictable and uninteresting. There is absolutely no suspense. The whole plot is contrived. Oh, yes, there is an endless attack by the Japanese, but by the time it happened, my mind was wandering. As far as those tragic lovers, I thought I was watching a bunch of eighth grade girls and boys ticked off because she said he said she said, whatever!! Then, of course, we have Jimmy Doolittle, going on his raid to make up for what those guys did to us. What a slap in the face to the real event. How can a director with 135 million dollars make the attack on Pearl Harbor dull. Yes, it probably looked like that. Those bombers and fighters moving clandestinely in on the island--destroying the fleet with no conscience. What about a script? What about the building of some sort of momentum? How about focusing on the realistic politics of the time and seeing the world from both sides. I was so disappointed in this film. People wonder why it's so expensive to go to the movies these days. It's because the studios are footing the bill for this kind of bilge!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pearl Harbor" comes off like "Titanic" meets "Tora! Tora! Tora!". It's a three hour epic that has shades of those two movies, and in the end I was kind of disappointed. This film should have been better than it turned out to be. The big problem with this film is the director, Michael Bay. Bay directed this film pretty much the same way he directed his last film "Armageddon", sloppy and inconsistent. With the exception of the Pearl Harbor attack sequence which is excellently done, most of the scenes before that attack come off as corny and ridiculous. And the love triangle between Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckinsale doesn't even stand up to the love story between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in "Titanic". However, the big scene when Pearl Harbor comes under attack is a tour-de-force sequence. The special effects are superb and horrifying. But just think at how much better this film could have been. If Steven Spielberg or James Cameron had directed this, "Pearl Harbor" would have been a much better film. Spielberg and Cameron are directing geniuses compared to Bay, who foolishly tries to integrate comic relief in the first part of the film which comes off ineptly silly. But he's got the special effects in the right place. So all-in-all, I was kind of disappointed with "Pearl Harbor", the film that was predicted to be the biggest hit of summer 2001, but ended up being a slight box office disappointment (at the time of this review the movies' gross was at $197 million, still below $200 million). It's not an awful film, but it could have been better.**1/2 (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie mostly for the flying and the action. Critics have been picky and implied the plot was boring. Well...... the action was great. It was the most thrilling flying I've seen in a movie.... it's not just bombs exploding and ships on fire...... but great reconstruction of air battles and thrilling flying before, during and after the Pearl Harbor attack. The best. The interesting part is that I was moved by the film as well...... even shed a tear or two, much to my surprise. The love affair plotline is certainly not new to the screen.... but it works very well..... and issues of friendship, loyalty, respect, are treated seriously, in mature, ethically responsible fashion. It's amazing how fresh it seems.The historical aspects are depicted in relatively accurate fashion. I've read a great deal of the literature and though some events were, of necessity, written in shorthand, the general thrust was true to what we now know. Jon Voight presents the courageous and compassionate side of Roosevelt; it's a pity he did not show his aristocratic spirit as well. They were part and parcel. After much thought, he was our best president after Lincoln and Jefferson (I never understood why Washington is usually regarded as the best being that not much happened under his stewardship).Tora Tora Tora is an exciting film but it tells the story from a less personal perspective..... a very different movie it is from Pearl Harbor, but also a very good one.</fullReview>

Lines that come to mind are "I think World War II Just started!" and "Not anxious to die sir, just anxious to matter!" Seriously, who wrote these lines? The war in Europe had already started and no one called it world war II until long after the war was over! Do not watch this load of crap! You will be disappointed!</fullReview>

There's the cheesy script played by up-and-coming actors carrying a love story set during one of the biggest catastrophes in the first half of the 20th century. I find Titanic to be overrated but where it succeeded is where Pearl Harbor does an u-turn in the wrong direction. I hate Josh Hartsnett with a passion, so that's a minus for this film already. Our main leads are mediocre at very best and the dialogue is tremendously terrible. This really becomes a problem because they go through the same pretentious romantic dilemma again and again for what seems like an eternity. The action was fun...at first, but overstayed it's welcome since the action scenes too where drawn out as long as possible. The entire movie is the same repeated stuff over and over and over and over and it goes on for three hours! When the Pearl Harbor attack ended I expected the film to end, but no! It was still going! I had completely lost my attention at that point and curled in my couch waiting for the film to end. Thankfully once the douchebag Hartsnett's character dies the film goes through it's ending pretty quickly.Some things work, most of it doesn't. It's a film that could have so easily been trimmed down an hour, because there is very little evidence that this film utilize a three hour length to it's advantage.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ten years in, and this has the most hated/loved war movies ever! The film is one thing, but the reviewer/viewer public has been pure bi-polar on this one. Most truly bad films just fade and are rarely seen or shown after a few years. Not this one, ten years later and it's still on all the time on TV. People watch it, I watch it. It gets ratings.I first saw shots of this movie in a electronics store in Pearl City, back in about 2003. Strange twist, I saw it there of all places. Anyway, the action and cinematography blew me away on those early big screen LEDs. And it still does. Historically?? Right, I get it - it couldn't be right. But, entertainment isn't all about historical accuracy, or it would all be just documentaries. Entertainment is about love, heroism.. Stuff like that. It's story telling. This film is too hated, I say. So I give it an eight, to help make up for all the bogus one, two and threes.. yo</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a doubt: Pearl Harbor is the worst movie of all time? Transformers 2 is the worst ever? I don't know. What I know for sure is that Michael Bay has a problem: He is an amateur playing with huge budgets.There's no much to say, because this movie is a complete mess in all levels. In fact, I recommend cinema students to watch this movie, so they will know what NOT to do. What most I disgust this movie is the complete mediocrity of the director to understand what makes a movie a good experience. I really don't understand why a guy that doesn't know that is working in cinema industry. A very bad movie.</fullReview>

I should think that with all the talent, effort and money invested in this film they would have had a better result. And where in the film did that nurse earn a Purple Heart? There was not even a hint that the American aircraft carriers, which were at sea and not in the Harbor at Pearl when it was attacked, were of concern to either the Japanese or the American military commands. To the Japanese because they did not know where they were and the Americans because they did! Having a copy of Morrison handy after seeing this film should serve as an antidote.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very long war film without much going for it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, I was shown some of this highly criticised 2001 war and romance story in English class sometime during the second half of my high school years, which would have been several years after its release. I'm not exactly sure what I thought of it at the time, and had never heard of it before, so I had no clue what the general reception of it was. I would later find out that its general reception certainly wasn't very good, probably the worst I've ever seen for a war movie! For that reason, it didn't surprise me when I finally got around to watching the entire film and it failed to impress me for the most part.Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker have been friends since childhood. By 1940, they are young men, and both join the Army Air Corps. Rafe meets a nurse named Evelyn Johnson and a romantic relationship between the two quickly begins. America has not yet entered World War II, but Rafe has volunteered to join the British in battle, so he soon finds himself far away from his new lover, and Danny and Evelyn are transferred to Pearl Harbour in Hawaii. Eventually, Rafe's plane crashes into the water, and he is presumed dead. Obviously upset about this, Danny and Evelyn begin to develop a relationship. However, it eventually turns out that Rafe is still alive, and Evelyn and Danny soon see him again! Unfortunately, Rafe soon learns about their relationship that started while he was gone, and as Japanese forces plan their surprise attack on Pearl Harbour, conflict between the two former friends begins! "Pearl Harbour" is often criticised for a number of things, which unsurprisingly includes historical inaccuracy. Even though I'm no history buff, I'm convinced this film is very inaccurate (even that might be an understatement, I don't know) but I've learned to expect that from films based on historical events, even ones MUCH more popular than this one. However, this film is also criticised for having poor dialogue, and after seeing it myself, while I can't say I think the dialogue is consistently horrendous throughout, I can definitely understand the criticism! Another thing is the romantic scenes, which I'm also going to have to agree with, especially early in the film, before Rafe leaves, an example being Evelyn telling the other nurses how her relationship with Rafe began. Yes, a lot of the poor dialogue comes from the romantic aspect of the story early in the film, and it sometimes gets unintentionally funny, including some of the dialogue between Rafe and Evelyn, which made me laugh quite hard at least at one point! Also, after Rafe has gone, Evelyn writes a letter to him, telling him, "It's so strange to be half a world away from you," as if they knew each other for a long time before he left, which may have made me snicker or at least smile. For most of the film, the unintentional humour doesn't continue, but instead, we have some tedious action sequences, and a shallow story. There may be some mildly touching moments, but not usually, not enough to make up for a mostly dull approximate three hours the film goes on for.I thought there was a good chance I would end up disliking this film more than I did. I could have ended up joining the many viewers who found it to be a well below average blockbuster. Now that I've seen the whole thing, I think it's basically average. It's a severely flawed, unsatisfying, and overlong romantic war film, but personally, I'm not exactly displeased with it enough to trash it as much as so many others have (I guess it could have been worse, and much more poorly received movies have been made). However, I still don't consider it a worthwhile effort, I'm definite on that one. Lots of highly acclaimed war movies have come from Hollywood over the decades, but "Pearl Harbour" is far from one of them, and there are obvious reasons for that. Even when an historical film is extremely inaccurate, it can still be extremely well written and scripted, which this film certainly isn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Comments on this P-O-S are probably superfluous . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be very succinct, for now, and go right to the point: This movie SUCKED! It is a PIECE OF CRAP! It is so bad, I can't adequately describe just how awful it is. Are you beginning to get my point? I couldn't care less what happened to the male leads. I was fervently hoping they would all get greased, smoked, wasted, blasted, shot down, killed, blown away, nuked. You know. Dead. I was rooting for the Japs in this movie. I was cheering on the Imperial Navy. I stood up and saluted and bowed whenever Admiral Yamamoto or Admiral Nagumo appeared on screen. I think I would've probably even GIVEN them US Atomic Secrets just so they could make a thorough job of their attack without they're having to expend maximum resources in aircraft. That's how much I hate this cinematic piece of garbage. TITANIC was much better. So was the overlooked film Genius, Timothy "Orson Wood" Hines and his celluloid masterpiece, "War Of The Worlds". Okay, the Chicks were Hot, but so the f*** what? Jon Voigt was good as FDR, even believable, and Cuba Gooding was wasted in what was merely a supporting role as a Token Negro Doing His Bit, although he did it well. Just as Messers Stone and Parker say in "Team America", he should have had a bigger, better part. Okay, moving on to the ridiculous Alec Baldwin and the Doohicky Raid, why did the idiot director try and bastardize and rape Jimmy Doolittle's morale-building strike against Japan after Pearl Harbor? Lt. Colonel Doolittle used a medium BOMBER group with its own personnel to mount that attack, he didn't call for volunteer FIGHTER pilots of DUBIOUS quality to fly his planes. Despite Ben Afleck's continual pissing and moaning to get him to a goddam airplane during the Pearl Harbor attack, his track record in the air prior to that hadn't been too good, had it? The Germans shot his butt outta the sky during the historically dubious Battle of Britain segment (the Eagle Squadron didn't see service until well AFTER the BOB, and it's America volunteer pilots DIDN'T arrive in Blighty wearing their US uniforms, they were required to first resign their American commissions), and I WON'T forgive the Luftwaffe for letting Big Ben survive in the first place. That's something that should have been brought against Herman Goring at Nuremberg after the war. And I wouldn't have let Film Actor's Guild member Alec Baldwin lead an attack, or command anything. He played Jimmy Doolittle as if he were severely constipated, and still looking for the head on the RED October. And it doesn't surprise me that Randall Wallace had a hand in this sneak attack piece of garbage: Look what a terrible mess of Scottish history he made with "Braveheart". I'm going to stop for now, before my pacemaker shorts out and I die, becoming another casualty of this truly worthless waste of money. Besides, I'd bet good money that Timbo Hines LIKED this movie. It may have inspired him to make "Bore Of The Worlds". Actually, come to think of it, maybe HE should have directed this godawful piece of you know what. At least it would have been ENTERTAINING.Peace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I could rate this movie a 0 I would have. To this day i'm not sure why anyone put director Michael Bay in charge of such an important subject as Pearl Harbor. The director couldn't make up its mind whether it wanted to be a mainstream Hollywood romance film or a movie based on REAL historical events that happened and shaped a generation. Pearl Harbor is a muddled nonsensical monumental waste of money by a studio hack. The real events at pearl harbor only receive a big budget Hollywood CGI nod with the attention purely focused on the big name movie stars galvinating across the screen. Replace the planes with horses and the leading actress with a damsel in distress and you could have sworn the dialogue was lifted from a 1950's TV western. This is the worst homage to WW2 veterans that Hollywood could give them.</fullReview>

In addition to its gross historical inaccuracies, it is one of the most dramatically inert piles of manure to see a cinema screen since the rotten "Inchon". From a technical perspective, the attack on "Pearl Harbor" is a fine achievement, but every positive is cancelled out by a dozen negatives. If director Michael Bay and Co. had not crapped on about the historical context of the film and its "importance", it could have passed for disposable rubbish. Instead, it is pretentious, boring, long-winded cow dung of the highest order. Only the trailer, which used a beautiful Hans Zimmer cue from "The Thin Red Line", has any artistic merit.</fullReview>

While some may find it distasteful to turn a horrific event which cost so many lives into a laugh riot, if you can get over this minor annoyance you'll find yourself embroiled in a film that gleefully lacks all of the following:*Credibility! *Acting talent! *Historical accuracy! *Periodical script accuracy! *Any serious lines or story threads whatsoever!I swear to God, if Michael Bay and Bruckheimer had any serious intentions WHATSOEVER when making this bucket of faulty rectum discharge, then I would be trying to sell them hookers in a vagina storm. I honestly cannot believe they approached this important subject with any respect at all. This is supposed to be a war movie right? Then why is the majority of the film consumed with a hilariously bad love story which has all the believability and relevance of a boiled potato? Why are there more historical inaccuracies than you could shake a stick at? Why is reknowed comedy actor Ben Affleck involved? His idiotic mugging through every scene is simply impossible to take seriously.Hugely amusing, and as a comedy I would not hesitate in giving it top marks. But be warned, if you want a serious war movie this is guaranteed to offend beyond all reasonable boundaries of good taste. These people have no shame, and the racist undertones only lend more laughs to an already unbelievably tongue-in-cheek outing. Absolutely a barrel of laughs.In the words of 'South Park' creator Trey Parker, "Michael Bay actually makes comedies, but he just doesn't know it because he's a turd."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this film, I have to say that I'm glad I listened to what all my friends were saying about this film and only paid attention to less than half of this film. The two battle scenes were what I found worth watching, and I hadn't expected anything else, from what everyone told me about the film. Had I not been fully aware that nothing other than those two scenes were worth watching, had my state of mind been completely open to this film, I would have hated it, and my review would have been a thoroughly negative one. It's more than likely that I would have commented on Jerry Bruckheimer's and Michael Bay's lack of actual talent and their extreme use of explosions(usually overplayed and overdone ones) to cover this up. But I won't. I won't comment much on plot, pacing, acting or characters. I could complain that this is just another typical, empty Hollywood film that takes a historical event and smothers in with romance and sappy sentimentality instead of bringing the real story(as if it didn't have enough impact on its own), much like they(seemingly; haven't seen it, for obvious reasons) did with Titanic. I could argue that the plot is thin and everything but the actual historical events seem bland and unimportant, that the acting seems flat, the pacing excruciatingly bad and the characters paper-thin clichés and stereotypes. But I'll try not to. Instead, I will comment on the two battle scenes, for those who share my point of view on the sappy romantic drivel of many late epic films. They look pretty good. The effects are impressive, though the CGI is overly obvious at times. Most of it looks good, and the overuse of explosions supposedly won't bother most action fans(though I, being in favor of realism in war movies, found this to be quite bothersome and annoying). If you really like strong war-action, you should check out a movie that delivers more of it(like Black Hawk Down) or at a far more realistic approach to it(like Der Untergang). However, if you want to see the Bruckheimer version of a war scene, by all means, see this film. I warn you, though, most of it is simply not worth paying attention to. I recommend this to fans of war movies with Hollywood action scenes and/or people who can't watch a movie that doesn't contain romance. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is definitely one of the best movies that portrayed a historical moment in time...BUT it's not the best. It's well done enough to pass as almost an epic, but it's not a movie for war fans, or ones there who really want a big action/war film.It's a wonderful movie for those who want to learn about a historical event, and for those who don't usually watch the war genre. I personally can't stand anything with a war theme, but this one caught my eye. I'd only recommend this movie however, to those who are into romance; for the love story between Rafe/Evelyn &amp; Danny/Evelyn is definitely heart tugging. With the romance interweaving with the tragedy of war, it definitely was a script that was deeply thought about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see why people wouldn't like this film, it's not for everyone. To me it seems like director, Michael Bay, took his formula for "Armageddon" and Cameron's "Titanic" and tried to mold it into "Pearl Harbor". But, despite that, I still liked the film a great deal.I do have a few complaints about the film though. There were a number of particular shots in the film that were filmed in a very strange way, there was a slight blur to them. I just don't get stuff like that, I didn't see why that was necessary, I think it kind of took away from the reality of what was going on. My second complaint is the length of the film, the film was just too long. Granted, it went by rather quickly, but still...there were a number of shots that were just redundant or unnecessary. Personally, I also thought the character, Red, was pretty annoying with that stupid stuttering that he did. One other thing I would have changed is that Betty died, wasn't too fond of that. That's really about everything I have to complain about.The story was pretty good, although, definitely more of a love story than a war-story. That right there is definitely going to anger some people. Yes, there is lots of shooting and things getting blown up, but there's a great deal of romance to the film. I thought the story was pretty interesting and fairly well done.The special effects are the reason enough to see this film, they are fantastic. I cannot believe there are people on this site (and everywhere else) that claim the special effects were not well done! You HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!! The special effects are just unbelievable! I can't even imagine how much work must have gone into this film.The acting in the film was fine for my tastes. There were a few cheesy scenes, but overall, I thought everybody did a great job. As far as the cast goes, I thought it was excellent. There was a surprising amount of familiar faces throughout this film. I was a bit surprised to see Dan Aykroyd in this film, but in the end he pulled it off. I won't really go into the cast, but all the players did a fine job.All I can say is that this is Michael Bay movie, so you can expect some cool action sequences and this is also a big love story. So when/if you see this film (assuming you haven't already), treat it like one. I thought it was a good film, with a lot of good stuff. It's not the best film I've ever seen, or even the best film of 2001, but it was a good film. When/If you see the film, I hope you enjoy it. Thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

Michael Bay obviously likes insulting his audience's intelligence by thinking any old story tagged on will work as long as we have the great spectacle of a shoot up at Pearl Harbour. I'm sorry but it's boring. Give the audience some credit and pay for a decent screenwriter.The acting for the most part is totally wooden and unconvincing. Kate Beckinsale looks like she's walked on to the wrong movie set by mistake. And do we have to have the whopping and hollering of joy every time an American character patriotically kills the enemy, it's embarrassing and out of place for that time period. To make matters worse the director's just can't let America finish the movie by getting it's butt kicked. You can not compare the Doolittle raid on Japan as some major military victory and certainly it should not be seen in the same context as the Pearl Harbour attack. If you've got some money to spend on a decent war story wait for 'Band of Brothers' mini series to come out on DVD and don't bother with this tripe.</fullReview>

But Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett made great war heros and their relationship brought a warmth that often doesn't exist in a war movie. Yes, Pearl Harbor was written to be a blockbuster rather than a critical success, but aside from Alec Baldwin's badly written part I thought it was a great lift-your-spirits patriotic movie in these times where we are no longer proud to be Americans (or at least afraid to show it).

		<shortDescription>Pearl Habor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Habor is a historical movie directed by Michael Bay in 2001. It's a perfect way to show how America entered in WWII. There are three main characters: Captain Rafe McCawley played by Ben Affleck, Captain Danny Walker played by Josh Hartnett and Nurse Lieutenant Evelyn Johnson played by Kate Beckinsale. At the beginning of the movie we follow Rafe and Danny's childhood. They wanted to be pilot and some years later they join the Royal Air Force. Rafe is in love with Evelyn, since their first meeting. He goes to England to fight against the German Air Force: Luftwaffe whereas Evelyn and Danny are sent to Pearl Habor. When Rafe is back at Pearl Habor there is a surprise attack by the Japanese Air Force. This movie plunges us aptly in the horror of war. Through the actor's play of Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett we can feel exactly the solders' feeling during this period. Firstly through the childhood of the two young men we understand that a lot of little boys wanted to serve their homeland, to be soldier and wanted to participate in the protection of their country. Then, when Rafe goes to England and he announces it to Evelyn we understand it was difficult for a wife, mother, sister or whatever to see their husband, son, or brother leaving. And we see it's also difficult for Danny because a friend is precious and he is afraid of his friend's death. Moreover when Rafe's plane crashed into the sea he thinks all the time of Evelyn in order not do die. So we can see that women are very important to soldiers to give their strength and courage. This movie also emphasizes brotherhood between soldiers. Indeed during all the movie, the young men build a relation of friendship which seems to be very strong. And it's very important to mentioned that this sort of group, had need to the strength relations. During the scene of the bombing we can see the panic in the eyes of the actors. We can see soldiers crying and saying "Mom!!" This moment transcribes very well the horror which soldiers underwent during this historical event. Moreover with the sound and the special affects we can believe we are part of the scene, we are with soldiers, we can felt their fear when they see the first Japanese plane. We can see soldiers were ready to sacrifice themselves for their country. We can think that the beginning was a little bit long but I think it's important to follow life of those soldiers before the attack because we can identify with them thanks to the scenario. After seeing this movie I can say they were not only soldiers, cannon fodder but they were friends, husbands, fathers, and above all, they were human beings and they gave everything they could to their country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So this movie may not be exactly historically accurate and perhaps it is a little long, but I loved it. If you're not one to care about accuracy this is a great story. The fight scenes are pretty spectacular (an earlier user comment said that it didn't give any "honor" to the Japanese fighters...But I beg to differ, I thought Bruckheimer and Bay did a good job of providing the Japanese with lots of honor), and the story line keeps you interested. My boyfriend who is in the Army didn't really like this movie, but every woman I know loved it. So guys, this movie may not be for you if you're really intense about war movies, but, Ladies...watch this movie, you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Michael Bay......what did you expect?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK - lets face it! Michael Bay is a second unit director - nothing more. This movie had so much potential and they absolutely ruined it....so what's really wrong with it?....Let's see 1) Casting: Jesus Christ! Who came up with the idea of casting Ben Affleck in the lead role??? I mean Affleck has to be the worst famous actor right now.He is wooden? - just horrible - and he'll never be able to portray a tough guy - remember my words: NEVER! Dan Akroyd??? in a serious role?Now I love Akroyd but come on - i laughed for 30 minutes when they tried to portray him as a serious character.Cuba Godding Jr.: well he may fit the character but his story part was just weak....really weak.Tom Sizemore: seems like you can't watch a war movie without him doing the crazy bastard type of warrior.....Jennifer Garner: don't panic if you didn't find her in the movie - her part is laughingly small 2) directing: now - Bay is able to shoot action sequences....but that's about it. He fails trying to do anything else - hence the best part of the movie - 30 minutes of action....who would've expected that? 3) historical accuracy: another ridiculous aspect of the movie because there is none....but hey that not the point of the movie right? I mean just because it's called Pearl Harbor doesn't mean it's supposed to be about that historical event....NO!It's about a cheesy love story...what else? 4) stereotypes: US= good;Japan= bad; Yeah we got it yada yada yada; Life can be so easy living in black and white.5) structure of the movie: why didn't the damn movie stop after the attack? It would have been a good ending, but no we need to have a crappy 45 minutes more of unnecessary stuff ALL TOGETHER: I didn't expect much - I didn't get much! Michael Bay did his job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somebody drop a bomb on this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mean that literary when I say that Pearl Harbor is one of the worst war movies I've ever experienced despite a promising trailer where I would think some history could be stuck in my mind. What we end up is a schlock of a film that endures romance more than a lesson.If there's a title that Ben Affleck should earn, it's "Why am i the sidekick that never catches a break?" since pointing him in a action movie or any movie with him in the top billing without the aid of good actor Matt Damon always fails in the end. He plays Rafe, a daredevil pilot who is best friends with Danny (Josh Hartnett) where they enter the air force together before they separate after Rafe is called into action by the British Air Force leaving his friend along with hot nurse Johnson (Kate Beckinsale) behind. The story then concentrates on Danny trying to comfort Nurse Johnson after reading a telegram stating that Rafe has died in battle where he falls in love with the nurse until seeing that his best friend has risen from the dead.The real action doesn't take place until at least seventy minutes when the Japanese planes start attacking the ships at Pearl Harbor leaving some of the most memorable scenes in movie history despite the fact that this film is deemed as a chick flick.Overall, a real extreme disappointment for those that were going to see a great war epic. Even the talent here is a waste with too many actors from Affleck, Hartnett, Beckinsale, Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight, Dan Aykroyd, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jamie King, Jennifer Garner, Ewan Bremmer, Mako, Tom Sizemore, William Fitchner, Sara Rue, and many more good names that deserved better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Worst Movies of All Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is without doubt one of the worst movies of all times. And the reason for that is not that it features Ben Affleck, probably the worst actor ever, nor that the dialog is truly awful, Josh Harnett declaring "World War II has just started!" just to mention one. It's not even all the numerous anachronisms and historical blunders that makes this picture The Worst. No, that would just make it plain bad, but what really earns this film 1 out of 10 (would have given it negative vote if i could) is that it really is a propaganda movie nearly as bad as bad as anything Leni Riefenstahl has ever made! Maybe even worse because in Pearl Harbor it's more subtle and disguised as an epic war movie.The propaganda in Pearl Harbor works, in short, like this: First we are shown how the horrible attack on Pearl Harbor was launched and are treated to all the pain and suffering caused by the evil Japanese. Which is supposed to fill us with righteous wrath against the Japanese. Then comes vengeance; America must revenge this most horrible deed, and decides to do so by launching a small air raid on some Japanese factories and strategic points, in which we are shown the bravery of the young soldiers and their glorious victory against all odds.Victory! Accompanied by epic music it's declared that from that moment on "America has known nothing but victory" and claims that this is what ended the war. Oh how glorious and brave! And with so few civil casualties, what a victory! ...or no wait, something feels wrong! No mention whatsoever about what really ended the war: the nuclear bombs dropped over the two major Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki! THE ONLY TIME IN WAR HISTORY NUCLEAR WEAPONS HAVE EVER BEEN USED! With the immediate death of about 300,000 civilians as a result! About 100 times as many as died in the attack of Pearl Harbor! And god knows how many others died and are still dying of cancer because of the radiation! So instead of mentioning one of the biggest massacres in war history we are treated to a glorious false victory with only the tiniest amount of casualties and the feeling that those Japs really got what they deserved! In other words exactly how propaganda is supposed to work.This kind of history rewriting is an insult not only to those who died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki AND Pearl Harbor but to all who died in WWII on both sides. This and the fact that many people gather their historical knowledge by watching motion pictures like this one, is what make Pearl Harbor one of the most untruthful, insulting and truly bad pictures ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this again for a second time on television, thinking it could not possibly be as bad as I remembered, but it was actually worse.This movie suffers from any number of flaws Most obvious is an overly long script due to the seeming insistence that this movie must end on an American victory through the Doolittle raid, not the actual devastation of Pearl Harbor. In addition, we have to have the useless, distracting story of Cuba Gooding Jr. as Dory Miller, which might have worked if the movie didn't seem to also need to cover the RAF, an unbelievably sappy love story, a fiancée torn away from her love, some other unimportant but present nurses and airmen, and everything else jammed into this film. It was three movies jammed into one, and none of them were done well except for the special effects from the actual attack on Pearl Harbor.The dialogue and script are also truly horrible. Alec Baldwin's character has the lion's share of ridiculously cheesy, undeliverable lines that he hams up like his character on 30 Rock, which doesn't work for this film. I don't know if Doolittle ever actually said some of that stuff, but Baldwin's delivery made me giggle. Rafe and Danny also have some doozies. This movie must contain every sappy love story line ever written, every cheesy motivational speech ever delivered.There are also just too many characters to care about in this film. Betty, Red, Jennifer Garner's character, Dory Miller, etc, their pain and everything else about them gets lost in the overwhelming quantity of people we are introduced to. Even Danny and Rafe aren't really developed characters, and apparently we're supposed to believe that Kate Beckinsdale's character sprang up from the Earth just as the war was starting as we know nothing about her.Whoever made the remark about the score being overpowering is exactly right. The music is overwhelming and drowns out any emotional power of the scenes. I'm not sure if Hans Zimmer was trying to overpower the bad dialogue, but the main theme gears up almost every two minutes and just becomes annoying.The battle scene is rather impressive, but it's seemingly lost in a morass of bad movie rather than the climax of the film, which is a testament to just how bad the surrounding film is.Overall, a terrible movie that should have confined itself to one incident and a few, realistic people instead of creating a gigantic mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horrible film that has so many faults, it just isn't worth my time to list them all. By all means read the other reviews, as they give a good account of them. The Battle of Britain scenes had me shouting at the screen. Even if you put aside it is the wrong year! It was an insult, not least of all to the American volunteers who did serve in the war with Britain and were NOT part of the US military who at that point, did not consider Germany an enemy.Why an event so significant as Pearl Harbour, wanted or needed the implausible and repeatedly inaccurate story line is beyond me. It was and is an important story to tell - the right way. Combine a script that would make a high school history teacher cringe, with an implausible love story and some of the worst acting I have seen in a while and you have a recipe for a movie that should never have made it to the screen.Watch the twenty minutes of the actual raid. Discount the inaccuracies in it and then switch off the DVD player. The rest is pure drivel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure that 'summary' has been used many times before to comment on this movie... I was dragged to see (during it's actual run time in the theaters) it by a naive girl. Being a history buff, who has studied the war in great detail (including the attack on Perl Harbor, and the Doolittle raid on Japan), I sat through the entire film with either the look of in-credulousness on my face, or in a fit of laughter (which would have appeared to be inappropriate for any other film dealing with these subjects. Having been born on Long Island, and visited the Mitchell Field area many times (just south of Roosevelt Field where Lindberg took off from) I began my laughing fits at the site of California hills and a modern garbage incinerator in the opening moments of the movie. The fits continued right through to the end of the film, where the 'fighter jocks' suddenly were able to fly B25's off of carrier decks, and had somehow gotten Browning machine guns installed in the nose (which wasn't implemented for another 2 years) and flew the planes like strafing fighters... Granted, almost all of the John Wayne films of the time were not much more than propaganda for the cause, but you wouldn't see anyone switching from PT boats to steering a battleship overnight either.. There should be an award for stupidity in motion pictures (though they might have to instill a 5-trophy limit for Mr. Bay) or institute a law prosecuting the lowering of intelligence of the American people through motion pictures...</fullReview>

Put it all together to make another film, and pretend that it's an original story.OK, yes, some of it is historical, but I'm always amazed that filmmakers feel compelled to do again what has already been done, and then not do it very well, despite spending multi-millions of dollars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie wouldn't of been so bad if it wasn't for the terrible performances from it's leads: Josh,Ben and Kate. Totally to be expected from Ben Affleck though since almost every one of his movies sucks big time.The movie doesn't start getting good til like 2 hour some minutes into the flick when the japs bomb Pearl Harbor and that's really sad. Thank your lucky stars though VCRs and DVD players have fast forward buttons. In this movie you will be needing it unless you want to watch of course a romance between 3 people that was so terribly acted they should really be ashamed. If they wanted an interesting triangle to this dull romance they could of written in a 3 some. Might of well have,probably would of drawn in more interest.After the first half it starts to get better,to watch events that actually happened like some history lesson but with special effects...Yay...to make you forget about the crappy start to this so so movie.This movie wasn't too bad in action and special effects but the chemistry sucks between the actors. How can you get over a guy after 3 months after his death. Can anyone say slut? Harlet's the more appropriate word for Kate Pukingsdale.John Voight was great as always as FDR,even though I read some where FDR didn't actually get up I think he had help or some sh*t like that.The ending where *spoiler alert* one of the lead actors die,I could not have been more gleeful although they killed off the wrong one. If you can stomach the poor romantic performances in the beginning without heaving then you might enjoy this flick. If not then good news there is an option...the fast forward button.</fullReview>

Maybe some parts of the movie could have been a little better though. well in the part of the bombing, some of the bomb effects looked really fake. but how much can you complain since they did have to use CGI and how realistic can you actually make it but it did look a little fake. but other than that everything in that movie was accurate. there was another thing. when the planes first started to fly over and the boys were playing baseball, they were saying that they had the time wrong because why would the boys be playing baseball at around 8 in the morning? but im not sure on that one, its just something i heard or read.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful movie -- Rent Tora! Tora! Tora! instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another movie that I borrowed from the local library. I didn't want to be responsible for a single cent on the bottom line of this travesty.Unless you're a fan of cliché cinema, you can watch the first half of the film on 10x fast forward and not miss a thing. It's essentially the same as Titanic before the ship starts sinking.In theory, the climactic attack sequences should be the crowning glory of the movie. The movie has the benefit of 30 years improvement in special effects technology over 1970s Tora! Tora! Tora!. And yet, I didn't find it as impressive -- At least partially because the digital effects artists got too clever. What was seen in Tora! Tora! Tora! was restricted to what could actually be done with the real airplanes used to shoot the scenes, or in model work. Pearl Harbor doesn't operate under this restriction, and thus the attacking planes do all kinds of absurd things that would never have happened in reality -- I guess because it looked cool. As a result of this, what should be the dramatic highlight of the film ends up coming off like a cartoon, or a cheesy video game. The earlier film, while not having the benefit of recent CGI technology, at least attempts to reproduce the events as they actually happened.If you're looking for a brainless action movie with pretty-boy actors, this will do -- just skip over the first half. If you're interested in history, and want to know what really happened at Pearl Harbor (and equally importantly, why), watch Tora! Tora! Tora! instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK here is the good news, This film is visually amazing as well as the sound and the score. Now for the bad news. first off who came up with this idea because they half ass-ed the script. Many will complain about the inaccuracies and the love story. Im not one to completely criticize those elements because any movie portraying historical events will have plenty of those. The thing i have against this film is an interview that Michael bay did with movie line magazine that had him talking about the formula that made Titanic successful. Put a historical Background with special effects and a love story to bind it together and you got a box office and Oscar giant. Very naive statement there. First off what Titanic did only works once and they tapped into it not to mention that James Cameron completely did the research on everything that was true and what was myth. Why Titanics love story works is because its characters were fiction and only they were fictional. Everything else was fact and the fictional characters did not depict what happened that night. James Cameron was very careful with not letting the love story contradict the historical facts. He guided them around it and bouncing off it but never affecting it. Michael Bay was not so careful with that and it cost him. His naive approach was more about box office and Oscars that he forgot what he was making. For a summer blockbuster i enjoyed it the first time i saw it but only as something entertaining to watch. I don't go to the movies souly to critique the hell out of every film i go to enjoy a cinematic experience unlike some of the people who just come on here to bash films. Peral Harbor is not anywhere the greatest films of all time but its not the worst filming thats ever been displayed you can at least appreciate the effort that was put into this. I came out loving Hans Zimmers score so thats something positive that came from this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular but misconceived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An exhilarating special effects sequence is the showpiece centre of this muddled film. The marriage of a minor army of stunt men, US Military cooperation and the digital midwifery of ILM makes for half an hour of irresistible and affecting excitement. The lovechild of Saving Private Ryan and Titanic - fantastic.Beyond this jaw-dropping central act though is a very confused and, remarkably, cheap movie. The story either side of the attack is designed to contextualise the attack's recreation and give it's participants some purpose. Sensibly no one suggested re-creating the use of atomic weapons in retaliation, which was the ultimate historical consequence (not least as it would have had to upstage the Harbour attack, if only to scale). A gesture of positive outcome, heroism and potential victory is all that can really justify the romanticising of the attack. We are given this... but it just doesn't present any interest. It's a faithful, inevitable but redundant appendage.Talking of redundant appendages, the amalgamated subplot and characters badly cripple the emotional impact inherent in the action. This is the 'cheap' bit; stock characters, script, performances and score gummed together with clichés of every type. I think that the production was probably a little hamstrung by not only concentrating on the action but also the demands of authenticity, respect for the survivors and ultimately the simple fact that $140 million dollars = no risk film-making.An often thrilling but overlong, misconceived freak. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Bay, not the greatest of directors it's fair to say but always blows us away with his action sequences in Bad Boys 1+2 and Armageddon and even Pearl Harbour set's us all up for a great entertainment but with a Story like Pearl Harbour is Michael Bay really the best choice director? In my opinion then answer is no and after first seeing Pearl Harbour I thought he actually did quite a good job. The action was excellent, the sets were very standard and expected, some actors were better than others, I'm talking about Josh Harnett acting the pants off Ben Affleck. Kate Beckinsale was very good as Eve but after viewing it twice there was something definitely concerning me, the script.This film portrays America as people who don't like to admit to their history and what's happened to them in the past. The ego of this gradually gets bigger and bigger the more the film s goes on. One scene in particular that really rubbed me up the wrong way and others that I have consulted with is when Rafe is writing Eve a letter home and a British pilot comes up to him and commends him on his piloting and then says or something along the lines "If Germany goes to war with America, god help them", I'm sure there was a point the screenwriter was trying to make but I sure as hell didn't get it, there are other scenes which I could go on about but I'm sure you already know of them so I will now judge the film on other points.As far as action goes like I said before, it is amazing and the bombing of Pearl Harbour is really a cinematic experience. Everything apart from the Pearl Harbour invasion is very badly directed. It shows that Michael Bay doesn't really have a connection with his actors like Scorsese and De Niro do. The script is nothing but god awful. The dialogue apart from being cheesy is just terrible, it really makes the actors not do a good job when you got someone saying lines like "Japan realised they were no match for America and turn their forces back", what's that all about, it maybe true but there's no need to rub it in, that's just careless and not really something you should put in to a film like this. I was hoping to see a film that would show how much WW2 destroyed so many lives but it just seems to show how great America is and how well they can.This is also the downfall of Ben Affleck. Armageddon was very enjoyable and his cheesy performance was just manageable by Bruce Willis stealing the show but here there is no forgiving him for his bad performance. Towards the end of the film he starts to act well but right up to the moment the Pearl Harbour invasion happens I thought he was poor, Kate Beckinsale wasn't far behind and poor Josh Harnett must have been black mailed into this because I think his performance is the best though has a few moments which I would rather turn my head in embarrassment.Michael Bay's action sequences do save the film but his direction in other places is needed by somebody who knows how to deal with his or hers actors and actresses and get the best of them, Pearl Harbour sadly does not have any sign of that ever happening. It's fair to say that no one's career has gone on to better things since apart from Jerry Bruckhimer and at least he can say "I never directed and starred in it so don't blame me", clever these producers aren't they? Effects can only save this film with a nice soundtrack to go on top but no one will remembering this film</fullReview>

The attack sequences in this movie were second-to-none, and were the main ingredient for what would have been an unforgettable movie. The Japanese fighters approaching over homes and assaulting the naval base for 45 minutes was absolutely sensational. But Hollywood, you blew it with your typical love story crap and the over-hyped American patriotic s*** we're simply tired of on the big screen. Should have ended the flick after the bombing in Hawaii instead of dragging audiences kicking-and-screaming to Japan for the revenge attack. Talk about an anti-climax.

		<fullReview>This is the worst historical drama I have ever seen. Actually there are very few historically accurate facts in the movie. It's essentially a trifling love-triangle romance with some action sequences. The Pearl Harbor attack is just a backdrop. The direction is horrible, the writing is horrible, and the acting is horrible. There are some interesting special effects, especially when the torpedo strikes USS Arizona, but who cares? With a title like "Pearl Harbor", I assumed this was supposed to be a picture about the horror and the heroes, about the event. Instead, it was a sappy love story between three fictional characters. If anything the special effects and melodrama just distracted the audience from the fact that real people actually died. This is a movie for people who know nothing about the harrowing events that took place on December 7, 1941 and don't care to find out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Patriotism" does not justify this miserable script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say first that I really wanted to like this film, despite what I had heard about it. It was much worse than I feared. Jerry Bruckheimer should be exiled to Bombay Films or beyond for producing this overblown piece of garbage and then trying to sell it as a must see patriotic epic.The first hour of the film contains some of the most stilted, cliche ridden dialog I have been subjected to in years. I know the love story was included as a sort of "chickflick within the guy flick " to appeal to female viewers, but the lady I watched it with kept bursting out laughing at the ridiculous cliches spouted by the contrived characters. (Maybe the target audience is really 13 year old girls.) Ben Afflech was incapable of delivering a convincing Southern accent, and many of his lines sounded like they were delivered in a not very good high school play. This has got to be his worst performance ever. Ditto for Alec Baldwin. Jon Voight has the only very good performance as FDR, but he is "lost at sea" in this one.What truly amazes me is that this corn ball script ever made it into production.The inclination to inflated, melodramatic dialog that writer Randall Wallace showed in Braveheart runs totally out of control here. Bruckheimer &amp; Bay must have thought that dramatic lighting, sweeping cinematography, great special effects, and a lot of loud, Dances With Wolves style movie music would turn this turgid Harlequin romance into some kind of a patriotic, misty eyed nostalgia piece. Message to Jerry B., "Garbage in, Garbage out!" But what about the much ballyhooed action sequences? Admittedly, they were often exciting and, at times, inspiring, but IMO, Bay &amp; Bruckheimer once again shot themselves in the foot by wretched excess. For example, they spent millions on a very convincing computer generated recreation of the Japanese attack on battleship row, and then proceeded to intercut fake explosions on unmistakably modern US navy ships that happened to be moored in Pearl Harbor at the time they did the shooting. For a movie that touted itself as "as historically accurate as modern technology can make it", this is the equivalent of having the the Nurses drive around 1941 Pearl Harbor in a red 1968 Corvette in the midst of 1939 Fords. Flashy but totally wrong. How could this happen? Bay's explanation on the DVD is revealing. He says when they saw the modern ships moored in the Harbor, they got Navy permission to stage real explosions on them, so they would have "real ships" blowing up, as opposed, (I suppose) to historically accurate, but computer generated ships that they had already spent millions to destroy in such dramatic and convincing fashion. The contradiction of adding modern guided missle destroyers to 1930s battleships apparently did not trouble anyone. If anything, this reveals a total lack of any real passion about producing an accurate historical depiction of events. That was all just BS marketing talk. The irony is that this movie really didn't even need those extra fireworks. If you have seen the film, you know that, if anything, it has more than enough slam bang explosions and the running time is much too long to support the shallow material. So why add the modern ship explosion shots at all? Because, for Jerry Bruckheimer &amp; Michael Bay, there are never enough explosions. There is never enough loud,melodramatic music. There are never enough golden hued Norman Rockwell shots, piled one on top of another, oozing ersatz atmosphere. There can never be enough heavy handed, manipulative dialog. Because they fear if they let off the sensory accelerator for one second, the audience will snap out of it's stupor and realize that this film has the depth and artistry of an over produced 3-minute MTV video stretched to almost 3 hours. More explosions are better than historical accuracy 'cause the kids like 'em and the audience forgets, for a moment, about the very silly script.. Everytime the fireworks stop in this film, the shallow dialogue and endless cliches proved more deadly to this viewer than Japanese torpedos. IMO, on the DVD, Jerry B's lack of real confidence in the film is painfully obvious. He knows it is a turkey. Ditto for Randall Wallace -- he sounds like a defendant on trial. The special effects are sometimes amazing, but they cannot offset the endless, mind numbing mediocrity of the rest of this shallow film. Some people have said, "well this is an important subject, and Hollywood has to make trade offs to popularize the material and attract a wider audience." Fair enough, but there are good Hollywood epics and bad Hollywood epics, This is a really bad one, being sold as a "must see" because of it's historical content.. Using patriotism to sell second rate schlock is disgusting. I have no problem with pop Hollywood renditions of historical events, if they are reasonably well done. I would recommend "Tora, Tora, Tora" any time over this flick. And, IMO, if you want to see a really good Hollywood war movie, set in this historical period, rent "30 Seconds Over Tokyo." It puts "Pearl Harbor" to shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Awful Waste of Time Ever! *SPOILER ALERT*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* Well, Michael Bay stepped in it again. After producing the stunningly boring HEAT, he moved on to slaughtering every single tragic/heroic feeling ever associated with Pearl Harbor. How anyone in their right mind can watch this film and feel it to be a romantic action movie is beyond me. It is about three hours too long, the romance is poorly written and quite trite to watch and the action sequences want to make you yawn and go home doing income tax returns instead.From seeing the trailers I expected a movie about the events of Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941. A movie about the tragic loss, that was alas necessary to get the US off their collective ass and do their part in World War II (where Europe had already bled for two years). A movie about the event that awakened the slumbering Titan and in actualíty was a major turning point for WW2.What did I get? A run-of-the-mill love triangle that didn't feel the least bit innovative or gave me any feeling of sympathy for the three "soap opera" leading characters. I just couldn't care less about their small problems, when young men and women were about to get their lives cut short in a tragic event or when the rest of Europe experienced far worse. This movie should not have been a Titanic rip-off. Love has its place, as always, but not soap opera one liners and boring repetitions of "I can never look at a sunset without thinking of you". Ewwww!There was about 30 minutes of Pearl Harbour. Hallo! What was the rest of the movie supposed to be about? Apparently not about Pearl Harbor. This movie was merely set in some Americanized version of Hawaii, where apparently someone got killed in the short scene you missed because you took a sip from your soda.I expected far more from Randall Wallace (of Braveheart fame) and something of Michael Bay (Armageddon was at least just that, a film about an Armageddon). What I got was nothing to do with WW2 or Pearl Harbor. It didn't honor the memory of the fallen, the heroes of WW2 or at least attmpt some modicum of historic relevance.I sincerely hope noone watches this movie. Your money is better spent just throwing them out the window - at least they may be found by someone in need and nt just vanish into some producer's fat pockets.1 out of ten (and ONLY because you cannot give a negative score).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse than you've heard - Shows a shameless lack of respect for war that borders on immoral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Congress should pass a law prohibiting both Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer from making films - especially together. With the likes of Armageddon and this film under their belts, who knows what horrors they plan to unleash upon us next?Pearl Harbor is the worse kind of insult to both good taste and intelligence. The characters are 100% lifeless, and they speak mostly in the language of catch-phrases ("Not anxious to die, sir. Just anxious to matter.") and middle school love letters ("You're so beautiful it hurts."). As if to compensate, Hans Zimmer provides an oppressive score to tell the audience exactly what to feel at any given moment. If the music actually spoke, it would say things like "Now is the time to feel patriotic!" and "Why aren't you crying? Can't you tell something sad just happened?" Add to this visuals that, while impressive, are nothing out of the ordinary, and you're left with a movie with a plastic atmosphere.In of itself, this is all bad enough, but Pearl Harbor gets even worse. In strictest terms, it is a war movie - but only because it takes place during a war. The first half of the film is nothing more than bad romantic drama, and, once the raid on Pearl Harbor finally begins, the movie plays less like a period war piece than it does like a bad summer action film (which is precisely what it is). Also, because the movie is rated PG-13, the violence is muted to the point of near-bloodlessness. Now, in a true war classic such as The Bridge on the River Kwai, I can except such muted violence because it is indicative of the time in which it was made. However, to minimize the violence to this kind of an extent in a modern film is unnecessary and therefore an insult to the memory of what truly happened, but Bay and Bruckheimer aren't interested in honoring the memory of those who died. They are interested in making money, and so we get a movie custom-made to be The Biggest Movie of the Summer by playing on the United States' collective patriotic consciousness. Hmmm, makes me wonder how well this will play in other countries.Of course, with all that's already wrong with Pearl Harbor, one cannot expect Bay and Bruckheimer to pay much attention to such small details as historical accuracy and setting. According to Bay and Bruckheimer, Hawaii was, in 1941, a state occupied almost entirely by white people and Cuba Gooding, Jr. And speaking of Cuba Gooding, Jr., while he plays a real historical figure, he is onscreen for a mere six or seven minutes and seems to be in the film only so that Disney can advertise his presence in its commercials. Gooding, therefore, portrays not a character but a marketing tool - the final insult in a movie already overflowing with them. 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big, blundering brute of a film that flashes around as uncontrollably as an unmanned hosepipe on full power.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Isn't it annoying when the boundaries between the war genre and the action genre are blurred to the point that the piece eventually just resembles out-and-out exploitation? Pearl Harbor, or 'Pearl Harbour' to the Brits or further still 'Pearl Harbore' to anyone with any common sense - regardless of nationality, is a film that blurs these boundaries to the point of blindness. It ploughs through the rule book like a freight train slamming through a blockade made out of matchsticks. Pearl Harbor sees war and human misery as an excuse to get across the shock and awe of experiencing bombs dropping around you; gunshots going off mere feet away from you and death and destruction everywhere you turn; all in glorious, soft focus and drenched out cinematography. War films should primarily be war films that sometimes, or might not at all, contain a little bit of action ? Pearl Harbor is an action film that sometimes, or might not even at all, contain a little bit of war.Pearl Harbor etches out just about everything the audience it is aimed at would want out of a film: romance; action; gunfights; comedy; retribution; attractive leads, all in a runtime of about two and a half plus hours; all under the facade of historical non-fiction and real life tragedy. In historical terms, you won't learn anything from Pearl Harbor that you wouldn't be able to pick up off the back of a themed, kiddie orientated cereal box: "This semester: Second World War Trivia!" The latter third of Pearl Harbor reminded me of an old; 1945 made; Spanish produced and propagandist driven piece entitled 'The Last Ones of the Philippines', as this 99 minute piece of drivel about brave, Spanish soldiers defiantly holding up against all the odds in a symbolist-driven location (that being the local church) as various acts of heroism and 'upstanding-ness' are played out.The notion being that war works; war can be a good thing if it means being able to get across what makes a nation, or a nation's attitudes and/or beliefs, 'great'. The catholic driven iconography of the church in said example echoes one such character's eventual demise much later on in Pearl Harbor as we realise he is killed trying to protect a friend whilst tied to a cross ? a fitting iconographic intervention. Whereas the ideology of the poor, brave leads refusing to go down without a fight as they strike back with the Dolittle raids/hold up in the said location suggests a sense of victory/accomplishment even though the overall times for the nation are that of dark ones.I've read about it before, and I'm in agreement on the point that Bay doesn't want to end his film with the Pearl Harbor attack because it's a downer, when Bay's film-making ideology is all about anything but. Generic, Hollywood action films (Pearl Harbor is an action film, remember?), it seems, are supposed to have happy endings. Ending with the darkest hour in America's history (at least up to that point in 2001) is seen as not the way to go. But with hindsight, does United 93 go on for another hour after it ends; further documenting what America did in response to the events explored in that film? Of course not; it's an honourable and harrowing depiction of something that happened, not a glamorous; 'feel good'; action movie designed to excite.The film will eventually see Americans Rafe McCawley (Affleck) and Danny Walker (Hartnett) become pilots, but initially they mix and mingle with one another as young kids. They play on Danny's father's farm in a disused crop-duster, pretending to fly and shoot down enemy planes; essentially capturing Bay's overall attitudes to the war genre, one of which says it is just one big game in which gun fire and dogfights play a large part in 'having fun'. One day, they accidentally take up a real crop duster ? much to father's displeasure, and he berates them in what is one, brief fleeting moment of realisation of how horrid war is; when he recounts what it was like in the trenches of World War One.From here, they follow up on their love of flying by becoming United States Army Air Corps First Lieutenants, all the time under the watchful eye of James Doolittle (Baldwin). This is in between getting involved with some of the nurses after they're all posted to Pearl Harbor, the nurses; of whom represent some of the loosest, dumbest, most flirtatious, most pouting ever seen on film. They are nothing but mere prizes, what with their bright red lipstick and on-screen vibrancy; they exist only to be 'won' by the male pilots and navy personnel - the one that causes the most trouble is Evelyn Johnson (Beckinsale). Along for the ride is Red Winkle (Bremner); an annoying, stammering character whose deformity is nothing but the butt of most jokes; one of which occurs seconds before the Japanese actually attack Pearl Harbor as he blurts "The Japs are here(!)" in what is a monumentally mistimed gag on Bay's behalf.Then there is the attack itself; while technically brilliant, displaying a good awareness of where the planes and boats are in relation to one another, it exists to titillate; to excite: it should be harrowing, but Bay turns it into the film's money shot ? he turns it into the most exciting thing in the film when it ought to be saddest, with the item that is the saddest something else completely un-related to the Pearl Harbor attack. "I think World War Two just started(!)" spouts some idiot character as it all plays out. The film is a monumental misfire; a politically-driven load of clap-trap, with an ideology that reads something like: 'You do not mess with America!', one that sees the Japanese given five seconds of backlog and President Roosevelt, circa 1941, actually stand up and walk. Too bad there was no last stand in a church.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just don't understand why making this movie was necessary. It didn't bring back fond memories, awaken the spirits of Americans, portray events, words or persons accurately. It angered historians, Japanese people and mocked the services and personal of the times and the string of events was ridiculously over drawn, over played and utterly unbelievable. It could have been so much more and was so much less. I could list the inaccuracies, but others have done so much of it already, what would be the point. The historical points of benefit from the moment in time were not even accounted for. The disaster led to a change in Naval warfare, IE, the Pacific War became a Carrier war. How many actual heroes of the times were poorly portrayed and confused as to their roles in life, war and times. It diminishes their contributions. The change in how we collected intelligence for the rest of the war. The real heroes, the 11 Dolittle crew men that died or were incarcerated for the war and how they perished. The incredible luck that the Japanese withdrew from the battle before inflicting incredible damage on fuel and dry dock facilities or caught our carriers returning to Pearl Harbor. Horrible, just Horrible.</fullReview>

The special effects were very nice but the story line and acting was deplorable.This movie was nothing compared to "Tora, Tora, Tora", "Midway", "To Hell And Back", "Saving Private Ryan", etc. This movie was a slap in the face to the great war movies of the last 50 years. It's like a train wreck that never ends and everywhere you turn the same heroes are turning up again and again and again. They participate in every daring mission from England to Japan from 1941 to 1945... They shoot down Japanese planes over Pearl Harbor, participate in Doolittle's raid (massive overacting by Baldwin as Doolittle which is the norm for Alec) and fall in love along the way in the few minutes they aren't daring their lives against the enemy.</fullReview>

It would be laughable were it not about one of the worst days in our history. Sure the battle scenes, top-notch but if we do not care at all about our characters, which is the cardinal sin of any movie were the characters are in constant peril, it's almost a meaningless exercise of lights and sound. I mean come on, does every line have to be from another film, and does every little plot twist (including the ending) have to be telegraphed to us. Here's my advice watch the 40-minute battle scene on you tube, then don't watch the rest. Not quite horrible but it's a bad movie by far and an incredible disappointment.

		<shortDescription>A revised history of WWII by Michael Bay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1. The battle of Britain was fought in 1941 2. Apparently a pilot can convert from a p40 to a spitfire to a bomber without any training. 3. America is the only nation that suffered in WWII. 4. A pilot with no combat experience can easily shoot down seasoned and battle hardened German fighter pilots without so much as breaking a sweat. 5. In the battle of Britain sequence, British pilots used American tactics. 6. American pilots can desert their own air force to fly in another countries air force without a court marshal. 7. Navy nurses decided whether or not US army pilots were allowed to fly. 8. Bomber pilots can crash land and easily defeat war hardened and experienced Japanese infantry.There are many more points, but I wont waste time by writing them down, overall, the worst distortion and alteration of history I have seen since U-571. Completely missing the point by including a silly and unbelievable love triangle, Bay goes further by taking the glory away from 2 real pilots (George Welch and Kenneth Taylor) who shot down 6 - 10 Japanese planes. As for the battle of Britain scenes, oh boy, I knew it would only be a matter of time before some director turned it into a joke, with British pilots kissing the ass of their American saviour, flying in a model of spitfire that wasn't available until later on in the war, and of course by that time the Battle of Britain was already fought and won.Other than some attractive scenes of bombing, dog fighting and destruction in general, don't get the DVD, wait for when its on television, oh and only watch the middle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never before has one of the 'Team America:World Police" songs been so apt. This is one of the worst films that has ever been made. Pearl Harbour is one of the most important events in the the history of the USA yet Michael Bay managed to butcher it completely with an overly and blindly patriotic film interwoven with a hideously written script and awful acting from all of the leads in the film, not even sparred by a former Oscar winner Cuba Gooding who delivers a complete turkey in his version of a 1940's Snoop Dog. This film did not even deserve one star, but I gave it one out of pity. After watching it, you will not feel a deep sense of gratitude for what happened in the war as you do with truly great war films. Instead, you wonder what on earth it is you have just watched. YOu wonder why you wasted such a lot of money on such absolute tripe.First off, Affleck and Beckinsale have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever in this film. Their relationship seems awkward and at times blatantly false. Furthermore, Affleck stooped to an acting low rivalled only by his performance in Gigli, one which did no justice to the first world war. Bay seemed more concerned with getting young American children to salute and to paint the Japanese as animalistic, and the British RAF as completely incompetent, whilst completely ignoring the fact war had been established in Europe and had been raging for a few years before this, epitomised by Dannys (Harnett) awful phrase "I think World War Two just started" after being asked what happened.A script interwoven with horrible clichés which look like they have been taken from just about every war film ever made.To put it simply, Pearl harbour is a film for a blindly patriotic American, and for people who do not need a storyline, or do not need well built characters, or do not need to see good performances and only want to see over done war scenes that prehaps overdo the actual destruction that was done, and turn Pearl Harbour from the provoked retaliation of the Japanese (a point which is overlooked) into the start of a war which pitts the world against the United States.Do not waste time or money seeing this film. And if you do, after reading this and the countless other negative reviews, then you deserve the disappointment that is coming your way.</fullReview>

Then the main character played by Ben Affleck, who is a pilot, volunteers to fight in Britain for the RAF.....he is shot down and presumed dead. His best friend played by Josh Hartnet, is also a pilot but he stays in Pearl Harbor and then falls in love with Ben Affleck character's girlfriend. But Ben Affleck's character is actually still alive and is rescued and comes back and sees that his best friend has betrayed him and has stolen his girlfriend. Now there's a stupid love triangle that is totally worthless to the real focus of the movie. Its about Pearl Harbor!!!!!!! Next you see the over the top but impressive action sequences of the attack on Pearl Harbor that you have waited over an hour for. When the devastating attack is over you presume the movie is over. But no.....now the movie continues as the men of Pearl Harbor train for the famous Doolittle-raid so they can get their revenge and so America ends as a winner..........what a cheap cop out........the last hour of the film, to say the least, is absolutely irrelevant to the plot and film.Terrible acting and Atrocious script!!!!!!!!!!!I would call this the worst war movie of all time but I cannot consider it a war movie..........Pearl Harbor is just a cliché tacky film that is targeted toward ignorant and tasteless moviegoers who want to see America always come out as the winner.</fullReview>

Anyway, what's concerning the movie itself: technically nicely done, but the usual idiotic story (as said) and sentimental, plus the usual US rambos. This time they're two, who basically have been born to fight (and win!) the entire enemy fleet. Well, the US is a super hero nation, that's for sure. It's even more kick butt than Star Wars, but real. We saw it in Vietnam and now other countries, and it won't be last time. Persians, do you hear? I think there's been only about half an hour which isn't totally boring: in the middle of the movie, when the planes torpedo the ships. That's nicely done indeed, even concerning the computer graphics. Maybe one could cut the movie to this half an hour and publish it as director's cut?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't hate "Pearl Harbor" because it starred Ben Affleck, I didn't hate "Pearl Harbor" because it starred Josh Hartnet or because it was directed by Michael Bay or because it was historically inaccurate. I hated it because it was an insult to all these people who've fought and died during the war. Michael Bay had turned this historical event into a summer blockbuster, a date movie, a kiddie movie. It is so horribly dumbed-down that it no longer is a story about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor an event that plays crucial role on the outcome of the war no no. Bay's struck of genius comes stronger than a Hitchcockian plot-twist, he throws in a love story in it. Not confined with just that, he makes it the central aspect of the entire movie. So yeah I guess you could say the attack itself was an added "bonus" to the oh so thrilling romance that occupies two and a half hours of the whole thing.How could you do this wrong? "Saving Private Ryan"'s success opened many doorways and practically reinvented the war movie genre. Demonstrating proper use of effects that add to the overall experience. Spielberg had an eye for detail, he didn't want to discard anything he wanted to show war in it's pure form, in all it's chaos, all it's gory detail. And he did. An attack on the U.S. fleet by Japanese bombers could have been done in the same fashion and skill, but when you get a director whose previous work includes "Bad Boys" I guess you can't really expect that much. Indeed, the small fragment of this overlong, boring, melodramatic, sleep-inducing movie that actually deals with the attack is done completely wrong. Bay directs it like an extended action sequence from "Bad Boys", he doesn't take his time in showing the effects of war on people or showing the darker parts of the bombing (namely blood, gore) no, all he cares is getting that PG-13 rating so that more kiddies will go see it. The scene does not end with that oh no, no it ends when our great action heroes save the day by practically destroying half the Japanese air forces. A lot of explosions and people dying does not make a war, but what does Bay care about he is here to make money. No wonder war-vets left this thing half-way through, it is a disgrace.But let's talk about acting. Yeah let's. Here we have an all star cast of overrated actors and yeah, it's bad real bad. Keanu Reeves would have done better if he had starred in all roles. The romance dialogue is a petty copy of "Titanic"'s while the one concerning the war is filled with overly patriotic lines similar to something we might hear in a John Wayne featurette about the Vietnam war (and by that I do mean the likes of "Green Berets"). Bay could have hired someone directly from the streets and it wouldn't have made a difference, hell he could have even saved some money. But I guess you need the big names to draw in the crowds and since Bay was looking to make lot's of cash he made the right choice.The outcome of all that was no surprise. Money poured in like wild, all the kiddies were coming in to see their favorite actors, watch lots of stuff blow up and laugh at the silly dialogue. While the people to which this should have been dedicated to were left speechless. What better way to show your respect to those who fought for your country, than to turn the death of their comrades into entertainment.Thank you Michael Bay for you have truly outdone yourself with this insulting movie.</fullReview>

And now, now I'm far away and all I wanted to say was Pearl Harbor sucked and I miss you.I heard this song on the film Team America and it made me happy. Everybody loved this film but I hated it. It is clearly not historically accurate and has a little as possible to do whit the Pearl Harbor event. It is clearly made for teenage girls whit Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett as the main characters. My girl friend rented it six times, six times. Why I do not understand?? I went to see this film with a hope of seeing a real war movie. Man was i wrong!!! This movie was so stupid and crappy and lame. OOOHH bbb..b..b..b.omers are coming stutter. American fighter pilots going to Englani during the Battle of Britain never heard of that before , and ohh yes fighter pilots switching to be bomber pilots, thats really smart. There are a lot of other stupid things in the movie but I'm not gonna name em all.All I really want to point out is that Pearl Harbor Sucks and gets no more than 1 star. Absolute total crap</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unparalleled incompetence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon hearing that we would be viewing this movie in our history class, I winced at the idea because I had not heard good things about the movie. However, I was one of those people who decided to try new things, and since we were watching it for history class, I figured it might have some promise. We watched the movie, and after only a few minutes of hearing Ben Affleck's and Josh Hartnet's dialogue, I felt ready to run out of the classroom. Yet I was only to discover that what began as a corny action movie later revealed itself to be an offensive masterpiece.The historical accuracies in this movie are slim to none. Michael Bay even uses freighters and equipment (targeted by the depicted villainous Japanese soldiers) that would not be developed for many years to come. The story's sappy romance and incredibly false acting (save for a much appreciated Cameo of Cuba Gooding Jr.) stands out as a complete annoyance in the movie, yet serves to take away the equally idiotic video-game-like plane fights.But what really is most unsettling is the overall mood of the film: it's an action-filled, romantic, heroic buddy movie. And it's also World War II. This film gives memories to the old John Wayne war movies and it's campy, almost unrealistic attitude with almost a bit of nostalgia, until you realize that this was made in 2001, a time when most people have realized that the subject of war, especially World War II, is not to be fitting for an entertaining popcorn movie. That in itself leaves the viewing standpoint completely uncomfortable, and almost wondering, with lines such as "I think World War II just started!", if the ignorance shown in this movie could possibly be real. The movie is false, campy, sappy, and in many views offensive to veterans who have experienced war firsthand. In addition, the film shows almost no respect to those who died in Pearl Harbor by showing overly dramatic death sequences quickly cut to make room for more time of Ben Affleck with his hair blowing in the wind.Overall, a complete lack of focus on a film as a whole and disregard for important events to make room for intense action sequences. A film hopefully forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor. Another mindless, pointless, emotionless, senseless, &amp; entertainment-less big-budget Hollywood Flop by Micheal Bay. This guy has tanked more movies then.....Ben Affleck, for chrissakes....Why Hollywood even promotes Micheal Bay's mega-flop movies is beyond me. All I gotta see is "A Micheal Bay Film", and I know I'm gonna see lousy acting, over the top special effects that insult your intelligence, slow motion crying scenes with crappy pop music background noise, and most of all, a lousy overall plot.....Since this was based on Pearl Harbor, I had to see it for myself, simply out of respect for those who died there. This could've been a great movie, considering the $100+ million budget. The saddest part of this whole debacle was casting. They cast the two most monotone, emotionless, talentless jerk-offs in Hollywood as the leads, Ben Affleck &amp; Josh Hartnett. These two guys make Frank Stallone and Jim Hanks look like Oscar worthy actors. Over the years Affleck has quickly built his own reputation for ruining big budget movies, and Hartnett is about as likable as a case of hemorrhoids. Unfortunately, these two idiots are in the movie too much for any other part of it to be remotely enjoyable.The actual attack scene was very well shot, but the over the top flying sequences where Ben &amp; Josh turn into the flying Mancini's and start pulling off barnstorming stunts with planes that simply weren't capable, is truly annoying. It's kind of like watching Armageddon, only in 1941. There's virtually nothing believable about the flying scenes. The best parts of the movie are the scenes that neither Josh Hartnett or Ben Affleck are in. The Japanese attack was very good. As well as the storyline of the Japanese command and the American high command. But, as stated, enter the Bobbsey twins, Ben &amp; Josh, and every oz. of respect just flies out the window.Overshadowed by Affleck &amp; Hartnett's lame Bo &amp; Luke Duke imitation, is Kate Beckinsale's performance. Too bad the casting director was on acid when he chose the male leads for this film....Alec Baldwin did a okay Jimmy Doolittle imitation, but once again, the attack on Tokyo with the B-25's storyline was ruined by the presence of Affleck &amp; Hartnett.A great start to this film would've been for Affleck &amp; Hartnett to be failed out of flight school for being idiots, sent to the front line in Germany and killed, then get on with the rest of the movie without them in it.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a failure on part of the cast and crew of the movie when you as a viewer actually get relieved when the Japanese finally bomb Pearl Harbor. I don't think that was their intention.It is also an affront to those who participated in the real events to push the cliches and stereotypes in the story so far that it reminds you more of Monthy Pythonesq comedy than a historical war drama.Many others have pointed out all factual errors, the bad script, the over bearing acting and so forth so I'll simply leave it at that. What puzzles me is that the makers of P. H. failed despite that they could have done so much better by simply allowing inspiration from movies like "The Thin Red Line" and "Saving Private Ryan". If not else to create character that you might care about.With the kind of budget Bruckheimer &amp; Co provided there is no excuse for setting the standard lower.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so just a quick rant here, but imagine if 50, 60, 70 years from now filmmakers make a movie about 9/11; except, instead of it being about 9/11, it's a dumb soppy romance that has nothing to do with 9/11 itself. Wouldn't you be just a little p***ed off? I know I would be. Taking a horrible tragedy and turning it into an insanely stupid movie with a lame romance story would be terrible.Now imagine that that tragedy actually took place 50, 60, 70 years ago, and that the insanely stupid movie was released today. As a matter of fact, make it be Pearl Harbor. Oh, wait, THEY ALREADY DID THAT. Talk about totally disgracing and disregarding a horrible tragedy. Good job, guys; now let's watch you make fun of disabled people.Anyway, that's just my little rant. Now back to the movie...It was sh!t. The romance was stupid, the acting subpar, and the writing was like jamming a screwdriver into your brain through your ears. The only decent thing about it was the special effects, but since many other movies have just as good if not better effects, that's probably not a good reason to see it.I don't recommend this film at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>History tells a story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Pearl Harbor, the movie is based on real events, but no one likes the story line. Which is understandable but the audience should look at the history as informing and exciting, rather than booing the movie as a whole. There are varieties of historical films such as history as drama, history as anti drama, history without heroes, and postmodern history. History dramas are mainly produced to tell a story, these films are produced to appeal to the audience in a way of the historical setting is intrinsic to the story line and meaning of the work. Like, how Pearl Harbor told a love story to appeal more to a certain audience. Historical films want to make the audience think that they are reality. Meaning, the technology advancement has placed bits and pieces together to represent the reality of what is being presented. Like when the Japanese were attacking the bay. There were many visual effects of bombings and aircrafts and bullets flying everywhere to seem like it was from 1941. This movie to me was a great depiction of history, and the story line was really dramatic but it still was an all around good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Pearl Harbor' is a biopic which recounts the events of that tragic day on December 7th 1941, where the Japanese bomb the historical American base.1. In the vein of 'Titanic', 'Pearl Harbor' has the same effect of having a fictitious love story in the midst of a factual tragedy. This time around, it comes in the pairing of Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale (who do make a cute on-screen couple to be fair). Keep in mind, the movie is 3hrs long so we mainly get scenes with the both of them at the beginning and near the end. The love story works well up until we get to the awkward and forced love-triangle involving Josh Hartnett. This is the unnecessary weight of the film that could easily be trimmed down to save on running time. Let's summarize the romance shall we? Your best friend (Affleck) aids the British army, is presumed dead after his plane crashes, you (Hartnett) use that as an opportunity to make a play on his mourning girlfriend (Beckinsale), then unknowingly get her pregnant after a month of having unprotected sex in Hawaii.2. If there's one thing Michael Bay knows, it's action. Every action and battle sequence in this film is highly intense and really captures the feel of what this war could have been like. The theatrical version is tamed to a certain degree, but the director's cut is Rated-R and shows tons of blood and gore. Of course, the actually bombing of Pearl Harbor occurs in the 2nd hour of the film after the campy stuff.3. The acting is nothing spectacular with the exception of Alec Baldwin and Jon Voight, who play Lt. Doolittle and President Roosevelt respectively. Affleck, Beckinsale and Hartnett are the leading characters (with the latter being the weakest) that we follow as the film progresses. If nothing else, I know women would like the romance in this film more than the guys.'Pearl Harbor' is an okay/down-the-middle type film and nothing else. Michael Bay delivers on the action and Hans Zimmer provides the breath-taking score to follow. Love it or hate it, but it exists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best war film but not totally unworthy either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the mid-1990s, it was a big time for director Michael Bay. After successfully making three action blockbusters with Bad Boys (1995), The Rock (1996) and Armageddon (1998), producers thought that Bay would be the next best director to handle another blockbuster made film. However, this movie came in the form of a more delicate topic and that was the tragedy of Pearl Harbor. On December 7, 1941, Japanese forces landed a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. An event that took several by surprise and shock, the infamous day would forever be remembered as the day the US would enter World War II. This particular event isn't per-say something anyone would want to revisit. After all, this movie would be released 60 years after the actual tragedy. Yet the film was made anyway. As for those who know what Michael Bay is capable of, some may be a bit leery of how he handles such a touchy issue. Well, he actually does both. He doesn't make it insultingly terrible but he also misses the point on some degree too.Randall Wallace wrote the script to this war drama. Wallace was also known for The Man in the Iron Mask (1998) and more notably Braveheart (1995). Here, Wallace flubs a bit on what exactly what is more important. Pearl Harbor actually takes a backseat and yet this is what the title clearly states what it should be about. Instead, viewers are introduced to Capt. Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Capt. Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett), two young men who enjoy nothing but flying planes and looking to go fight for their country. Of the two, Rafe is the older one and acts like an older brother to Danny. As they grow up, they enlist into the air force. Rafe ends up meeting Nurse Lt. Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale) during physical exams. As to what happens between these three, it is fairly obvious as to what becomes of them. If you have two male and one female lead, there's not much else to be said. The love subplot just feels too cliché to have for this movie. What war film fans usually enjoy is the struggle of living through the bad times. Look at Steven Spielberg in Saving Private Ryan (1998), Ronald F. Maxwell in Gettysburg (1993) or even Edward Zwick in Glory (1989). All these films focused on characters that had their own separate lives given through carefully written backstories. This gave a better picture of the people involved in the overall time period where the event took place. Here, Pearl Harbor feels like more of pawn in this love story than vice versa. This is the area where Michael Bay doesn't quite get it. It has been clearly stated by him that he liked the love story but giving it all the attention was not the right direction. Apparently, Bay also included some historical inaccuracies that angered both US and Japanese veterans. If a filmmaker is going to make a war film, there has to be some decency to keep the facts right. It's also understood everything may not come out right but at least try not to make it controversial.This is about it though. The acting itself is fairly acceptable from both sides of the war. The cast is also packed with a lot of familiar faces. Ewen Bremner from Guy Ritchie's Snatch. (2000), plays one of Danny and Rafe's fellow pilots. There are also appearances from Alec Baldwin, Jaime King, Jennifer Garner, Jon Voight (as FDR), Cuba Gooding Jr., Michael Shannon, Dan Aykroyd, Makoto Iwamatsu and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. For the most part these actors are far less involved but still have a significant amount of time. The chemistry between Affleck and Hartnett feel real; they certainly act and behave like brothers a number of times. It is bit weird seeing Affleck talking with a southern accent though. Beckinsale's chemistry with the two works as well but the blatant overuse of her role as the main storyline may make her annoying to some. It's not say that love stories didn't exist during the events of Pearl Harbor but making it the star of a tragedy seemed in poor taste.The special effects and action are nicely executed though. This is a Michael Bay film so that should be at least natural for him. Even more appreciated is that Bay doesn't go overboard on his pyrotechnics either. Really the only big set piece is the attack on Pearl Harbor and although it isn't as graphically realistic, it is still difficult to watch. War is ugly and that's exactly what Bay gets right. Everything dealing the impending danger is accurately displayed with none of Bay's comedic shtick people loathe him for. The camera-work handled by John Schwartzman (Armageddon (1998) &amp; Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009)) is decent too. Occasionally Schwartzman will use shaky camera to emulate first person but that's it. The rest is smooth with wide panning shots. Lastly the music by Hans Zimmer is memorable too. Again although the love story should not have been of main focus, Zimmer has a great theme for that and the Japanese Empire. Well done.Pearl Harbor is an event nobody should forget and for much of the long running time, it's not focused on a lot. The writing and direction focuses more on the love story than the event itself. If that's the case, then just change the title. However, Michael Bay thankfully omits his usual humor and abundant explosions in exchange for more control. The music, camera-work and depiction of war are nicely done too. Just don't expect Pearl Harbor to be around a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Bay's World War II is entertaining, yet deeply flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the past two decades now, Michael Bay has been known littering his films with countless explosions, and with this heavy special effects, garners wide success at the box office. Here, Michael Bay steps into the war genre with this intense, dramatic retelling of the fateful event that pulled America into World War II in the 1941. Set near the dawn of World War II, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett play Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker, two Airforce soldiers who have been best friends since childhood. As they grow up, they are caught in a love triangle when they both fall in love with beautiful nurse named Evelyn (played by Kate Beckinsale). Things get pretty complicated when Danny and Evelyn are transferred to Pearl Harbor where Rafe returns from fighting overseas in Great Britain to find the two are in a relationship. Next morning, December 7, Danny and Rafe wake up to find hundreds of Japanese fighter pilots dropping bombs on Pearl Harbor. The two friends arm themselves with the F-51s in attempt to fight off against the Japanese fleet. With the U.S naval base devastated and thousands of innocent lives lost, the U.S declares war against war. From there on, Dafe and Rafe and their army lead by Lieutenant Colonol James Dolittle (played by Alec Baldwin) prepare for a fight against Japan to overcome their country's catastrophic defeat. This film also features Cuba Gooding Jr. who plays Captain Dorie Miller, the first African- American in history to be awarded the U.S Navy Cross.The bombing of Pearl Harbor was one of the most shocking moments in the history of America, and it makes interesting subject matter to be told on on screen. Although this movie does manage to paint the horrors that took place during that fateful day, this film does suffer from some flaws that director Michael Bay is often known. Now with a war movie being directed by Bay, audience should go into this movie expecting abundance of explosions and this film plenty of these during the 40-minute action sequences that takes place during the attack on Pearl Harbor. The entire scene is very well done and the special effects are great. The scene really captures the grim details of what the civilians of Pearl Harbor suffered through as we watch countless of people killed from gunfire and drowning, as well as others who suffer some gruesome injuries. This entire scene is quite difficult to watch and it really pulls at your heart strings. Now here is where the film falters. Along with the whole Japanese attack and its aftermath, audiences are treated with a romantic subplot involving Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck, and Kate Beckinsale that takes up a good portion of the film. What we get from this is poor acting and cheesy dialogue between Affleck and Beckinsale, including a line "I love you so much it hurts", a line that is highly laughable and far too corny, especially when dealing with a war flick. The whole love story is not terrible, but definitely takes more than what is needed of the film. With the whole story, the film ends up running 183 minutes. Pearl Harbor is certainly not one of the best war movies in Hollywood and definitely not the best of what Michael Bay has to offer. I feel that this could have done better if it was handled someone like Steven Spielberg who has been masterful with the World War II genre (Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List). Overall, this is film is not terrible. Despite some of its flaws, it still works and is entertaining to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Always there is a stupid love story sub-plot, even in Titanic. Paradoxically, I can love a movie and hate it at the same time. Other cases in point are: "10 Commandments" and "GWTW" (inane story-lines and a depressingly bad 2nd half of GWTW). So it is here, also. A great Movie Blockbuster, with great digital efx, but a lot of technical and historical errors. E-2 aircraft in the background, (an anachronism) plus right-on recreations of famous newsreel footage, frame-for-frame. Switches color-timing-b/w all over the place. "Potboiler footage" with simulated sexual situations about fictional (?) heroes and sweethearts. Some really gripping action and dog-fighting but it's just too blasted long! I usually have to watch it in two sessions, which is the "beauty" of discs vs. tapes! Chapter selection helps also! Some directors don't know how to edit for time. Stanley K. and Jerry B. sure don't! Has 2 distinct endings, as it follows another famous epic warplane-battle, right after Pearl Harbor. That part is almost like watching an entire 2nd movie. It's nice, but unnecessary to the main story. Sometimes I end the movie there, just for that reason.</fullReview>

I will say this: I did enjoy the film even if it was a wee bit long (but that's okay, since it is a war movie). My only issue was the relationship between Hartnett and Beckinsale's characters. Your best friend dies in the war and the first person you think of hooking up with is his girl? There are literally plenty of other fish in the sea. When Afleck's character returned, I had to slap the space bar on my laptop and laugh at the sticky situation these two new lovebirds found themselves in.As I said previously, I am not entirely sure about how accurate this movie was in portraying the historical events of Pearl Harbour but judging from many other reviews, I'm guessing the producers didn't do the best job at the keeping the film accurate. But yet again, in their defence, if you want accuracy then you should go hit some documentaries.But I must say this: Affleck and Hartnett's portrayal of the relationship between two best friends was spot on. There wasn't a time when I felt as though their friendship was forced. What was also touching was Affleck's tendency to want to protect his best friend. We see this in the beginning of the film when as children he displays this characteristic by slamming his best friend's dad on the head with a plank. However, tables turn when Hartnett's character literally takes bullets for his best friend.I will admit that I did cry a little (okay, a lot) at the end of the movie because it dawned on me how unfair life can be. I found myself frustrated at how everyone's plans did not work out the way they wanted. But that's just me. I tend to think a little too deeply at times. The movie is good. Apparently not historically accurate, but good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine drama/romance combined with great war action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pearl Harbor" (2001) is a Titanic-ized version of the tragic events of Pearl Harbor -- a fabricated drama/romance hooking the viewer into the deceitful attack of December 7, 1941. It's 85 minutes before the attack occurs so the dramatic-romantic part of the story BETTER be good, and it is -- and it's believable too (except for the premature sex part, which inaccurately transfers modern sex morals to the early '40s). This first act successfully brings us back to the era of the early '40s and sets the stage for the attack. I didn't think there would be any action until the big attack but I was wrong, as we see some quality action when Rafe (Ben Affleck) goes over to Europe to fly for the British. Believing him to be dead, his girlfriend (Kate Backinsale) and best friend (Josh Hartnett) spend a lot of time together and naturally develop a relationship; but ***SPOILER ALERT*** Rafe miraculously survives, which leads to some more action ***END SPOILER***.Many criticize the acting and dialogue of the drama, but I found nothing wrong with it. In fact, I found it quite well done and realistic. For instance, the film shows that Danny (Hartnett) was abused by his father while growing up. Later while dancing &amp; drinking Evelyn (Beckinsale) comments to Rafe how shy Danny seems to be while Danny is shown just sitting at a table too shy to talk to a girl or ask someone to dance. Rafe responds that Danny is like a brother to him, that Danny's father abused him and he therefore lacks confidence. This is REAL, my friends. Much later, after it is believed that Rafe is dead, Danny goes to Evelyn's apartment fumbling &amp; stumbling to ask her out. The conversation is, of course, awkward. He then walks away, speaking under his breath, "You're such an idiot!" This is good, realistic stuff.The film also shows that the timid average-looking man (Danny) can win the heart of a beautiful woman just as well as the confident handsome man (Rafe). It's simply a matter of passion, patience, risk, humble pie and playing your cards right.As for the Pearl Harbor attack, it's a full 30 minutes of great war footage. Critics argue that there are many historical inaccuracies in the film, but what? -- Go ahead and state them. Seriously, what is so historically inaccurate in the film? I'm sure there are a few minor inaccuracies (maybe Jimmy Doolittle's boot laces weren't right -- Oh my God!!), but what film ever has everything 100% right? They for certain got the gist of the event right, what more do you want? Get a life.You want accuracy? The subplot with Cuba Gooding Jr. as the winning Navy boxer Doris Miller is a true story. Research it, it's a fascinating story.The film is also respectful of the Japanese' viewpoint as they plan, prepare for and carry out their attack. I felt this was generous on the filmmakers' part since nothing can justify their deceitful and cowardly assault. They spoke with forked tongue of peace while planning the unprovoked aggression.There's also a great scene showing the Japanese pilots the night before the raid, praying and psyching up for the attack. It's very realistic.After the attack I knew there was a good 50 minutes left in the film so I was apprehensive regarding the remainder of the story; not to worry, though, as this final act compellingly details The Doolittle Raid, the first American bombing mission over Japan. More great war action.I never even knew about this bold bombing mission until I saw this movie. It took place a mere 4.5 months after the Pearl Harbor attack on April, 1942. The raid is notable in that it was the only time in U.S. military history that bombers were launched from an aircraft carrier. 16 modified bombers with five-men crews successfully bombed 10 military and industrial targets in and around Tokyo. Unfortunately this was a one-way mission and they were forced to fly to mainland China to land, crashland or bail out, IF they had enough fuel, that is. Most of the Americans made it to China and safety with the help of Chinese civilians and soldiers. They paid dearly for helping, however, as it is estimated that the Japanese killed 250,000 Chinese, vengefully searching for Doolittle's men! What evil bastages!! Incidentally, Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle is greatly portrayed by Alec Baldwin in the film and, true to history, the picture shows Doolittle taking part in the daring mission. More historical accuracy.Some criticize that the Doolittle Raid doesn't belong in the film, but nothing could be further from the truth. If all the movie showed was the Pearl Harbor attack and the immediate aftermath it would've ended on a real downer. Showing the successful Doolittle Raid makes the film end on a positive note. What effect did the raid have at the time? It caused American moral to soar from the depths to which it had plunged after Pearl Harbor. It has the very same effect on modern viewers.CONCLUSION: In light of all the criticism I kept waiting for "Pearl Harbor" to stumble and fail, but it never happened -- there's not one misstep. Yes, the viewer has to be open to and patient with the opening drama/romance as it leisurely unfolds, but this just helps make the viewer CARE about the characters before the tragic events inevitably occur. I'm not a fan of Michael Bay. I d have zero interest in seeing the "Transformers" films, but this is fine movie-making. It provokes interest in the events and inspires the viewer to research them in more detail.GRADE: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was a Day of Infamy when this movie came out. This made up movie is an insult to those who died on Dec. 7th 1941. Still, it's not the worst movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is a pretty awful movie looking back at it, but it was a successful box buster movie. It was kinda insulting to the veterans and those who live around the tragedy event. Directed by Michael Bay, and written by Randall Wallace. It feature a story straight out of badly written soap opera romantic novel. In my opinion, it's seem like a badly written remake or reimagining of 1953's From Here to Eternity. I would love for the film to focus more on the realistic story of those soldiers who died trying to protect our country that day, than those make believe characters with an unrealistic over the top love story that has nothing to do with the real events. I know Michael Bay wanted to graphically portray the horrors of war and was not interested in primarily marketing of mixing tragedy with romance aimed for the young adult PG-13 audience, but with the success of 1997's Titanic. Michael Bay pretty much sold out, and went with the studio ideas. Still, there is a Rated R version DVD out there, if you want to see that. The story goes like this, two fighter pilots, Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) and Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) are both under the command of Major Jimmy Doolittle (Alec Baldwin). Rafe happens to have an Army Nurse girlfriend, Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) who he loved, but based on what we see on screen, seem to rather spent time away from her and mistreat her. Rafe go off to fight in RAF outfit for American pilots to fight during the Battle of Britain and presumed killed in action. Meanwhile, Danny, Evelyn and the rest of their fellow pilots and nurses are transferred to Pearl Harbor, as Danny and Evelyn move on. Both fall in love with each other, until Rafe return making it a love triangle. The love triangle is god awful trite and how they solved the rush love story wasn't the greatest ending at all. It had cop out end to the film. It wasn't until ? in the film, that 'Pearl Harbor' the movie really became about the Pearl Harbor attacks by the Japanese Empire. I do have to say, the Pearl Harbor attack scenes were very well done, action pack while giving the emotional trauma of that day. Still, there were some historic inaccuracy and major factual misrepresentation of the facts in such things like the Doolittle Raids and how Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr) should be portrayed. Like many historical dramas, Pearl Harbor provoked debate about the artistic license taken by its producers and director. The biggest is the use of fictional replacements for real people. One of the biggest faults is replacing the real pilots, George Welch and Kenneth M. Taylor with the two leads played by Affleck and Hartnett who took to the skies during the Japanese attack and, together, claimed six Japanese aircraft. The pilots could be more realistic in tone, if the film didn't take great liberties on making them look a silly caricature of what romantic movies think military pilots should look like. Not only do they endanger their airplanes, and themselves playing a game of chicken, but they are allow to take citizen on war planes to see sunsets over the harbor and afterwards have sex in the parachute hangar. Plus, they are dyslexic and one is squinty all the time. Excuse me, if I did that. I would be in jail and no way, a pilot! I do have to say, the portrayal of the Japanese were pretty well done. I see no faults in that. All the supporting actors were very good. Mako Iwamatsu and Dan Aykroyd were interesting. I have to say, Jon Voight as President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the closest thing to FDR coming back alive. Another thing good about the movie was the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, and the song by Faith Hill, 'There You'll be". In my opinion, there is no way to have a throwback World War II movie like the pre-Saving Private Ryan old days. Yes, the movie is full of war movie clichés, some good, some stale. America patriotism was written all over the film, like we single-handed won the war by ourselves. I didn't mind it, yes it somewhat true. I don't have that much of a quarrel with the idea of framing a standard romance between fictional characters with true historical events like other WWII drama like 1996's English Patient or From Here to Eternity is a fine film set on Oahu during the months leading up to Dec. 7, 1941. Still, it's not a good idea. Overall: It wasn't the worst war movie ever. There are better movies set during the Pearl Harbor attack that better serve the public. Go watch a few documentaries, if not watch 1970's Tora! Tora! Tora! As it turns out, this disaster flick is both bomb and was the da bomb in the box office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love-Hate relationship with plenty dislike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is a tough one for me. On one hand I fall victim to the scenery, the set pieces, the historical relevance and time setting, and Kate Beckinsale - but mostly the first three. Like many history buffs, I love a good WWII set film, and the 1941 environment in beautiful Hawaii is so visually pleasing, it can easily be the focus of your attention as a movie goer.Then there's the acting, the shotty love story (and although I'm no feminist nor a chauvinist, the story doesn't portray Kate Beckinsale's character in a very positive light as a female), the clichés and the historical inaccuracy and utter absurdity i.e. Dan Aykroyd sitting in some intelligence room just "not buying" what he's reading on the decoding machines. At many times it's difficult to sit thru, similar to the complete cheese content of Top Gun.As far as the actual action shots go (and I use the term action not in reference to the action film genre, but just scenes in which battle action takes place) they are not nearly as poorly done as other films. There is a good amount of live action material so the viewer is not overwhelmed, or should I say underwhelmed, by CGI nonsense. The P-40 or Spitfire scenes are fun and interesting to watch, although not all that accurate, but they still are visually pleasing. Much more true to life than the likes of, say, Red Tails.In the end, I think the only reason Pearl Harbor squeaks by with a 6 is the setting, the beautiful visuals of the island of Hawaii or the 40's set pieces, and the massive historical relevance of the Pearl Harbor incident.All of those positives must be actively searched for while wading thru piles of canine excrement in the form of sub-par acting and God-awful clichés (Josh Hartnet's "I think WWII just started" is repeatedly mentioned and rightfully so) along with many historical and factual inaccuracies, all of which are easily pointed out by anyone that knows much of anything about history, aviation technology etc.6 out of 10 solely for the setting and historical story behind all the terribly "Hollywood stuff".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the Doolittle Raid section</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the 3+ hours of Pearl Harbor a full 1+ hour is spent not on the attack on Pearl Harbor but on the Doolittle Raid, America's ineffective but highly symbolic revenge raid on Japanese cities. It should be a separate movie, and was obviously added by the studio to keep American audiences from feeling depressed at the end of the Japanese victory on Hawaii. Maybe a good business decision, but it was a poor dramatic decision.The 1944 movie 30 Seconds Over Tokyo, with Spencer Tracy as Doolittle, already covered this story, although thankfully without trying to mix it with a silly love triangle. In several ways the old movie outdid the new one, mostly because it didn't use some of the terrible techniques that are spoiling so many movies for me these days. The main thing it avoided is the constant use of quick cuts, one camera shot replacing another after only a few seconds, supposedly to increase the sense of excitement. Unfortunately, it detracts from much of the pleasure of watching this kind of movie, the kind of thing I always enjoy, such as prolonged views of the aircraft and the carriers, the views from the air, a chance to look around and see some of the background details that may be completely miscellaneous but which add to the sense of reality, even if they're not exactly what the director wants us to focus on. The audience can also see that the real purpose of a lot of quick cuts is sometimes to hide things from us, to avoid showing a plane really gunning its engine for a while, trying harder and harder to get up to full power, then taxiing and taking off a short runway, for example, or a real view of Tokyo from the air. Pearl Harbor certainly does offer a lot through the use of computer graphics, but even then it does so only in fits and starts, in scenes that flash by too quickly to enjoy. In 30 Seconds Over Tokyo we fly with the crews for several minutes over the wave-tops toward Japan, the engines roaring in our ears, while in Pearl Harbor the trip is done in a couple of quick cuts. Remember the Bruce Lee movies when martial arts were actually performed in front of the camera and you could see exactly what was happening? Today it's all done through quick cuts and film editing, and you know you're being cheated as you see one snippet of a kick, then another snippet of a back flip, both put together in such a way as to suggest an amazing, continuous action--but it's completely faked.Please, Hollywood, stop with all the quick cuts. Let us actually LOOK at something!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a incredible portrayal of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The movies' love story personalizes this historic event and connects you to the characters and what they are going through. The actual attack on Pearl Harbor was beautifully portrayed and was absolutely devastating. When the men and women died I cried like a baby, even the characters I didn't know caused me to cry. The way it brought to life the attack made me almost want to join the military to avenge the people who died there. It showed how horrible an event that it was. The movie was pretty long but it didn't ever feel like the movie was dragging.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the rest of the movie is going on my TV near my pc, I read the first commentary, and could not agree more with the last hour being a wast of time. But till the end of the bombing of PH it is a fairly good watch, especially if you've got one of those larger screen, it comes up quite neat. I had a little trouble to spot John Voight and did need midb to confirm he was... well by process of elimination I actually got it right. I did not mind either the romantic side of it, the improbable situation was a little uneasy to accept for me although I admit in such a mess as a war lot of things are possible and reality at time may surpass fiction. My last remark is about the second entry, I think (jan 2003), Some guy from London must have had in mind to dazzle other readers with his summary in French. I can assure you it does not make any sense and it's just as well because if it did and was offensive, it seems the moderator would have missed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, the errata: Dorie Miller wouldn't have been flirting with Evelyn.Dorie Miller died on a ship a few years after the attack and received his medal posthumously. He did, however, fire the 50-cal and it is believed he shot down one or two planes. His captain also survived in real life.Oh yeah, people smoked. A lot. They also played poker.No nurses died in the attack.The Doolittle raid was tidied up for Hollywood.While factual, I still do not believe that Jon Voight could ever have sired Angelina Jolie, but give the man props for his creation. His acting? He said it best in the movie, after the attack: "How bad?" It is true that America scrambled a few fighter jets and shot down a few Japanese planes. This may have been one of the reasons that the third wave was called off (Japan suffered 29 casualties).The plot? The first half is "From Here To Eternity" while the second is Tora Tora Tora. The action scenes of the attack, which run a full twenty minutes, save the film. You really get a feel for what it was like to be bombed like that. Where the film almost, but not quite, perishes, is how it attempts to insert a chick-flick into a war movie. The result is what I imagine it would taste like to mix milk and orange juice, two things which are fine on their own but not pleasant when combined.The movie's other main strength was in its portrayal of the Japanese as an honorable nation that felt it had to conduct this war to preserve its place in the world. We have certainly done this ourselves, and the film also captured the sense of total victory experienced by the Japanese pilots, many of whom are now interviewed for documentaries on the war. One cannot help but respect the efficiency of the attack, including how the Japanese altered their torpedoes so they could navigate the shallow waters of Pearl Harbor. Without question, we got our tails kicked good, and from a military standpoint, it was one of the most lopsided battles of all time.The movie chose to end with the Doolittle raid, but it would have been smarter to give minor screen time to that attack, and more to the role it played in our winning the Battle of Midway, which was the true turning point of the war. That battle was won by mere seconds, as our bombers beat the refueling Japanese bombers to the attack by a whisker.The film is a good way to show a historical event to a young audience that can smooth out the inaccuracies in the history books or on the internet. The cast could have been stronger, but Affleck (Rafe), Hartnett (Danny), and Beckinsale (Evelyn) do not drop the ball while carrying the film. Jennifer Garner as the mousy Sandra was an interesting performance, especially in light of her future stardom. Dan Akroyd as the decoder was convincing as only he can be. It was good to see an SNL alum play his role well in such a big-budget feature.Watch it on cable if you're an adult, and keep the DVD around for the children for when they have a history bug. At 3:20, they'll be occupied all evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe this did honour the dead. I understand war veterans were invited for special screenings and were moved by it. Most people who saw this were not personally affected by the tragedy so have little care for the dead unless it is rammed home to them. It's all very well for posters here to fake sympathy (this is programmed into us) but you can't be genuinely sympathetic if you didn't know them personally. Thousands of people die every day. I would also argue it isn't healthy to be too personally affected just because they were working to defend the beloved country. At least here the film brings it home to the viewer who wouldn't have cared otherwise, what actually happened. The gripping attack sequence was a major chunk of the film.I personally like this style of movie directing. I consider it similar to Paul Verhoeven's work. It doesn't need intellectualising on any great level but is great to watch. There is no need to remind the viewer it is a movie as it is obvious.If this was made into a more serious work, then the performances would have to change. I understand people's objections, and am surprised the average score is quite high given their obvious concerns but they should remember that this is a movie made for entertainment and not as a historical dramatisation.I went to see this with a gf who was sceptical about watching it but nothing else really appealed. Although she was sure she'd hate it, she loved it and was very emotional during it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor isn't really that bad a movie. Yes, it is far too referential about the Hollywood and WWII clichés. Yes, the most important attack upon the US during WWII is wrapped around a love story and the lifes of two farmboys is a backstory that goes on far too long and doesn't really get to the hart of Pearl Harbor - it would have been better if they'd focused on the political developments and intelligence failures that preceded it. Yes, this movie was written by the same guy (Randall Wallace) who gave us Braveheart and We Were Soldiers (notice how similar wifes/love-interests Madeleine Stowe and Kate Beckinsale look). And yes, there is some painful dialogue (especially Nicholas Farrell as the RAF officer - he looked like he was drowning his distaste for the lines he had to say in a pint of beer).However, when all is said and done, you're left with a pretty well done yarn, nothing great, three attractive leads. Although with a budget like this, I guess much of the disappointment comes from the producers not paying more attention to the storyline and the script. One problem is that because so many movies have been made about world war 2 over the last half century, it is difficult to avoid the clichés (the conflicted love story, the dead soldier who really isn't, even the stammering guy to whom it falls to announce the Japanese attack, although that _is_ pretty funny - you've seen it all ten times before).The battle scenes however are very good. But, as this movie is intended to lift spirits, it can't be just about the kicking the US Navy received during Pearl Harbor (like for instance A Bridge Too Far is just about Market Garden). So, the Doolittle Raid is tacked on, taking up the last half hour, allowing Alec Baldwin to reprise his role from Glengarry Glen Ross.What is also good about this movie is that it shows at least two Japanese Americans working for the US military and also includes the story of Dorie Miller, a Black sailor who without specific training manned his ship's machine gun and shot down 6 Japanese bomber planes (3 of which were officially acknowledged), at a time when the Navy tried to keep Black troops out of active service.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most touching movie about friendship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What endears this film to me is the human aspect of it. Yeah, sure the special effects are great and everything, there's no denying that. SPOILERS You see people being bombed in the movie, you see suffering, you see destruction, you see death, you see pain. You see Danny and Rafe, caring for each other, and how gutted Danny was over the supposed death of Rafe. But when a girl comes between them and Rafe returned from the dead, their friendship came under the ultimate test. Both friends were torn between the other and the girl. During the Japanese attacks, you see how Rafe still worry about the safety of Danny, even though the latter had broken his heart. Rafe took the nobler position however, by acting like a big brother to Danny, relenting over the girl. He even persuaded Danny not to go on the Dolittle mission, trying to protect Danny as he always had when they were kids.Come the Dolittle bombing, their planes crashed in China. Danny's plane crashed later, and we see Rafe running towards him without a care for his own safety, testament to the bond of brotherly love between the two. When Rafe tried to release Danny from the capture by shooting the Japanese, he ran out of bullets. It was Danny's turn to manifest his love to his buddy, by sacrificing himself - he stood between Rafe and the bullets meant for him. In the last moments of his life, we see Danny agonizing in pain as Rafe, by this time in tears, tries to relieve him. We see the brotherly love between two friends that does not come often even between real brothers. Truly a touching movie about a friendship with a tragic end, though one I would dream to have.</fullReview>

By the time we'er following the bomb down to the ships deck, they had me. Trouble is, WW2 was still big news, much talked and written about when I was a kid, 20 years ago, so I not only recognized the vessel under attack (the Arizona, I built a little plastic model of it once), but I have heard and read the Presidents speech at about 7 minutes and NOT re-written. Ouch. How did that happen? Why? I would have handeled the whole thing so much differently. About 40 minutes of this movie are computer-graphic and live action combined to re-create actual events so we can watch what they might have looked like. No problem. Call me ghoulish but I'd pay to see it. There are also about 40 minutes of really good service comedy/drama. Then there are 40 minutes of stuff I don't care to remember. Corny, fake. Too bad we didn't get two 90 minute movies. One a grim anti-war picture that would make strong men weep, and a really fun movie about crazy nurses socializing with Air Corp guys.</fullReview>

Special effects were good, but the film could have done very well to not go it alone, and use archive footage as well. One special effect scene of a ship exploding is good, but real film shot during the attacks shows the action better.

		<fullReview>History is a very convenient thing when you can re-write it as you see fit. This film helps maintain the legend that the Japanese did a sneak attack on Pearl Harbor which responsible leaders in the US knew nothing about. While historians may argue that no serious researcher would fall back on Hollywood as a source of facts, people will readily accept what they see, because this is a convenient tragedy to believe.The film in itself is an attempt to recreate the Titanic success formula (love story set on a catastrophe tableau sketched with meticulous detail). Directing and acting as well as the CGI are solid quality, but the research behind it could have used a dash of Oliver Stone. Another attempt at rewriting history and eliminating unwanted facts -&gt; see also U-571 (2000). Watch if you're into war fantasies, avoid if you want truth in fiction.</fullReview>

Considering what this mess actually cost Disney absolutely nothing is impressing.The only way they could make it worse would be to cast Ryan Phillipe and Chris O'Donnell in the parts of Affleck and Hartnett.Had this happened, viewing would've caused deaths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This "movie" totally blows</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For as much money and time that was spent on producing this film, one would think that it could have had: (1) A decent story. (2) Awesome special effects. (3) Some semblance of historical accuracy. (4) Attention to detail. Unfortunately, what we ended up with was Michael Bay's warped view of how the United States involvement in the Second World War started. What crap. I only saw this movie once in the theater. That was once too many. Do you get the impression that I don't like this movie? Well I don't, and if I knew you hadn't seen it, I would suggest that anything else you might want to see would have a better change of being more enjoyable. The story sucks (a good third of the movie revolves around a farce of a love triangle.) The special effects have a nasty cartoonish quality to them. Mr. Bay changed a great many details that either, didn't suite him, or, were inconvenient to his plot. As for detail, what were late 20th Century Arleigh Burke class, Aegis equipped destroyers doing tied up in 1941 Pearl Harbor? Did he really think that anyone with any kind of knowledge about naval ships wouldn't notice something as obvious as that? I don't know a whole lot about ships, but I do know that ships today don't look anything like those build 60+ years ago. See Tora! Tora! Tora! if you want to see a movie about the attack on Pearl Harbor that has most of its information straight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, despite some cheesy moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent epic -- it brought to light many of the horrific details of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, details not covered in a history book trying to cram in facts. I sat in the theater watching 18 and 19 year old sailors die, trapped inside the Arizona or another ship, and I was terrified. It actually hit home with me -- these guys were my age. That could be my friend or my cousin. Surely there was some unnecessary cheesiness in "Pearl Harbor." The whole love story was a bit overdone. Also, I don't know if the counterattack scene was really necessary in a film called "Pearl Harbor." Good stuff though. Extra points for having Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett as the stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Pearl harbor was in the cinema's it was "THE MOVIE" the one you had to see unfortenatly i'd never make to see the film in cinema so me and a good friend started to rent the film in our local video store because we wanted to see this great blockbuster but after all this was a great disappointment the acting was good and so were the action scenes(you have to wait long for something happens) but the rest wasn't all that. The love story in the movie is pretty boring and drag itself around the film the characters looks like stripfigures it's difficult identify yourself with someone and the running time 176 minutes is far too long it's nog a long film it' seems to last eternally. But actually the worst thing about this WARDRAMA was the fact that it wasn't gripping you actually don't care what happins even when it's tragic, i've seen much better WARDRAMA for example "SCHINDLERS LIST", "APOCALYPSE NOW" OR "SAVING PRIVATE RYAN" These are fims you almost watch in Trance but PEARL HARBOR is a film you watch with te remotecontrol of your VCR (fastforward).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most anticipated blockbuster (no pun intended) of the Summer 2001 season, PEARL HARBOR makes us appreciate much more, the other film depiction of the horrendous December 7th attack, TORA! TORA! TORA! Granted, the battle scenes were intense, and kept on hitting you, honestly making you feel like you were really there. What drags the film down is the amazingly cliched romantic sub-plot. Every "Two military buddie smitten with the same sweetie" routine is there- the slug fest, the way war makes friends forget petty diffrences, the heroine having to give a heroic star at her boyfriends going off to war. Director Michael Bey didn't have to treat the film as a routine formula war film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really did not know want to expect when I went to watch Pearl Harbor, this was because lots of people were telling me how bad it was. So I was thinking should I just went till it comes out on video, so I went against my friends judgement and went to see it. I was so glad I did aswell because it was brilliant and fun and if I just saw that Pearl Harbor attack on video then I would of been missing some amazing cinema magic. Josh Hartnett and Ben Affleck were good as the American fighter pilots but the film would of been better if the romance was worked on a bit and they didn't make the British Air Force look so badly beaten and unheroic. So if the characters were worked on a lot more then this would of been a all round great film but as they didn't it only gets a very good. But I am glad I went to the cinema to watch it I really am.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, Pearl Harbor is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Granted, the only redeeming part was the actual attack. This scene lasts for about 40 minutes. The movie is over three hours. I think Roger Ebert said it best: "This is a two hour movie squeezed into three hours."I couldn't agree more. Pearl Harbor has some the absolute worst acting, dialog, storyline, characters...the list can go on and on. The main part of the story, the love (???) story, seems to have been contrived the night before shooting, and is a story of stunning stupidity.Think about this line: "Not anxious to die, Sir, just anxious to matter." - Ben Affleck. This is one of the stupidest lines I've ever heard in a movie. Sadly, Pearl Harbor is full of dumb lines like this.Bottom line: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!</fullReview>

Yet all way through the entire movie, I could not stop thinking "This is all wrong"!This seems more like an american post war propaganda movie than what it is: A love story based in war time.On a critical note, one might wonder why, in the american couterattack bombing, you don't see a single japanese casualty, yet pearl harbour doesn't hide any details. And the end monolog is thin as paper. A film as shallow as this one should not dare to make any retrospective political comments.Unless you want to go through 3 hours of americanism as we saw it in ID4, don't watch it.

Sorry no.They simply changed Bruce Willis role (father of the heroine inarmageddon), to Ben Affleck's buddy (played by Josh Harnett) tofight over Kate Beckinsale. The ending was designed to be thesame, the message is also exact. Towards the supremacy ofUnited States, and how people willing to sacrifice (or be killed) foreternal love.Michael Bay might be weak on picking up the story, but thecinematography, picture-style and action sequence remains thebest amongst current directors. The war sequence is so intenseand realistic, the casts are framed nicely on the screen, and evento the romance scene is beautifully drawn and carefully colouredand enlighted.For all the aspects, it is indeed for these aspects which helps usto sit throughout the show, not the love triangle main theme of thismovie. Despite the shallowness of this movie, it will be remembered asone of the most remarkable movie ever made.A perfect evening movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie picked for theme the bombing of Perl Harbor by Japan,an even happening on World War II.Portraying World War II would be the most logic thing to do.But no we are introduced on a pointless romance. The best scenes were by far those including the Battle of England between the British and German airforces,the best at this time.It was a three-dimentional point of view alright.But no remark of the damage done in Britain during the battle. The Japanese were at the time already at war with China before Germany's invade on Poland.They were experienced in war and trying to create an empire including Eastern Asia and most of the Pacific.They had learned to sacrifice for their country and that surrender means dishonorment.By far the most prepared for war.Were in this movie do we see any of this? I would like to see more of Franklin Delano Roosevelt,the greatest among the American presidents.And more of the Battle of the Pacific,which was among the hardest of the war.No we emphasise on a pointless counter-attack. No mention of current events either.Just in December 1941 great changes were happening without at all being mentioned here.On December 5th the Soviets obtain Kalinin while the Germans retreat.It was a disaster for Germany.On December 6th Britain declares war against Finland(alied to the USA and Germany both),Rumania and Hungary.The declaration was an insult to USA.On December 10th Japan invades the Philipines,on December 25th they capture Hong Kong,defeating the British,During the month the Americans continue to retreat against Japan which obtains a number of American islands during the process.Any of this mentioned? The happy ending of the war doesn't even mention the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.In a historical movie accurance plays a great part.In this one not at all.And if you realy want to see a great movie watch Chaplin's a great Dictator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What other plot could they have come up with?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The producers of this movie honestly tried, I can give them that. If your making a movie about warfare, you can't just have planes swooping down and shooting at everyone and blowing up everything. You need to have some sort of plot. Alright, so maybe the love story was as sloppy as a used kleenex, but what else could they have done. And maybe, just maybe, some love story like this did REALLY happen to the setting of Pearl Harbor. You just never know?A better way to tell the story of Pearl Harbor may have been to take two soldiers, one Japanese, the other American, and tell it from their sides (did you ever see GETTYSBURG?). That would have made a much better story. As far as historical accuracy, Im big on WW2 history and most of what was said in the film was correct. No one knew the location of the Japanese fleet at the time, Admiral Yamomotto reluctantly led the attack,some military personnel did suspectan attack on Pearl harbor etc. The only thing terribly wrong in this department was saying the Doolittle raid was the truning point of the war(err sorry that was Midway and Guadalcanl). But in terms of showing the Doolittle raid had a psychological signifigance, I guess we can let this error go.In short, this movie is worth seeing. Sure the love story is garbage but its the best they could come up with. The battle scenes and Doolittle raid make up for it. See this movie and try to delete the love story. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is one of the better movies Hollywood has produced recently. It successfully evokes a wide range of emotions, while taking us back to that infamous day, December 7, 1941. This film induces feelings of passion, vengeance and patriotism in audiences as it portrays scenes involving action, drama, love and even some tasteful humor. It fits many a description of the essence of cinema; the entire movie is outlined principally by sex and violence. These images, however, penetrate the audience with real meaning, contrary to the shallowness some movies guided by sex and violence tend to evoke. The fact that this movie is based on an actual event in American history significantly contributes to the profound impact it has on audiences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are nice points. We have, after all, Disney and ILM. They do what their standard requires in visual effects. Sound effects are also great, and if you've got Dolby in your theater, you're up to some good sound. Mark Hamill is quoted as saying that he suspects George Lucas would do without actors were it technically possible. PH's casting people know better than that. They remember how a well-cast Crowe made women fell in love with the otherwise unremarkable Gladiator. Patented female attractors Hartnett and Affleck do their job of bringnin some money out of ladies' purses and into the box office.That's about it. Everything else is dreadful. Story's a mix of the simplest of love triangles, and "dead lover turns out to be alive" routine. 'Trivial' would be a huge understatement. The lines are stupid enough to make an idiot turn red. Acting is mostly helpless, but for crying in a bucket, how can you expect one to look following the flapdoodle in the script. I found it hard to feel for any of the people in the movie, American or Japanese, with the possible exclusion of Danny. Ridiculously pompous patriotic gibberish that follows the bombing is a nightmare. It reminds me of the worst Soviet specimen of the genre. First the movie forgets about Japanese atrocities in Asia then takes the cry to such heights that what Americans did to Hiroshima and Nagasaki would seem justified.The movie evades the real question: how a thing like Pearl Harbor could happen. US have cut up Japanese oil supply. Almost entire American fleet in the Pacific is at dock at Pearl Harbor, and a Japanese fleet disappears suddenly. Where would they be heading? Oh there's a serious problem... Let me think... How about... uh, Pearl Harbor?The usual review goes "it may not be quite historically accurate, but" etc etc etc. It is NOWHERE near historically accurate, period. Go watch it, girls enjoy the star hunks, everyone enjoy the effects. Then put what you saw on a shelf of your memory labelled "FAKES" and rent "Tora, Tora, Tora". If you want a war movie, the greatest of all time is "Come and See". I doubt you'll ever want to see another war movie again. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will always resent what Top Gun did to action movies. You know it by heart: two buddies in the cockpits of state of the art aircraft, making like Thunderbirds, daring do, do or die. What hogwash.There is some of this --okay, too much of this -- in Pearl Harbor, but the good news is, this is mainly a simple she-has-to-choose love story set against the huge backdrop of history. Many people hold this against it. They say "With one of the pivotal events of the century taking place, the makers act as if this dumb little story of 3 people matters. It doesn't; it's trivial!" Au contraire, my callow young friends. Real Life, versus Reel Life, is made up of the small things. We experience life in macro, while we study it through history in sweeping panorama. To the people living in that time, Pearl Harbor changed their lives, sure, as it does the three main characters here. But the other things they were engaged in continued right along. --The passions, the human folly. Why do people have such a hard time with this movie, and its concessions to this particular level of reality? It is in fact no more or less "real" than many Hollywood films. --It is more real than most. Sure the Top Gun bit is hokey, but the love story, which is where the movie is rooted, rings true, even if a bit familiar.This movie may tell the story your grandmother or father would never tell you about what they were doing when the planes came. I give it 7 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>REVIEW: Pearl Harbor MOVIE GRADE: *1/2 out of **** BAD MOVIE GRADE: ***1/2 out of ****Pearl Harbor is the most unintelligent action movie I've seen since Armageddon. It is so awful that it gets hilarious at times. Especially when a girl tells a boy, "I'm gonna give Danny my whole heart, but I'll never be able to look at another sunset without thinking of you". The movie attempts to do to Pearl Harbor what James Cameron did for Titanic. Titanic seems like Ingmar Bergman compared to this. There are two things I hate most about this junk. First, the movie has a good story (Dorie Miller) in its reach. Just when it's getting interesting, they cut away to a boring love story, probably because they're afraid to put an African American story into full focus in a summer blockbuster. The other thing that I'm most offended about is toning down the carnage to a PG-13. I HATE watered down war movies! That's partly why U-571 was so awful. By toning it down, they are just giving a giant middle finger to all WWII vets everywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor is Sappy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fundamental question I pose to you...Does every movie have to have a love story attatched to it? I'm a huge movie fan and at times enjoy a good love story, But some movies don't need them. Pearl Harbor is one of those movies. I was in New York City when i saw this movie and while I thought that the action sequences were great, especially the air combat scenes, I found myself going to the restroom or snack bar during the incredibly sappy parts of this film.Alec Baldwin plays a great Admiral Doolittle, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are good in their respective roles and have great interplay.This film had the distinct opportunity to tell the story of an extremely historic event in the annals of U.S. History, But instead it winds up trying to tell three stories...The event...The two best friends Affleck and Hartnett...And the romance. I have seen many documentaries on Pearl Harbor with interviews of actual survivors and I can't recall one of them that had a love story attatched to them. The people who write, produce &amp; direct these big budget flicks witout fail follow the same formula, and in that formula no matter what the plot of the movie is there is always a love interest.This could have been a really good movie with much more information about the real event and much more badly needed action footage, but alas it fails because it is trying to please too many people. You cant'please everyone, it's an impossible task. The men that have gone and seen this movie all told me it had too much love story attatched to it. And the women i have spoken to were kind of indifferent to the whole movie.Make a movie that appeals to the core audience you are shooting for...If it's an action movie then market it as such and leave out the love story because i can tell you we don't need it. If it's a love story you are making then market it as such and the people who are interested in that subject will go and see it. Lets face it even though action movies do not and will not win any oscars they still pay the bills at these studios..That 200 million dollars from an action movie will help finance indies and love stories which in turn will win academy awards.STOP...STOP following the same old formula...break with the norm...believe me the public will embrace it.As for this movie, love interest aside it's pretty good. action is good, cinematography is good, acting is good and the scenery is great. Overall i would give it a B-Don't make the mistake and go into this movie thinking it will be all action or you will be sorely dissappointed.</fullReview>

Aside from Ben Affleck's 90's style haircut everything from clothing to wall posters were all well placed and everything.Now we come to the acting. Every one in the film did a great job portraying their charecters and making them seem real. The only real problem I noticed in the acting was Ben Affleck's southern accent. I've got nothing against Ben Affleck, in fact I think he's a very good actor it's just that he'd have done a much better job with his charecter if he'd just not used an accent.And last but not least, the bombing sequence. This was absolutely the best aspect of the film. The second the first bomb falls, you'll be on the edge of your seat. Not only that but the scenes where the Japanese were planning the attack were awesome. All in all this is a must see of a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>YUK!!! This movie sucks! I can add it to my Hollywood over-hyped suck list? along with "Independence Day" and "Blair Witch Project." This movie bombed even without a Japanese zero in the sky. The movie is way over-hyped and bogus. It consists of a fictitious love story, which just happens to take place during a real historical event (Pearl Harbor). When I saw "Saving Private Ryan," the age of the people in the theater ranged from teenagers up to senior citizens. Some of the senior citizens were WW2 veterans, and proudly wearing their VFW hats. However, the age of the people in the theater for "Pearl Harbor" was more the teenage to college age crowd. Most of the young ladies in the theater only wanted to see the movie because of prince Ben (VOTE GORE?OOPS, I FORGOT TO VOTE MYSELF) Afflect, and didn't really seem to care about the actual historical event. Has-been Alec (I'M LEAVING FOR CANADA?.NOT?..LEAVING FOR CANADA?.NOT) Baldwin was another winner in this over-hyped flick. Of course, Tom Hanks (a real actor) has raised public awareness and $ for WW2 veterans as a result of his film. However, Alec Baldwin is still unpacking, and Ben Afflect is sitting in the drunk tank. If you want historical knowledge of the real attack on Pearl Harbor, then read a history book or watch the 1970 film "Tora..Tora..Tora." If you only want to watch a hollywoodish romance flick, then "Pearl Harbor" is for you. I give this trash two thumbs down!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real mixed bag of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is definitely a real mixed bag of the good, the bad and the downright nauseating. Certainly it is very well made with that `big budget' look, and the actual aerial attack sequences are superbly and realistically done. However, I found the sometimes (obviously deliberate) shaky camera work in the action scenes to be very distracting and headache-inducing. This was clearly intended to give the viewer a feeling of the chaos and confusion that must ensue when you're in an aerial dogfight or at the business end of an air raid, but I simply found it extremely annoying, because all it did was make it difficult to see what was actually going on. Some of the other reviewers on this page have complained about the historical inaccuracies, and while this may be valid criticism up to a point, come on people! This is Hollywood!!! If you want to see a documentary about Pearl Harbour, watch the History Channel or buy `The World At War'!! There is always going to be some degree of `artistic licence' in these big-budget blockbuster movies because they're trying to offer something for as wide an audience as possible in order to speedily recoup at the box office the massive cost of making the thing in the first place.I did however find it a little long-winded in places, occasionally to the point of tedium. There was little real chemistry between Kate Beckinsale and either of the two male leads. Ben Affleck plays (as usual) Ben Affleck, and the other guy looked like he'd just stepped out of some `boy band' (very anachronistic). In fact I felt that all three leads were poorly cast. My favourite character had to be Earl, played by Tom Sizemore (a greatly underrated performer in my view, who is convincing in any role that he tackles). Alec Baldwin does a pretty good job as Col. Doolittle, despite being forced by the scriptwriters to deliver more than his fair share of sickeningy `patriotic' lines. And I can only agree with the other hack who, like me, was reaching for the puke bucket during some of the supposedly `romantic' moments because of positively vomit-inducing lines like `I think it's my heart that hurts' and `If I had just one night left on earth, I'd want to spend it with you' (who gets paid to write this crap for heaven's sake???!!!). Even my wife, who's normally into the romantic stuff, was cringing in her seat on hearing such dreadful dialogue. I have to disagree with the reviewer who criticises the film-makers for `tokenism' with regard to Cuba Gooding Jr's character. I seem to remember reading somewhere that a black sailor did indeed perform similar heroics during the actual attack, which would make this episode at least partly historically accurate. I also think the other reviewers who criticise the movie-makers for reducing the real-life victims to (and I quote) `worthless bits of digital code' and `flinging them around the screen to die with little respect' are being a bit silly. What were they supposed to do? To make the viewer `care about' each and every one of the 3000-plus victims of the Pearl Harbor attack within the constraints of a 3 hour movie would obviously be impossible, and not to show any anonymous extras being shot / blown up / burned or bodies flying through the air would just be plain ludicrous in the context of such a movie. That's just criticism for the sake of criticism. To summarise, I'd say that this film is nowhere near being in the class of `Saving Private Ryan' and the 3 leads are very wishy-washy to say the least. But despite its obvious flaws, if you haven't yet seen it it's worth checking out to decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Damn Shame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry I walked out on this one (the first time I have ever done this). Sad really because despite all the hype and the bad reviews I was still really looking forward to seeing this movie.  This was very Jerry Bruckheimer (Bad Boys, Crimson Tide, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon, Enemy of the State, Gone in Sixty Seconds and (Somewhat out of place!) Ugly Coyote), what with those big bangs so I didn't blame Jerry for this howler of a film because I expected this from him!!! Randall Wallace's (Braveheart &amp; The Man in a Iron Mask) script is quite simply unacceptable in modern cinema and as for the director Michael Bay (Bad Boys, The Rock &amp; Armageddon) I have one request please please hold your shots you idiot! So many great ship sinking moments were ruined by him cutting to something else. The actors Ben Affleck (Chasing Amy, Armageddon &amp; Dogma), Josh Hartnett (Halloween: H20, The Faculty &amp; The Virgin Suicides), Kate Beckinsale (Shooting Fish, Brokedown Palace &amp; The Golden Bowl), Ewen Bremner (Trainspotting &amp; Snatch), Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Deliverance &amp; Mission: Impossible), William Scott Lee (The Opposite Sex, October Sky &amp; Gone in Sixty Seconds), Cuba Gooding JNR (Boyz N the Hood, Jerry Maguire &amp; As Good as it Gets), James King (Four Faces of God, The Beauty Loop &amp; Blow) Alec Baldwin (Beetlejuice, Talk Radio &amp; The Hunt for the Red October) and finally Tom Sizemore (True Romance, Natural Born Killers &amp; Saving Private Ryan) promised so much more, but I really do blame the poor script for this and the likes of Beckinsale's and Hartnett's promising Hollywood career's are no way near in doubt. Such a shame the American's couldn't honor those who died that sad day with a better movie. 5.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>4 out of 10! I was really disappointed in this movie because I thought it would be the biggest smash this year!!! Even though it's popular, for me I think it's a waste of time watching it. Not enough action, characters are boring and even the music by Faith Hill is not that good! Very worse than Titanic. I would suggest not to rent it on video or DVD. because it's a 3 hour movie with less action. This movie is for people who feels very depressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Pearl Harbor' is a HUGE let down. In almost every magazine and newspaper that I have seen this film advertised, it has been categorised as a 'War Film With Romance'. I'm sorry, but this film is NOT about War, and to say that it is, makes a mockery of the likes of Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now and, more recently Saving Private Ryan.First of all, I find it difficult to become engrossed in films that use REAL Historic events as a backdrop for a little cheesy romance. Titanic used the amazing story of the ship itself, and took every chance they could to feed on the audiences emotions. But people cried at the wrong time!! Like when Jack died, instead of when the rescue ship was wading through the corpses of young and old. Some people would argue that Saving Private Ryan did the same. Used the 'one man is worth a million' policy to underline how loyal the Americans can be. But at least Saving Private Ryan looked real. At least there was swearing, and smoking and blood and a distinct lack of eyeliner and concealer, which is more than I can say for Pearl Harbor!If they're going to make a movie about War, and add a little tacky romance to it, then they at least need to make the movie LOOK real. It was the Second World War okay? Yet nobody smoked (a travesty and historical flaw in itself), the worst curse was 'Hell' or 'Dang', and even in the bombing sequence, there was no blood or chaos. Something that Saving Private Ryan and even Platoon were credited for. Add to that the fact that everyone looked like they'd just shot a cover story for 'The Face' magazine, (apart from Ewen Bremner, who puts in the only good performance of the whole movie) and you have a recipe for unrealistic disaster.Even as a straight romance movie this flounders. Danny (Josh Hartnett, looking more and more like leading man material with every movie) and Rafe (Affleck, attempting to be A.J. from Armageddon, only in the 1940s) have been buddies since they were children. They've been through thick and thin, they even join the Airforce together. One day Affleck decides that he will join a renowned squadron, based in Britain (depicted as War torn and stiff as a broom handle) and leave his best friend and.....you guessed it, new love behind.Rafe leaves because it's his 'duty'!! And that's where the fun starts, because his best buddy Danny decides to move in on the woman that Rafe loves. A pretty nurse called Evelyn (played as well as possible with the script in question by Kate Beckinsale).Luckily for Danny however, he and Evelyn get a message telling them that Rafe has died in heroic and mysterious circumstances. So, instead of mourning him and showing honest remorse for their actions. They have a little drink, a bit of a cry and get on with their lives. AS IF!!!The rest is just as stupid **SPOILER APPROACHING** Affleck returns to find that Danny and Evelyn have been getting up to some rude little duties (including a sex in a parachute scene that is a tragic mixture of the Top Gun and the Titanic love scene). As you can imagine, Rafe is none too pleased, but after a day or so, they have a beer and all is forgiven!! And anyway, Rafe gets his own back, because Danny dies and Rafe and Evelyn spend their lives happily ever after.....This is of course after Pearl Harbor gets bombed. And that is the only part of the movie that deserves any kind of rating. The bombing sequence is exactly as I imagined it. Rapid editing, brilliantly realised CGI planes, boats and sailors. Shattering sound and a mass of colour on screen. It is, without doubt a piece of art all on it's own. It's just a shame however, that there's not much 'reality' in the actual action. I mean there's a few cries of anguish, but it lacks brutality (for the sake of a 12 rating) and for some reason has Cuba Gooding Jr. (tragically forced to play the token Affro-American)running around trying to save everyone, without getting bombed himself.After the bombing sequence, we get all the American patriotism stuff, and the revenge attack on Japan.**SPOILER** And as I said earlier, Danny dies, leaving Rafe and Evelyn to bring up a family of their own somewhere in the deep South!!I guess I have the same problem with the romance as I did with Titanic, and that is that it distracts you from the REAL issues. And that is that lots of real people died needlessly in the War, so why would I rather focus on three badly scripted characters in an almost incestuous love triangle?And I guess I have the same problem with the action as I did with U-571. From a distance it all looks splendid. Rattling gunfire, big yellowy orange explosions. Loud noise and some very, very tasty CGI. But once you really get in there it lacks realism and brutality. I'm not twisted, I' just like to actually become absorbed in how horrible that must have been. And with everyone shouting things as tame as 'Damnit' or 'Sonofabitch', I can't really sympathise.In short then, Pearl Harbor is terrible. That is unless you like badly scripted romance films that use war as a backdrop!! If you're an avid cinema goer, then watch it. If not, rent something good. Like Hamburger Hill or The Thin Red Line.Pearl Harbor is good for one thing, and one thing only. And that is to show that CGI is developing at an astonishing rate, but even THAT bombing sequence isn't worth waiting an hour and forty minutes for. Not so much a 'popcorn munching must', as a 'a popcorn regurgitating rabble'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgettable 'Epic'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the makers of 'Armageddon' and 'The Rock' comes...another film of 'epic' proportions with lots of explosions! Now I am aware that the producers of this film did not intend for it to be a historical reenaction of the events that took place on Dec. 7th 1941 (see the excellent 'Tora! Tora! Tora! for a more even-handed and 'historical' account of that fateful day) but what is presented here is weak. As usual, Bay and Bruckheimer are completely out of their element when it comes to HUMAN interaction, especially between the opposite sexes! The 'love' triangle in PH is about as scintillating as a wet fish. The Japanese 'villains' are stereotypically jittery and conniving and they even play 'evil' music when they appear! Quite simply, I could not bring myself to CARE about anybody in this film.As far as the explosions galore and action sequences, as long as you remember that this isn't supposed to be a historical movie, I would say that they are quite impressive. The Japanese Zero's do look like the speeder pods from Phantom Menace though. There's lots of explosions if you like that sort of thing.</fullReview>

There is no focus on the actual event of Pearl Harbor - and what a terrible ending - why not leave it with the fact that the Japanese caught the American forces off guard. The script was a cocktail of cliches and stupid lines. What a waste of money - barely a rental.</fullReview>

Never have I seen a movie that showcased more abysmal writing, directing, acting, or special effects. The fact that anyone found this movie entertaining in any way is a sad commentary on the intelligence of the American viewing audience; and that this chum bucket of a movie was green-lighted by the front office is a disgrace!! I think the 135 million dollars could have been better spent had it been dumped in a Newark land fill. I would not think it possible to saccharine-coat one of the most horrific days in our nation's history, but he did it! And if FDR's ghost is about,I hope he haunts everyone involved with this movie for eternity for that god-awful "locker room" speech in the war room when he decides to "stand" (PUKE) Please, I you have any respect for yourself, DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE!!! P.S. Why aren't there any Hawiian islanders in Hawaii?, I counted a total of none in this movie- I think that sums it up! Rating (-)10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok -- The movie was only made to show how great the special effects are at Disney. The succeeded in showing that they have great special effects, yet nothing compared to the years critical and box-office blockbuster "Moulin Rouge". Pearl Harbor drags on miserably with an all-star cast including Cuba Gooding Jr., Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Jon Voight.May I say that the story of Pearl Harbor was pathetic -- how can you make a 3 hour movie about something that occured in only a few minutes. And then for extra whipped cream they added a stupid, pointless love triangle -- not a spark of chemistry between any of the actors. "Enemy At The Gates" had an amazing story line with a great love triange between Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, and Joseph Fiennes. This love story seemed as if it was just thrown in for a little more "drama depth" between the characters - because the characters were so unrememberible and flat.And the ending??? It made it seem like Ben Affleck had won the war-- I'd rather see the Japanese win, than him!Pearl Harbor will just be another movie that is loved by the people when it comes out -- but will soon vanish into the back of Beuna Vista's film closet. Please take my advice and avoid this movie at all costs. This is the movie that most critics raved...."UNIMAGINABLE".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have spent the last week trying to remember a worse film than this. I have failed miserably. This is the most appalling blend of patriotic nonsense, bad plot, weak dialog and hackneyed acting. The only reason I stayed in the theater after the first hour was that the first half was so poor, I thought that it had to get better. How wrong I was.This offensive garbage is churned out by the studios only for the consumption of the corpulent, duncical US masses. The rest of the world groan at the patriotic hokum cooked up in the name of ticket sales. The story of Pearl Harbor is a fascinating one, with lots of tales of individual bravery, which could have been done completely differently, but unfortunately, turned up to be formulaic, jingoistic trash. When are the studios going to stop producing this polluting garbage? Only when the market disappears. When your average American Mickey-D eating Joe wises up and quits consuming this brain-dead tripe. Not for a long, long, time, then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where does one begin? With the fictional love story on top of the historical event that's a little too reminiscent of the Titanic premise? With the made-for-Velveeta cheese acting portrayals of ultra-patriotic boys growing up in the heartland of America, whose only desire later in life is to gun down the 'japsuckers' in defense for the land of the free, the home of the brave? With the flights-of-fancy love affairs of the leading lady who settles for the flight officer who happens to survive the 'Top Secret' mission? With the inspiring pearls of wisdom (no pun intended) from Alec Baldwin's air force general character who profoundly proclaims that "there is no heart braver than that of a volunteer"? With the over-simplified sequence of events leading up to the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and the stereotypical and lame portrayal of the Japanese who later fear that they "have awaken a sleeping giant"?Perhaps it was the fact that I do not feel a deep connection to American patriotism, or the fact that I watched the Pearl Harbor in another country, that I felt the need to make gagging noises during many scenes. Or maybe it was that I thought the movie, for lack of a better term, SUCKED.There is no point in detailing the flaws, shortcomings, and overall bad aspects of Pearl Harbor, besides the fact that it would be excruciatingly long to read. In my opinion, Hollywood should leave the movie-making of historical events to intelligent persons concerned with the actual event, and just stick to making contrived love stories involving Ben Affleck and the current leading female du jour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first hesitated very much to go and see this film, because of all the bad reviews I had read about it. The movie was described as stupid, boring and too long. But the action sequences were said to be great, so I decided at last to go and see it. Boy, am I glad I did! I think it is a great movie, not only for the spectacular action, but for the movie as a whole. The story is much like that of Titanic, a love story for about the first hour and a disaster for the next two hours. So-called "experts" have said that the love story of Pearl Harbor had nothing to do with the actual Japanese attack and that the love story was therefore obsolete. But what had the love story between Rose and Jack in Titanic had to do with the sinking of the ship? And what did the love story between Scarlet O'Hara and Rhett Butler had to do with the American Civil War in Gone With The Wind? The Japanese in this movie are not depicted as cruel savages, who have great pleasure in killing Americans, but as people who think what they do is best for their country, and didn't want to go into war in the first place.This movie has comical moments, spectacular moments, impressive moments and touching moments, in other words, this movie has it all.If you haven't seen this movie yet, then do not listen to whining movie critics, but run to your local cinema or videostore and rent it, because this is a must-see movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film, while named Peal Harbor, covers two war time events. The Japanese attack on Peal Harbour and the 'Dolittle' raids in April 42 on Japan by US bombers flown from carriers.Really the film is just a triangular romance set during the war incorporating the above events.Hollywood thoughtfully presumes, though not accurately, that pilots trained to fly fighter planes will obviously make expert bomber pilots.The effects were good and the film does address the affects on the ground during the Pearl Harbour raid more than previous depictions.Where the film really falls down is in over setting expectations. By calling the film Peal Harbor people will judge it as such. However the film is a romance set in a war.If you want a film on Peal Harbour you still should watch Tora! Tora! Tora!

		<fullReview>I know, if all I'm going to do is bash, I should stop writing reviews for this movie. Well, here's one last review for this movie-may the film lose the praise.My parents are amatuer historians. I think they liked this movie due to it being in WW2. That is no reason to like a movie-that is like a cult saying Manos was the best film just because it had a cult. But Manos is a dumb film, the 4th worst film of all time (well, on my opinion)-and the same goes for this. (But this is better than Manos. Wait-no it isn't.)Like everyone who hates this is saying, bad dialog ("I'll never ask for anything again?" You'll have to ask for a better line), stupid humor (while talking about girlfriends, one guy says that he has a girlfriend-that's all he says), and disagreement with history (a. they say "The Great Dictator was dumb, but it is classic; b. one character knows that it is world war 2-while Japs are STILL BOMBING!) make this worse than most films I've seen. This makes me think more and more that Hollywood has everything in for no reason.I've got to be going. I'm working on a script involving a conspiracy with Nazis underneath everything. It is going to be called "Anardili" and will rely solely on hype to succeed. (If this sounds familiar, remember that I'm working off of this.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A massive disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This year, when the summer movies rolled around in May, there was one movie that I was dying to see: Pearl Harbor. I have enjoyed the work of Ben Affleck and thought that this movie would be the perfect balance of action and romance. However, I left the theater massively disappointed. I appreciate the attempt that Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer made to create a cross-gender classic for the ages, but the result fell flat. The best thing about the movie was the bombing sequence in the middle. This section captured my attention fully with its raw power and emotional action. It was one of the best action sequences in recent history. The portion of the movie leading up to the bombing was a huge bore. Could the romance between Rafe and Evelyn be more pathetic and moronic? I found myself rolling my eyes when Rafe popped himself in the nose with a champagne cork rather than smiling in pleasure. Because of this movie, I am not as big of a fan as Affleck. He is good in supporting roles, but he does not have the stature to lead a blockbuster. The position of his frown seems to be the range of his emotional acting ability. And what was with the way that he kept wearing his hat cocked to the side? Did he see it on a WWII documentary and thought that it looked cool? I was hugely annoyed by the character of Evelyn, whose emotional strife was poorly played by Kate Beckinsdale. It seemed like she was constantly lying to both of her suitors and trying to play helpless. The only shining performance was of Josh Hartnett, and even his luscious bangs cannot save this movie. Nearing the end of the movie, I was wishing that both Rafe and Danny would crash and burn and that Evelyn wouldn't be able to have either of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dramatic effects, almost deja-vu, but dialogue suffers...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2001 version of "Pearl Harbor" has much in common with another massive-budget film of recent years, "Titanic". Not that both involve ships, but both involve superior performances by supporting players while the headline stars fall far below their potential... In this film the recreation of the event itself is nothing short of phenomenal, to the point of momentary lapses and SHOCK... The visual effects defy imagination and, along with cinematography, possibly art direction, sound, and (certainly) the theme song, there are elements here I expect displayed at the next instalment of the Golden Globes, Oscars, BAFTAs, and others. Among the supporting crew, Academy Award Winner John Voight, Ewen Bremner, Mako, Alec Baldwin, and -- let us not forget, Cuba Gooding Jr., inspire, leading us to laughs, tears, stone cold somber moments, and everything in between. The first, John Voight, was so believable that he could garner an award nomination himself. The hoped-for romantic 'enhancement' was not, in and of itself, misplaced, as many media reviews have stated. Rather, it was poorly done and here I would recommend a complete script chapter re-write. In other words, these things DID happen (during that era) and it could have been handled. It wasn't, and the film suffers for it. Our leading three characters are basically 'good' throughout (but not great), apart from various moments during said element. All three, at one point or another, stumble miserably through it, with Josh Hartnett doing the best job at 'damage control'. Ben Affleck, for his part, LOOKS just like someone from the era -- stunningly so -- and thus a major success. He manages the exchanges reasonably well, too, to include non-verbals, but for said element. (Hartnett is a little less convincing, but the difference is marginal.) Both men, at this point, however, lose the edge ENTIRELY on sounding like the 1940s, and the effects on the viewer are nothing short of a jarring back to the present = NOT GOOD. With better editing, Kate Beckinsale could have 'saved the day', so-to-speak, on the romance as this was a chance for her to 'manage' the unplanned balancing act (witness how well it was handled in "Castaway", for example), but alas... No. I wish to emphasise that said element also had the potential to add to this film and unfortunately takes away instead, from an otherwise nearly-perfect production. What were the writers/ editors thinking...???A few chewy remarks about money, vis-a-vis reasoning for making decisions with the use of aircraft and naval fleets are more indicative of yesterday's newspaper, and mean that even the directorial staff has forgotten the times. I recommend a dose of old WW2 movies to refresh their memories. This 'snafu' alone, however, would have had no more impact than a slight, indiscernable mistake made by a figure skater at the Olympics, e.g. the judges might have marked a 5.8 rather than 5.9. But along with the jarring effect of the failed element just cited, well...My rating, however, rests with the sound, visual effects, music, song, cinematography and supporting cast, i.e. all of which and whom TAKE YOU THERE to the event itself and that is what I was looking for. This was also true with "Titanic" which could not have been carried without veteran Gloria Stuart retelling 'her' story along with all of James Cameron's creations... For these criteria alone, rating = 5 stars (of 5; but with 1.5 point markdown if I include everything else).</fullReview>

It was slated by the critics (especially by those who reside over my side of the ocean). I saw it twice within ten days.......hmmm......I found the movie to be an emotional journey. I have to admit that I managed to miss the first 15 minutes of the movie on both viewings. I was touched by the waste of life, the naievety of the people in charge of the Hawaiain islands and by the historical consequences of the United States worst hour.I went to the first viewing with my wife's stepfather; he flew B25's in Burma during WWII. He was stunned by the flying sequences and he was teary eyed by the conclusion. His opinion was that the flying sequences were stunning. I agree - they were stomach churning.....I then saw the movie with my wife - she was also moved to tears. The tragic waste of life on the US battleships needed explanation. I suggested that Pearl Harbor signalled the end of the battleship as a real force. The Aircraft Carrier continues to be the strong arm of the navy - it was regrettable that the Japanese recognised it's strength first.So, what were the movie's strong points?Firstly, despite the weak storyline, it is a stunning piece of history which needs to be seen, digested and understood by all. Secondly there are some amazing cinematographic moments in this film. The images of the Japanese aircraft flying over the non-combatants at the beginning of the attack were poignant and grotesquely beautiful.I was totally ignorant about the Doolittle raids before seeing this movie. It squared a circle in my mind. Tragically, the British Bomber Command have yet to receive a campaign medal for their efforts against mainland Germany in WWII. The Doolittle raids were a testimony to man's ingenuity in adversity.My advice? Forget the love triangle and watch with awe as the reasons for US foreign policy in the second half of the 20th century unravels before your eyes....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry, there's no red carpet treatment......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently read in the San Francisco Guardian newspaper, that "Pearl Harbor"'s producers, wanted to remake "Titanic" by way of "Saving Private Ryan", and in it's reference to one of the many harsh reviews this movie received, it called the film "oscar-baiting" before it proceeded to destroy the cast. Now, first off, my review of Pearl Harbor isn't as harsh as some critics reviled it, but this movie, is most definitely no "Saving Private Ryan" and it just breathes "Titanic". This $135 million monster of a film follows two soldiers named Rafe and Danny (Affleck and Hartnett), best friends since childhood who are now in the air force, just days before one of history's darkest incidents. In a fit of chance, Rafe falls for Evelyn (Kate Beckinsdale), an attractive nurse, but alas, things change and Rafe is out of the picture (for a while), and Danny falls for Evelyn, and the two embark on a romantic affair, complete with powerful visuals of the two necking. Of course, those visuals are all that you see when you consider the more than overbearing romantic subplot between Danny and Evelyn, as well as Rafe. It's so innocuous that you'll desire for the film to be over. At least half the film is the two making love or kissing or what not, that you'll want to put a gun to your head. The film, is essentially a summer movie because there really isn't much intrigue, you believe that Pearl Harbor is a truly disastrous moment that is gone but not forgotten. The characters, about every one of them, are very one dimensional and that's a no no for many films that desire to be in the best picture category. Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight, and Cuba Gooding Jr. do however make their characters have real depth because they're all based on real people. But their presence in the film isn't huge, because the film focuses on it's lead characters and their RIDICULOUS triangle of love. I believe Bay and Bruckheimer, (of whom many film aficionados have dubbed "the devil" and "the antichrist" respectively) wanted the red carpet treatment. They want the award shows, the endless coverage, and the numerous praises, but their film, doesn't have what it takes to be rewarded those illustrious chances. They're both terrific filmmakers and make a hell of a team as director and producer, but "Pearl Harbor" shows that Michael Bay isn't ready to get serious yet. He was preaching with "Armageddon", but "Pearl Harbor" is a weakness. Spielberg was in his forties when he helmed "Schindler's List" and "Saving Private Ryan" (which strangely lost Best Picture) because he was ready for it. Bay hasn't matured as a serious filmmaker yet, and he moved too fast into this film. However, the real power of this film is in the historical incident itself, which Bay orchestrates with a raw intensity. The looks of soldiers as they are being relentlessly shot at and blown up. The explosions are massive fireballs that sink whole battleships sending innocents to their doom, and Bay makes you feel as if you are one of those soldiers. He doesn't portray the japanese as an evil totalarian army, but as soldiers fighting the war, and aware of what the consequences may very well be. Spoilers! One particular image that stands out if the view of endless soldiers carrying themselves through the field covered in burning oil, their faces nothing more than just black masses of people screaming. It's a powerful image, and Bay shows it. Honestly, I'd say Pearl Harbor is something you can rent, if you haven't seen it in the theaters, you haven't missed anything.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood or history? That was the question asked oh-so-many times before Pearl Harbor was released. My question: who cares? I saw Pearl Harbor the first day it was released and I was impressed. I didn't let the negative attacks made by those close minded movie critics sway my decision. My call: 5 stars out of 5 stars. This is the best movie I've seen, knocking away Titanic from my top spot.Of course you all know the story of Pearl Harbor so I won't explain it. I will touch on the love story, however. While most people will talk down to the love story parts, I think it adds to the movie. I mean, the first opening sequence the Japs attack and then it's all over? You have to have a another story line, such as Titanic did.Ben Affleck delivers a warm performance while it seems newcomers Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale's performances are the best. Movie critics and some of the American public throw this movie in the toilet for some reason when it really is a very good movie. It may have not lived up to expectations but how many movies do?While I was waiting in line for the select showing, the movie before us was letting out. I stood in line watching women, men, teenage girls and even TEENAGE (15 - 16 year old) boys crying with tissues in their hands. What movie can evoke such emotions like that? What movie can have shows sell out weeks ahead of its opening date? Pearl Harbor. It's that good.BOTTOM LINE - Don't listen to the movie critics and go see this movie. Show your true American Pride. The people downing this movie don't have any.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie sucks. Nothing about it was good. Well, I guess the girl was kinda pretty.The worst thing about movies is wasted potential. Pearl Harbor had so much potential, and absoloutely nothing in the movie lived up it.You can just watch Armageddon, which doesn't presume to take itself seriously, and is a heck of a lot more fun (mostly because of its stupidity and silliness).Pearl Harbor sucks. Don't watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My comments about Pearl Harbor and the review posted on this site,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Pearl Harbor 2 weeks ago, and since then I have been thinking about it non-stop. Although the film hasn't gotten the best reviews, I personally think it's one of the best movies I've ever seen in my young 13 years. The love story aspect really touched me, and it seemed to me to be the perfect fit to the actual attack storyline. I didn't find the film to be dragged out or boring because of its 3 hour time span. I found it to be quite enjoyable, even though the movie didn't end until midnight and I had been up since 7 that morning. I thought, going in, there was a chance I would fall asleep, and it was totally the opposite. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. It was an amazing movie, and the fact that my favourite actor, Josh Hartnett, was in it made it even better for me. I urge teenagers and adults alike who don't mind going through the bearable gore of the attack scenes to experience a touching story to go see Pearl harbor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a preview for "Pearl Harbor" about two months before it came out. After watching it and seeing some of the special effects, I knew I had to see it. A couple of months later, I finally went to see it in the theaters, and I thought it was awesome. (Warning: Possible spoilers ahead) I'll start out with the cons: There are a few things I didn't care for in this movie. First of all, I agree with you who say that the romance was bland, etc.; but I don't really care for romance, so my opinion on that doesn't matter. Second, Ben's and all of the other twenty-something actors' acting were kind-of corny and goofy. But on the other hand, I have seen people who act like that. Not everybody in every movie has to act like they are acting. Some of my freinds behave in such manners. And they are on Hawaii, where they are (or were) care-free, thinking they were away from the war. Pros: Of course, the special effects were the best part of the movie. In my opinion, they more than make up for the lame romance. I went into the theaters expecting to see some of the best shots I've ever seen, and I got what I wanted. The effects combined with the unique camera angles (following a bomb as it drops above a ship, watching a squadron of jets fly over kids playing baseball and a women drying clothes, etc.) made the attack scene one of my favorites of all time. When "Pearl Harbor" finally comes out on video, I'll probably get the DVD so I can skip to the attack on occasion, but I will be sure to watch the complete film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have now seen it twice and I love it. Who the hell cares what critics say about this film. It's just big fun and entertainment. With the technologie we have now it is important that this film has been made again, especially with Michael Bay behind the cameras. I've never seen anything about Pearl Harbor before and this really got my attention. I've even checked out some history books about it and I don't even really care about history. I never cared about it come to think of it. Looking at the user ratings I was really surprised that it only came to a 6. I thought that it would at least come to a 7. I have to admit that the movie is a bit long. 3 hours!!! I didn't really understand the love triangle between Ben, Josh and Kate. First it's Ben and Kate, then Ben is presumed dead. Now Kate and Josh go at it. Then Ben is back. And ultimately Josh dies and Ben and Kate live happily ever after. Maybe it's just me.I give it a 10 minus 1 (because of the length of the film) = 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst war movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pearl Harbor" is the kind of movie where a man and a woman who have just witnessed countless numbers of people getting shot and blown up can honestly look each other in the eye as they well up, sniffle, and ask in all earnest "But...what about us?" It's the kind of movie where secondary characters die by what seems like the thousands, and getting your girlfriend pregnant or getting engaged is as good as a death warrant. And it's the kind of movie that's so boring you stop caring about anyone in it less than a third of the way through.Earlier in the year, a movie titled "Enemy at the Gates" was released, set in the battle of Stalingrad where a Soviet peasant becomes a hero by sniping Nazi officers, so in retaliation the Nazis send their own expert sniper to draw him into a showdown and crush the propaganda machine he's made of himself. It featured great standoffs between the two near the beginning and middle, but it soon dissolved into an insipid, uninteresting love triangle between the Soviet sniper, the man who made him famous, and a Russian female freedom fighter. I didn't really care for it, really, but when compared to "Pearl Harbor," "Enemy at the Gates" deserves to be seen as one of the best war movies ever made. The makers of this pile engineered the preview to make it appear as if it was 90% explosions with a love story in there somewhere, but the most uninteresting romances of the past decade take up a good two-thirds of the running time. By the end of the movie, I wasn't sure if the Japanese were bombing Pearl Harbor to sink ships or if they just wanted to kill people in love.A lot has been made of the possibility of Japanese Americans being offended at the movie, but beyond ominous, evil sounding music that plays whenever scowling actors portray Japanese naval officers planning the attack, and at least fifty cries of "Yeah! Got those ba****ds!" screamed throughout the movie, there's nothing to be offended about.*Plot spoilers ahead, although if you didn't see them all while watching the movie about five minutes in advance, I feel sorry for you*On the love triangle, I've loved movies with romance before, but the way this is done is just sloppy. Affleck makes a pathetic plea to a nurse while getting his immunizations, she falls for him after maybe a minute of resisting, and before you know it they've exchanged lovey-dovey gifts and gone on a date by a ship in port, and they're virtual life partners. None of the slow buildup or obstacles found in real life relationships, they just fly into each others' arms. Affleck volunteers to fight in Europe, gets shot down, and word gets back that he's dead. Three months later, it's taken the nurse about two minutes to fall for his childhood pal, and they're humping like jackrabbits. Gee, ya' think Affleck is going to turn up alive, come back at a very convenient moment, and it'll all lead to a cliche`d barfight seen a thousand times before in a thousand better movies? And that they'll reconcile just in time to leap into the Pearl Harbor battle and become heroes, then chosen for a top secret mission where only one comes back?Running as a parallel story (and I use the term loosely) is Cuba Gooding Jr.'s blank page of a black navy officer, who adds nothing to the story at all and whose character should've been scrapped. He's given no definition or personality at all, just a suit of skin to wear that the filmmakers threw in so the NAACP wouldn't complain. I can almost hear them saying "OK, that's enough of the black guy to satisfy the minorities, now back to the white people!"Without a plot I couldn't predict or characters I cared about, I hoped that veteran director Michael Bay would use the action scenes to save it. I have to admit, the moments right before the actual attack on Pearl Harbor are ominous and fearful, and the first ten minutes are first-rate. After that, though, it's like riding a roller coaster for forty minutes. The first time you watch Japanese Zeros strafe fleeing American troops, it's exciting. The fortieth time it's redundant. The Doolittle raid on Tokyo, which takes place after the battle the movie's named after, is a pointless addition to an already overextended enterprise, which would've been a lot better off without it. Arguably the dumbest part of the movie is when they crash land in China, and a few pilots armed with pistols kill what feels like an entire company of Japanese ground troops with rifles. Must be all that apple pie they eat.After I could plainly see the director and writer throw in the towel and give up trying to make even a decent movie, I could expect the actors to do no more. Ben Affleck can be a good actor, but his performance here borders on jaw-droppingly awful. He squints a lot, with a fake Tennessee accent that fades in and out at random and at times he emotionally inflects his face, but not his voice, giving the impression of somebody having a very emotional time choosing what detergent to use at the laundromat. Kate Beckinsale is in over her head. With her woozy, breathless style of overacting, she should be in Diet Coke commercials, not movies. Josh Hartnett isn't quite as bad, but his character is so laughably underwritten that by the time he's become a Christ-like figure, there's nothing about him to ponder except how someone with such a girly haircut became an American pilot.A bloated, overdone studio-funded corpse this is. One of the year's worst movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see Pearl Harbor with as much objectivity possible, but I just couldn't see where the positive stuff if except in the astounding graphics, the audience was probably hit by a bomb or two. But anyway its weight is the effects, the story was weakly delivered in a very shallow "we are (Americans) the victims and heros" way. Even though we know Randall Wallace is all about heroism and glory, it's just loses all kinds of originality and becomes purely political.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible movie, dont listen to the critics!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw this movie today (July 25) right before it will probably be pulled from the big theaters. Regardless of what the critics have said, I thought this was an incredible movie and is by far Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bays best. The movie appears to be very accurate and believable (as opposed to another Bay/Bruckheimer collaboration which was a piece of trash called "Armageddon"). Ive heard some say that the whole love story is irrelevant to the film, but I say it is very important to the film. Without it, we just have a bunch of people that we end up not caring about. If the whole movie stuck with strategy and stayed with the US and Japanese powers rather than the individual characters, then this movie would have been a total flop. Without caring about the characters, the audience does not get emotionally involved and therefore the ending really means nothing at all. "Titanic" would have never been as successful without the fictional characters that the film followed. And that other WWII movie, you know, "Saving Private Ryan"...how much of that plot was factual? This is a great film, just as good as that other WWII movie and is on my DVD to buy list when it is released. Definitely give this a view if you havent already. Thank you and have a nice day :D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the end of the "event" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Hollywood believes that making a movie is like baking a cake. Like Luc Besson said, "movies at Hollywood are like the pie machine in Chicken Run: you throw the ingredients, press the buttons and a product comes out on the other end". The importance of the cinematographer, the writer, the director, the sound director, the actors is totally irrelevant. This system thinks that the bigger, the better. And the difference between success and failure of a movie lies in how much you are willing to spend. The film being treated as a product and not much else, it all depends on how much money you can make out of it. The rest is totally useless.The problem with Pearl Harbor is exactly that it was born out of a studio system so capitalist and near-sighted as Hollywood. And this time, they didn't made this one just to cash in at the box office. They were aiming to higher goals: box office smashes, a wide array of public and maybe even glory at the oscars. But Michael Bay is no James Cameron, and they were playing with fire when they decided to repeat the smash success of "Titanic". The comparisons between these two movies are huge, and, although they don't show on the final product, they are quite visible on the way this movie has been made: the thing they really wanted to do was to recreate the bombing of Pearl Harbor in all its 2.35 widescreen Dolby Digital DTS splendor, and Michael Bay, being the bubblegum popcorn director he always has been was the right choice to do this. But, as they noticed, a film doesn't live on only a bombing sequence, so they decided that they had to create a pretext, luring also the sensitive side of the audience, labeled as "women". This is what really gives me the more disgust: this movie was made by the numbers, no art involved, the script filled to the brim with clichés. The film is at all predictable, cold, a product of an industry and not much else. This is what really made me sick throughout.First part: The way to start every epic movie: the clichéd prologue of the two protagonists when they are still children, having experiences that will influence their lives (see Backdraft and Braveheart, for example). Then we get a love story that takes nearly 5 minutes to start, the essential time (the audience really only wants to see the action). The film rushes slowly to the action sequence, with the always-seen newsreels of war. The sun is always orange, and the cameras are almost always in slow motion. Ben Affleck and a guy I have seen in Trainspotting do also the (very weak) comic relief. But we blink and the movie is already in Hawaii, because we have to get there so that the characters meet their fate, which everyone is predicting. The result of this first part is a handful of clichés which bores everyone who doesn't go to the movies to eat popcorn.Second Part: The thing everyone has been waiting to see. After all, this is why probably 90% of the audience bought their ticket. The explosions are, of course, massive and huge. Many people die, also in the most gruesome ways. Fire, planes, bullets, water, the 150 million dollars are all there on the screen, in those specially dramatic shots of the bombs falling and the torpedos swimming towards the ships. Many things blow up, but, maybe it's just me, there is such a lack of artistic sense of good taste and suspense that the cinematic event of the summer, which is probably those 45 minutes of bombing leaves the viewer cold. It actually tastes like a fraud. There isn't one single shot I can say that touched me more than the others. Not even that bomb falling, which I see as a different way to show the same thing. The bullets, the explosions, even "The Rock" touched me more than all that collection of stunts. The flying bits are good, but at the same time they fall flat: why do we guess from the very beginning that the both of the protagonists will survive? I don't even ask how did they manage to be shot at during all that time and not being killed in the process. I don't even ask how two planes can lift off and escape. Why do the bad guys never kill the main characters? From the beginning, the bombing of Pearl Harbor doesn't strike us because there is no real sense of risk: all the people that die are not the people we met in the first part, and we know that at least the three main characters will make it to the end.Third part: America always wins. That's maybe the message they show here. The bombing of pearl harbor was a disaster to the american fleet in the pacific, but america always wins, no matter what. And yes, they will strike back. Hey, even the Japanese admit it's a sleeping giant (which makes us think on the reasons they attacked it). In the final part, which we see as another episode and not as a conclusion (really, the movie could continue on and on, the bombing still looks like it was glued in the middle of the absurd love story, just check out that first dialogue between Rafe and Evelyn). The final sequence is one more statement that America always wins, no matter what, and even if they lost a great deal of troops and boats and planes, they will manage to win. Like they say at one given time: "they lost the battle but they will win the war".It's things like these that kill the innocence and the sensibility of a movie. The credits haven't started, I was getting out of the theater. Really, it was a great disappointment, which proves that all the waiting was in vain, and that even if they invest millions in one movie they aren't guaranteed to suceed. It was a flop from the expectation point of view, and it nearly missed at the box office: the film merely payed itself and nothing more. But it isn't an unfair defeat: the film is just too damn pretentious, and aimed for sensible and artistic goals that the director wasn't prepared to reach - hey, Michael, no all is about little lights and sunsets. If we are expecting something great from a director who has filmed none other than brainless patriotic action movies which rely on frame rate to state their points, think it over, baby. I think it's time that Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer think over their strategy and think that maybe smaller is better next time (just check out the 2 french "Taxi" movies which made over 16 million viewers in France altogether) - this is the way to do it: give the audience a thing they have never seen, for clichés are starting to lose their appeal. Like they said in Gladiator: "Win the crowd". Good luck on your next effort, Michael and Jerry. Be careful with choices and priorities.The "event" epic movie, of which Titanic was the last example, has fallen dead here, among the explosions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad that it's...bad (contains mild spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor was a truly awful film. I tried to like it. I felt I ought to like it. But I just couldn't bring myself to enjoy such utter rubbish.It suffered from plot 'twists' that were visible from some twenty miles away, as well as bad acting and terrible dialogue (notably Ben Affleck's line "Please ma'am, don't take my wings!")I admit, the special effects were excellent. But I don't feel that they were enough to save a film that in all other respects was totally sub par.I also felt that the 'love story' was confused. It was obvious by the end of the movie what you were supposed to WANT to happen. But little feeling was injected into either relationship, and I was left wishing that all three main characters would just get blown up so that I could go home and watch 'Coronation Street'.As a British viewer, and a teenage one at that, I was unable to warm to the blatant promotion of America and it's all round brilliance."Come on, we're great! Those evil Japanese people may have caught us unawares, but look we can get them back for it! And kill off a character in an attempt to make this film a tear jerker at the same time! Could this film be any better?"Well frankly, yes. It could have been much better. By the end of Pearl Harbor, I wasn't in tears for the fate of the characters. I was glad to get out of the cinema and stretch my legs!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never knew the significance of Pearl Harbor or what it even was. My birthday is on December 7th and what do you know, I was born at Pearl Harbor! Can you believe I never knew anything about what happened there? This movie was excellent because it illustrates my birthplace authentically on how it was back then in 1941. It was interesting to see the devastation it caused and exactly why it was such an extraordinary place after. I am so proud that I have some kind of history with that place. Affleck and Hartnett did an excellent job playing people you could see the perspective of the attack from, instead of playing your average military stiffs. Beckinsale did a fantastic job playing a woman torn between innocence and emotional strength. She really did illustrate how much gratitude is owed to the nurses the day of the attack. Another thing, it was a fantastic setback for the Navy in which my family has a history of joining for the past three generations. I was glad that they honored they Navy as something that we are eternally in their debt for serving our country. The action scenes were spectacular. WWII film-making has become revolutionary. I like how it wasn't 100% accurate. I like how it didn't have the same gritty realism as Pvt. Ryan did. Arguably, I think the love story was completely necessary or else all you'd have is a lot of sinking ships and crashing kamikazes that wouldn't illustrate history at all. At least have something normal to back this phenomenal re-enactment up. I recommend this movie to absolutely everyone since it has something you're guaranteed to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is a movie that defines an epic structure...the build-up, which many times involves a romance, the event to be viewed, the response, and the happier ending. That is definitely a broad and hideously worded definition of its structure, but the point is made. What epics require that Pearl Harbor simply did not deliver on is a reason to stay in your seats for around 3 hours...in other words, epics need good plots, good characterization, and good development.This film had little good in it. The acting was sub-par, to say the least. Ben Affleck has had good performances, such as Dogma and Good Will Hunting. He has also had bad ones, such as Armageddon. This one, though, was the worst I've seen. Of course, I don't know if anyone could act very well with the screenplay he was given. Josh Hartnett wasn't much better, but he was evenly more poorly written. Kate Beckinsale just wasn't at all convincing.The storyline was awful. The love-triangle story that emerged was the most melodramatic and unnecessary plot that I have perhaps ever seen. This film was searching for tears, but it only made me wince with pain.If those two things weren't bad enough, the handling of supporting actors was worse. Tom Sizemore, a very capable actor (Check out Bringing out the Dead and Saving Private Ryan.), had too small of a role. Cuba Gooding, Jr: ditto. Jon Voight, the best acting performance in the movie, was much under-used. Alec Baldwin did as good a job as he could have with as poorly written a character as he was given. Simply put, a movie all should have said no to.The battle itself was too long and too uninvolved. Was it me, or did I just see the same thing for 40 minutes? All I saw was people dying, and all I felt was boredom. Sure, people dying and things blowing up were what they saw too...but they felt it, they endured it, and they were angered by it. This should be felt by the audience, too (I was actually feeling guilty for not caring that much for the battle as I was watching it.)...and the last thing I was thinking about was enduring more. I was becoming angry...but not at the attack...while watching this film.So what were some goods of the film: Hans Zimmer delivered musically. He had a subtlety that few musicians have anymore. He made the Japanese sound ominous but not menacing...appropriate, I think. Special effects were great...but you have to have something to back it up. Jon Voight was excellent as FDR. Why did I not see more scenes with him in it?The attack on Pearl Harbor was an event that changed America forever. Many soldiers and civilians died, and all that were there were psychologically never the same. This movie did not show this at all...and that this wasn't shown makes this movie simply one of the worst failures ever to be displayed on film.Rating: 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though it plumbs the depths of schoolboy heroics and slushy sentimentality, on its completion, the makers of Pearl Harbor probably considered it a successful achievement and $150m well spent. (What they think now, in view of subsequent US box-office disappointment, is another matter.) With their eyes and minds fixed on such forerunners as Titanic, Saving Private Ryan, Top Gun and even South Pacific (minus the music), producer Jerry Bruckheimer, writer Randall Wallace and director Michael Bay seem to have aimed little higher than a formula action movie targeted at a younger audience. The love triangle between Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale), Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) is embarrassingly banal, with almost every incident and line of dialogue in the relationship thoroughly predictable. There are numerous other trite and clichéd incidents and characters, but the movie's treatment of African-American Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr), McCawley's spell in the UK with the RAF, the endless "joshing" among the pilots, and its female equivalent among the nurses, are all particularly painful. Alec Baldwin's lines as Lt Col Jimmy Doolittle sound especially stilted, though the Internet reveals that some of them are direct quotes from the war hero himself, The film improves when it gets away from the fictional characters and their relationships. The scenes in Washington involving Jon Voight as President Roosevelt, those showing the Japanese preparation for the attack, and of course the attack itself with all the SFX stops pulled out are absorbing and exciting. For me, the visually best sequence is the Japanese's planes' take-off for the attack. And the worst - how about our heroes' blood donation being dripped into Coke bottles? (Later, there is a fleeting more routine product-placement for Pepsi.) Despite all the above reservations, the movie has to be seen, if only as an example of mainstream Hollywood cinema.  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I could at least laugh at Armageddon...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One question continuously plagued me while watching Pearl Harbor (hey, you have to have something to think of when 90 minutes of storyline are painfully stretched into a 180-minute film). That question is: Do Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay genuinely feel they're making a grand, majestic and epic take on a tragic disaster? Everything in the film seems to lead on that they do; the grand scale battle scenes, the slo-mo shots of dying and drowning soldiers, the inflated, empty romance and the running time (so....epic moviemaking means making long films, I guess). If this is to be taken seriously, it's a failure far greater than any Bruckbuster before.It already starts with its basic premise. Someone said 'Pearl Harbor' , someone thought Titanic and that's it. A disaster rapped inside a 'romance'. Now, I'm not the world's greatest Titanic-fan. But the way the romance and disaster elements are combined here and the banality of the romance itself make the uber-corny Titanic seem like Citizen Kane. The romance in Titanic may have been more than a little cliched, but at least it served a purpose: it gave you characters to follow during the intensity of the sinking of the ship. It Pearl Harbor it does not serve any purpose. It seems the people behind it simply thought in modern day a disaster needed a romance. So out goes most of the interesting historical backround on the attack (which saves the movie from most critique on historical accuracy), the remaining bits reduced to some flashy edited 10-second scenes (in which good actors like Dan Akroyd and Colm Feore are criminally underused). Besides the trite romance it's replaced by some of the most redundant, crappy dia- and monologue ever commited to screen. Oh yeah, and there's the Ben Affleck/ Top Gun angle. Also, for no apparent reason whatsoever, Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character is briefly introduced and gets to pick up a medal. His is an interesting (and true) story, but just why was it included in this film?Arguably worse than any of its script problems is the battle itself. 40 minutes of completely uninvolving carnage and visual effects. Those effects sure are good, but the sequence in itself neither works as an action sequence, nor as a dramatic representation of the actual events. Note to Michael Bay: lots of explosions (far too many, by the way) do NOT make an action scene. There used to be something like tension because the viewer is taken into the action through characters he or she cares for. Here we get some bangs, a ship sinking and some plane stuff. All cut together is such a way that I doubt anybody knew exactly what was going on, let alone care. The whole scene feels like a 40-minute montage of something like 'America's Greatest Explosions'. Of course, even if it were a satisfying action scene, it would still be terribly patronizing to the real people involved in the attack (as it would reduce their ordeal to mere entertainment). But it would be less patronizing than it is now, because you could have discarded it as mere entertainment. With countless shots of the drowning and dying Bay is clearly establishing what he's going for is something beyond that. He's going for some Saving Private Ryan-style depiction of the horrors of war. But then, he cuts back to the next money shot, thus rendering the foregoing useless. In short; the battle is an incredibly, extraordinary mess.Isn't there anything good about Pearl Harbor then? Well, apart from those bit-parts (what is Tom Sizemore doing here, anyway?) and some impressive effects, no. Ben Affleck seems bent on replacing Keanu Reeves as rent-a-plank, Josh Hartnett does his best Leonardo DiCaprio impression and Kate Beckinsale looks great (and that's all she does). Furthermore, there's the soft-focus hospital scene (Q: Why not show the real deal? - A: PG-13 rating), the Doolittle raid (Q: It's a Pearl Harbor movie, right? - A: Yes, but the Americans need to win), the utterly senseless prologue, the terrible Hans Zimmer soundtrack and so much more, but you catch my drift.Pearl Harbour wants to be Titanic. It wants to reduce a tragic disaster to an entertainment blockbuster, but show the horrors at the same time. An already questionable starting point, but even worse is it's total failure at being entertaining at any point. Insulting rubbish.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Last hour spoiled a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains minor spoilers, but I've tried to avoid specifics. You have been warned.My theory on Pearl Harbor is that it was altered from the original scriptwriter's vision during the process of "selling" it to the studio. The first 100 minutes were fantastic: Epic scope, a wide cast of characters, balance between drama, romance and humour, foreshadowing of the attack, building of tension etc. The attack scene was done brilliantly and was tremendously immersive. However, after the actual attack on Pearl Harbor it was a logical place to end the movie. (Incidentally, HAD the movie ended there, I would have given it 8 out of 10)However, from that point the movie degrades down into an awful waste of another hour. All characters except for 3 are rushed out of the movie, the plot changes course and pace completely (Can anyone say "Armageddon"), and the realism and immersiveness of the movie is gone. It appears that the studio simply could not accept a movie which ended with a crushing defeat against the USA, and needed to rescript to put that right. This blindingly shallow and tedious extra hour destroyed any sense of enjoyment I had taken out of the first half and dropped this movie's rating down to a rotten 4.*MAJOR SPOILER* One other comment, they would never have put Rafe's status as "Killed in action" unless they had found the body/tags. He should have been "Missing in action".Pros: 1) Interesting and believable love story up to the attack. 2) The chilling triage scene outside the hospital with the lipstick. 3) Special effects and filming in the attack scene. 4) Supporting characters and the use of humour. 5) Real historical quotes popping up in unexpected places.Cons: 1) The last hour. 2) Blind patriotism. "Evil" Japanese pilots doing strafing runs on innocent women. "Good" American pilots not killing a single person. 3) The last hour. Aargh. 4) Overdone camera movement made many key scenes unclear. 5) The last hour. Simply awful.My recommendation - go and watch this movie, and walk out when you hear the words "Do you know what Top Secret means?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor boasts a tremendous cast including leads Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsdale. All three performances are brilliant, especially young Hartnett whose previous screen outings (The Faculty, Halloween H20) have hardly required any serious acting ability! The supporting acts include Jon Voight as President Roosevelt, Alec Baldwin as General Doolittle, Cuba Gooding Jnr, Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner, Dan Akroyd and Ewen Bremner. Each one offers a career best, Bremner even beats his early performance as Spud in Trainspotting. Director Michael Bay offers a film that stirs the emotions deeply and leaves the audience feeling dry, overpowered and angry at the American government for their ignorance at this time. The closing scene is probably one of the saddest I have seen in film history (baring in mind my age is 17)Although overlong and sometimes possibly drenched in American heroism, the film is a worthy experience and definately one I would recommend to all. Rating = 4/5</fullReview>

I've seen the movie for 6 times this week and it's still not boring me, like the Titanic did. It's a great story about love and friendship and how war can change that. The film is brilliantly casted, the actors are all very good and know their jobs very well and that makes the movie so sensitive that I think the ones who did not cry in the end have no hearts, cause it is really heartbreaking when Danny dies and you see Rafe go out of the plane, turning around and takes Danny out of the plane and when you hear Rafe call the sun of Evelyn "Danny!" The action scenes are very exciting. To me, this is a movie what will never ever bore me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I cried. . . over the waste of my $4.50!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I so did not want to see this movie, but I was forced to by a group of friends willing to waste their money despite the critics' warnings. Well, guess what? Yep, you guessed it, not only did I find "Pearl Harbor" to be the worst piece of crap I've ever seen, but my friends all felt bad as I gave them a look that said "I told you so."So, "Pearl Harbor", how do I loathe thee? Let me count the ways...1. The script! Ewww! I can't believe Randall Wallace, the same guy who wrote the script for "Braveheart" (one of my favorites), would write such a clichéd and corny piece-o-rubbish. I'm not gonna crap on the acting here because Ben, Josh, Kate, and everyone else unfortunate enough to have their names attached to this mess literally had nothing good to work with! Seriously, you could go back in time, snag the whole magnificent cast from "The Godfather (I and II)", put them in these roles (if you could pay them enough, probably not), and still have one stinker on your hands! The dialogue and lines were so bad that they distract from the already shallow plot. Speaking of which...2. Yes, the plot. Who was the idiot who decided to make this movie a love story with the attack as mere background material? Oh yeah, Jerry Bruckheimer, damn him ... and I thought "Armageddon" was bad. It's "Titanic Redux", same cheesy dialogue, same clichés, same predictability. Now I'm not against love stories, really, I'm not! If it's well-written and acted and develops in it's own unique way. But this cookie-cutter "love-triangle" plot is not only poorly contrived, it's insulting, which I'll explain later.3. The fact that I did not care about what happened to any of the characters. That's thanks to the noxiously written script and plot.4. The soundtrack. Especially the song at the end. I'll never complain about "My Heart Will Go On" ever again!5. The fact that this movie potentially insults all of humanity. The Japanese, obviously, being portrayed as cold-hearted and ignorant. And this movie's gonna be released in Japan soon; if I were Bruckheimer I'd reconsider, because they might very well bomb us again after this insult of a flick, and I won't care! Hell, this movie insults every non-American simply due to it's sickening excess of misapplied patriotism (SPOILER: The movie's ending, yep, the Americans always have to come out on top). I consider myself a self-respecting AMERICAN, and if you consider yourself such, you will be insulted by this movie. It insults the men and women who in some way served our country during World War II and this bombing. Now all the teeny-boppers who foolishly and sheepishly love this tripe will be led to believe that all the soldiers involved in WWII had love triangles and twisted morals and stabbed their friends in the back, not that I cared about this sorry attempt to pull off this delicate topic. The overall quality of this movie almost makes me ashamed to be an American.Overall, if you haven't seen "Pearl Harbor" don't waste your time. This movie has NO redeeming qualities whatsoever (at least Titanic executed the sinking of the ship right). If you want a good film about the bombing of Pearl Harbor, watch "Tora, Tora, Tora." If you're looking for a good plot-driven war movie, look away from this mess and steer yourself toward "Saving Private Ryan" (same war) or a good Vietnam flick (ahem... "Apocalypse Now"). And if your in the mood for a good love story or chick flick, and yes, even I'm into watching those when in the right company, watch "When Harry Met Sally" or "What Women Want." But whatever you do, stay the hell away from this! I gave this pile of mierda 1/10; it's a shame I couldn't give it a negative number.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew not to expect much of this movie when I saw the name Jerry Bruckheimer in the production credits. After all, this was the same genius that brought us such great cinema classics as Top Gun, Armaggedon, and The Rock....Rather than give us an historically accurate slice of history, which in itself would have made for fascinating viewing, Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay give us a tedious, by the numbers romantic 'epic' that screams 'Don't I Remind You of Titanic?!' (There are even long, lingering shots of a sinking ship, for crying out loud).The story is clumsy and disjointed, with the love story and the actual event having very little relationship to each other. The dialogue is cringe inducing ('We don't want to die sir....we just want to matter..' BARF!) and the gung-ho American flag waving is nauseating.For those of you looking for Titanic 2, you'll love it. Those of you looking for an intelligent and accurate depiction of events that occurred in December 1941, go rent 'Tora!, Tora!, Tora!'Crap!, crap!, crap!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Angry Historian &amp; Writer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a professional historian and published author I find it impossible to avoid throwing in a few comments about this film. I finally went to see it this weekend (July 14th) long after the hoopla surrounding its release, and yes I did go primed as a critic due to what I heard from students who take my course on WWII.I left the theater feeling angry, angry over the fact that the film could have been far more effective, entertaining, and revealing simply by being respectful of the history of that fateful day. Of course I understand the need for profit in film. I've had several books optioned for the screen, and whether I am writing fiction or history, I of course have an eye on the bottom line. And yet I would like to think that when it comes to certain subjects, that these subjects would be approached with the respect they deserve. Pearl Harbor, D-Day, Gettysburg, the deaths of Kennedy, King and Lincoln are sacred moments in our history and when done on film should at least be treated with some respect. I am not asking for a somber documentary, or even a high tech remake of "Tora Tora Tora," but I was hoping for a bit more than the trivia dished out with an obvious eye towards marketing to the 18 year old female audience. I can not fathom why second rate directors and production teams feel compelled to trash over history in favor of improbable fiction, when so often the real stories are far more compelling. Spielberg did this beautifully in both Schindler and Private Ryan. The real history was respected, the fiction blended in with skill and grace, creating films that are the highest level of entertainment, while at the same time being films worthy of historical respect. I use both in my classes, and the most successful class I've ever taught involved bringing in four D-Day vets and opening the class with the first fifteen minutes of Private Ryan. I would never dream of insulting my class, or veterans, with the use of Pearl Harbor. Of course I could carry on about the absurd plot lines, (come on, the guy would of gotten a telegram out the day he got out of France), the technical screw ups (1980s frigates as targets, flying in the wrong direction when the B-25s head to China. . .the sun is setting behind them. . . and the planes did not bomb as a group, and why did Affleck get on a train in New York to go to England when the Queen Mary was sitting in the harbor) but I think the issue runs far deeper. It is an issue of all the lost potentials of this film. Sure, go ahead and create fictional characters in a real setting, some of the best books ever about history are actually historical fiction, but what was lost was the potentials of the real stories. Forty five minutes less of poorly written romance replaced with a rich cast of supporting actors playing real roles could have transformed the film. When the "Oklahoma" rolled over hundreds of men were trapped inside. They touched on it in the film, but what a lost moment for a real character, the boxer who fought Dorie for example, with just a couple dozen lines of writing to develope him out and we could have better felt the horror of it. Yes we did see Dorie, but it was sensed that the role was almost an obligatory salute to diversity, rather than a heart felt introduction to the gallant role played not just by African Americans but also Latinos and Filipinos serving that day. How frustrating---all the lost stories that could have been brought to life. The Japanese side deserved far more, instead it was reduced to a few attempts at imitating Kurosawa's "Ran" with the outdoor sets and banners. I did like the dialogue of the pilot writing to his father, but damn it, here was a chance to create a real character, a pilot with a family, willing to die for his country, and then indeed he does die, shot down in the raid. If we had followed his perspective for just a few minutes the raiders would have been far more than soulless killing machines. The only human touch I felt for the Japanese side was the gunner waving the children off, a genuine act which did reveal at least some humanity on a side that fought brilliantly even if it was for a cause that was wrong. As an historian yet again I left a theater frustrated at what could have been, and angered how a crucial moment in our history was reduced to trivia. I must repeat that there are certain moments in history which are sacred to a people and should be handled as such when someone wishes to make money off of them. This film trashed the memory of that day of infamy, and tragically another twenty years must now pass before someone attempts to do it right. Unfortunately those brave few survivors of that day will no longer be with us to see it. I just hope that the next "historical" film that comes out does in some small way truly connect to the real history, and in so doing both the producers and the public will profit from the result.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MULTIPLE SPOILERS ALERTOK, I know it's been out nearly 2 months, but I just saw this at the $2.50 movies LOL. It is alternately very good and very bad, blatantly ripping off the "Titanic" formula, from certain shots (overturning ships, floating bodies) to a tragic love story to a power ballad that was obviously supposed to be the next "My Heart Goes On," but isn't. The attack footage is gripping and disturbingly beautiful, almost balletic -- war should never, *ever* be allowed to look this pretty onscreen -- cf. Saving Private Ryan or, even better, the HBO flick When Trumpets Fade starring the highly underrated Ron Eldard. And no movie should ever consist of about 1/3 slo-mo shots. Mr. Bay seems never to have found an effect he didn't like enough to repeat till it ceases to be effective. As for the love triangle, the very capable Mr. Hartnett plays the whole movie like he's totally in love with Mr. Affleck -- a shrewd and interesting choice. Alas, Mr. Affleck is a total stick (the only worse performance in the movie is the absurdly over-the-top turn by Alec Baldwin). Ms. Beckinsale is excellent -- indeed the whole subplot with the nurses is surprisingly substantive and moving -- but in the climactic scene, she is literally left waiting by the phone. Worth seeing, but it could have been great -- especially if the filmmakers had trusted the truth of history: America lost this round, and paid dearly for it. Turning it into a "Top Gun" victory ride undercuts everything about the film that works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Critics have been eager to berate this film, which is understandable. Filmmakers have to be very careful when taking on a historic event of this magnitude. The reason for the success of "Titanic" was that, beyond a somewhat lowbrow script and mushy love story, great care was taken to depict in detail just what the great ship Titanic was all about. The legend of Titanic was treated with respect (if not augmented). "Pearl Harbor" lacks a great deal of historic insight and care for details.There are two major flaws with this film. The first, and most important one, is the love story itself. Dizzy with the immense success of "Titanic" amongst the young communities, the makers saw their chance to make big money in a grand love story set in an event of legendary proportions. The story feels really added-on, though, the attack and the ensuing retaliation effort (I will get to THAT part later) suddenly strip the story of its heart and soul. Furthermore, the characters are one-dimensional - despite fine acting by all parties - and one is never really given a chance to connect to them in any way.The second major flaw is the entire last hour of the film. It seems to be (and probably was) added to the script just to educate the world that the USA always wins, no matter what. The fact that the attack on Pearl Harbor was one of the most astounding military successes of all time is downgraded by the need to emphasize on US greatness. A suicide mission to drop a few pathetic bombs on a factory in Tokyo didn't really deter the Japanese from continuing their massive offensive in South East Asia. It is an unnecessary part, and the movie becomes terribly overlong.What, then, makes it okay? Well, obviously the attack itself is depicted with incredible force and with a great feeling for drama and action (which Bruckheimer-Bay team is no stranger to), some of the scenes are just awesome. The aerial battles are also very well envisioned - even though no American planes took to the sky during the battle. The acting is pretty good, not bringing a lame script to life like DiCaprio and Winslet did in "Titanic", but nonetheless helps keeping it afloat. I also appreciate the fact that the Japanese were not depicted as cruel, insane killers who just attacked for fun. From their perspective, the attack on Pearl Harbor was the only sensible thing to do in order to keep their aggressive expansionist politics intact. I'm not defending it in any way - I'm just stating the facts.So quite why the critics have to massively downgrade this movie, I don't really understand. It's very far from being the grand historic spectacle it could have been - it is merely entertaining - and it doesn't bring any new light to the actual event. Ultimately, it isn't the kind of film that I will remember with any clarity. It's just fiction. As such, it works pretty well.</fullReview>

And, as everyone looks like living in Beverly Hills 90210 the drama of the film falls into a bad-joke level.In the second place, simply lies. One thing is try to avoid making an extensive documentary film like "Tora! Tora! Tora!" and other, quite different, is to hide facts, or simply to tell things that didn't happen:* USA knew perfectly what was going to happen. It was only an excuse to enter the war* The most important ships of the Pacific Fleet were away during the japanese attack. Both of the carriers were "in missions" and also the new destroyers and cruisers* Apart from the heavy tragedy of the sinking of the "Arizona", it was a ship built for WWI. It was quite old and was going to be retired* The training of the japanese pilots lasted for two months, not two days* The raid over Tokio destroyed six factories and one school. USA lost 8 pilotsAs you can see, the real facts are near opposite with what is said in the film. (And I think that Jon Voight should... errrr... hmmmm.... ?stop acting?)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ok but too similar!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This war epic is fine, they are make very beautifully. Too bad is that the story has similar characteristics with "Titanic", about human suffering. Although the story is a bit too long but it can be promising with bunch of huge big names Hollywood star.I believe the story has to be explain with more details and that's maybe can make this film an enjoyable one to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ME SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT THE INDUSTRY:There a thing people have to understand. When wanting to recreate the battle of Pearl Harbor, for the reason of entertaining, you need money. A lot of money. And those money are bound to come from people who have them, yes? These people, who lend you the money are bound to wanting to get their money back, yes? So naturally there'll be A LOT of poll-searches done on a project of this magnitude, before the filming begins, yes?So what do we end up having is a "Usual" story, with unusual images. Which is all the "Pearl Harbor" is... and that ain't all that bad.THE "PEARL HARBOR" WALKTHROUGHThe characters are thin, but believable (This is entertainment, people, not "The late hour" with Siegmund Freud), and the love-story that goes on for the first hour is okay. It's a warm-up for the inevitable.And then: Battle. For 45-minutes of incredibly digital imagery, you get a feeling of how stratigicly brilliant, the Japanese war-machine was. They blow up practically everything, which really is not that surprising to those of you, that know history a little.So: There's gotta be some sorta happy-end, right? For the americans, yes? So our pilot-boys, though strugling for the same woman, take on a suicide-mission to bomb Tokyo. This bit is a silly add-on, as nothing comepares to the battle at "The Pearl".And then: End Credits.ME TALKING ABOUT GOOD STUFF.I like first part of the story. I feel entertained and moved, by all that love, and all that war to set it apart. And naturally I like the battle-scenes, and the thinking: "This is what it was like"I like the acting of:Ben Afflect Dan Akroyd Alec BaldwinI love the whole quality of sound and image. It's incredible. There's been masters at work here.ME TALKING ABOUT BAD STUFF:I don't really like the end-bit. It's too long, and becomes too much of a "And so on and then and so on".I don't like the acting of:Cuba Gooding Jr.I don't like the patriotic feel to the last bit either. The whole "We can do anything c'os we're americans"-thing. But that's just me being dane.ME RATING THIS FILM AND ENDING THIS HORROR OF A REVIEW:I give it a 7. It's viewable (In the cinema only), but not deep and full of special messages. You'll like this one, I guarantee. But you won't fall in love with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>although it got many bad reviews from "professionals" i thought pearl harbor was an excellent movie. there was a love story in there but it wasnt entirely one..the war scenes were very good and the acting was good. i only had two problems with this movie. 1 they portrayed cuba gooding jr as a main character but he wasnt and 2 why would kids be playing baseball at 600 am but overall it was a very good movie and i urge everyone to see it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Then I Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hearing a lot of negativity about this movie. The build upwould be dull, the scenes involving the Japanese embarrassingand the actual bombing too short.When I finally saw the movie with my girl, I was still thrilled. I'vealways liked Bruckheimer/Bay's eye-candy and knowing that whenthe script was in the hands of Randall Wallace, there couldn't betoo much of a problem there.And there wasn't.I've had a fun time. I didn't think the beginning was too slowbecause it gave a lot of information about the time and reallyestablished the characters. The acting (especially Alec Baldwin's)was better then I expected as well. Of course Alec's a stiff, he's anofficer!!!!I didn't cry during the movie. It didn't affect me that much. Somefighting shots actually resembled jeans commercials which wasannoying but the overall movie is satisfying and fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The following is partly taken from other people's negative reviews.For one thing, If it is called "Pearl Harbor," should it focus on a love triangle? Shouldn't they have made the bombs go a bit more diagonal and not just vertical? (Spoiler ahead) Should we care that any main character dies? Especially if it is one we know from the beginning of the film?The answer to all of these is yes. The makers probably thought it was "no."It was not worth $7.00 to see this. (If you see it with others, not only shame on you, but you are wasting enough money to make Hobgoblins. Not that it's expensive.) Films shouldn't be watched for special effects, but for a story, and quality. How many times must I say this? Nobody seems to care.As for effects, they are good, but do we need to be wasting money on them? I should make a CG film with little story, and watch people give me money.

		<fullReview>I have to say that although I liked this movie it just lasted to long. The movie should have ended right after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. The characters were well written and acted. Of course you cann't go wrong with Ben Affleck. I love a man in uniform, and to see him in that piolts outfit made it worth $6.00. The love story was sweet and very sad at times. Although, I would have liked to see Evelyn and Danny be the ones married at the end. That is the only thing that really disappointed me about the movie. Do I recommend this movie? For history lovers and Affleck fans yes I do. Be warned that it is a great movie but it will make you tired after 3 hours!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's Going On?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello! I am Akshay V. Kulkarni from India .Recently I have been reading various reviews, articles, and notes on Disney's most expensive film ever `Pearl Harbor'. Well I do not know how many stars the movie exactly deserves, but I simply hated the way the critics are making fun of `Pearl Harbor'. I came to a conclusion that if a 100 critics have reviewed `Pearl Harbor', then 80 consider it to be just ** out of *****.Can anyone explain this as I have seen this happen with most movies. The same thing happened with 'Mulan'.That time 'The Prince of Egypt' was credited more even when 'Mulan's' script was better.And with every movie in the past years ,except 'Toy Story'. That really shut the nasty ones. Don't the people at the executive board of Disney think that something is wrong. A tragedy like Titanic,which was a to be mourned and acclaimed more by the British,was acclaimed more by U.S critics .In Titanic,the love story formed most of the film,and the sinking is barely an hour. Well ....what ...is wrong?or Was it just Twentieth Century Fox. Critics are mentioning that the film makers of Pearl Harbor have forgotten the basis of the tragedy at the end of the film and its history. But the narration shown at the end of the movie, when Rafe and Evelyn are with Danny's son in the open fields is lot more than enough to make any American proud of what had been achieved in 1942.And that is what Bay and Bruckhimer and Wallace have done.They have made history.They have shown to the younger generation of America ,what great country is their's. The end part of the movie was enough to make any any hard hearted critic change to a soft one. Only god knows what has happened.Absurd.Where is Americas history heading?.Are they not proud of their victories?Have'nt they sat through 3 hr long movies before?was every three hr movie before Pearl Harbor interesting?OR would it have been a huge hit if it were not produced by the Mouse House.Also someone had mentioned that America was not in a position to have a grand funeral for Danny?Why man,HE is a hero,and he deserves it,even though some call it fictitious. And also the response by the audiences in America was heart breaking.A true American,who is proud of what had been achieved in 1941,should see the movie,no matter what the critics say. Remember AMERICA WON!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since this movie is constantly being compared to Titanic...I will do just the same...I saw the movie for the 2nd time last night..and thought it was even better than the first. The idea of Pearl Harbor was a great background for the love story. Titanic did the same...it was a great place to put a love story. Yes I admit that it would've been nice to have the movie end with Hiroshima and Nagasaki..but oh well...tough! We didnt direct the movie...therefore we can't complain..for those of you who think you can do better..go right ahead. This movie is being...well actually it has been...released in Japan..and they needed to focus more on the love story there..than on the actual Pearl Harbor...or the things that were said..because we were soooooo mean to Japan in this movie..many lines needed to be changed for the release of this movie there..we made Japan look bad..but oh well..cuz they bombed us and yeah..they deserved it...ok now I'm rambling about nothing..but I really don't care...my point is...that Pearl Harbor was a good movie..if you dont like love stories then maybe your opinion is a little different..but the acting was great...and yeah...alright i'm done...bye! And YES this is my second time defending this movie here!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie could have been so much better(and shorter) if they had taken out the love story, or if they insisted on keeping it in there, shortened it. Pearl Harbor reminded me too much of Titanic, and the last thing this world needs is another Titanic. Pearl Harbor had good action, some of the best action sequences I've seen, but because of the love story, I probably will not see this movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hate Michael Bay, Jerry Bruckheimer and epecially this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have the same 2 problems with this movie that I did with Titanic: unbelievably bad diologue and the tragic disaster brought to life with good special effects. The acting is stiff and wooden; you don't care what happens to the people onscreen. Ben Afflek isn't too bad an actor, but he gets annoying during this movie with the diologue that he spews out. Josh Hartnett (whose hair would've been cut shorter if he really was in the army) is also a capable actor, who sucks at the hands of Randall Wallace, the screenwriter. If any of you people who liked this movie ever see it again, please, please, PLEASE, listen to the diologue. It's so mind numbing that I'm am now stupider after watching this movie. Another problem was the depiction of the event. They didn't make it scary, which is what it should've been depicted as. They showed it as one big, long action sequence. They didn't want you to care about the thousands of people who died at Pearl Harbor. They wanted you to care about how cool the special effects were.Another thing wrong with this movie was the depiction of the Japanese, which was as one killing machine. The movie wanted you to cheer whenever the Japanese were called dirty b*stards or whenever one is shot down. I didn't cheer. I know something is wrong with a movie whenever the evil Japanese emperor comes onscreen and I expect him to grow a little curled mustach and put on a top hat. Then he can curl his mustache with his finger and pretend he's Snidely Whiplash.Now I'm not saying that a good movie couldn't have been made about the disastrous event. The movie would've been so much better if it focused on actual people. One good thing about the movie were the supporting roles of three actors: Jon Voight, James King and Cuba Gooding Jr., who are effective in the roles that they play (especially Voight as FDR). Sadly, they weren't enough to save this overhyped peice of dung.In closing, I am now convinced that Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay can't make a good movie. I absolutely hate these two men and thy don't deserve to be in the movie business. One good thing that I'm glad that Jerry and Michael didn't do was put Nicholas Cage somewhere in this movie. I like him, but apparently he's sold his soul to these two men as evidenced by him being in every movie that Jerry and Michael make.By the way, I think this has to be my longest review so far. It's amazing what a bad movie such as Pearl Harbor can inspire a guy to write.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>....of $140 million and 3 hours of my time.A war movie / love story that fails at both, this has neither the heroism of "Saving Private Ryan", the REAL romance &amp; dialogue of "From Here to Eternity", or even the maritime fx of "Titanic". A terribly corny script, mediocre acting (given their assigned dialogue, that is understandable), too much bombing &amp; strafing ("Want another explosion here, Jerry?" "Nah, gimme four more kabooms there!"), some bad fx (especially one scene where the US fighters being pursued by Zeroes are flying between the camera &amp; a not-too-distant hanger and both planes appear to be about 8 feet long), some bad "newsreel camera" shots (per "...Ryan") that are so jerky as to be unwatchable, the "hazy" camera shots in the hospital (several people where I watched this went to complain to the theater management about the projector being out of focus), too many quick cuts when people are just talking, too many full-facial shots that took up the entire screen (a person can take just so many nasal cavaties), too much of Ben A's "classic" smirk which he tries to pass off as a tough-guy attitude, and lastly and sadly, not enough of Cuba Gooding as Dorie Miller, one of the real-life heroes of that day. He was the genuine hero, not the fantasy flyboys (Ben &amp; Josh) around whom the entire 3 hours mistakenly revolved. This movie may excite some in the audience who drool over anything Ben A appears in, but in the long run it will be put aside on the action-film shelf along with "Independence Day" and "Armageddon" &amp; will never be in the same class as "Saving Private Ryan", "From Here to Eternity", or "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find this film one of the most difficult ones to comment. It has so many good points and so many bad points that you can think it's either a good or a bad film.But, to avoid that complexity, I'll try to recall them and write them down here, and let you construct your own conclusion. Of course, you have to keep in mind at every moment that this is the most expensive film ever made so far. So these are the points.1) The music. I place it at the first place because it is in my opinion the worst thing in the movie. This film needed a soundtrack by John Williams, for example. He would never have used that "minor seventh" chord for almost all the scenes (including both love and war scenes), which makes the film so emotionally flat. In Gladiator we have a good example of what music can do to a film (not to mention Star Wars...).2) The script. Pearl Harbor has a really poor script, based on a simple and original idea but poorly developed. In Saving Private Ryan we have a simple and original idea brilliantly developed. The film is so predictable that 1 hour before its ending I already knew it (I think that even before that...). It's a paradox in a film which is based in a fact that's basically one of the biggest surprises in history. Well, you could say "but history is already known", and you would be right, but the film isn't already known until you watch it. In Titanic I really was surprised when the ship collided...!3) The look. This film succeeds in creating another world for us. We feel transported to another time, with plenty of details, and that's something remarkable. The nurses look like fashion models, and Evelyn puts lipstick on her lips in every scene, but I'm not really sure if things were that way in 1941.4) The special effects. Pearl Harbor has one of the best special effects I have ever seen. The war scenes are so real that they can override all the bad points we could find. A lot of CGI has been used, but it's well done and looks real. As a result there is the best recreation ever made of what the Pearl Harbor attack could be. As in Saving Private Ryan, we find ourselves inside the battle and understand what those people should feel.5) The message. I know that films don't necessarily need a message, but this one needed one. And it really has one, but with a wrong envelope. In Saving Private Ryan, the old man at the cemetery asks his family if he is a good person. He has no physical injuries, but his soul is badly damaged, and desperately asks for a redemption to rip that black ghost away from him. We call this CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, and there's nothing of this in Pearl Harbor. Rafe and Danny kill a lot of people and pass through extreme situations, Evelyn lives the worst nightmare in her life, and after all of that we don't see any change in them. Most war films from the past (being most of them propaganda films) are the same way. That's NOT real, and doesn't help at all to send a message as we don't identify with the characters.You can make your own conclusions. This is mine: Film industry has lost its aim, which used to be art. They live for the moment, and don't care for anything but money. Nowadays a lot of good special effects are the perfect passport to success. All the other elements are chosen by its impact on masses rather than by its artistic value. And the artistic value is what really makes great films adored by masses, but in a long term.If you are curious about my rating to this film, here it is: 6-7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ENEMIES AT THE GATES of Pearl Harbor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a perfect (I think) representation of the famous morning of 7th December 1941 on Pearl Harbor. The 40 minutes of Japanese attack are the greatest minutes of the whole 194 minutes of this movie. The scenery is the best I have seen: a lot of boats, persons and Japanese planes. The story is a mix of Brave Heart, Enemies At The Gates and Titanic. The writer (Randall Wallace) is the same as Brave Heart, great movie. He (Wallace) starts to presents two young friends who dream to became "warriors", as he had presented us on Brave Heart(William Wallace, he didn't dream to be, he was pushed to be by the English), then this little boys became men, and "warriors" as William Wallace. And now we mix this story with Titanic and Enemies At The Gates, and this two men fall in love with the same woman, as on Enemies At The Gates, the romanticism of this movie make us remember the romanticism of Titanic, one very romantic story in a middle of a human disaster. After the "great" Japanese attack, The U. S. government decides to attack Japan. On this American attack we have two heroes, as on Brave Heart (one). The story have it originality, but make us remember a lot other movies.Finally, I think this movies is a great American movie, but it could be better. Not like Intimacy or Freedom, Pearl Harbor is different, it's easiest to understand the message and it's to entertain us. Intimacy and Freedom are two movies to appreciate like a painting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a real love-story with the events of Pearl Harbor providing a fascinating back-drop. The acting of Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett was excellent, however the portrayal by Kate Beckinsale as the nurse torn between her love for two war-time pilots is truly exceptional. Special mention for Jon Voigt as President Roosevelt. The scene from the White House in front of all his military aides and advisors is enough on its own to recommend compulsory viewing. The actual attack on Pearl Harbor has to be seen to be believed. It just went on and on as I feel sure it did in the actual event. It was really like being there. Although not historically accurate, I give this movie 9 out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing new... (contains some spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I see a movie that I somewhat don't appreciate, I can easily sit and search any little flaw to rack the movie down with. So I'll try not to.PEARL HARBOR doesn't put away the grease. But that's not really a secret. As usual in Hollywood Blockbusters the movie is parted in three different parts. Part one invites us to a lovestory between Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale and their friends, especially Affleck's life-long-buddy (Josh Hartnett). The lovers have one last night before Affleck has to go off to war. However he gets shot down and is reported dead. A new love story comes to life when Hartnett comforts Beckinsale. Naturally, their romance doesn't end the story. Of course, Affleck isn't dead. He returns and his longtime friend becomes an enemy. The same old story, that is. The lovestory isn't pale but it's rather predictable and I'm afraid to say the concept isn't immortal.In part two Japan bombs Pearl Harbor. The five minutes right before the actual bombing is perhaps the only really impressive thing in the whole movie. It lays a layer of suspense over America and nobody expects anything. Slowly the worries and the "wait a minute"-feeling increase before it takes everybody with surprise. After that it's basicly an hour of war, with Affleck/Harnett and the boys confused and surprised by the attack. Cuba Gooding Jr also appears with a nice, but strangely vapid character here. It is a very well-made scenario with many big booms and powerful effects. The kind of things that doesn't need any greater thinking to enjoy. It's the best part of the movie.The third part is all about USA's big revenge against Japan. The two friends, the supporting-actors and some other pilots, are trained by a naval officer (Alec Baldwin) to execute a top secret plan; bombing Tokyo. This part is held up by Baldwin, but gets boring at many times, especially at the end when the group crash in the middle of Japanese troops.This part contains some of the most overflowing USA-cheers I've ever seen. Especially Baldwin's character talks loudly about his brave American men and teach the pilots how to say "I'm an American" in Chineese. As the patriot he is, he would rather die than be prisoned by the Japanese.I think PEARL HARBOR has potential. But the script simply has too much clichés. I mean, do people in movies still say "I'm so cold" before they die? The movie has some great editing and special effects, some half-vapid but OK music and the three hours pass very fast. The acting is without any bigger surprises.Jon Voight does the best job as the American president. He is a very talanted actor and he really makes a powerful and believable job. Though I sympathized mostly with the character Goose. His line "I have a girlfriend" really got a laugh out of me.Overall I'm generous and give this movie a 6/10, and that's even though the lack of new ideas and the large number of clichés</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The problem is: American patriotism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor almost moved me to tears. It was, however not the trite and predictable love story that acheived this emotional response, but frustration at a wasted oppourtunity. Effectively, this was a very mediocre movie that could have been great.Why on earth did the movie not deliver what was suggested by the title - an insight into an event which turned WW2. When the political and historic aspects of this movie should have been the major focus, we were instead forced to endure a romance inserted for all the mothers and 13yr old girls who would attend, in order to widen the movies 'appeal'. There were even the occasional glimpses of interesting footage - such as the cryptographers struggling to break the Japanese codes, which highlighted just how boring the love-theme was. Instead of the building of tension and suspicion in Washington, along with a feeling of calm and safety in Pearl Harbor itself, that would have far more effectively led up to the bombing, the first part of the movie was an almost complete waste of time.The second part, the bombing and immidiate response, was actually pretty good, as most people have agreed (apart from the ridiculoulsy heroic antics of our clean-cut, all-american heroes). whether or not it makes up the price of admission, as has been claimed, is up to the individual. I think it would have, had the movie ended there. But it didn't. The final part made me very angrey. Since one of the boys have to die, in order for our heroine to live happily ever after with the man she loves, without ungraciously dumping the father of her child, off they head on a raid that was possibly the stupidest thing I have ever seen. apparently, this raid of 16 American planes turned the war, because it proved how brave Americans could be. Throughout the movie, it was made clear that, while some attempts were made not to cast the Japanese as satan, America would rise up in bravery and justice for the side of good. This leaves almost no mention of how america was happy to allow millions of deaths in Europe, before 'heroically' rising up in their own defence. Also left entirely untouched is the entire issue of Americas' use of the ATOMIC BOMB!!! For the movie to portray all American actions as completely justified and 'right' is frankly nausiating. I left the cinema fuming.Note: If you don't care about society, history or politics at all; if you really, really like seeing things blown up; or if you want to see a predictable romance between stereotypical characters that always look ready for a magazine cover; this is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor as Armageddon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every bomb hits the target, every explosion results in a huge fireball, and every bullet finds it's target, regardless of how it was delivered or lined up.It was really difficult to see an actual historical event turned into a Hollywood action film with all its preposterous battle hoopla. I've seen interviews with Pearl Harbor survivors who say that the movie is pretty accurate. This rather amazes me. Either they have forgotten the details of the event, or they may not have actually been there. My father was there. The battleships were tied together with walkways between them and to the dock. There was no way that Japanese planes were going to fly between the ships, below the deck level, the length of the ships, but they did this repeatedly in the movie. Dive bombers did half immelmanns to attack. I doubt this was ever done in actual combat. Bombs fell straight down, a physical impossibility when delivered from a moving airplane. Wasn't it amazing how all those guys who went through flight training together were always assigned to the same duty stations? Pearl Harbor had such potential, with todays technology, but in the hands of an adolescent director, the result was quite pathetic.Alec Balwin's portrayal of the phenomenonly heroic Jimmie Doolittle was overly theatrical and moronic. There was audible laughter in the theater during his major "speech." Anyone who would cast him as an American patriot is an idiot.I am willing to "check my brain at the door" to enjoy "Animal House", or even "The Animal," but don't ask me to do this to view an historical drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A three hour yawn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that *anybody* can find this movie even mildly entertaining totally escapes me. I had a fairly open mind when I went to see it, although I did expect a sickening display of American patriotism. And I did of course get that in bucketloads. That's not the problem though. The problem is simply put: this film is the worst film I've ever paid money to see (well, I'll make an exception for Dungeons &amp; Dragons).For the first two hours I couldn't help moaning, groaning and looking at everything BUT what was happening on the screen. The only things that were mildly amusing were the HORRENDOUS dialogue, and the almost equally bad acting. This film shattered all my illusions of Ben Affleck as a decent actor. However, I saw 'Chasing Amy' just a couple of days ago (an EXCELLENT film by the way), and he does a really good role there. This leads me to the conclusion that it's not the actors' abilities that are lacking in this film - it's just that the film is so badly written - so flat and boring - that they don't have anything to play with (like the horrendous performance award winning Jeremy Irons does in Dungeons &amp; Dragons). Not even Anthony Hopkins would've looked good in Pearl Harbor. And God knows what on earth Cuba Gooding Jr. is doing in there. I suspect only to include the mandatory even-black-people-can-be-good-people-bit all Hollywood films have these days (we know this Hollywood - stop being so insecure).I simply cannot believe that the script in this film was written by the same person that wrote the script for Braveheart (Randall Wallace). Although Braveheart has elements of sentimentality, I love that film. I think the commercial forces of Hollywood pulled Wallace's writing abilities down in cliche Hell. Talking about cliches - I won't even try to put you through the misery of telling you about the pathetic love story. It's the most horribly cliched I've ever seen.A problem with the film is also how totally one-dimensional and barbaric the Japanese are portrayed. I find the scene in which the Japanese plan the attack on Pearl Harbor almost shocking. They stand around a pond with some guy standing in the middle of it pointing at little models of warships with a wooden stick. "This is how we're gonna attack". This brings up the question: Do the Americans think that they are the only country in the world with military installations? And of course, the Japanese admiral in charge of the attack fleet that is actually portrayed as a somewhat sympathethic, is only in there for the purpose of delivering this line "I fear we have woken a sleeping giant". An American audience will of course appreciate this a lot more when it's coming from a semi-nice guy. Everybody knows the US armed forces are the most powerful in the world. So where does all this insecurity that calls for the rubbing of the military ego at every turn come from?And whereas the Pearl Harbor attack shows a lot of suffering on the American's behalf, the attack towards the end of the film on Tokyo where apparently the Japanese casualties were ten times higher than the American's at Pearl Harbor, doesn't show ANY Japanese people being blown to bits. What's going on here? Is it so hard to accept that America has inflicted a lot of pain on the people of the world? Do they have to HIDE the fact that they are killing people as well just to make themselves look even more heroic?I will of course admit that the effects are spectacular, but the attack itself is fabulously unexciting because of your state of mind at that point in the film. If the attack was put into the film one and a half hour earlier, it would be spectacular entertainment (the aerial combat over Britain is pretty good just because it's so early in the film the story hasn't gotten to you yet), but you're just not ready for it when you've been bored out of your mind for two hours. Also the last fourty-five minutes (raid over Japan) are pretty interesting, but it's just too late.This film could've been good if only it focused on what the title suggests it's about instead of the most pathetic excuse for a love story you're ever likely to see. Not even the music is decent.However, I'll give it 3 out of 10 simply because it has very good effects and some pretty nice scenic (albeit very cliched) photography at times.As a last comment, I remember how the audience in the movie theatre reacted with standing ovations when the White House was blown to pieces in ID4. Hollywood is actually making the rest of the world loathe the American mentality. They should start rethinking their strategy before it's too late</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great movie, yet with merit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll get to the point.Things that were good about this movie include the marvelous battle scenes (though the whole "jiggly camera" thing is getting a bit overdone), the cinematography, the acting (pretty good overall), especially considering that the leads were cast more for their appearance than anything. Don't get me wrong - they don't stink...they just aren't at the top of the list in terms of bards of the stage.The single worst thing about this film was the script (not even the most marvelous acting can overcome silly, corny dialogue). At one point Jimmy Doolitle (Alec Baldwin) was commenting on the American spirit, and I was expecting Grandma to walk up to him with an apple pie, and for the local high school band to march across the air craft carrier deck playing "Stars and Stripes Forever", batons flying.Yes, the storyline was convoluted and unlikely. And yes, it included some significant historical inaccuracies - though not quite as many as lots of war movies. Still, the mere fact that it's generating an increased interest in WWII - and the incalcuable sacrifices made by so many during the war - gives it some inherent value. How else will Mall Rats ever even conceive how grateful they should be to live in this country? Granted, this movie alone won't do it. Yet it perhaps may help.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twaddle...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately "Pearl Harbor" has to be the most cringe-inducing load of "God bless America" twaddle to come out since "Independence Day". I must admit that I wasn't expecting a war movie of the impact or sincerity of "Saving Private Ryan" but "Pearl Harbor" far exceeded my expectations of mediocrity. The script was acheingly bad, the acting wooden (mind you they didn't have a huge amount to work with) and the underlying Stars and Stripes flag waving was quite frankly sickening. Sure, the action sequences were impressive but produced more of a feeling of watching a computer game.It really is a shame because as a historical event, Pearl Harbor has the scope to produce a riveting movie. "Tora Tora Tora!" remains the best adaptation of this infamous day in the Second World War, whereas "Pearl Harbor" comes across as an overly long, and quite frankly embarassingly patriotic pile of rubbish. I am sure many people will jump up and down and say that this wasn't meant to be a jarringly realistic portrayal but at the same time all the filmatic elements of "Pearl Harbor" are just plain bad. In my opinion though it just doesn't do justice to the men and women who were a part of that horrific day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, apart from green painted Mitsubishi Zeroes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish war movies like this had been around when I had been a kid. They'd have shown me that war is a terrible terrible thing and not some corking big adventure as these sick comics of the 1970s seemed to make out. This film is better than Tora!Tora!Tora! and From Here To Eternity (and the beach scenes in Pearl Harbor bring the latter film to mind). It has a good story and it portrays war for the horror it is. If we are going to make films about war they should be anti-war films. Tora!Tora!Tora! did not concentrate enough on the terrible loss of life at Pearl Harbor and the attack in that film is just a lot of exploding ships. This film shows that people died terrible deaths or were horribly injured. There is one scene where two guys are painting the side of a ship. A torpedo slams into the side of the ship and they are just obliterated in the explosion. That and other scenes hit home very hard. The scenes showing the Curtiss P-40s being destroyed on the tarmac are horrific as is the scene during the Battle of Britain section of the story where the nose is completely shot off a Heinkel 111. The battle scenes aim at horror and don't glorify destruction unlike the war films of the 60s and 70s. They had genuine Mitsubishi A6M Zeros in this film and didn't use the replicas converted from North American Harvards which were used in Tora!Tora!Tora! (although the Aichi D3A2 Vals and the Nakajima B5N2 Kates were the same Harvard and Vultee BT-13 based replicas which were used in Tora) but why did they have to paint them green? Zeroes were not painted green until later in the war. The ones that took part in the attack were painted light gray and they were that colour in Tora!Tora!Tora! The biplane seen at the start of the film is a Boeing Stearman. This part of the film is set in 1923 and the Boeing Stearman did not appear until the late 1930s although I appreciate that hiring a plane that would have been more appropriate for that period like a Curtiss Jenny would only have added to the cost of an already expensive film. Alec Baldwin does well as Jimmy Doolittle and it's hard to credit that the actor playing Admiral Yamamoto is the same actor as played the eskimo in The Island at the Top of the World. Kate Beckinsale does very well and should get the Bob Hoskins award (joke) for most convincing American accent by a British actor or actress. Jon Voight gives the best and most convincing portrayal of FDR that I have seen. An excellent film which deserves to do better than it has so far. It deserves to do as well as Titanic, to which it has been compared. Let's face it, there are similarities. A love story set against a 20th century event and a leading lady called Kate!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's Not Just Accept it Because We Have to</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen so many comments about how younger viewers don't understand how people in that time period felt about going to war or that the characters were to "Hollywoodized". The same can be said of Titanic, but that was a highly acclaimed film.What truly made this movie bad was the fact that it was muddled. In all truth you could have made two (or possibly three) movies out of this one movie. Now I'm not saying that the length of 3 hours was the problem, but that what we saw could have been six or seven hours of film easily. Cutting out some of the froth around this film could have given the directors a chance to flesh out the events more so than they did. I think even WW2 Vets will admit that although the film provided a decent portrait of what happened there, it still did not capture the heart of whole event.Titanic had a great eye for detail, and it really tugged at the heart strings, but in Pearl Harbor I did not feel for the plight of these brave and unsuspecting soldiers, not because I did not understand what they went through, but because no one who developed the film took the time to get you to care.If you really want to see a film that captures the heart of WW2 go rent Saving Private Ryan. But if you are willing to compromise for a sketchy anecdotal depiction about a horrific event in America's history then Pearl Harbor is your best bet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well, i guess that's forever one of the favourite movie themes. it's nice, (think of WATERLOO BRIDGE) but too much of 'fitting' was there in PEARL HARBOR. you can just put the whole thing into another battlefield, (not even necessarily with bombing and carriers and fighter planes) and it might still work out. i've the feeling that i was watching a story 'stuffed' into the picture of the famous event. i'd have hoped that this movie would be more unique.as for the actors/actress, i gave applause. it's not their fault to be born beautiful after all, and whether attractiveness means they do not act well depends solely on our own points of view. if people would only see the faces, they will only see the faces, no matter how great the actors can be.and the effect, i would say it's splendid, but really too splendid. it's left people awestruck, wondering how on earth it was done and not remembering the movie itself. it's sort of feeling that effect has become a show-off point for movies rather than to support the theme. well that's my opinion, and people think differently. like it or not, there'll only be more and more computer work (think of FINAL FANTASY...i'm going to watch it, anyway) and well, we shall all learn to get used to it.i'll give PEARL HARBOR a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is all the criticism of this film about? It plays out perfectly. You can't be too harsh on this film since it was written by Randall Wallace who wrote 'Braveheart' and we all know how much people love that film. The performances by Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale are solid and heartfelt. Jon Voight was amazing as FDR and I truly believe he could get an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. 'Pearl Harbor' plays out perfectly. The first part is the romance angle, the second part is the attack and its aftermath and the third part is the U.S. retaliation against Japan. I think the reason a lot of people didn't like this film is because of the jealousy towards the superiority of the American military and fighting spirit which is the best in the world. At least it is in the opinion of this Canadian. The U.S. came back from terrible odds to, for the most part, win World War II. My only complaint is the editing which I thought was poorly timed. But it's Michael Bay who is technically inclined but academically mediocre. James Cameron or Steven Spielberg would have been better choices to direct this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't add much more to kitkat's excellent review except to also point out the good job the filmaker's did in presenting some of what the nurses in Hawaii did on December 7th. They were young women in a sleepy locale that, in the face of utter horror and their own mortal peril, rose to give the aid and comfort they had pledged themselves to. I think the movie gives them their due and I have seen few WW2 movies OR documentaries that have even tried. I'd also like to take a bit of an issue with the criticism of the filmakers' calculated efforts to provide a return on their investment. I am far from a defender of either Disney or capitalism in general (more of a wary partaker of the products and an enthusiastic critic of both ), but if you are going to make an epic you should spend the big bucks. If you spend the big bucks you've got to try and make them back or those with the bucks won't let you near them again. Simple as that. Pearl Harbor is an epic day in the history of the world's greatest nation, without question. It deserves a block buster as much as anything does and hype is part and parcel, a neccessary evil, if you will. You always have the choice to waste your $9 on Tom Green!</fullReview>

I was really not in the mood to watch some big, Titanic-esque tear-jerker that would leave me depressed for the whole week. As it turned out, I laughed through the whole movie. This does not mean I'm a heartless creep that laughs at people's pain; it was just that all the potentially sob-worthy moments were scripted in such a way that you couldn't help grinning. The whole script is corny, contrite and contains clichés from every other movie! All the seemingly "emotional" moments just make you groan unappreciatively. I think the movie would have been better if they'd placed the main concentration on the actual attack, as the whole first half struck me as unnecessary padding. (And in a three-hour plus movie, the only thing that needs padding is your seat).However, the attack sequence is incredible, and pretty much covers the price of admission.My chief gripes with this movie were: REALLY bad dialogue, predictability (it's pretty easy to tell whose going to get bumped off) and an overwhelming sense of corniness. I'd say 7/10 for effects and 1/10 for the rest of it. (Hey, the ability to turn tragedy into comedy is not always a gift).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A cast of easy on the eye young starlets, a seemingly bottomless pit of cash, permission to use the real site and a viewer friendly release date, what could possibly go wrong with Jerry Bruckheimer's summer blockbuster?That was certainly what the money men at Disney must have been thinking when they ploughed $135 million into Pearl Harbour. Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett star as Rafe and Danny; boyhood friends caught up in the Japanese bombing of the American port and caught in a love tryst with British nurse Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale).Doesn't sound enough to fill three hours does it?And the truth is that's where the problem lies. The first half is taken up by stereotypical characters muttering ridiculous clichés and tub-thumping American patriotism. At times it seems so bad you expect John Motson to pop up telling us not to worry because ?Hollywood pictures are movies of two halves'.And if he did then he wouldn't be too far from the truth because after the clichés are done and dusted and the dreary Faith Hill led soundtrack has had its moment, we have a fully-fledged hour long plus re-enactment of the bombing.The CGI effects just about manage to hold together the film. The aircraft are indistinguishable from the real thing and the scenes with the planes skimming over the baseball field and through the valley are spine tinglers with the ?bomb's eye view' shot through the USS Arizona a visual treat also.As for the rest though? the acting is poor although the wafer thin script doesn't help. Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character has no discernible reason for being in the film other than the fact that it makes it slightly longer. The scene with two American pilots (guess who) taking on the entire Japanese attack force above Pearl Harbour is ridiculous and the final 45 minutes simply an unnecessary extra to give us a seemingly worthy ending.And if that's not enough why on earth is Ben Affleck's character called ?Rafe'? Does no-one in a Hollywood film have a normal name?If you managed to haul yourself through Titanic, then this will probably be right up your alley, but the depressing soundtrack, weak script and flag waving ?we love America' attitude really does push the boundaries of taste.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must let you know, as someone who appreciates history and research, that there is more to the substance of the plots in the film than most would like to admit. Not wanting to reveal anything in this critique, let it suffice to say that most history books aren't as accurate and truthful as we would like to believe. Many parties on both sides of the conflict would certainly take issue with the innuendo in the film, not for it's fallacy, but for it's basis in fact. Relational situations, such as those put forward in the film did occur, as many of our fathers and grandfathers can confirm. And to comment on the casting, consider all of the photos you have seen of WWII veterans....handsome boys, weren't they? So don't think it so unrealistic that the cast is composed of chiseled visages with frames to match - soldiers don't need uniforms to be attractive. As for the nurses in the film, when you're lonely or scared, any woman looks like a pin-up girl, even if she is a bit short or plumb or lacking in the intelligence department!So enjoy the film for what it is, an endearing rendition of a tragic event, as seen through the eyes of men and women who did exist (though perhaps with a bit more gore, and a bit less glamour), who did live and love and lose - for love of duty and country. Remember, one main purpose for producing a film (besides making money), is to tell a story so we, the audience can see a bit of ourselves, and relate to the events described. On that score, Pearl Harbor succeeds. I highly recommend this movie for a wide range of audiences, and applaud the screenwriter and director for their discretion with certain scenes which could have been ruined had they been depicted in the more-typical (modern) "Hollywood style".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I went to see a war film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler alert.I went to see a war film about bombing the Pearl Harbor like I went to see Saving Private Ryan for Normandy invasion but I got a too long, too boring love story. Piece of crap. Two long hours we wait as those two pilot-guys love the same girl. What does that do in a war movie? At least the battle is well made and I could watch that part again. Zeros flying ten meters above ground and blasting with machine guns and bombs. I think that the Doolittle raid was put there so the ending would not be too sad for the American audience. My advice: Wait until this thing comes out on DVD and jump the first two hours. You miss nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>False Judgement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen Pearl Harbor twice. Both times I thought it was the best movie. I got home and decided to read up on it. I think almost every article I found said it wasn't really historical or that it was an overall bad movie. But it can't be that bad. I'm only fourteen and now I want to find any information I can on it. I never even liked history before and I knew absolutely nothing on Pearl Harbor and hardly anything on World War II. So how can the movie be so bad when it got me interested in what happened. Now I go out and spend about 40 dollars to buy a huge book on Pearl Harbor that I finish in about a week or two. The movie got to me and I don't see how it can be considered a bad movie. It seemed so real. I felt like the characters were actually going through it and that I was kind of there too. I think its the best movie I've ever seen. It had the romance that would happen, the action, the drama, and suspense. So why is it so bad?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER-RATING: Nothing really... just something about the structure of the film.To me Pearl Harbor was a big disappointment. I still wonder how Michael Bay was able to make a 1,5 hour script 3 hours long. In the beginning of the movie there's about an hour of building a relationship with the main characters, and that's basically good (still, an hour?) but the characters still remain so hollow. If you're making a big action flick, why mess the movie with pointless love drama? And Pearl Harbor wasn't even a warmovie, so there was no need for romance. So those looking for hard action shouldn't bother seeing Pearl Harbor. And those looking for romance... you ain't gonna find it in this movie, sorry. I'd give it 2/5... but that's just me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, but really.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like alot of other comments I've read here, I was skeptical when my wife and I went to see this film. I had heard alot of negative reviews and of course friends who had friends who had seen it and not liked it. After reading some comments in here I decided to see it for myself. Being an avid movie goer I knew I could give this film a fair evaluation. It was a truly GOOD movie. Ben Affleck, who has the nicest teeth in film, was very good, as was Kate Beckinsdale, Josh Hartnett, something for the the preteen girls to ooh and aah about. The supporting cast was quite effective also. There was no great character development here, just some interlaced scenes to try and help us feel something for the main characters. All in all, it worked. Lets face it, this is summer entertainment, not a David Lean epic. There were plenty of incredible special effects, and the bombing sequences were amazing (definite Oscar work). Micheal Bay, probably the slickest film-maker out there, has made a very patriotic, let's beat the Japs asses, lets all fight the good fight, let's get one for the gipper, movie. But pleeeaaassssee, let's be rational here. Why does Hollywood insist on trying to make us believe that WW2 didn't actually start until the Americans joined and that they were the only ones that made a difference. I always thought WW2 started with the invasion of Poland and then Belgium, 3 years earlier. When Ben Affleck's British commander said that if all Americans were like him (Ben) god help whoever picks a fight with them. I almost vomitted when I heard that line. Sure there were Americans flying alongside the British during the Blitz, but this seemed to me just another way to show the Americans, even though they were not officially part of it, single handedly driving the Huns back. I enjoyed this film alot. I will buy it on DVD when it comes out, I will not, however, buy into the America is our saviour crap. P.S. How can you watch a sunrise on a beach faceing west? Anyone remember The Green Berets?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rubbish. I can't tell you how sick I am of movies trying to glorify America's part in a conflict or a war. For forty minutes (it felt like more) we see the bombs fall over Pearl Harbor -- sometimes even in slow motion -- and how much time is spent on the bomb that ended the war? The bomb that probably killed and injured more people than any *bombing* in history. Well, I actually can't tell you -- as any other human being, I have to blink every now and then.Please, script writers and moviemakers in the USA, do not try to glorify you own country if another country gets discredited in the process. In American movies, the bad guys are always from Russia, Germany or Japan. I have seen quite a lot of movies from these countries, especially Japan, and they plots are always deep and stimulating. The Hollywood recipe for a good movie includes action and nudity, and a story that a five-year-old would understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The end of the age of innocence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read a lot of reviews before I see a movie and many times that helps me to decide if I even want to see a movie. If I made my decision based on the critics I would not have seen this movie. What a loss that would have been! This was a simply great movie. Without the first 90 minutes (which so many pan) the movie would have been an expensive documentary. Pearl Harbor is about American life before an awful war. The love story at the beginning (which totally captivated me) strongly picks up the 'age of innocence' that was America to a great degree. The attack ended that age. And, even when the war was over there was another attempt to recapture that innocence. But, it was to late, it was gone forever. We did indeed lose a lot.This is a movie that you can sit back an immerse yourself in. You can truly become part of the movie and the time in which it was set. What more can you ask of a movie? Pearl Harbor gives you an opportunity to better understand what life was like in 1941. Even with war around the world you get the feeling that many just don't believe that America will have to fight. That is history brought to life.Certainly Pearl Harbor is not true 100% history. No movie is that. Movies take history and move events around and words around and add other elements to create dramatic interest while telling the story. Pearl Harbor does a great job of this. You certainly live the attack. I rated this movie a 9/10. I will see this one again and this is on my list to own the DVD when it is released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say. The trailer for this movie looks so good. The first time I saw it I said,"This is gonna be great." Then I started to think that sometimes the trailer is better than the movie. Well, that is the case here. I enjoyed the movie when the Pearl Harbor attack happend but I did not enjoy the love story that involved the main characters. Micheal Bay is an excellent director when it comes to action. He is not however a director of human nature or romance. I hate to compare him to James Cameron but James Cameron works on so many different levels of filmaking. He is able to ad artistic quality to his films as well as making a pure action film. Micheal Bay is just a good action director. I don't mean he's bad. I just mean he is good with action and should just stick with it. Don't do love stories. Anyway, See Pearl Harbor for it's action and as a homage to our men who were there. I myself will keep watching the trailer over and over again because to me....it is just so much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS!Yes Pearl Harbor is much too long, yes it is full of cliches, yes the dialogues are ridiculous, yes it is historically appalling. All that is true. But really, the attack scene alone merits the admission ticket; it is movie history. And honestly, the actors make the best of the lame material they get. What killed this movie for me though was the unnecessarily tacked on Doolittle-raid on Tokyo. And especially the epilogue, where this hare-brained raid was suddenly promoted to the single event that turned the war around. Hmmm... funny there is nothing about anything so pivotal in our history books! We always learned it was Hiroshima and Nagasaki that brought the Japanese to their knees. Obviously the makers did not dare to make the American audience go home with the idea that their glorious army had just had their asses kicked. So the Doolittle-raid was glued on to give the movie a patriotic ending. What a shame that Europe did not get a version without that useless and obsolete, even ridiculous chapter. Not only because Europeans don't really go for American flag-waving (The Patriot did nothing here, for instance). But mainly because it would have shortened the movie by a little, and strengthened it by a LOT! Sorry: just 6/10 from me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What was it that Hitchcock said were the three things required for a good film? "A good script, a good script and a good script." Well Pearl Harbor has none of these. And it lets the actors down, hence, I've seen better from WWF wrestlers, who probably have futures in films like this.The constant tirade of patriotism is sickening. I lost count of the number of times that the American flag was shown. The love story was predictable, unengaging and unemotional. Everything is S-P-E-L-T out clearly for the audience. Now I know that making the everyday cinema going audience think for themselves a bit would probably equal a sharp decline in profits, but it would be nice just for once. And on top of that there were far too many square jawed, "pretty boy" soldiers for my liking.Mainstream Hollywood film seems to reach new lows in this three hour tragedy of a film. Watch it, but promise me you'll watch something better when you get home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was parked in Battleship Row and bombed !I feel for all the historians out there who had to put up with this 3 hour distortion of history ! If you're going to make a history film, then don't change history, tell the real story. If you're going to make a love story, don't call it Pearl Harbor.Perhaps, as some have stated, this was another attempt at Titanic. But the content was as shallow as the Harbor itself. At least James Cameron's production delivers the factual accounts with accuracy.I am a realist. Historical events should not be changed. History is a mentor and if you start telling the story in a different light, history is lost.Alec Baldwin is a decent actor and I enjoy his movies, but I must say my girlfriend and I broke out in laughter as he gave his "...we're gonna win this dawgone war" speech, before the Doolittle air attack. If you're going to steal monumental war speeches, from older movies, at least have the courtesy to show the film in black and white !The only thing that kept me in my seat was the attack itself. The visual effects were entertaining. But, I have a question.....did the real Zeros, that attacked Pearl, swarm like flies ?Needless to say, I was let down. To restore my faith, I went out and purchased Tora! Tora! Tora!, on DVD, to ease the pain. A 31 year old movie, but a more enjoyable 3 hours.If you must, wait for the rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking foward to this film but left feeling disapointed. I have been to pearl harbor and been to the Arizona memorial. I just fail to see how this awful American propaganda can really do justice to the thousands of people trapped in the rusting ship. When I went to the Arizona I could see oil still coming up from the ship in little dribs and drabs. It was totally creepy to see it. I thought that they would try to honor those sailors, but I think that the movie is an insult to the men who died there. It was like watching Dawsons creek. "All the boys are pilots, and all the girls are nurses" Arron Spelling would be proud. And even the inclusion of "Trainspottings" Spud, could not even bring any sort of realism to the movie. Im sorry, but all I can do is give it a big thumbs down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Believe The Anti-Hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading all the excoriating reviews, I did not have high hopes for "Pearl Harbor", Michael Bay's epic-romantic restaging of the battle that brought America into World War II. I was expecting corn, bathos, high-gloss trash. And I got all of that, except for the trash part. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised by how much this picture held my interest and engaged my emotions. Rafe and Danny (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) are two young hotshot flyboys for the U.S. Marines. At the dawn of the war, they are living the would-be hero's life; while the Brits slug it out with the Nazis, the American army sits happily idle. Rafe is sent overseas to join an elite American-British unit, and while he's facing peril in the air, Danny is becoming maybe too close to Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), Rafe's WAC lover. The two friends are on a collision course...but just as things are coming to a head, Japanese zeroes buzz into the Hawaiian sky and begin raining death down on Pearl Harbor. All differences must be put aside, personal slights forgotten. It's all about America now, and a huge mission is mounted to show Japan that the U.S. is not about to go gently into that good night."Pearl Harbor" is three hours long, and does drag at certain key junctures, but the thing that surprised me was how completely engaging the first hour of the picture was. I was expecting to spend the entire romantic prelude to the battle twiddling my thumbs, waiting for the bombs to drop. Instead, I found myself really caring for these young people and anxious to see how things would turn out for them. I give full credit for this to Affleck, Beckinsale, and Hartnett, who deliver honest, straightforward, unpretentious performances, the kind of serve-the-story acting that makes a film like this work. Once the attack on the harbor begins, however, this becomes Michael Bay's picture, and he gives us some of the most impressive battle sequences I've seen in a while. Naturally, an air battle is a different beast than the frenzied ground combat of "Saving Private Ryan", just as Bay is a different animal than Spielberg. "Pearl Harbor"'s war scenes are polished, much prettier than "Ryan". Still, the violence hits you like a punch in the gut; even with the PG-13 rating, Bay does not seem to be holding back. The special effects are some of the best I've seen, surpassing "Titanic" in their realism and scope. The sound is appropriately devastating, and John Schwartzman outdoes himself with his grand, sweeping cinematography (marred only by the ugly soft-focus images he uses in the hospital-aftermath sequences).The film does begin to drag somewhat in its final hour, as a stentorian commander (Alec Baldwin) prepares to lead his men on a retaliatory strike on Japan. I knew the film had some problems when I figured out how it was going to end, learned I was wrong...and thought my ending was better, more dramatically satisfying. Still, the film does send you out on a proud-to-be-an-American note, and for a Memorial Day weekend release, I assume that's what they were going for."Pearl Harbor" is by no means a classic. Indeed, it seems that everything I really liked about the film was countered by something that stuck in my craw. Jon Voight does wonderful work as FDR...that is almost sabotaged by silly-putty makeup. The inclusion of the character of Dorrie Miller (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a black ship's cook who finally got a chance to fight for his country during the attack, was a nice one...but marred by Wallace's blatantly foreshadowing dialogue. It's a tricky film in that regard. You want to love it unconditionally, but the discerning viewer in you keeps holding you back.Still, unlike many critics, I feel that the good here largely outweighs the bad. "Pearl Harbor" may not be a spot-on retelling of history, but it gives enough of the facts that I believe many kids will be encouraged to seek out books and films that can give them the REAL story. I think that Michael Bay would be quite proud of that. I think it's something to be proud of, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies are so bad they're funny. Pearl Harbor isn't one of them: it's so bad it's... interesting. I spent most of this very long film thinking about the various ways in which it was awful. Michael Bay seems to be the Jade Fox of directors - he obviously owns a copy of How To Make A Classic Movie but he's only looked at the pictures, not the text. Films like Armageddon are forgivable because they're just bubblegum, but Pearl Harbor really, really wants to be a sweeping wartime romance (or epic romantic war story, or whatever) in the classic mode and it really, really, *really* isn't. A few things that stand out as particularly dreadful: the hamfisted History 101 newsreels, the RAF guy's awe at just how heroic Ben Affleck is, the perfunctory and staggeringly patronising treatment of Cuba Gooding's character, the whole fourth act (a cruel blow to those of us who had assumed there were only three). Actually the Japanese assault is very well done - the special effects are superb and the whole thing degenerates into an obscene massacre, as presumably it did in real life, but then Bay ruins everything with the tearful music and the slo-mo and the blurry bits and the obligatory dead likeable supporting character and the whole blasted fourth act which is there only because (a) you can't have a movie end with the US on its knees and (b) you can only resolve a Hollywood love triangle by killing one of the protagonists and none of them is dead yet. Did I mention the nauseating patriotism? Maybe if you're American it's okay, but Kate Beckinsale's voiceover at the end is truly horrible.</fullReview>

More of this sort of magic would have been much appreciated. This seems to show the human element involved on that "Day of Infamy" artistically and poignantly, whereas the thin layer of the Titanic Love Story Redeux (only this time, the two men are friends!!) stands apart as a shallow and transparent farce in contrast. And our two mavericks, Ben and Josh, hooping and hollering while the survivors below cheer them on do little to inspire any reverence for the real battle of that day, the battle of sheer survival. I was hoping we'd see the frantic rescue of a few of the crewmen in the USS Arizona's tower, but apparently there was not that kind of time to spare in this three hour, sprawling decadance. And why not spend a little more time on the Arizona's sinking. These men who still breathed for several hours before their ship became their tomb are never even really seen. As for the workings of the love triangle,Ben Affleck's character, if he survived in occupied France thanks to the kindness of strangers, could have relied on them to post a coded letter or two, methinks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is a film that I wouldn't even subject to my worst enemy as a form of revenge(I have never been a proponent of cruel and unusual punishment). Hmm, where do I begin............ah yes: The dialogue was laughably trite, the cast overacted with the zeal usually expected only from an impersonator of William Shatner, the love plot was truly pointless (another sickening attempt by Jerry Bruckheimer to trick less informed moviegoers into thinking that it is not only an action film, but a good romance as well), and the plot was filled with inexcusable historical inaccuracies (it is beyond my comprehension as to how the part where FDR walks could survive on the cutting room floor, seeing as to the fact that he had been crippled by polio for the previous 25 years). It is a truly sad thing when film is cheapened as an art form. It is a travesty when filmmakers knowingly release garbage targeted towards the less educated portion of population, allowing normally insufficient acting to be overshadowed by BIG EXPLOSIONS. SO WHAT. I must admit, the attack scenes of the film were truly impressive from an visceral and technical standpoint. SUCH A SHAME THAT I HAD TO BE SUBJECTED TO SUCH TRIPE FOR THE PREVIOUS HOUR, AS WELL AS THE HOUR AFTERWARDS. Also, is it just me, or is it hard to believe that 90 percent of soldiers and almost all nurses are truly attractive people (If only that were how it is in real life, but it isn't). Another blunder is the complete and utter dearth of hawaiian natives in Pearl Harbor. In fact, I don't remember seeing one. However, it seems foolish to draw attention to such miniscule details when nearly every other part of this film is greatly flawed.In summation, good films are hard to find and therefore, attention should be payed to them, instead of to films like this one. Memento is a far superior film, in a perfect world people would choose to see that instead of this. Unfortunately, this film is destined to manipulate millions of mindless viewers, and I am sure that I will get angry responses by a few of them for this review. But if the truth illustrated in this review reaches even one filmgoer, then I feel that I have not written in vain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every summer, we expect one of the awaited blockbusters to be a turkey. Be it The Avengers of M:I-2, it helps maintain the balance. However, with Pearl Harbor something has gone seriously wrong.The opening sequences are a reasonably engaging mix of humour and romance, but it soon becomes clear that director Bay is quite content with the sheer shallowness of his leading characters to build his action framework over them. Big mistake. The total lack of sympathy that Affleck, Beckinsale and Hartnett evoke means that you really don't care if any of them get blown to bits.These are all reasonably standard summer blockbuster mistakes. In the characterisation department it always appears that the scriptwriter has been out making the tea. But what really grates is its sheer, irritating patriotism. The Americans are seen as a saintly race who it seems were attacked totally out of the blue by the Japanese, who according to the film are just plain evil. Every time we see them, the sinister movie pipes up and we see them rubbing their hands together with glee as they plot the attack. It is truly insulting. The rest of the film is unceasing flag-waving and propaganda, with the basic message that the war was won solely because of the Americans. And that whole, trivial Nuclear Holocaust thingy is not-so subtly deleted from the narrative, in order to ensure that the Americans come out looking like the good guys and the sole saviours of the free world. It is quite frankly laughable.The effects are the thing, of course, and for a moment you actually believe that you haven't wasted your ticket fare. But even that becomes very samey after a while and you realise that you have been sat there for one and a half hours, your left buttock is about to drop off, and you're still only halfway through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought this movie was pretty good unlike other comments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My family consisting of mature adults and a young adult enjoyed the story. I get the impression that some of the negative comments about this story are written by young people with zero understanding of life in the 40's to 60's. Young men really did believe it was the right thing to do - even thought they didn't really want to- to go and defend freedom for all.Although the the Love story appeared to be a takeoff on Titanic it is a common format and gave us a look at the lives of people entering the war at that time. I believe the characters were accurate of the "flyboy" type person. The story of Pearl Harbor was the backdrop. But the action of the war scenes did overpower the love story somewhat.The Col. Jimmy Doolittle raid was not an "avenging act" but was to show the Japanese that we would not sit still for that kind behavior. Not said in the movie the the lack of cultural understanding by either side. The Japanese thought we would be intimidated, demoralized and not fight back. This raid showed a different view. That's what Roosevelt wanted. This was a morale booster to get the Americans to do a hard thing - fight a war (see "Saving Private Ryan" to see how hard.)A similar movie (not about Pearl Harbor)that I saw on rerun was "Racing with the Moon" (1984) with Sean Penn. Also about two boys &amp; love and about ready to to go to war. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic opportunity missed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: minor spoilers ahead...Oh dear. What could have been a momentous slice of celluloid given the budgetary considerations has emerged as an entire travesty that is offensive not only to those people who paid to take their seats in a cinema but those who fought and died in this climactic conflict.To be fair, this film is never a historical account of the attack on Pearl Harbour, in the same way that James Cameron's Titanic was never a blow by blow account of the sinking of the big ship. They are both films dedicated to love triangles set against an epic backdrop. However, on viewing both, it seems that Michael Bay took the most insulting cringeworthy elements of Cameron's blockbuster and ignored some of the genuine moments of invention.When patrons begin to filter out of the cinema BEFORE the big bangs start going off, you know something is terribly wrong. When patrons are laughing at moments when the sacrifice of sailors and pilots should be appreciated, you know something is terribly wrong. In fact, from the mawkish and awkward prologue, you can feel yourself shrinking into your seat.The first bone of contention is the clutch of truly dreadful performances. Josh Hartnett is trying so hard to be goofy and endearing but never gets out of first gear, Ben Affleck is almost strangled by his thicker than syrup Southern good ol' boy accent and Kate Beckinsale (trying to replicate Kate Winslet) is all lips pouts and no depth. She is the pivotal axis in the love triangle dynamic and comes across as a rather cheap and easy minx rather than a passionate woman torn between two ridiculously macho lovers. Tom Sizemore looks frankly embarrassed as the stereotypical chief engineer, Alec Baldwin chews scenery for all he's worth as the stereotypical commander and Cuba Gooding Jr. is cast adrift as a stereotypical put-upon black sailor. In fact, Jon Voigt is perhaps the film's saving grace with a quite exquisite performance as FDR, complete with prosthetic double chin and stately mannerisms. Yet, even he can't hide his awkwardness with some truly atrocious lines fed him by the script.Ah, the script. Randall Wallace has mighty penance to pay if he's to convince most people that Bravehart wasn't a flash in the pan. Admittedly he tries to be a little creative by staging the attack where you might not expect it (if you're already dead, that is) but this leaves a gaping hole with 75 minutes still remaining. Everything is just so cliched: characters stand and spout sickening platitudes, feelings are rendered entirely superficial and there's so much cheesiness you want to choke. Some of which could have been remedied by director Michael Bay. Except he just makes it worse.Still not heeding the lessons of Armageddon, Bay resorts to all the same film school "Ain't that cool, like, wow" techniques that nearly sunk his space project. The over use of slow-motion (which makes an already overlong film even longer) and his hero-shot framing (check out the pilots walking out in slow-mo for their final mission: an exact copy of Armageddon) detract from any emotional resonance the film aspires to have. It's just all gloss.Some of Bay directorial flourishes are just plain insulting. Where Rafe and Danny take to the air against the Mitsubishi Zeros, it's a paean to Top Gun which even takes in the "playing chicken" scenario. Zeros were far more sturdily built than the American P-40's and did not blow up after taking a few shells in the tail piece. Similarly, a Zero would not be blown to pieces by small arms fire from 6 men in an aircraft tower (you know the scene I'm talking about: if not, you're lucky). The depiction of any race other than Americans is plain infuriating. I saw the film with several Japanese people, keen to see the version over here which will differ from the print sent to their country. However, it's difficult to see how the Japanese will not be offended by any version of this tripe. Planning meeting were not conducted outside with plastic battleships in paddling pools. Pilots were not ordered on kamikaze missions at Pearl Harbour which renders the entire Japanese pre-flight sequence historically inaccurate. And the subtitles are far removed from what the characters are actually saying. Poor Mako and Cary-Hiroyuki Togawa, two fine Japanese actors who are abused in this way. The British are unjustly belittled too. Only one British character is present and, as an RAF officer, the script compells him to thank the American volunteer for single-handedly saving the British homeland in the Battle of Britain. (BTW, no one ever referred to that particular conflict as that in 1941, only from 1943.) And of course, the only comic relief has to be found in someone who has a stammerHomages to other films are so palpable it's sickening. The build-up (Titanic), attack (Tora! Tora! Tora!), American response (Top Gun) and end sequence (the godawful BAT-21) are so shamelessly ripped-off you'd think there would be lawsuits flying around for defamation.However, one of Bay's directorial motifs remains. Action scenes are shot with so much camera shake and so ruthlessly edited as to make them unwatchable. Follow the Bad Boys to The Rock to Armageddon to here and you'll know what I mean. This renders the scenes in the hospital quite painful as one can only see the director's artifice instead of bringing home the suffering of the wounded and dying.All in all, I beg you not to see this movie and give Jerry Bruckheimer any more money to keep making drivel like this. I despise this film not merely for its faults but for its pan-Americanism which leaves such a bitter taste in the mouth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>poor fact, worse fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is almost impossible to mix historic fact and actual personalities from the past with fictional characters and plot. The last one to do this really well was Leo Tolstoy, although Herman Wolk did a pretty good job in "The Winds of War." If you want to see a love story set against the background of military life at Pearl Harbor just before December, 1941, then you can't top "From Here to Eternity." If you want to know how and why the attack took place, see "Tora! Tora! Tora!" If you want to know the true story of Doolittle's raid (even if Spencer Tracy looked no more like Jimmy Doolittle than Alec Baldwin does), see "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo." If you want to see great World War II air combat (with no computerized effects) see "The Battle of Britain." If you want special effects and computerized air combat, see "Star Wars." -- JONCHA</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor was the best movie I have ever seen. When I was little my dad used to lecture me on everything in history. Pearl Harbor came up quite a bit. By the time I was 7 I knew almost everything about it. Kinda funny, but I think that's why the movie was so good. Then there's the fact that the movie itself was the best movie. I can't understand why the review board said it was so bad. It was a great movie. It was very well made and the the actors did a great job playing their part, plus some of them were pretty cute(Josh Hartnett). I have already seen Pearl Harbor 3 times that's 9 hours and 9 minutes of Pearl Harbor. I could care less, that was the best movie I have ever seen and I would watch it a bazillion time over and over again. 3 hours isn't long at all, well, not for me at least. If you haven't yet seen Pearl Harbor, you have to see, it is the hit movie of the summer. The best movie ever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, this had a lot of potential to be a good, even a great movie, but it was a huge let down. The movie would have been perfect if it concentrated on the battles and the soldiers, instead of the lame attempt at a love story. The battle scenes were amazing, but the love story seemed like it should have been a whole other movie, it didn't mesh with the movie. I think they tried to create another Titanic, but, as I said before, it was just lame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Script, Great Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The script for Pearl Harbor is bad. Really bad. The characters' dialogue barely comes close to believable, speaking mostly in cliche and soundbites. The plot is full of every war movie plot device you've probably seen before (since this movie is about a subject that has been covered many times before, that's almost excusable). The only characters worth caring about were the lame secondary ones, and the love story is totally worthless. But, as an action movie, "Pearl Harbor" delivers breathtaking sequences that will keep your eyes glued to the screen. The attack on Pearl Harbor itself was quite exciting. Michael Bay's break-neck directing style works better on these scenes than on the rest of the film. Overall, "Pearl Harbor" wasn't a total waste of time (although it could've stood to be an hour shorter). It was no "Tora Tora Tora," but not too bad a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, just an average summer flick with a great advertising push. Pearl Harbor never gets off the ground until the action sequences which are impressive. The attempted love story is poorly written, poorly directed, and filled with cardboard charactors. The only actors in the movie I liked were Gooding Jr, Baldwin, and Tom Sizemore as the sargent, unfortunatly none of them get to spend much time on screen. The main charactors are cliche speaking cut-outs that you almost hope will die during the attack if for no other reason than they are so uninteresting.To really understand the attack from both sides rent Tora, Tora, Tora, if you like special effects check this out. But summer movie dollars can be spent better elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's really depressing just how bad a movie can be and still becommercially successful. And this is one really, really bad movie. Like Mr. Bay's previous insult to the intelligence and taste of themovie-going public, Armageddon, this film chokes on some of themost nausea-inducing dialog ever written for a major motionpicture. A few samples:"You're so beautiful it hurts!""I'm gonna give Danny my whole heart, but I don't think I'll ever lookat another sunset without thinking of you!""I think World War II just started.""Sir, it's risky, but it's bold!""God help anyone who gets into a war with the Americans!""I'm not anxious to die -- just anxious to matter!"barf, barf, barf, barf, barf, barf.This, of course, doesn't even begin to touch on the inane story:suffice it to say that absolutely nothing of any interest to anyonewith an IQ over 70 happens during the 80% of the film that isn't theattack scene. It also leaves out the egregious historical idiocies,perpetrated by Disney in order to avoid offending the Japanese. The violence will appeal to teenage boys, and the love story, suchas it is, to teenage girls. They won't learn much about PearlHarbor, and what little they do learn will be mostly wrong, but thereare probably more harmful pastimes. I'd seriously question theintellectual capacities and aesthetic tastes of anyone over the ageof 17 who enjoys this swill, however.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing original here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I went to see "Pearl Harbor", a friend of mine told me to be prepared to be disappointed. She was right. There was nothing new here; nothing original. The story leading up to the absolutely unrelated attack on Pearl Harbor was reminiscent of "From Here to Eternity", which had much better subplotting and character development. The ship-sinking scenes reeked of "Titanic," and the scenes of nurses and corpsman trying to stop patients from bleeding were poor imitations of "Saving Private Ryan." Not to mention the depiction of the Japanese war planners, which made them appear to be the Hollywood stereotypical "mysterious oriental", straight out of "Tora Tora Tora" and other such films. Michael Bay's direction of this fiasco gave the entire movie the look and feel of "Armageddon" all over again -- from the music to the poses to the heroics -- way too melodramatic. The only reason I rated this movie "7" was because of the spectacular attack sequence at Pearl Harbor. Otherwise, it would've garnered about a "5".</fullReview>

It will not bring historical enlightenment, it has no surprises or unexpected plot twists, it's not profound, and it follows the Hollywood formula.

But if you ignore what it COULD be, and look at what it is, you get a decent movie with wide appeal that's certainly worth more than 1 1/2 stars.

Read Roger Ebert's for a laugh, if you want. But don't be too discouraged. Don't expect too much, and you will be pleasantly surprised.

		<shortDescription>Could have done better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was okay. It had its moments, but there is infinite room for improvement. To begin with (spoilers ahead), the title seems to indicate that the attack on Pearl Harbour is the focus of the movie. Then you go to see it, and apparently the movie can't decide if its focus is the attack or the love triangle between the main characters. This would have been a much better movie if it had just one plot instead of three. It spends an hour and a half giving you the love triangle in spades, with the occasional (VERY occasional--often less than two-minute) visits to Japan. Then it spends an hour on the attack, which is the most well-done part of the movie, as it ought to be. Then the last half hour depicts the planning and execution of the Doolittle Raid. But it constantly cuts back to that love triangle, often annoyingly so. It's like the movie is saying, "Okay, let's watch the Japanese plan their attack. Oh, there's our lovebirds! This is more interesting. Let's watch this for a while."There were a lot more possibilities. They could have had, say, two sailors on the Arizona, and intertwined their personal lives with the possibility of a sneak attack. That would have given the film some continuity at least, and some great drama could have come of the loss of almost 1,200 shipmates on the Arizona. And they could have done a lot more with Cuba Gooding Jr.! He's a marvelous actor, and it's a shame he had such a small part.Oh, and don't even get me started on the modern warships that inundate this film. Spruance-class destroyers and Nimitz-class aircraft carriers in 1941? I Don't Think So. Try not to notice the steam catapults on the flight deck when Doolittle takes off from the Hornet, willya? I'd like to think that in every historical film, there's a different point of view that can explain how accurate or inaccurate it seems. No such point of view exists in this case.But, as I say, the movie does have its moments. The effects are great, and the depiction of the true grit of war is the best since "Saving Private Ryan." As I watched men being blown all over the harbour, I thought, "I really don't need to see this." But then I said to myself, "Self, you're just watching this in a movie theater. How do you think it felt for the guys who were ACTUALLY THERE?" And for perhaps the first time in film history, we see the real heroism of the medical corps, something that I've never seen treated in detail. Finally, the emergency that results in the early takeoff of the Doolittle Raid holds an excitement that just didn't exist in "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo."It's one of those movies that you might want to walk in on when it's about one-third finished, and have somebody tell you what went on during the parts that you missed. I'm sure it'll be nominated for the Harry Awards on the History Channel next year, but I doubt it'll place very high.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: mild spoilers ahead.First (I truly have to let this out of my chest):As a non-american viewer, I felt actually insulted (even if I am not japanese) by some parts of this movie. The patriotism clichés (a torn flag floating in the water, the speeches by an englishman telling the north american that the U.S. could take any country in the world with such men, et cetera) are terrible for a summer blockbuster (at least, ID4 acknowledged the campiness in the President's speech). But the truly terrible part is the depiction of the japanese army. Every soldier or higher ranking man is ugly, short, with terrible hair, etc., while the north american soldiers are perfectly dressed, cute, handsome, etc. Still, since Hollywood made this movie, it is only logical that the North Americans must look their best against an ugly, almost deformed enemy. The real problem I see with this movie is that we are presented with Titanic Redux. Throw in a love story with a nice looking guy and girl, plenty of drama, a love triangle, and you have the teen market cornered. Add lots of bullets, and you will surely get men and boys. Then, historical accuracy, and (maybe) you will get the biggest audience possible. Sadly, this movie bombs almost as hard as the torpedos at Pearl Harbour on that fateful day.First, the love story. It is too long, too boring, too clichéd. It even has its "I am the King of the World" scene (where Danny and the girl go flying). The audience I saw the movie with actually started making noises in protest... and I saw a couple leaving *before* the fighting scenes. They couldn't take it anymore (and neither could I).The love triangle. So predictable, it was boring. It was never gripping enough as to be an integral part of the plot, anyway.The war scenes. Simply incredible. Terrific. Awesome. Not quite "Saving Private Ryan", but close. Very, very close. Not so gory, not so realistic, but perfectly executed. I can hardly think of anything that could be done to make these precious few minutes better. Historical accuracy: dunno. I'd have to check on that. Still, with so few references to actual events, it is not a movie you'd go to learn about the facts that made Japan attack the US (at the beginning of the film, it is explained that the fuel embargo was the reason for the attack. It seems a very flimsy reason to attack, but that's what was said).So, what to do with this sad piece of film? Well, the war scenes are so good, I had to raise my final rating from 4 to 7 stars. Think about it. But there could be something that would save the movie. Get a good film editor, cut the love scenes (cut some 2 hours, actually), leave the fight scenes, and film the entire drama behind Pearl Harbor. The real things that happened before and after December 7. Make the film shorter by some 45 minutes, and you will have a knockout of a movie.As it is, oh well. I guess I'll have to wait and see Atlantis, so I can say I watched a great movie this summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie turned to seriousness of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor into one big joke. The movie wasn't about Pearl Harbor at all, it was a dopey, cliche love story SET IN Pearl Harbor. I was expecting to see a gripping war story and instead saw a three hour melodrama with a very expensive fireworks display thrown in. I did enjoy watching the special effects, but that alone can't make a movie good.I think that the standard for the current generation of WWII movies should definitely be "Saving Private Ryan." That was an excellent movie. The opening sequence was unbelievable, and it set the tone for the entire film. They didn't taint the storyline by throwing in a stupid love plot to sell tickets to 16 year olds, this movie was deadly serious. Then came "Enemy at the Gates." Not bad, unfortunately there was a love sub plot, but it was just that, a sub plot. Then comes Pearl Harbor, where the (factual) battle is the sub-plot, and the true focus is this absolutely dopey (fictitious) love story.SORT-OF SPOILER ahead, but it was shown in the trailer on tv:Like I said, I did like the battle sequence, but even that got silly fast. First off, I expected more from Cuba Gooding Jr's role. His role was basically a cameo, an afterthought. All he did was appear for about five minutes, just enough to gain the audience's approval, and then assume the role of hero as he shoots a plane down from his sinking ship. He was there for the sole purpose of putting him in the trailers to sell more tickets.SPOILERS AHEAD:Secondly, they had to portray Ben Affleck and his best friend as superheroes, the only two pilots who could cause any damage at all to the Japanese. They make it to a nearby airfield, and there's only a few planes that are ready to fly, how 'bout that? It gets better. Then, the first guy (a nameless pilot) gets into a plane, tries to take off, and gets shot to pieces on his takeoff roll. Of course! We can't have some schmoe cramping Ben Affleck's style, right? Next, our heroes mount their steeds, and wow! They made it off the ground to fight the Zeroes! Then the Japanese pilots instantly go brain dead, and Ben and company start picking them off as if they were shooting at hang gliders. And then it gets even better! Ben and his friend each have three zeroes on their tail, and they can't shake them! Oh no! So what do they do? They pull the same whacky hi-jinx that they did at the beginning of the film, and play chicken! Ben and his friend come barreling toward each other, all the while the enemy fighters are courteous enough not to fire a single shot at them, and at the last possible second, our heroes turn away from each other and the zeroes are all destroyed in a massive midair pile-up! At this point, I literally covered my mouth and began to laugh uncontrollably. It was contagious, as my girlfriend saw me and she, too started to laugh. That dogfight scene was so silly, I was beside myself. If that film had even the slightest shred of seriousness in it, at that point it went down in flames along with the six zeroes that crashed into each other. The only thing I could think of was, "C'mon Luke, it'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back at home!" (a "Star Wars" quote for those of you who don't recognize it)OK, YOU CAN LOOK AGAIN, END OF SPOILERS.So to sum up, I'd say rent the film on video or DVD, fast-forward till the battle scene, watch that part, and return it. This movie made a mockery of Pearl Harbor, it used that terrible attack as nothing more than a backdrop for a ridiculous love story and an excuse to spend millions of dollars on special effects. If you want to see the REAL Pearl Harbor movie, it's at most video stores. It's called, "Tora! Tora! Tora!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8 hours long would be better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After half way through this movie, I am pretty sure that they should make it into a TV series, such as an hour a week for 8 weeks. Its narrative style (and the romance) is so old-fashioned TV series like, and the story-line as well as those characters really need sometime to develop. Besides that the perspective and the lines are embarrassingly simple-minded, the history should have been better presented. After a bit hard work, people may then find it deserve a watch on a TV screen.You can still go to watch it since a few scenes really worth a look in the theater. Just don't believe in any one who says that it is good.In short, embarrassingly easy-watching.</fullReview>

So I thought, hey I've come this far only to go home again? Nah, I'll just pick up a movie, anyway, it's half price day. So I looked at the choice, not very promising. Between Duets and Say It Isn't So and The Mummy Returns I finally chose Pearl Harbor. Okay it's long but I wasn't bored. The story is so predictable and that is my main objection about this movie. It's not the best but not the worst either, and I felt it was kinda waste of money to watch this movie but hey you can't turn back time, can you?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor: a paradox</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pearl Harbor" baffles me. Some of the performances were very good, while others were bordering on simply bad. The film itself was beautiful, yet the lines were hard to stomach, to say the least. But this is the most baffling part of all: given all its faults, "Pearl Harbor" is addictive. I've seen it twice and I want to again.Here's a brief synopsis of the great performances: Josh Harnett, Ben Affleck, Tom Sizemore, Kate Beckinsale, and Ewen Bremmer. Josh was not only adorable, but he good enough to not let the lines drag down his performance, with the exception of "I think World War Two just started". Ben Affleck was good because he wasn't made out to be perfect. The scene where he busts his nose twice in one day was a very well played out scene. Tom Sizemore actually has a hand up in this category because I consider him the definitive actor when it comes to war movies, especially WWII. Kate Beckinsale was so beautiful and so poingnant that she it could arguably be said that she's a candidate for the new leading lady of Hollywood. Finally, Ewwn Bremmer. Honestly, I had not seen him before this movie, but he was just so charming. The scene where he's struggling to say "The Japs are here" was so painfully ironic that I gotta give him props.I'm too nice to mention names, but if you're smart you'll realize that those who didn't make the great list weren't so great, and that includes some big names.Basically, if you pay attention to statistics, this movie is not so good. However, if you listen to a big skeptical crtitic like me, ironically you will like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes. That's right. I'll be stunned if someone other than Michael Bay, in the next 9 1/2 years, creates a more grossly unbelievable, cliched, distorted, mutilitated, butchered piece of...well, you get the idea. Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer(sp?) have succeeded at one thing: they have trivialized perhaps the most important pereptia of the century. They have surrendered millions of dollars to create the most racially stereotypical, the most irrevocably inaccurate, the most disgusting biased piece of trash I have yet to spend $8.50 on. What saddens me more than having seen this, this, this sacrilege, is to see that this film(if you can call it that) has garnered a vote higher than 3.0 on IMDB. I just do not understand how movies of this undeniably horrid level of quality can be made anymore in America. We haven't evolved a bit, have we? In times like this, the stupidity of the American public really comes to light. And if you can't resist the hype, if you can't possibly stop yourself from seeing Pearl Harbor, remind yourself repeatedly through the film: this is NOT what film-making is! This is NOT art! This is capitalism. This is commercialism. This is Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor- The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor. The Day that Will Live in Infamy. The movie that would live in infamy, I hoped.So much for that one.Pearl Harbor is really two movies in one- the attack that took place on December 7, 1941, and a love story. Most everyone knows the basic story of the first plot: the Japanese made a surprise attack on a U.S. naval base in Hawaii, thus drawing America into World War II. At least, that's the simplistic version. Sadly enough, most everyone knows the basic story of the second plot as well, as it is a giant, mind-numbing cliché.But beneath the explosions and the tragedy and the boredom, there is something else. Pearl Harbor is not just a cinematic disappointment, but a demonstration of just how little thought can go into plot when all of the effort is directed at special effects.The GoodPearl Harbor was not without its strengths. The most notable, of course, is the action footage during the attack. The visual effects are stunning, and on a technical level, this film deserved the hype it was given. The scenes taking place directly after the attack are poignant and extremely effective. Director Michael Bay and writer Randall Wallace produced some very powerful images here, and these images conveyed the despair and tragedy of the attack.The acting was also very good, although the characters were so lacking in development there wasn't much the actors could do with them. Ben Affleck was forced to fall back on a variation of his character in Armageddon, but it's a character he plays well, so there is little to complain about if you like Ben Affleck. Josh Hartnett fares somewhat better, if only because he has few expectations to live up to (although, based on his performance in this and The Virgin Suicides, I think he is a fine actor.) Kate Beckinsdale does a good job playing an extremely poorly written role, but she's given very little to do besides look gorgeous. The supporting cast holds their own nicely as well, particularly Jon Voight as Roosevelt. Cuba Gooding Jr. is completely wasted in his minor role as Dorie Miller, not because of the size of the role but the awkward way it was worked into the story. But the cast can act. Shame they don't have more to work with.The BadWithout a doubt, the weakest point of Pearl Harbor was the writing. The love story was predictable, cliched, and filled with tacky dialogue. I knew the ending the minute I saw the main characters- not a good sign.Then there is the believability factor. The Rafe-Evelyn romance is given nearly an hour of the movie. Danny and Evelyn have less than five minutes of screen time as a couple (and not talking about Rafe). Five minutes. I am not joking- I timed it. This makes any following aspects of the love triangle much less believable.The side plot of Dorie Miller was frustrating as well. So much potential there? a man denied his dream for three years finally gets what he was asking for, and probably would do anything to return it. Instead, it's reduced to almost a token plot, as if the writer and director felt that this was something that was politically correct to acknowledge. Sadly, Pearl Harbor might have been better off without it- or focusing far more attention on it.Lastly, Pearl Harbor could have easily been shorter. Three hours and three minutes, and I looked at my watch at least three times. There was a lot that could have been edited out, and the movie would have fared better for it.The UglyBelievability, bad writing? these things are annoying, but Pearl Harbor would not have struck such a deep chord with me if these were its only two flaws. Like Titanic, I could have dismissed it easily, without any real sense of lingering disappointment and anger. But there are two crucial errors that fatally damage Pearl Harbor.The first is historical accuracy. Pearl Harbor is touted as a movie about, well, Pearl Harbor. The attack is fairly well documented. And yes, two pilots did get into the air and meet the Japanese that way. And yes, it was only two. An incredible achievement. However, their names were not Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker. This story does more than portray history inaccurately- it takes the achievement and bravery of the pilots who did fly at Pearl Harbor and expropriates it for two fictional characters. And the fact that Rafe and Danny made it into the air does nothing to improve the movie except to give Michael Bay more chances to blow things up.The second error is the character of Evelyn. Evelyn is far more than the writers allowed us to think she is- and what she is is not complementary. She is presented as God's gift- sweet, beautiful, kind, responsible- but in truth she is manipulative and thoughtless, and very self-centered. An interesting dilemma if Randall Wallace had chosen to acknowledge what he had created.All in all, Pearl Harbor is not a total loss, but certainly not a winner. What's frustrating is that it could have been so much more. I'd give it 5 out 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is a great film. The romance is a bit awkward at times and some of the script is a little 'what were you thinking?' at times.However, it works and in 180 minutes I wasn't bored once. The real highlight of the film was always going to be the assault on Pearl Harbor, and that was the most thrilling half an hour of cinema I have ever seen.The way the violence made you feel uncomfortable and nervous would be expected in a Scorcese film rather than a supossed summer block buster. Normally, this would probably be seen as a bad thing, but in a dastardly attack like Pearl Harbor I think it is totally appropriate and exquisitly done.Don't believe the critics - if you miss Pearl Harbor at the cinema (definately it's most appropriate and worthwhile format) you will miss out.I give it 8 and 1/2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw only two hours worth, and by that time, I didn't care how it came out--neither the war nor that sappy romance. The actual bombing of Pearl Harbor (what most people would assume this film is about) was compelling, but all tension and horror was obliterated by the constant cutting away from history, in order to dwell upon that incredibly bad Hardy Boys response by Our Heroes. Two touching moments, before I made my escape (I left right after that Date Which Will Live In Infamy): Cuba Gooding's brief moment with the dying captain of his ship; and the nurses facing the influx of an overwhelming number of casualties. The former was so unexpected, so brief and had so much humanity in it; and the latter would be a worthy subject for a film of its own, but instead was obscured by artsy "blurred" cinematography, to suggest confusion in lieu of dramatizing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Cat Could Have Done It Better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Oh come on, Pearl Harbor was never going to comfortably sit next to World War II classics such as A Bridge Too Far or even The Great Escape. Lets look at the facts: Producer, Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay are masters of clichéd, cheesy flicks such as The Rock and Top Gun. Between them, they are responsible for one of the most hilarious films of all time, Armageddon. Whereas we want to believe in Father Christmas, Jerry and Michael actually believe that Bruce Willis can save the world, Ben Affleck can act and that big is always better - face it, Pearl Harbor was doomed from the start.As America basks in peaceful isolationism, Europe is at war. The faceless, cold and Dr Fumanchu-like Japanese - as Touchstone Pictures would have you believe, are determined to protect their empire against imminent American interventionism at any cost. And so the racial stereotyping ensues. However.World War Two plays second fiddle to the Sunset Beach-esque love triangle that slowly and uninspiringly dominates the narrative. Rafe McCrawley (Ben Affleck) falls for military nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale), and they couldn't be happier until he volunteers to go to England and help fight the war. Tragedy strikes and Rafe is killed in action (or so we're lead to believe). Evelyn finds comfort in the arms of his best mate Danny (Josh Hartnett) and guess what, they fall hopelessly in love. But here's the best bit, Rafe isn't dead! No surprises there then and so follows the tale of betrayal, love, jealousy and a really crap musical score.Oh yes, silly me, I almost forgot to mention that hour in the middle of the film dedicated to dizzying explosions and spectacular ship sinking, courtesy of the 'evil' squadrons of Japanese warplanes launching a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. Although this altered the course of world history, it amazingly leaves our three main characters, plus Cuba Gooding Jr (who clearly just popped over from the set of Men Of Honour to ad lib) and some muddy little ship's dawg, totally unscathed, lucky them eh? Unlucky for us though...The crazy thing about this huge budget flop is that everything is basically slung together in a very choppy fashion, almost as if the editors were so bored and wanted to make lasties at the local. Whilst the visual effects are phenomenal, I'm afraid that I'm of the 'if you've seen one explosion you've seen 'em all' school. And hence for the best part of an hour, I had to sit through Technicolor flames and strung-out ship sinking, lots of extras hanging onto each other for dear life etc and too be honest it all got a bit boring. However, top marks for Affleck and Hartnett taking to the skies in their Hawaiian shirts to wup-some-Japanese-ass, such heroics, so predictable; oh just one more shot of the victory boys and their flapping Hawaiian attire in the propeller wind, puhleeese?The film is hellish and whilst the Pearl Harbor bombing may be based on fact the romance is purely fiction, yet dominates the entire narrative. Errr logic? Why not call it Love In War or Three Get Friendly In Hawaii? But hey, why spoil a good story with facts.Major moan of the day, why couldn't the budget include a bribe for the actors to at least look like they remotely like each? Instead, there is a total lack of chemistry all round. It's like watching a movie where the actors clearly don't want to be there or worse still, were utterly mis-cast. Kate Beckinsale is cold and very dull in her role which I couldn't help but think Nicole Kidman could have pulled off and Affleck sucks, as usual. Even John Voight's FDR is cringe worthy and as for Alec 'tubster' Baldwin's aviation legend Jimmy Doolittle, you've got to be having a laugh. Alec would much rather have been munching pies.The saviour-of-the-movie award goes to Josh Hartnett. Young, bright and talented he steals the show with his tremendous presence and slightly better lines than Affleck. Plus, he's bloody gorgeous! Warning, if you're going to shed a tear, it'll be over this fella.As a war movie it fails miserably, as a love story it's boring and predictable but as a comedy-laced cheese fest, it rocks! Like Titanic, Pearl Harbor will probably fall victim to its own crapness and hype. It could have been a lot better and when I thought about it rationally, there was probably no money for a decent script writer, so a crap one wrote the entire script on the back of a postage stamp with a felt tip pen, and I reckon my cat could have done it better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A truly wretched movie, it sucked my will to live in the first twenty minutes of cliché romance only to reach heretofore unseen peaks of cliché battle scenes, followed by an arduous cliché-rich conclusion. The acting involved more puppy-dog eyes and winning smiles than quality scripting (hence, the high rating from young teen-age girls), which was all too apparent in the Japanese one-liners. (No, really. A one-sentence statement would be followed by a profound one-sentence reply, with evil music in the background, of course, just in case you weren't sure who the bad guys were, and then the scene would change back to the heart-throbs in uniform.) The characters were static, the movie was three hours too long, predictable, and dull. To sum up: dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love history and historical subjects, and love to see a historical period reenacted, but my misgivings about this film were the weak romantic triangle and the overwrought special effects. I never bought Affleck as a 40's flier or a romantic for a second, and the special effects were overdone. They look like they were intended to fit into a video game coming to a store near you. I doubt any fliers flew down along streets between buildings during the Pearl Harbor attack. I think the models in Tora, Tora, Tora were more realistic that the real modern-day ships they used in some of the explosion scenes, which were obviously not from the 1940's. I'm glad I saw the film, but it ultimately failed to satisfy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The death of storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What bothers me even more than the historical inaccuracies is the inability to tell a coherent story. The abundance of quick cuts, constant overwhelming music, overemoting actors, and blatant symbolism is becoming fairly common these days. Unfortunately, all this gets in the way of following what's going on. There's a lot of money on effects (such as the Arizona blowing up), but no time given to appreciate them. All this layering on seems to be an attempt to inject "excitement" as an alternative to the more difficult but more effective method of a coherent, suspenseful plot. You might contrast the Pearl Harbor attack with the D-Day scene in Saving Private Ryan. Spielberg effectively recreates the chaos of battle, yet you're able to understand the movement of the characters and the obstacles they must face. By NOT USING MUSIC to artificially heighten emotions, he created a much more powerful experience.I don't consider this movie to be about Pearl Harbor in any historical sense; it's a video game with P40s as X-wings, jammed in with force-fed emotionalism. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney spent a million dollar on a blockbuster sinker. The movie is filled with many different topics. It tries to juggle WWII with romance. The plot switches back and forth that the theme lost all meaning to me. I don't even know what it is. The only good part is the explosions, even though it is overdone. I think the directors and producers should have studied their history a little more before they did this type of movie, since some of the historical aspects were off. The thing I hate most about this movie is that it glorifies war and propagandize US as the heroes. The actors and actress are ok, what can you expect from a romantic, predictable movie. If the script is bland, then so will the acting be. This movie isn't as bad as the critics said it is, but it lacked a lot of things as mentioned above and also depth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where are the Kamikazes?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, highly awaited and overly promoted Pearl Harbor opened at theaters across the world. like to review this movie 1) on itself and 2) in comparison to Michael Bay's other movie, Armageddon, and I have two major critiques coming out of each review.1) Firstly, I was so surprised that there was NOT even one scene of a kamikaze diving into a battle ship despite the fact that kamikaze attacks are the most important element of Pearl Harbor story. So why were there NO kamikaze scenes? We all have seen historical movies where the history is told inaccurately due to lack of knowledge or events twisted on purpose but never had I seen a movie where the most important element is disregarded all together with no plausible reason. How can you make a Pearl Harbor movie without Kamikazes?2) My second critique is based upon the incredible similarities between Pearl Harbor and Armageddon. Here are the ones I have noticed: 1) In both movies, the first hour and 20 minutes is filled with comical incidents and easy-laughter type of jokes. Remember The Armageddon where Bruce Willis' crew was being tested for their space mission? Do you remember the funny incidents that take place during these tests? In Pearl Harbour, it is exactly the same; funny things happen when the pilots are tested for -not for space mission but this time for- war. In both movies, we see that the first half of the story is senseless comedy which somehow spoils the wholeness of the movie to the point of making it look like two separate movies. Some may argue that it is a artistic achievement to combine two parts but I think if they are so separate in nature they should not be combined at all because that makes the whole picture look incongruous. If you are going to make a comedy, you should continue with the same pace and told the story from that point of view. If you are going to make a serious war movie then you should be very careful with the degree of comedy involved. 2) In both movies, a guy is leaving a girl behind for his duty. In fact, it is the same guy, Ben Affleck. He was leaving Liv Tyler behind in Armageddon promising to come back where he does exactly the same in Pearl Harbor. There were romantic scenes before he left for the mission; in Pearl Harbor, again, there is romance all though this time scenes were less sensual. 3) In both movies, there was a aftermath which was filled with tragedy. In Armageddon, Bruce Willis had to stay and sacrifice his own life whereas in Pearl Harbor Ben Affleck's friend gets killed in fight with Japanese and Ben Affleck returns as the sole survivor in both movies.Briefly, I think Pearl Harbor is suffering from a lack of story. It is simply filled with easy comedy, romance and special effects which are told in such an expected and in such an average way, it takes away the whole excitement. A good movie needs more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great bombing scene....but too cliche, too long.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, after 3 hours i could not believe how dismayed I was. Apart from 40 minutes of a great bombing scene I can honestly say the rest was cliche.By the way, anyone see any similar traits to Top-Gun? Let me list them. 1 - T.G- Maverick did his fly-by the tower and got chewed out by his superior. P.H - same thing happens except the pilots play chicken.2- Maverick had a signature move by braking his jet and then he uses it in battle and defeats the enemy. Well so to does the "chicken" game which gets used.3 - A character called Goose appears in both movies.4 - A shallow romance plot (just to appeal to those old romantics out there and serves nothing else)5 - All the ritualistic hand signal/salute on the aircraft carriers.I'll stop there. The romance scenes were over done to death. The old train departing gag with the man inside and female outside parting, for mabye the last time. (I wish it did..pewk)American patriotism...over done...as if the soldiers swimming in the water would be cheering when they saw their fellow pilots shoot down an enemy zero. I would be swimming for my life with 8-10 warships ablaze and sinking around me and most likely be oblivious to what is happening in the sky. Also no mention of Australia....not a shred..which is very strange because USA did base themselves at Australia as the Japanese firmed their grip after taking Singapore. Again just like "Saving Private Ryan" - denies acknowledgement of other countries who also lost thousands of troops. Cliche American flag shot..been there seen that.And the movie was about Pearl Harbour. It could have finished with the bombing and focussed on the tragedy. But nope the USA had to get revenge in some phoney suicide mission. We all knew how the war ended with Hiroshima and japan signing a treaty why place in that corny other stuff.Someone told me this movie was like the Titanic...I wish i had listened as I would have skipped it. The only thing that makes this movie popular is clever marketing because it will not be from word of mouth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I highly recommend this movie. Yes the final third could probably be another movie. Yes, it has a love story involved but so what? I also recommend "Tora Tora Tora" for a straight telling without the love story but who cares? The visuals are awesome, the terror although was much worse. For those that weren`t there, I recommend reading "Remembering Pearl Harbor" edited by Robert S. La Forte and Ronald E. Marcello beforehand if possible. The book is strictly true accounts of those that were there at the time of the attack. There you will read of the true horror of men dying in boiling seas of oil, their skin and limbs coming off like a boiled chicken, there you will read of the Japanese pilots flying over grinning and waving at the Americans as they killed them. It`s only just a movie and a visually striking movie when it comes to the combat scenes but as history it is unfortunatly probably the only history young people will be exposed to so for that reason alone I recommend it highly. Go see it! And when you do, do some thinking in the days afterward of the slaughter that happened there and appreciate what our fathers and grandfathers had thrust upon them when they were only 18 years old, give or take a few...</fullReview>

The writers had a problem connecting the love and historical aspects of the story together, but in the end, they were put together poorly. The movie dragged, and the love parts of the story were weak and confusing. All together, you should wait to see Pearl Harbor on video and dont waste $10 to see it in theatres.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor MUST NEVER BE FORGOTTEN.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor and so many other movies about World War II and all other wars are a necessary evil. The knowledge and awareness there is about history no longer seems to come from our public educational system.We must rely on movies to impart our history to us now, or so it seems.The knowledge of all past wars and its horrors must never be forgotten. How much better but with such a movie as this?The ladies and gentlemen who made this movie have provided us all with a great public service. So few realize how important a movie like this is if we are going to remain a free society.Patriotism and national pride have become laughable pursuits in some segments of society. To honor the ladies and gentlemen who gave their young lives to war so that we could live ours to their full length and in peace, is a most honorable pursuit. I was not born in the USA, but as my adopted country, the valor and bravery of these ladies and gentlemen are sewn deeply within my heart.Take away all your quibbles about formula plots, unnecessary subplots and uneven script-pacing...let us view this film with the solemn veneration and grateful heart which we must provide in order to pay tribute to those who did not come home or are still buried in the Arizona, and in a thousand other unmarked graves throughout the world.I thank all of those who participated in this film. Yes, this story has been told before... ....but as with so many other stories about wars, we must continue to teach our young people that these wars were not numbers, dates and places in a history book, but about the sacrifices, the blood, maiming and horrors of every human conflict and quest for peace.May they forever remain in our memories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie, although Americanized</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, This movie was pretty good, I liked it, but on the downside, I think it was truly Americanized. I mean, I know that when Pearl Harbor was bombed, innocent people were killed. But when the Americans bombed Japan it showed the bombing from a different perspective. "Glorious America, seeking revenge, and can do no wrong" It showed that. Now I'm positive that through out that bombing, we had to have killed innocent people. But the movie didn't show that. So its just that little disgust that ticked me off. Other then that, it was a pretty good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sigh. Yet again, the American blockbuster machine massacres history and entertainment. And yet again it is with the subtlety of a brick to the head. Every hero shot and `memorable moment' are spelt out explicitly and along with the patriotic speeches, come fast and furious. Pick one of the many and shed a tear. The director apparently doesn't give his audience enough credit to be able to recognize a heroic moment by the action itself. He must resort to trailer-made tricks such as stirring music, slow motion shots and that steely-eyed stone jawed look that suggests the actor is in an arm wrestle instead of a terrifying fight for his life. In our world, not all acts of heroism are in slow-motion and blurred. Sometimes Japanese people (or any given enemy) laugh. Not every sentence a person says is laden with a message/moral. We sometimes discuss the trivial and in doing so, show our humanity. And not every hero has a touching and poignant death scene, expressing their best wishes. (For a stunning contrast, compare these points to something like Saving Private Ryan, or even better, a British movie) On top of this, much of the true drama of that day is merely brushed over, such as the fate of the flight of B-17s and the heroism of the crew of the Nevada in their efforts to save her. The fate of a dog is however a guaranteed heart-jerker.Don't be fooled, this isn't the fitting tribute to the brave fighters on both sides of the war. This is pure and shameless propaganda for reminding Americans that their country is great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning, but a bit contrived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Admittedly it must be hard for a director to condense a vital historical occurence into three hours, and in a format that will be interesting and appealing to a large audience. Pearl Harbor is visually stunning but the supporting story is a bit contrived. The actual invasion is handled brilliantly. The special effects and direction make it real and painful and painful to watch in some parts. The movie dealt with both sides, Japanese and American, with respect and sensitivity, not casting any "good" guys and "bad" guys.But the supporting story reminds me of those war and romance movies from the 40's. It lacked substance and reality. The dialogue in some areas was fake and shallow and didn't match up to the grittiness of the invasion scenes. This had a lot of impact on the way I viewed the movie. The acting was a treat and Ben Affleck is always interesting to watch. But I was very impressed with the rest of the cast especially Josh Hartnett. Unfortunately he wasn't given to much of a chance to show off his range but he's worth keeping an eye out for. While it is a watchable movie, it doesn't really provide an underlying statement. I didn't walk away from it that deeply in thought about the futililty of war and the shame of losing so many men. I went into it expecting a patriotic american retelling of the story and that's what I found. It's a good movie but definitely not "a best ever".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only good thing about tonight was that I was given the tickets - I would have been so annoyed if I had actually paid to see this! Quite frankly, it is one of the worst (and longest) movies I can recall seeing. The characters are wooden and miss-cast (I generally love Jon Voight, but he sucks as Roosevelt). There is nothing about any of them that makes you give a damn about them. The dialogue is APPALLING - hackneyed, trite, predictable and extraordinarily dull. I can't recall having heard so many cliches except in a spoof! Oh - I nearly forgot the special effects - they were loud and colourful, but somehow they seemed a bit like "Star Wars" at sea, and were extraordinarily repetitive.On top of all that, I thought it was NEVER going to end! (Yes, I could have left, but, being the eternal optimist, I kept hoping it might improve). I was really optimistic that it would end after the bombing of Pearl Harbour, but it dragged on for ages after that, with the skimpiest, and dullest, of "plots" to stretch it out.All in all - a DREADFUL movie - 2/10All in all</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a history buff, I tend to be extra critical of movies on major historical topics. If really great, they are highly cherished. If not so hot, then I feel uncomfortable. I regret that I am lukewarm to cool about the supposed blockbuster, "Pearl Harbor" I suppose it depends on what you want to see. If you want the attack on Pearl Harbor depicted with "Star Wars" special effects hype, then you are in for another Adrenalin rush. But somehow, the depiction just doesn't seem quite right. An example? Yes, the US did manage to get a few planes off the ground during the raid and some dogfights and Japanese casualties occurred. But nothing I have read about the raid indicates that rival pilots chased each other around the facilities on Hickam Field. Other aspects of the film? The romantic involvement of the two pilots (falling in love with the same girl, yet somehow managing to remain friends in the end) is not totally unbelievable, but would have been rare in the cultural milieu of the early '40's. Also, the movie, which not only builds up to Pearl Harbor, dramatizes the Raid and then moves on to Jimmy Doolittle's bold venture, is very long. It is very appropriate, in year 2001, for the American film industry to celebrate the 60th. anniversary of Pearl Harbor. But, as a depiction of this momentous event, the movie doesn't hold a candle to "Tora, Tora, Tora" which really was a serious and highly successful attempt to depict history.  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expensive and entertaining but not breath-taking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw it and expected more. The most expensive movie ever made, the hype shouted at me. It was an entertaining ride, none the less, but it was not as fabulous as the hype insisted it was.I'm getting a little tired of all these flag-waving movies. Don't get me wrong, I'm American and I care somewhat for my country, but I'm getting tired of the self-righteous movies that punch themselves in the chest macho-style and proclaim that they have a right to be AMERICAN GODDAMMIT!So, let's break it down.Story: Interesting that it's set around an event that I've always had a weak spot for, and the script is somewhat amusing at times. It's also (as far as I know) relatively accurate, and gives a fairly good (if at times skewed) perspective on one of the turns in WW2. Of course it does have some very large clichés, but I got the feeling that they were there more because the studio felt some clichés were in order, not because of the writers.Acting: Bad. Bad. Bad. Ben Affleck tries in vain to sound southern, but he's as wooden as he always is in these big-budget movies. Josh Hartnett is equally wooden, with equally fake accent. What's-her-face who plays the love interest is in my opinion as stereotyped as always. I'm also annoyed with the fact that pretty much every cast-member is either handsome in a rugged kind of way, or cute in a rugged kind of way. Everyone sounds/looks as if they were given one or at most two times to rehearse, and often sound as if they're reading off of cue-cards.Effects: Impressive. Not bad. Entertaining. At times VERY impressive. But overall the Joe Schmoes are becoming kind of jaded with these really amazing SFX. And as always, great effects does not compensate bad acting.So... to summarize a bit. Good entertainment, but it will not leave your mouths agape with wonder afterwards, unless you're feeble-minded or have very bad taste in movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can call me a sentimental sap. I don't care. People complain about the slow buildup to the actual attack. My two favorite films of all time are the original 'King Kong' and 'Titanic'. Both films have long buildups to their thrilling second halves of the film. "Pearl Harbor' also builds up to its stunning semi conclusion. Again, I don't care. I fell in love with Kate Beckinsale the second I saw her. She is so beautiful. Kate does a wonderful job. I don't care too much about the 2 guys she falls for, but I certainly respect their taste in women. I was terribly moved when the attack took place. What a horrible sight it must have been to actually been there in person! I enjoyed 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' just as much as 'Pearl Harbor'. Both films are moving and entertaining.

The bad (and sometimes laughable) performances (with sometimes odd casting choices) make this long movie even longer, and the audience's reward is a contrived ending (again based on another famous military attack) that proves that film makers really are even more stupid than they are on the Oscars and Politically Incorrect. Taking one part TITANIC and one part SAVING PRIVATE RYAN may have sound like a sound idea, but maybe if the Disney had actually tried to make a film about Pearl Harbor they would have made a good movie. Instead this is just a really sloppy cartoon from a studio who is has done much better mixing live-action and animation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Possible Spoiler* I saw Pearl Harbor this weekend and I have to say that it is an excellent film in every aspect of the word, the beginnging could easily have been made to feel like something to stop the film opening with the battle sequence but it doesn't. The start of the film, the first hour-hour and a half all go into building up the characters so that we care and feel for them later on in the film. The build up to the attack which runs in small segments are moody and give an impression of the sheer scale of the actual attack and how much stock Japan put into it. The attack it's self is a piece of movie magic, once the first torpedo is launched you'll try your hardest not to blink incase you miss something, take an action sequence from The Matrix which typically last 5 minutes, length it to 35 mins and increase the scale massivly to include tens of battleships, airstrips, and planes and you've got the best action sequence featured in a movie to date. The action doesn't stop during the attack and you can't help but get upset and marvel at the sheer scale of attack and the damage done in it. Theres also an intriguing love story line running at the same time. The end is were the film comes apart, it feels like an afterthought because Hollywood couldn't make a film that didn't end without them getting the upper hand. **** out of *****</fullReview>

Despite the obvious fact that the makers had an abundance of riches at their fingertips,they failed in every area (except FX) to create a decent film. This particular no-brainer has no excuses as there are so many factual sources of info on the infamous subject. The resultant, mix of love,war &amp; tragedy does not work!The one-dimensional characterization stops the (capable) actors rendering a believable framework to hang the whole picture on.You can't use a drawing pin to hang a Renoir! I really feel the glossy nature of the picture insults the memories of those who so tragically died.It also overlooks the American ignorance of its own intelligence sources of the time.The real drama &amp; tragedy of this event would have been more ably portrayed &amp; hard hitting had Mr Bay &amp; Co. made a more factual account of the events.The cringe-inducing "romance" destroys the potential tension,sadness &amp; despair of the situation.The tacked on revenge ending is rubbish!A childlike attempt by the film to even the score!Regardless of any truth to the Tokyo Bombing,no one remembers it like Pearl Harbor!This even insults the Japanese-if you want to show "anything you can do,we can do too!"-GO THE WHOLE HOG AND CHEER THE BOMBING OF HIROSHIMA!!

		<shortDescription>Why oh Why! this is two films rolled into a God awful mess!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about this film I was excited to say the least. The thought of watching the epic bombing of Pearl Harbour was something I just could not imagine. And to the films credit that part was at least satisfying. However it is quite obvious they did not want to go down the "Saving Private Ryan" road and do the full on cold hard reality style war film. It is also quite obvious they wanted something there for the ladies to see. This all by itself seems fair, reasonable and smart but the execution is an absolute shocker!There is in essence two films here, a love triangle and a war movie. They have been rolled into one and they fail to complement each other. The war scenes and the love scenes are two seperate entities and the filmmakers never seem to be able to fully roll them into one. It is kind of like 'now lets have them kiss and be lovey dovery', 'now lets bomb that absolute heck out of Pearl Harbour' - does this match? However as sperate films in themselves they lack so much.The love story is not engaging enough. I found myself at the start when the female lead was explaining how she met Affleck I wandering what I had missed. Had I walked in late or something, I was thrown into an already developed relationship and felt lost. The characters in the start of this film get some poor lines to use and the film never sucks you in. I know my girlfreind loved the love story angle just as much as I loved the war scene but she agrees she felt like she was not part of it all. And that is where it fails. The film fails to 'suck us in'. In "Titanic" we see the lovers before they meet, when they meet, when they have fun, when they fall apart and then finally then end. In this film we jump straight into when they are having fun, have them fall apart and then the end fails to give us any sence of conclusion. And this goes for three hours!!!!The war angle too has its problems! For starters the battles near the start are kinda cool but they are woven into a monologue by Affleck about writing to his girl - boring! Everyone needed a release from the intense love angle trying to be portrayed and some aciton was needed. The we get to the Japanese who in relaity were very barbarrack, patriotic people! The Japanese Admiral says towards the end "I fear all we have done is awoken a sleeping giant". What a load of tripe, the reality was the Japanese thought they were going to take over all of Asia and America. As for the films justification of why the 3rd wave was not sent against Pearl is also full of it. The reality is so much more complex and believeable. And of course you must cut most of Alecs and Johns speeches so the American "we are so great" is no longer there. However the actually bombing was awesome! I could feel the tingle in my throat as the planes flew in! This was what made the movie and made it bearable to watch!!!!!!!!!!!!So all in all what is it? two hours of an uninteresting, unengaging soppy love story mixed with just over an hour of historically inacurate, Americanised war scenes. But it is all saved by one thing, the bombing of Pearl Harbour itself. This is proof you can save any film by bombing the absolute heck out of something</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bloated and boring, Pearl Harbor is a collection of war-movie clichés in search of an epic. Director Michael Bay (Armageddon and The Rock) allows this sappy romantic drama disguised as an action film drag on for three finger-drumming hours. While the actual, extended battle scenes are technically dazzling ? full of diving fighter bombers and exploding warships ? the story and dialogue that surround and accompany them are as hackneyed as that of any daytime soap opera.Pearl lollygags forever setting up a pre-December 7, 1941, love triangle among three fictional characters: Rafe (Affleck) and Danny (Hartnett), flyboys who grew up best buds in rural Tennessee, and Evelyn (Beckinsale), a military nurse. She falls in love with the cocky Rafe first, but he volunteers for service over in England and is reported dead. She then finds comfort in Danny's arms when both men are stationed at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. As they laze about on the beach, Evelyn asks, `Do you ever wonder if this war is going to catch up with us?' Cue the bombers.Rafe returns, of course, just in time for the aerial attack that would spur America's entry into WWII. He and Danny do what they can (`Just get me into a damn plane,' Rafe yells), but Pearl at least has the grace not to tamper with history, acknowledging that Japan's surprise raid left 2,400 Americans dead and destroyed half of our Pacific fleet.Affleck, strappingly handsome, comes across here as a movie star playing a movie star playing a character. Harnett and Beckinsale fare better but only because they don't have to be quite as noble in every single scene. Gooding, portraying `Dorie' Miller, a real-life Navy mess attendant who courageously manned an antiaircraft gun during the raid, is solid, but his character feels awkwardly wedged into the main story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hype is worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although more of a "chick flick" than I would tend to like, with the obligatory love story and complications thereof thrown in to appeal to popular audience approval, still one hell of a flick, with the climactic event portrayed in all its violent, destructive glory with some of the most amazing effects ever seen (while being almost a scene-for-scene remake of 1970's TORA! TORA! TORA!) . Yes, the story is a cheesy attempt at trying to hold viewer interest and appeal to younger crowds, but still there's no denying the power this movie holds in depicting the event leading the U.S. into WWII. If you HAVEN'T seen this one yet, shame on you and I would urge you to get out and see it, if for nothing else, for the mind-blowing effects when the Japanese finally start the attack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought I was this movie's target audience. I'm a white male aged from 18 to 25. It was raining and I wanted to see some cheesy love story with loads of big explosions. I am Jack's need for Hollywood. Far from being just cheesy, the love angle was a flat afterthought. Insert-heartbreak-here. Lovable, honest but dumb pilot falls for caring, sassy nurse. If that didn't pull the heart strings of every maternally crazed woman in the audience, then this film is a poorly acted, badly scripted turd. It didn't. Anyway, not to worry. There's still 150 Million $'s worth of magic to see. Unfortunately, after 30 minutes of explosions, even ILM becomes boring. No pacing. No tension. No edge-of-seat action. Just explosion after explosion after explosion. It's like watching a 2 hour special on 'When bombs go wrong' of Fox. And just when I thought it was over, another hour and a half of the film appeared. Bugger.Not worth the 150 million they spent. Not even worth the 12 francs I paid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying that I loved this movie. I went into it expecting something and walked out having seen what I expected. How many times can you make that claim?I went into this movie with the idea that it would be Titanic meets Private Ryan meets Armageddon, and I was right. It's all of the above. The sweeping love story, the intense battle and a visual style that I can only describe as beautiful. This is what Gone with the Wind would have looked like if there had been MTV. It's a classic tale of young love set against the backdrop of one of the most painful events in American history. Some people are no doubt going to disagree with me. They're going to take the above paragraph and use the exact wording to point out its flaws. That's what makes this country so wonderful, we can disagree.

It wasn't a war film - it was a love story for God's sake?! For me, a war story IS a love story, if not for some hot nurse, then for the country the soldiers are fighting for. I'm telling you, this is no Gladiator, by any means - not everyone is going to see it for the epic it is. There's a stigma attached to films that Jerry Bruckheimer makes. There's a stigma attached to the movies Michael Bay makes. And there are people who will dislike Pearl Harbor for those very two reasons - possibly without having even seen it. All I can really say, the point that I can try to get across, is that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I liked it for the action. I liked it for the love story. And most of all, I liked it for the way it made me feel as an American. For me, movies like this have to tug on your strings a little, and this one tugged mine, just like The Patriot and Private Ryan did.Go see this movie. Ignore what the critics have said. Make your own judgment. You may love it, like me, or you may find it to be a piece of crap. But you will have made that decision, for yourself.

		<fullReview>This movie is rip-off. I'd seen trailer after trailer for this movie promoting it as a big action flik, so I decided to go into the theater and see what all the fuss was about. What I ended up watching was three hours of cliche's and sappy love story. The film would have worked a lot better if they had balanced out the action and the romance, rather than allowing the love story to rule the film. This film is worse than some of the stuff I see on MST3K. Please, for your own good, don't see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb cinematography, but, script needed more work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first say that the action sequences and the acting of the leads is without reproach. The filming of the attack itself is fantastic and is engrossing (without the revulsion of Private Ryan).  (There are many well publicised continuity goofs, but, I don't spend my movie time worrying about that sort of thing.) However, and it is a really big, HOWEVER, why didn't someone give the script a going over and dump the farcical last 30mins. While they were at it there is at least another thirty minutes of 'fat' in the film that could have been lost while they were at it. It detracted from the story and left a bad taste when you eventually leave your seat.  I think this more than anything else account for the low scores it has received here and elsewhere. I know Hollywood/Americans were loathe to leave the story at the low point of there massacre at Pearl harbour. But, it would have been a much stronger film if you had.  Also, the scenes cut in to try and minimise the poor reflection of the Japanese were bordering on farce in themselves. Go watch Schindlers List again to get the idea. All in all a good movie to watch at home were you could turn it off in the aftermath of the attack on Pearl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long. Tedious. Big Budget....So What.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't understand why so many people are raving about this film. An hour into it and they're still trying to flesh out characters who remain flat throughout. Ben Affleck has 2 facial expressions. He uses them both, extensively. Kate Beckinsale's easy to look at and this provides some relief to an otherwise tedious first hour.The next hour is the attack. Pretty cool special effects, but even these get tedious after a while, and you're left with what the director must hope we will believe is engaging acting. It's not. Ben Affleck is out of his depth, and unremitting close-ups of his two facial expressions don't substitute for acting. By the time I got to the finishing stretch (and it felt like the end of a long race)I'd lost all interest. I was drumming my fingers when I was supposed to be teary-eyed. Sorry. Two thumbs down.P.S. Did anybody else notice the calendar at the Japanese headquarters (which otherwise used Japanese characters, showed the word "SUNDAY"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok what do i think about Pearl Harbor. Well in my overall opinion i would say that the film was entertaining, but not so much a good movie. I think that the love triangle involving the three mains was too long and uninvolving. Another thing, being British i really do hate films that are so i love America. Why do they have to consistantly wave the flag around the whole time. You don't see that in british movies. But i do think that the actual attack on Pearl Harbor was very well done. But i found when the two leads went up in the planes to fight was quite ridicleous to say the least. But despite the mountain of cheese it was quite entertaining and i would recommend it as long as you leave you brain at home. If you want to watch a film that'll make you think watch Memento or any Coen Brothers film. But if it's high octane cheesy action that is your bag then this is still worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>no good love story, no good film about war, what else?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been a dozen previous American films that have significantly dealt with the attack of Pearl Harbor. But only one, TORA! TORA! TORA!, thought to be painstakingly faithful to the facts and is remembered as one of the great big-budget turkeys of all time. The new Pearl Harbor is Hollywood and not history. The film glorifies the American weaknesses and distorts the history at a such high level I have never seen before in another film. For example got no American nurses killed and no hospital was intentional attacked by Japanese aircrafts. American pilots were not as good as shown in the film during the fights between Germany and England. On contrary they were an easy booty for the experienced German fighters. The reason of this desaster is, that American filmmakers are not able to show the truth on WW2, because a nation, that has the most of the casualties related to his time at war, can not be able to make a realistic film based on the true history. There are only a few exceptions: Platoon, Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket and TORA! TORA! TORA!</fullReview>

Pearl Harbor's saving grace was it's visually spectacular battle sequence; however, the hour and a half long 90210 episode that led up to it left me begging for the bombs to drop early. Basically, it's worth the 3 bucks to rent for the effects alone, but not the $9 ($18 if it's a date) plus food to see it in the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given the number of comments about how shallow the movie is, I'll just say this: ditto. My real problem with this movie is how it glosses over the story behind the Japanese attack. I think the writers actually devoted one, maybe two lines to the Japanese reasons for attacking. Believe it or not, but it was a little more complex than this. "Pearl Harbor" just glorified the Americans' side of the story. If you want to see a good movie about Pearl harbor, rent "Tora Tora Tora," which offers some deeper insight into the events, and save yourself 9 bucks and 3 hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not horrible, just cliched, predictable, and entirely too long..."Armageddon" was more fun, though just as mawkish and even more ridiculous plotwise."Pearl Harbor" does deliver on the action sequences, though nothing really new there, either. And though the romance is a pretty lame attempt at recapturing the old Hollywood tradition of the wartime love story, it's partly redeemed by the lead actors, who have an appealing freshness--especially Kate Beckinsdale and Josh Hartnett. Ben Affleck isn't doing much to show his range (which at best seems fairly limited), though I have a soft spot for him because he's so damned good-looking. So is the Hartnett kid, who's likable as well as cute. There's plenty of eye candy in this film, that's for sure.As for the dialogue: Sure, it's dumb, and as flat and canned as Coke that's been out too long--but it's no worse than "Titanic," which everybody hailed as some kind of masterpiece and which no one seemed to notice had cliches spouting everywhere and a love story I found as cheesy and unconvincing as the one in "Pearl Harbor." And even dumber lines.That said, I do admit, grudgingly, that "Titanic" is the better film. "Pearl Harbor" tries to combine "Titanic" with "Saving Private Ryan" and comes up instead with a big hollow cheese puff of a movie. Which has its enjoyable points, but is hardly something to be savored or remembered. Swallow it whole in one big gulp and don't think too much about it afterwards. Do think, however, about the real Pearl Harbor story, the one in the history books--it merits a lot closer examination than the Hollywood version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is one of the worst films I have seen in years. The men who died at Pearl Harbor deserve a far better tribute than this piece of blockbuster trash. It amazes me that an event that is so packed with plot-potential could manage to be made into a movie that lacks one entirely.Furthermore, it's lousy history (warning: some SPOILERS - not much the trailer doesn't already give away)a) The attack happened at 8am. Yet kids are shown playing baseball in the yard, people are going to church, seems like everyone on the island is awake in a great norman-rockwell-esque shot with the Japanese planes flying in. Meanwhile, the soldiers are all asleep.b) It mentions we can't crack Japanese code. Not true - the US had cracked the code completely - which is why a message was sent to Pearl Harbor warning of imminent attack. (The movie does get right that the message arrived 4 hours too late)c) The order of attack is all wrong - the movie shows them attacking ships first, then hospitals and nurses, then the airfields. The japanese attacked the airfields first, then the ships. Japanese NEVER attacked the hospitals.d) They were able to get to the ammunition/planes. In fact, the planes and ammunition were all locked up - and the planes lined up in clear view because the Army was following sabotage protocol. One of the bigger dramas of the ACTUAL attack was that the troops couldn't get to the guns/etc because they were all locked up.e) One of the things this movie fails to even mention is the fact that most of the ships were on leave for the weekend - so many of the sailors were on the island when the attack happened. The exception is the Arizona - which was the ship on active duty rotation. The majority of the casualties were of those who died when this ship was bombed. The movie makes it look like every ship was full of people. (though, there were certainly folks on each of the ships)If you want your history from hollywood, at least do yourself the favor or watching Tora! Tora! Tora!, don't waste your penny on this lousy love story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the worst movie that I have seen in the past five years - it is terrible in a multi-layered way.First of all it's over three hours long and every minute of it is badly written. Second, the love triangle is tedious in the extreme. Thirdly, for a non-American to watch this is pretty disspiriting - the history is all over the place. Finally, the special effects are nothing special - they borrow a number of ideas from movies like Titanic and Saving Private Ryan and just increase them manifold.Nothing in this movie is emotionally involving and nothing makes you sit back in your seat and think: "Wow, that was pretty cool."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insult to veterans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The previews for Pearl Harbor were misleading. Even the title of the film is deceptive. I initially thought the film would be about the events that took place at Pearl Harbor in 1941. But, no. It's really a sappy, poorly written love story that happens to have in the middle an exciting 40 minutes of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The film does not deserve its title and is an insult to veterans everywhere. The depiction of the actual attack is well done, but the rest of the film is not worth even a matinee ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shallow summer blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all of the money spent on "Pearl Harbor," it leaves the audience wondering why the filmmakers couldn't have spent a few extra dollars to hire a decent screenwriter. The dialogue was sappy, full of clichés, and worst of all, boring. This being said, its not surprising that the most magical, touching, and exciting parts of the movie came when the thinly drawn characters said nothing at all.As for all of those people so concerned with the film's historical accuracy - forget about it. This movie doesn't come anywhere near realistic. From the first glitzy shot of a wheat field in Tennessee a la the English Patient; to the triumphant pilots marching into their planes a la Armageddon (not coincidentally, also produced by Bay and Bruckheimer); to Ben Affleck waving an American flag and emerging as the hero, this film was clearly made to look and feel like a summer blockbuster rather than a war biopic.Forgetting about plot or characters for a minute, Bay and Bruckheimer did what they do best - shot an exciting, expensive action movie (starring an exciting, expensive Hollywood star). The special effects and action scenes served their purpose, with the audience on the edge of their seats while planes flew overhead and battleships blew up for a good forty minutes. Other than the ineffective, nauseating, shaky camera shots, and blurred shots of the victims in the aftermath, the direction was decent. However, "all that" (as described by Beckinsale in the film) was over after an hour and a half of the over three-hour movie, leaving us wondering what could possibly be left of this story.This is where the film takes its most downward turn, as we discover that there truly is nothing else to be said (especially with that mundane dialogue). The second half of the movie could've been a whole other movie, while screenwriter Randall Wallace tried to cram in all that he could into the already too long three-hour film. Affleck, Beckinsale and Hartnett were all fine choices for their characters (even though Beckinsale looked a little too similar to Liv Tyler in Armageddon), but were not given much to work with. I was more convinced of their love by Affleck gazing into Beckinsale's eyes than I was when they actually spoke. Furthermore, their romance is turned into even bigger schmaltz when it becomes an ill-fated (and ill-scripted) triangle between Rafe (Affleck), Evelyn (Beckinsale), and Rafe's best friend, Danny (Hartnett).One more thing: if you're going to make a self-aware summer blockbuster, please don't base it on an important historical event. You might even try writing an original screenplay next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Flock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some reviewers have commented that far too many people have berated this film by need of adhering to the overall majority view. Funny how they dismiss the many who saw this soulless trash on opening day, seated beside couples who would have welcomed a little bit of romantic melodrama but who ultimately cringed, laughed (during highly 'serious' moments) and yielded a fairly high "Oh, C'mon!" response to a lot of what was supposed to be touching. I am-or was-neither hateful of Michael Bay nor a supporter of his work. All his films offer technically adept escapist action but when attempting anything beyond that, the man fails miserably. Did it not bother any of the fans of this tripe that not one single sentimental line of hollow dialogue could be uttered without the prompting of Hans Zimmer's beautiful but way overused score? I never thought I'd sit through a film scored by him wishing the music would just stop. Never mind historical inaccuracies, never mind the tacked-on Doolittle raid to end the film on an inappropriately positive note, this is simply a BAD movie. Some of us were forced to go home in a near trance wondering if the last three hours were indeed as wretched as they seemed. Then, to our relief, we learned of the horrible reviews across the board, which did NOT CREATE our opinions; they only informed us, the common moviegoer, that we were not crazy. Regardless of the shoddy script, the overuse of the music is the best evidence I can give as to how deeply felt the filmmakers were, forcing the audience to feel angry here, weep there, stand up and salute NOW! I suspect that neither Michael Bay or Jerry Bruckheimer have ever in their lives felt any of the emotions so bluntly rendered in this pathetic excuse for an historical epic.SPOILER ALERT! Did anyone actually feel moved by Jon Voight (easily the best performance in the film) standing up in his wheelchair to illustrate to his administration that nothing is ever impossible? The then polio-stricken FDR, if ever so adamant in addressing others, might have found another, more plausible and therefore more touching way of making a point. And believe me, that's only the tip of the iceberg that ultimately doomed the Titanic-an also maudlin but far superior film. Though James Cameron has never been a terrible witty writer, his screenplays at least have integrity amid all the action.The flock, as some have put it, is not the consequence of an influence instilled in us by critics, it is the result of this much-anticipated film proving to be one of the very worst of the year.Nevertheless, if you believed Armageddon was robbed on Oscar night, then by all means, Pearl Harbor is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many of the critics have slated this movie and said it is awful, but i totally disagree. It had an excellent mix of romance and action meaning fans of both genre will enjoy it. I don't usually enjoy slushy love stories but Pearl Harbor was different. The only criticism i would make is that there isn't any point in Cuba Gooding Jr's character, because he is hardly involved with the main storyline at all. Its as if the the makers decided just to put him in for the sake of it, i.e. the token black guy.The action scenes are stunning especially how the cameras follow the missiles right up to impact, creating a very exciting effect. I would recommend this film to anyone and i think the money spent on it was money well spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fraudulent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allright, so I watch the trailer and I think it is going to be POSSIBLY even better than American Beauty. I look at it and say "Well geez, that is going to be one spectacular film" and so, I get two of my closest friends and I go to the movies! So, I sit there for the 3 hours 5 minutes, and enjoy the film, right? Well, yes, I am a 13 year old female that basically saw the film only because the two main characters are incredibly good looking; I feel that probably many other females did the same as I. The first time I saw this movie, I was blown away it was great, I got teary eyed, the special effects were great... and so I decided to see it another time. I enjoyed it even more the second time, and then I bought the soundtrack. You are probably thinking that I mislead you by the summary at the top "fraudulent" or that I don't know what it means, but let me continue. So, I am overly touched by this film and I cried and all when ????? died. Then, I went home and discussed it with my brother. I guess that I didn't realize that the main reason I did like it was BECAUSE of the love story, which wasn't even based on a true story which totally takes away from this being a "realistic, historical film" or whatever. I mean, the film was basically a love story that got "interesting" around the comings of the whole attack on Pearl Harbor. I didn't go to it to see a love story, I wanted to see a historical film on a subject in which my history teacher lectured about, something that I found interesting. The whole battle scene lasted 40 minutes, but then it basically went back to the love story. That's basically forty minutes about what the movie is presented to be (about the bombing). I did enjoy the whole Doolittle's raid part. Though, although Ben and Josh are gorgeous, they aren't great actors, which was kind of a reason I turned out to not enjoy the film after hours of really thinking about it. Probably the greatest actor, who played an incredible role, was that Jon Voight, the one who played F.D.R. he put on an incredible performance and hopefully he will be in line for some academy awards. So, if you know what happended at Pearl Harbor, you really don't need to see this movie. I give it a 4/10.</fullReview>

No need for a sensible plot, decent dialogue, or physical accuracy (Armageddon) or historical accuracy (Pearl Harbor). They are marketing to adolescents of all ages not to thinking adults.If you want to watch a love story, watch one of the hundreds of better ones available at the video store. If you want to watch a war movie about the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the raid on Tokyo, watch "Tora! Tora! Tora!" and "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo" back to back.There are THOUSANDS of better movies out there. No reason to waste money on this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film "Pearl Harbor" is a mockery of one of the most horrific days in the history of the United States.Poor acting framed the most pathetic screenplay I've seen in years. The only part of this movie that's worth seeing are the historically inacurate, yet visually beautiful, CG shots from ILM. Absolutely gorgeous. Everything else, the acting, the screenplay, and the the slow-motion, go America, soft focus, Armageddon shots, are all crap.The whole world knows what happened on that day. In every country, in every history classroom, everyone the world over is taught of the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the United States into WWII. It was a tragic event that affected the planet as a whole. Did Michael Bay and his goons actually think they could fool us?I'm insulted. I'm offended.The ordeal of watching is slop reveal itself one frame at a time on the screen before was a punishment that robbed me of eight dollars, three hours of my life, and my dignity.But did this movie about the bombing of Pearl Harbor begin and end with the bombing of Pearl Harbor? No.It began with a simple enough, somewhat romantic, get-to-know-the-characters kind of shpiel, but then that shpiel dragged on, and on, and on. Suddenly, one historical inaccuracy after another broke up the romantic, hour long intro, spotted with poor humor and neat little historical facts ("Do you own that $25,000 figher out there?" - ooh, this movie is so cool because they did some research and found out that planes cost 25 grand).Then, for almost no reason other than wanting oil, Japan attacks Pearl Harbor because, get this, it's close. Not because of the fleet that's there or anything, just because it's close.In the film Tora Tora Tora, Japan planned and planned and planned, each member of the task force studying up on each and every ship that the United States held in the harbor. In "Pearl Harbor", Japan planned for a couple days and pretty much went ahead after their higher officers thought it was pretty much a good idea.And even after the bombing was over (and, again, thoroughly inaccurate), the movie didn't stop. Like a train full of manure, it needs a lot of track to come to a stop. This movie went on.All of the charaters we've so far come to know and dislike, are all still living without a scratch, having literally walked through the thick of the bombing. Everyone's given awards, lots of ceremonies, and then WHAMMO, we're heading to Japan to kick their ass.Please, people. I could go on, but I don't want to. The sun's out, it's a nice day, and I don't want to ruin it with any more talk of the worst film to hit theaters since Battlefield Earth. Spare yourselves, and read a book about the bombing if you absolutely have to get your WWII fix. Otherwise, just live life pretending that this movie never happened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: spoilers... however, they will only ruin the surprise if you do not know the outcome of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December of 1941, or have never seen another war movie or romance in your life. I promise you, nothing essential is given away.Despite well-documented evidence that the attack on Pearl Harbor was not unexpected (check out John Toland's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1983 book, "Infamy"), screenwriter Randall Wallace and director Michael Bay chose to represent the attack as a strategic move by the Japanese that caught the U.S. totally unsuspecting (except for one man... see section about Ackroyd's character below). In "Pearl Harbor," such historical accuracy has been sacrificed for the entertainment of the audience. For the sake of a good story, I can accept that... with a small caveat: the story has to be good enough that an educated audience can look past the historical errors and enjoy the plot for its own sake.The storyline of "Pearl Harbor" is, frankly, not good enough to overcome its accuracy weaknesses. The main plot, involving a war-time love triangle between Rafe (Affleck), Josh (Hartnett), and Evelyn (Beckinsale) is canned, contrived, and utterly predictable. Without giving away those all-too-crucial plot details, I will merely say that nearly every event in the movie is blatantly foreshadowed in some way. I am referring not, of course, to the historical event (PLOT SPOILER: WE GET BOMBED) but to the love story woven around (or rather, interrupted by) the attack on Pearl Harbor. If the movie patron has never seen a full-length feature film before, and is unaware of what a cliche is, it is possible that they would be surprised and entertained by "Pearl Harbor"'s outcome (Try playing the guess-what's-going-to-happen-next game). Subtlety is the key in foreshadowing, but is decidedly lacking in this movie.Affleck, Hartnett, and Beckinsale all give decent performances for what they have to work with. As for the supporting cast, Voight does a pretty good impression of FDR (with the make-up the resemblance to our only four-term president is quite striking). Kudos to Bay for including FDR's controversial wheelchair. Ackroyd plays the man-who-knows-what's-really-going-on-but-nobody-will-listen-to. His character's only apparent purpose is to appear in one scene and say, "I have a hunch they're going to bomb Pearl Harbor," to the deaf ears of his commanding officers ("The United States does not act on hunches.") The concept of a single man with the answer (um... cliche?) is laughable, as is Baldwin's overly dramatic, win-one-for-the-gipper, die-for-my-country, (cue heroic music) God-bless-America, the-children-are-our-future Captain Doolittle. Baldwin's character is so cliche that I found myself laughing out loud at nearly everything he said. For instance, he actually spoke the line, (to coin a phrase) "You remind me of myself fifteen years ago," after catching Rafe pulling a daredevil stunt over an airfield. Puh-leese.The film comes off as your typical, factory-made blockbuster. Do not see "Pearl Harbor" if you expect any sort of creative plot twists on your Hollywood war romance. (If you've seen "The Cider House Rules" you already know the general plot of the "love triangle.") The fact that Bay twisted the facts for the sake of a mediocre drama adds insult to injury. Do see "Pearl Harbor" if you like watching explosions. Do not see "Pearl Harbor" if you want to learn about the history of the United States' involvement in World War II. Do see "Pearl Harbor" if you want to see Cuba Gooding, Jr. take out a Japanese plane with an anti-aircraft gun that he was never taught how to use because of the racism inherent in the military. Do not see "Pearl Harbor" if overblown melodrama makes you cringe. Do see "Pearl Harbor" if you think Ben Affleck is hot and don't care whether he's in a good movie ("Good Will Hunting," "Dogma") or a bad one. Do not see "Pearl Harbor" (or at least skip the attack scenes) if you've seen "Saving Private Ryan" or "Titanic" because I promise you you've seen similar displays of dying soldiers and sinking ships before, but done better.My personal advice: if you want to see a good, intelligent movie, go see "Memento". If you want to see a good romance, I've heard "Moulin Rouge" is great. As for "Pearl Harbor," you might be better off to save your eight dollars and try to catch the Network Television Premiere in a couple of years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERSAnyone fancy a fat juicy steak sandwiched between two 4-pound slabs of icing sugar? Of course, if you're vegetarians, you won't even fancy the steak, but then again you probably wouldn't want to see this glorified piece of war movie hokum anyway. Me, I would have much preferred the steak on its own. Is there any possibility of a release of just the footage of the attack on Pearl Harbo(u)r itself? Please.Because the forty to forty five minute sequence involving the attack was spectacular in the extreme. The fx/action etc were everything you'd expect and more. Superlative.Sadly, the rest of the movie was so sickly sweet, laced with enough sugar to sink several hundred battleships and shovelled down your throat at frequent intervals throughout.Let's set all the quibbles about historical inaccuracies aside, because, let's face it, what war movie (or any 'factitious' movie!) doesn't have those? Bend the truth for dramatic license, by all means. But please oh please remember to look up the word dramatic in a dictionary.What are we left with? Well, a sort of Bermuda Love Triangle in which all sense of drama and plot are lost without trace. Predictable and strenuous to watch. A fraternal bond between two pilots inevitably broken when Pilot A is believed KIA (in his valiant one-man attempt to help our poor RAF boys win the Battle of Britain - where oh where would we have been without Ben Affleck?), Kate Beckinsale's bomb bay inevitably ends up loaded with her own Little Boy, by which time we know that Pilot B will die (heroically) and Ben Affleck will inevitably walk off into the sunset with a family Pilot B made earlier.All boring enough in and of itself.To this recipe though, we have to add enough patriotism to fuel several World War Twos, along with some questionable elements which don't sit comfortably at all. The movie highlights the sheer strategic folly of the then US Government, but in doing so it must make reasonably intelligent people wonder whether the intelligence people really were that much in the dark. It's easy to see where the blame is being laid, but where is the real guilt, I wonder? Then there is the portrayal of race relations in the US Navy which doesn't entirely ring true for America in the 40s, at least two decades in advance of Martin Luther King's struggle for equality. Things that make you go hm.Finally, there is a scene or two which depicts the whole campaign from the Japanese point of view, which are handled relatively sensibly and sensitively, even. However, within the context of all the sugar-coated stars n stripes and love candies, it only serves to highlight the sheer banality of this $139m bomb. Surely there is something of more substance to be said about the 3000 lives that were lost in this episode of history?What next?Perhaps a sweet-tooth romantic slushy epic, scored with stirring patriotic themes, and bearing the simple evocative and emotionally powerful title: Hiroshima. Please, God, no.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard this film was being made I was thrilled, but as rumors circulated, I began to fear this was not a war movie but a love story set around a major historical event (a la Titanic). Unfortunately, my fears proved correct. This is not a movie about Pearl Harbor (though the battle scenes are generally well done, even though there are far too many shots of modern ships being attacked for my tastes). Rather, it is a movie about a rather contrived love triangle, in which the only semi-appealing member suffers the worst fate. At just about three hours this film is at least 45 minutes too long, with an ending that appears tacked on. 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented Tora Tora Tora last night just to remind myself that there was a time when film makers could crank out a really good movie. I guess there's a good reason why Disney decided to replace most of the interesting build-up to the attack with a gawd awful soap opera. The film should have been called, "Nurses of Pearl Harbor." the night we saw this film there were about a dozen people in the theater. Maybe the word is out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once you get past the "Young and the Restless" this is a great movie for the WW II afficionado and history buff. While no one will say the movie is 100% historical fact, it was a noble effort. It's true that the Japanese seem a little too noble, it was after all a "sneak" attack, but we don't want to offend them do we? The American were larger than life, as all heros ought to be. The depiction of the carnage, the feeling of outrage, the desire to "get them back" is well portrayed by the pilots, the officers in charge and President Roosevelt. The preparations for the Doolittle raid are documented better than any movie since "30 Seconds over Tokyo". Actually, this is the only other movie that addresses this heroic raid. The "other" Pearl Harbor movie, "Tora, Tora, Tora" , was more documentary than movie and you were hard pressed to feel any emotion for any of the characters. Like "Titanic", everyone knows what happens how so you set this movie apart? A love story usually works. It certainly did with "Titanic". Rose and Jack were wonderful characters and you cared what happened to them. But the Rafe-Danny-Evelyn triangle is too contrived and just doesn't cut it. So to wrap this up, as a 50 something, whose father was a WW II Marine and who grew up with the outrage of the sneak attack, I think this was a worthy effort. I recommend this movie to everyone. While it may not be history (100% anyway) it IS entertaining.</fullReview>

That information would never have gotten to them because the ships were in radio silence. 3)Guided missile cruisers didn't exist then, however enough of them got bombed (Final countdown anyone). 4)Japanese ambassadors were waiting to see the president on Dec. 7th, the movie does not show this which takes away from the message they were delivering. 5)What ever happened to that flight of B-17's that they were expecting? In real life the B-17's showed up during the second wave and most were shot down by american guns. And one problem that I have with what actually happened at pearl harbor and they showed in the movie: All nurses getting purple hearts. The purple heart is for wounds received in combat. Not all nurses were hurt but, they still received purple hearts. There were still a few I missed but, can't think of right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor is from the folks who brought you that monument to mindlessness, Armageddon. This is even dumber .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl howler worth sinking &gt;Stunning special effects, but dull dialogue lacking subtlety Pearl Harbor Cert 12, 180 minsDisney was ominously reluctant to show Pearl Harbor to the critics. Now we can see why. It's ludicrously, uproariously awful - so bad that a packed audience at its first British screening last night laughed at most of the would-be serious moments. Yes, there are 40 minutes of exciting special effects when the Japanese finally attack, but the rest of the movie doesn't begin to justify its three hours, three minutes of screen timePearl Harbor is from the folks who brought you that monument to mindlessness, Armageddon. This is even dumber . No one expects subtlety or human interest from producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay. You are more likely to get massive explosions and a quasi-mystical belief in the cleansing nature of extreme violence. But the ?135m Pearl Harbor is quite staggeringly cynical, a shameless attempt to repeat the success of a quite different blockbuster, Titanic. For the first hour and a half before the special effects kick in, it's prettily photographed but utterly banal romantic fiction, with two childhood friends turned fighter-pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) falling for the same nurse (Kate Beckinsale). Ben leaves for England to join the Battle of Britain and goes missing, presumed dead, by everyone except the audience. Then he returns on cue, just in time to experience the carnage at Pearl Harbor in December 1941 when the Japanese navy notoriously attacked America's Pacific Fleet at anchor in Hawiai.Whereupon Franklin D Roosevelt (Jon Voight) rallies the nation, and Ben and Josh avenge their dead colleagues in a daring bombing raid over Tokyo, the importance of which is mightily exaggerated in order to end the movie on a positive, war-winning note, without reference to such minor unpleasantnesses as Nagasaki or Hiroshima. Notable by its absence is any attempt to discover why America was so unprepared. There is no hint that the American authorities had prior knowledge of the Japanese bombing raid, although evidence has recently come to light which suggests they did, and negligently ignored it. But let historians attack the movie in their own way. This film isn't really about the Second World War, or love, or indeed any aspect of reality. It's about copying the successful bits in other movies. When the Japanese planes swoop down on the American navy, they are just like Luke and Han Solo attacking Darth Vader in Star Wars. The sinking of an American warship is shot in a way that creates echoes of Titanic. When the Japanese shoot at Americans underwater, you know that the director has been studying Spielberg's equivalent shots in Saving Private Ryan. Randall Wallace's screenplay is equally secondhand and far more third-rate. It plunders most of the known clichés from other war films, and gives the leading actors little to do except look glamorous . This they duly do, but not even Kate Beckinsale can breathe life into her dialogue, which requires her to be little more than pretty and dull. The most striking performance is given by Jon Voight although the filmmakers treat him with such obsequious reverence that the last half-hour degenerates into the same gung-ho patriotism that made so many critics queasy about Bruckheimer's first militaristic hit, Top Gun. It wasn't the jingoism that upset me about the film, however. It was its affectless approach to violence. Whereas Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan used modern special effects to recreate what it must have felt like to be in the Normandy landings, Messrs Bay and Bruckheimer seem concerned only to capture the adrenaline rush of bombing defenceless American servicemen. Spielberg's approach was deeply felt and humane. The second approach reduces war to spectacle, carnage to a computer game. Maybe this won't concern American audiences out for a cheap thrill at their local multiplex; but it concerned me. At least Titanic had some pretensions to a moral message, about the folly of a hubristic pride in technology. Pearl Harbor the movie is itself a product of that same hubristic pride, the idea that superior special effects can distract audiences from a woeful screenplay and a cast whose main achievement is to speak the unbelievably crass dialogue with a straight face. I can only hope the public can see through the hype and treat this film with the contempt it deserves. There is nothing in these movie-makers' heads except the urge to make a fast buck. And the crucial question to bear in mind when watching this movie is: Does it honour the memory of those who died at Pearl Harbor? Or does it give audiences a perverted thrill from watching them die?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a great film!(Contains Spoilers!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Contains Spoilers!)What a great film...if you want to show off what a 140 million dollar budget and a good special effects crew can get you. As far as its quality as a movie, it was a big, steaming pile of crap!Let me break it down for you in basic terms. The soap opera storyline was insanely boring, stale, and fairly predictable, and the characters were flat. The actors brought nothing dynamic to their characters, either. The exception was the always-great Cuba Gooding, Jr., who was very underused. However, considering that African-Americans weren't allowed to play very major roles in the military during WWII, it is understandable. The special effects during the battle, however, were amazing, I will give them credit for that.I imagine there was some sort of meeting between Bruckheimer and Bay about their next movie after Armageddon. They probably thought for all of five minutes, decided that to make more money, they need bullets and bombs, and quickly settled for WWII, and, more specifically, Pearl Harbor. Then there was the question of how to appeal to the widest demographic. Since bombs and bullets pretty much covered the guys, they probably threw a love story in there for the women, and an African American character for African-Americans. Was Dorie Miller an important part? Of course, but did they give him as much coverage as the two main characters, or, for that matter, as much as he deserved? No, which suggests to me that they threw him in there for the demographic, as his part was far from fully developed.Does it stack up to "Saving Private Ryan?" Hell no, and to suggest it is ridiculous. The characters in "Ryan" are more three-dimensional, and the actors were better as well. "Ryan" shows that you can make a damn good three hour war movie that doesn't need to pander to the masses and still be commercially successful. The action in "Ryan," while not as expensive, was much more realistic. "Pearl Harbor" fell prey to the "Episode One" syndrome, in that they overdid the special effects to the point where they were far from realistic. On top of it, "Pearl Harbor" was rated PG-13, as opposed to "Ryan," which was rated R, showing that it didn't pull any punches with its graphic nature. Blame it on Disney, the "family-friendly" studio who probably didn't want "blood" and "gore" attached to their project, or, "realism." The PG-13 rating once again suggests that they wanted to appeal to as wide an audience as possible and skip that pesky under 17, R-rated policy to grab as many teenagers as possible.And how bad was the story itself? Aside from what the trailers and teasers gave away, it was very predictable. As soon as Evelyn told Rafe she would give her heart to Danny, but still love him, you knew that Danny was going to die and Rafe was going to live. How? Well, first of all, Ben Affleck is the main character, and Josh Hartnett is the supporting character. Ben Affleck is considered the bigger sex symbol, so to appease the majority of women, he, of course, gets the girl. It's typical sappy love story crap. Of course, in this movie, as opposed to a love story, it doesn't fit. It is also hard to believe that with the seemingly hundreds of planes in Pearl Harbor, only two were scrambled, and because it's what people like to see, both are piloted by the heroes. I'm not an expert in Pearl Harbor history, so it may have been true that only two made it.So, the final verdict? Bruckheimer and Bay made this movie for the money, and have lost their artistic integrity as far as I am concerned, as well as my respect. The problem was that they spent way too much money on the special effects, and not enough on the story. On top of it, they seemed to have forgotten that they were dealing with a historic event, and they do not have the right to change events to make the movie more entertaining for the masses.Final Verdict - 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be required viewing for anyone 13-40</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is actually two movies: a sappy love story that is totally useless (until the last five minutes, then it's all worth it), and a gripping, intense dramatization of the real life horror of Pearl Harbor. The director does an outstanding job of depicting the terror of the situation, without resorting to "severed limbs" tactics. I was especially impressed with the use of the "halo-like haze" in the hospital scenes. One gets the impression that, under such extreme circumstances, that may well have been just how the doctors and nurses saw it. He also pays excellent attention to details of that fateful morning. Ben Affleck is okay, but the real star is Josh Hartnett. His affable character and boyish shyness make him the hero of the story as much or more than his courageous deeds. Cuba Gooding, Jr. plays the best (albeit a small) part as a young black soldier, fiercely and lovingly loyal to his country and his commander in what were for blacks in the 1940s Navy very difficult circumstances. His poignant words of comfort to his dying Captain, and again later at the flag-draped casket, are some of the most memorable scenes of the film. As I said, this movie should be required viewing for anyone between 13 and 35 (I'm 36), lest we forget (or worse yet, ignore) the horrible, bloody cost of the freedom we enjoy. Here in Tennessee, we have a state representative who refuses to say the Pledge of Allegiance in the House Chambers. I'd like to sit her @#% down and make her watch this film, then explain to her that the flag she says represents "oppression" represents a country in which she was free to be elected!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I want my nine dollars back" was all I really intended to say in this review but apparently I HAVE to write four lines in order to have my review included so here goes... contrived "love" story, wooden acting on the part of the three leads, painfully lame dialogue, cliche upon cliche, apparent attempts at "Spielbergian" moments that fall flat, a superficial cast of one-note nurses that belong in a sit com. Poorly written, poorly directed, poorly edited. Yes the attack was on a grand scale but I was completely emotionally detached from all the carnage -- maybe because I didn't give a hoot about the characters or maybe because it was just too special effectsy to make the horror feel real. (Unlike the beach battle scene in "Saving Private Ryan" during which I was shaking like a leaf and could barely look at the screen from behind my hands.) -- There WAS one really, REALLY good moment in Pearl Harbor. The scene with Cuba Gooding and the Captain -- real and powerful and ripped my heart out. Too bad the whole movie wasn't as good as that simple, single moment. In short, in my humble opinion you should do yourself a favor, rent "The Longest Day", "Bridge on The River Kwai", "Empire of the Sun" and watch the opening beach battle scene (and tank scene too) in "Ryan" instead and save your ticket and popcorn money for a well crafted film like "With a friend like Harry" :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although not as scrupulously researched as Richard Fleischer's 1970 TORA! TORA! TORA!, this highly energetic historical actioner boasts virtues which far outweigh its flaws. I found the love story a bit sappy, not up to the standard of Jim Cameron's affectatious TITANIC, and the battle sequences were overly loaded with quick cutting and actors screaming at each other. And drop-dead gorgeous nurses performing medical exams on military recruits? Please. Only in your dreams, pal. Military nurses had other things to do, like taking care of sick and wounded personnel in the hospitals. And why does no one smoke? Tobacco use was ubiquitous among men and women of all ages at the time.The love story, in fact, seems to have come right out of William Wellman's 1927 WINGS, with Richard Arlen and Buddy Rogers--two American flyers in WWI vying for the affections of Clara Bow. No spoiler intended, but PEARL HARBOR resolves the romantic triangle in a nearly identical fashion.The good stuff, however, is simply transcendent. Some of the special effects are jaw-dropping beautiful. All 45 thousand tons of battleship USS ARIZONA seem to leap out of the water as she explodes from a Japanese bomb deep in the entrails of her ammunition magazine. Even better, and far sadder, is the slow, excrutiating death of battleship USS OKLAHOMA, as she gracefully, achingly capsizes. The water around OKLAHOMA is strewn with the bodies of dozens of drowned sailors just as the battleship's oversized holiday flag slowly unfurls just below the surface of the water. Navy welders work furiously to cut holes into the thick armor of the capsized battleship and rescue trapped crewmembers inside, only to speed the death of some by venting air out of flooding compartments. Welders manage to open holes just large enough so that drowning sailors can thrust their hands into the open for a few seconds, grasp welders' hands, and then succumb back into the flooded darkness.The best, I thought, were the hospital sequences depicting military nurses who just simply wanted to run off in hysterics, but grimly took on the task of sorting out mounting casualties for treatment. The hospital scenes were so chaotic, and the resolution of the nurses and doctors so intense, they reminded me of the Omaha beach sequence of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.Well done, Michael Bay. I hope to see this one again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I attended this movie with my husband, my son and his wife, and all four of us really enjoyed the entire movie. I think the critics forget one crucial thing - movies are primarily ENTERTAINMENT, and this film is both a sweet love story and an excellent action film. We didn't mind the length at all - in fact, the last 90 minutes slipped by so fast we were disappointed that it was over!!!Ben Affleck is always absolutely believable in whatever part he plays, and he was excellent as Rafe. Relative unknown Josh Hartnett was pretty good as his buddy Danny, I think that with more experience he will be a fine actor. The other actors and actresses were well cast and well directed, and all fit their parts well. We especially enjoyed Jon Voigt as FDR and Alec Baldwin as the infamous Doolittle.The action scenes were excellent, though heart-rending at times - particularly the Arizona scenes. We ladies had our tissues out for almost the entire second half of the movie, and we caught the guys with a tear or two in their eyes, as well.If you are prepared to sit back, relax and let a movie take you where IT wants to go, rather than where the critics THINK it should go, please see this movie - you will enjoy it. We four unanimously give it a score of 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointing Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After viewing the trailer for Pearl Harbor, I looked forward to seeing what promised to be a visually stunning portrayal of the Japanese attack of Dec. 7, 1941. While the movie does provide some breathtaking visual moments, that is about the only good thing that can be said for it. Apparently, Jerry Bruckheimer and company were more interested in creating a sappy love story that would (they hope) reproduce the success of Titanic, than in accurately portraying the events surrounding Pearl Harbor. The movie's central love triangle is so silly and predictable that it seems better suited to a romance novel than anything else. Kate Beckinsale, Ben Affleck, and Josh Hartnett are all capable actors, but their complete lack of chemistry, combined with the godawful lines they are forced to utter, made it impossible for me to care one whit what happened to any of them</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great War Scenes, Crappy Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has some incredible war scenes. The integration of action and CGI seems flawless and it is truly worth seeing the movie for the 45 minutes or action. However, the love story is very contrived and border-line ridiculous. After seeing the movie, I thought the love story should have been on Jerry Springer. Character development is a little slow, but a decent performance by Affleck does good. Alec Baldwin does way too much over-acting. Dont expect too much when you see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie with action sequences but bad romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor I thought was a good movie. The movie follows the lives of two best friends, Danny, played by Josh Hartnett (Virgin Suicides) and Rafe, played by Ben Affleck (Good Will Hunting). Coincidentally they both fall in love with the same girl, played by Kate Beckinsale. It soon turns out to be an almost soap-opera like love triangle which to me is too ridiculous. Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy) gives one of the most realistic portrayals and best performance as President Roosevelt. Also Alec Baldwin (The Shadow) gave a good performance as the head aviation commander. The movie also stars many other famous stars such as Cuba Gooding Jr., Dan Aykroyd, and Tom Seizmore. Pearl Harbor probably had to be one of the best movies on Pearl Harbor because of the realistic dogfights, the special effects, and the acting, especially Jon Voight's. Unfortunately the romance segments of the movie are stupid and pointless. If I were the director, I would try to keep the romance parts of the movie to a bare minimum. There are also, many fast camera movements during the attack on Pearl Harbor, which I liked. I am also surprised it got a PG-13 rating. The bombing of Pearl Harbor was pretty violent and bloody. Overall, I recommend this movie to everyone, but just skip the romance part of the movie. Other than that, you will like it.7/10 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War, What is it Good for?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a bunch of resourceful folk the Americans are! Run out of medical markers? No problem, we'll use our lipsticks. Guns too heavy to be placed in fighter planes? What's to worry about, we can use broomsticks and paint them black, thus fooling those Japanese foe. If Pearl Harbor is anything to go by, America single handedly triumphed in the face of adversity and saved the world from the wrath of Nazi nihilism. Yet, how could the most expensive movie in cinema history manage to take a tragedy like Pearl Harbor and turn it into a cold, prosaic, limp story?The plot can be summed up in a brief sentence. Two best buddies fall in love with the same woman, go to war, Pearl Harbor gets bombed, one friend gets killed and they live happily ever after? Nothing more! It takes three hours for Michael Bay to tell a story that Mills &amp; Boon's would shun with disgust. Bay tells his tale with all the grace of an overlong car advert, replete with slow motion shots and over saturated lighting (did they polish the negative of this film with Mr. Sheen?)So what do you get for your money? Well, there is the actual bombing which is impressive, but never exciting. How can it be when you don't care about the fate of any of the characters. Bay attempts to throw you into the action, but you feel absolutely no attachment to the events depicted, you sit back and watch the money thrown against the screen. Unlike Saving Private Ryan, where the first thing the audience is thrust into is full out war, Pearl Harbor waits almost two hour until the events ensue. By this point you're so fed up with the movie you just want all of the protagonists to explode along with the bombs. The Stars and Stripes shine with all their might and never lose their patina as shrapnel flies all over the place. In fact, Ben Affleck's hair never loses its gleam as all hell breaks lose. This is war Hollywood style!It's true to say Pearl Harbor has no heart. It's a testimony to how Hollywood has managed to turn the simple art of filmmaking into a commodity. Having seen how Titanic succeeded in making money out of an actual tragedy, Jerry Bruckheimer took all the ingredients of that film (including love story, long-length and a British actress playing the all American girl) and rehashed it. Ultimately, all the failures of the former are epitomised here, apart from this is worse because the novelty has gone. This film is like the new range of DKNY sunglasses: it exists to make money. For God's sake, look how they've re-edited the film for Japanese and German markets. If this film really had any thing say about the atrocities of December 7th 1941, it would never shy away from profoundly expressing the horror of war. Instead, it knows by blocking out these lucrative foreign markets it stands to never recoup its money. Alas, this is all it boils down to.What's hurtful are Evelyn's (Kate Beckinsdale) final lines `America suffered and grew stronger? through trial we overcame.' Do the words Hiroshima or Nagasaki mean anything to Bay and Bruckheimer? The carnage of America is completely forgotten. But I guess to the people watching the film in some fleabag cinema in Ohio, this is irrelevant. They want to be reminded of what a great nation of people they are; not how they vaporised a civilian population. Enjoy guy's? just hand over the cash, sit back and let them tarnish all historical accuracy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be required viewing for anyone 13-40</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is actually two movies: a sappy love story that is totally useless (until the last five minutes, then it's all worth it), and a gripping, intense dramatization of the real life horror of Pearl Harbor. The director does an outstanding job of depicting the terror of the situation, without resorting to "severed limbs" tactics. I was especially impressed with the use of the "halo-like haze" in the hospital scenes. One gets the impression that, under such extreme circumstances, that may well have been just how the doctors and nurses saw it. He also pays excellent attention to details of that fateful morning. Ben Affleck is okay, but the real star is Josh Hartnett. His affable character and boyish shyness make him the hero of the story as much or more than his courageous deeds. Cuba Gooding, Jr. plays the best (albeit a small) part as a young black soldier, fiercely and lovingly loyal to his country and his commander in what were for blacks in the 1940s Navy very difficult circumstances. His poignant words of comfort to his dying Captain, and again later at the flag-draped casket, are some of the most memorable scenes of the film. As I said, this movie should be required viewing for anyone between 13 and 35 (I'm 36), lest we forget (or worse yet, ignore) the horrible, bloody cost of the freedom we enjoy. Here in Tennessee, we have a state representative who refuses to say the Pledge of Allegiance in the House Chambers. I'd like to sit her @#% down and make her watch this film, then explain to her that the flag she says represents "oppression" represents a country in which she was free to be elected!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was as well written as it was grandly performed! I'm being sarcastic. The actors were about as emotionally into the film as the props. Ben was a major source of "ear-sore" from the beginning, to his very predictable reappearance in the third quarter of the movie. Hartnett's character, "Danny" was played out pretty well, but the love-triangle was as predictable as Rafe's reappearance, and nearly as annoying. But, what sane girl is going to say she minded looking at Josh Hartnett for three hours! he played his part and did a better job than most of the other cast, considering the corny writing he had to deal with. Kate Beckinsale played her part, but that was about it. The writers definitely set her apart from the other nurses in order to make her a lead character. She had a level head, almost a "motherly-figure" to her companion nurses. Once again, we ALL could have lived without the sappy, ongoing love story. The Writers and directors should have spent more time detailing the history, and less time worrying about Evelyn's "boy trouble".I would have liked to have seen more action. I was impressed, however, with how long the Bombing SEEMED to take. There was no emotion attached to the deaths we viewed during the bombing, a major downfall of the movie. All of the main characters narrowly escaped being killed, while many extras "lost their lives".I really could have done without the Doolittle scene. It made the movie seem even more long and drawn out. And, of course, our little farm-boys-turned-aces were both put right in the middle.it was not a good movie, but I recommend that people watch it for kicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read all of these reviews saying how Pearl Harbor didn't pay tribute to our war vets, and how the romance is sappy, the script is pathetic, etc... but I must say that I still enjoyed the film. It all depends on what you are looking for. I came into this movie not expecting a film like SavingPR, or Glory, or any other great war movie; I was expecting a summer blockbuster and that is exactly what I got. Sure, the bombing in between the romance was kind of akward, and they should have ended it after Pearl Harbor and not have gone into the Doolittle raid (and spared us 45 min), but I was glad to get out of the heat for 3 hours. The acting was pretty good; Ben Affleck pulled off the cocky fighter well, and Kate Beckinsale was fair as the nurse Evelyn, even if she did cry every other scene. Josh Hartnett, I thought, was amazing as Danny Walker, and did his best w/the dialouge he was given. I wouldn't be surprised at all if he becomes a major star. I agree w/the one review however, that said how everyone kept talking about how heroic the characters were. I got sick of hearing how great they were, too.Ahhh what the heck, c'mon people. Its a big summer blockbuster and thats what you get. No great war movie, but worth the money and time to see. It's called entertainment, not great art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't miss this movie because you heard that the history is inaccurate, or that the love story is poorly told, or that the characters are cardboard. These opinions may or may not be yours (they're not mine), but nevertheless, "Pearl Harbor" should be seen because of the impressive attack sequence.I've heard that some of the veterans of Pearl Harbor who have seen this movie thought the attack appeared a bit over-the-top, which is probably true, but it does do an excellent job of conveying the sadness, helplessness, and confusion of the event, of seeing all the destruction and wounds inflicted and lives lost, in particular the drowning of all those people trapped within the Arizona. What an emotionally intense sequence, and I can only imagine how much more magnified these emotions were of the people who were actually there.The love story was so-so; you do empathize with the characters. But, it doesn't really relate to the actual attack or serve any grand purpose in relation to the war. Rather, the relationships were explored only as book-ends (beginning and end), and that's probably why it doesn't seem to work very well. That, and I felt that the triangle was a bit... twisted.So, check out "Pearl Harbor" for the actual event itself. For the attack sequence alone, this movie is worth watching. You do get a love story on the side, which you may or may not enjoy, plus some extra patriotism (for Americans) with the Doolittle Raid retaliatory airstrike thrown in there, as well as a nice portrayal of the great President Roosevelt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, although a bit long.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbour is the second major "summer movie"(after moulin rouge) here in NZ(where it is winter). I saw it at an advance screening where it was shown on all 12 screens at the local multiplex,(starting time delayed by 30 mins).Pearl Harbour was, for the most part what I expected. Average love story, based around the beginnings of the war for america, climaxing in the bombing of Pearl Harbour, with what I thought (may be considered a slight spoiler) an unnecessary afternote causing what was a bad ending to an otherwise good movie.There is quite a large cast in Pearl Harbour, with the main characters of Affleck, Harnett, and Beckinsale taking centre stage with the love triangle which drives along through the movie.I love Bruckheimer productions, as they are generally fun, action packed movies however Pearl Hrbour is slightly different, being based on fact. I saw a startiling resemblance to Armageddon, however, as the story set up is quite similar,this is both good and bad. Good: respectfully tackles a true life event Bad: as with Armageddon goes on too longThe length was the only real problem in this blockbuster. I could get passed the flag waving and historical simplifications(what else would you expect from such a movie?). But the length and ending caused my opinion of the movie to change ('slight spoiler' the film makers could not just leave it as america being defeated at Pearl Harbour could they?)Anyway, for blockbuster entertainment about a sad historical event the movie is quite good, and despite what critics say, worth seeing. **** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another galling example of how film producers are misguiding the punters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, where to start? Firstly, let me be fair: this is not a bad film. It is however symptomatic of a period in Hollywood film-making where historically based subjects are being dealt without the care that they deserve. The fact remains that films like Saving Private Ryan (which I generally thought was excellent), U-571 (appalling, dreadful and insulting) and now Pearl Harbour misrepresent almost all of the parties involved in the events that they describe.Certainly, an amount of story-telling is required, but so many incredible acts of bravery have come out of World War Two that the need to invent more beggars belief. I am doing a history degree and my grandparents fought for Britain and the Allies in the Second World War. I understand that the film is being toned down for German and Japanese audiences, for the sake of me retching in the aisle, could the editors consider toning down some of the America-saves-the-day heroics and marginalisation of the European effort for our sakes?As for the likes of Braveheart and The Patriot, don't even get me started. Needless to say they were so historically inaccurate as to be slanderous.OK, toys are back in the pram, I have had my little moan. As for the film, the special effects were awesome, but the love story was unconvincing - Kate Beckinsale just came across as a Slapper, the dialogue floated between corny and wooden, and some of the acting was distinctly average - though Voight as Roosevelt deserves special mention.If you are American, go and see it and feel proud, noble and invulnerable. If you are not, then have a look if you want but I, for one, came out with nothing but a sense of shame that comes from knowing that millions of school children are going to believe that that is how war actually happened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 3 Hr instruction video on how NOT to make a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I would like to congrat you on a great Website, I have been using it for years and it has just got better by the day.Well now for the bad news....The film! I will try to keep it nice and short and to the point, not like the film director.I watched the trailer last year with my wife and we both agreed that this was going to be a really good film. After the hype and build up it eventually arrived. I was a little disapointed that it was aimed at being a love story but my wife was pretty chuffed.We paid our five pound fifty and we sat down ready to witness the marvel of the year. Little did I know that I would be sitting there for a good hour until the action started.The film starts with the traditional build up and get to know the characters etc... but this seemed to enjoy stretching the whole thing out. I could of accepted a love story as I always get my way with the choice of films so it was about time my wife got a treat and watched a great love story. The only problem is that the hour long intro was totally pathetic and unbelieveable. It is not often I catch myself staring at the ceiling waiting for a film to finish, and then to look over and see my wife doing the same. We both looked at each other and both wished that the film would just get on with it.Then came the part where the film title had a meaning ie "Pearl Harbour", this was where the film remembered what it was about and got on with the story. To be honest you could of just arrived at this point and still felt like you had watched a complete movie.I then gripped my seat ready for a jaw drop, but it didnt! I wont say the effects were bad, in fact they were very good. My problem was that they were nothing new, there was no new ground breaking FX's being displayed here at all. Surely this was a perfect opportunity to display the next generation of FX's? I have unfortunately got very bored with the same old CGI FX's and I strongly welcome a good jaw drop, but not here I am afraid.Please dont get me wrong though, the attack was by far the best bit of the film and it was a pleasure to finally get to the point after an hour of watching paint dry.The planes attacked, the nurses helped the injured and the two heroes got into the air to "save the day (ish)". Oh, and I think Cuba Goddard Jnr was in the film too!? (What a waste of a talent)Well after being entertained at the attack something strange happened, I seemed to have blinked then magically moved to another cinema and found myself watching a sequel to the film "Pearl Harbour".Somehow after the attack, the film then decided to gloss around the reality of the event and just fast forward to the bit where the yanks try to revenge the attack. There was little aftermath, no lesson learning, very little mourning and no summary of what had just happened. The film just seemed to completely start up again where it should of finished and begin telling a completely different story. It was just incredible to witness this strange technique in film making.Well it ended with the Yanks having a little pointless go back at the japs before coming to a close. Naturally after all that had happened the film just had to finish with the cliche explanation commentry using a womans voice, very cheesy.In summary:1. Very stretched out love story that didnt work. 2. The Yanks getting a pasting by the Japs. 3. A very stretched and misplaced ending trying to make you feel like the Yanks did okay after all. 4. Very cheeseball and predictable end to the "Love triangle".My rating: 3/10 for the middle bit, nothing for the rest.Lesson learnt: Never waste such a great and memorable topic ever again. For half the price the story of Pearl Harbour could of been told more honestly, factually and with much much more feeling. Big bucks do not make a good film as shown here, but it is just such a pity that this chance was wasted. What I dont understand is that when all these movie business people sit around the table, well surely one of them must see that it is badly constructed, scripted and directed, but why is nothing said to stop them making this expensive mistake?Top tip: Save your money and go and see something else!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This really does leave no cliche unsaid and no trite cinematic plot device unused. I sat through the first hour with friends, several of whom said they were going to leave (but didn't) and we weren't the only ones snorting into our popcorn with disbelief or guffawing at quite incredibly banal lines. How Kate Beckinsale got mixed up in this I don't know, she is a very highly educated woman (even if her father was a Seventies sitcom star)- the money I suppose, that is usually it. When she said some really awful line I half expected her to turn to the camera and give a knowing wink at times.That said, I have to give it to ILM, the attack scenes are brilliant, especially the shot following the bomb down, if cartoonish and I'm not sure it was possible to fly planes that close to the ground or close together without wind shear causing upsets, but no matter for that section of the film I was transfixed.The film is very easy on the Japanese who were a fascist military dictatorship who did after all attack without declaring war and whilst still talking peace.Some gripes, the whole cinema here laughed when (over a siren sounding the all clear not the alert) the newsreel spoke of Hitler's Luftwaffe bombing 'downtown London' (it just sounds very odd to British ears), Roosevelt's cabinet members talked of giving aid to Russia before it was in the war (the US did give the UK help before it joined the war but made us pay handsomely for it) and I just couldn't get Ewen Bremner's 'Trainspotting' role out of my mind when seeing him in this. This was the first and probably last raid there ever was on US citizens in what was very nearly US territory, but I think US audiences should remember London had raids like this almost daily in 1940/41 and continuing for years after (the last German bomb to fall on London was in March 1945!).If you go to this with the right attitude of healthy scepticism and an ear for irony (not something our American counsins are always good at)you'll probably have a good time. If not, for European audiences it is far too cloyingly sentimental. Voight will probably get Best Supporting Oscar for Roosevelt though.*Possible Spoiler*More than a few of the London audience fell about laughing at the end when Affleck came out of the plane and looked back to let his eyes follow a coffin out of the plane. To his credit he looked as if he was having difficulty keeping a straight face too...........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read all of these reviews saying how Pearl Harbor didn't pay tribute to our war vets, and how the romance is sappy, the script is pathetic, etc... but I must say that I still enjoyed the film. It all depends on what you are looking for. I came into this movie not expecting a film like SavingPR, or Glory, or any other great war movie; I was expecting a summer blockbuster and that is exactly what I got. Sure, the bombing in between the romance was kind of akward, and they should have ended it after Pearl Harbor and not have gone into the Doolittle raid (and spared us 45 min), but I was glad to get out of the heat for 3 hours. The acting was pretty good; Ben Affleck pulled off the cocky fighter well, and Kate Beckinsale was fair as the nurse Evelyn, even if she did cry every other scene. Josh Hartnett, I thought, was amazing as Danny Walker, and did his best w/the dialouge he was given. I wouldn't be surprised at all if he becomes a major star. I agree w/the one review however, that said how everyone kept talking about how heroic the characters were. I got sick of hearing how great they were, too.Ahhh what the heck, c'mon people. Its a big summer blockbuster and thats what you get. No great war movie, but worth the money and time to see. It's called entertainment, not great art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of the most laughable I've seen in years.Contains Spoilers!!!Rafe and Danny have been friends since childhood, and have dreamed of someday being pilots. years later there dreams come true and they are posted to Hawaii, thought to be the last place the war would reach While there the two guys meet Evelyn a local hospital nurse and she falls for Rafe. but not long after their romance begins,Rafe in lists to join up with the British R.A.F, so he can see some action. While fighting the Nazi over Britain, Rafe is shot down and thought to be dead.(obviously Rafe forgot about that new invention THE TELEPHONE!!!) Believing Rafe to be dead, Evelyn slowly becomes more friendly with Danny until they begin seeing each other. Then all of a sudden Rafe appears back from the dead, obviously a little miffed that his girlfriend did'nt waste much time jumping into bed with his best mate. The obvious arguing and punch up ensues until they come to some buddy, buddy understanding. Not before time! early next morning The Japanese attack, and over some forty minutes reduce the American navy to ashes. To try and hit back the Americans send a team of pilots Including Rafe and Danny to bomb tokyo (must have missed this in the history books!) Obviously Im not going to ruin the ending, but it wont really matter, if your like me you'll be holding your sides, which hurt so much from laughing. The dialogue sounds as if it were from a trashy romance novel, and the characters are utterly two dimensional. The special effect were brilliant although it seamed a little strange that so may seamen where still sleeping in there beds while the ship which is anchored right next to them is being torn appart!!!! This movie is a typical Hollywood blockbuster. high on action, low on logic and plotting. And as ever the Americans go around saying things like "god bless America" making the rest of us wanting to reach for the vomit bags!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*What* a goddamn stinker!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer for "Pearl Harbor" left me in virtually no doubt that I would love it, weep over it, etc. The opening scene of the movie did nothing to prove me wrong - it's a brilliantly scored, brilliantly shot scene between the two "brothers" who will (unfortunately) become Josh Hartnett and Ben Affleck, and a fight with a father who served in World War I, where he saw plenty he wished he hadn't. It's like warning about the movie, really... I didn't take the hint.The scene left me in no doubt that before the movie was out, I'd have shed many a tear. But when a movie is *so* bad in its first hour or so that you begin wishing the Japs would just *drop the bomb, for god's sake!*, it means one of two things: 1) I have ADD; or 2) Alert, we have a stinker here."Pearl Harbor" is "Jerry Bruckheimer: The Clip Show". It's two movies in one, with enough good moments to fit on one hand, in which anyone with slight movie knowledge (and let's face it, the guy only does blockbusters) can recognise such movies as "Crimson Tide", "Armageddon", "Top Gun", and "The Rock". What are the good moments? Alright, I'll list them:The first scene: loved it. It was a nice turnaround when the kid called the father "German," and the fact that no more violence intervened made it absolutely clear how he felt about that word.Cuba Gooding Jr.: The best actor in the movie by far, in two of his (not many more) scenes with the captain of his ship. First, he is told the ship is proud of him, and it bounces off his face wonderfully. Then, as the captain dies, he is placed in full command of the ship, but he tells the captain before the last breath "Everyone's where they should be - you trained us great." Loved it. Also, Cuba's face when firing the gun. I swear, against Hartnett and Affleck and anyone else, Hollywood needs more actors like Cuba Gooding Jr. who aren't afraid to expose some real emotion onscreen.Most of the hospital stuff - very raw, very real. The key moment is when Kate Beckinsale forces herself to take control, and grabs a nervous doctor and says *so* firmly it almost got those tears from me, "Doctor- look at me - what do you need?"Okay, technically all those won't fit on my hand, but that's about all there is folks. I know I can be really brutal on this movie because if you're taking issue with my words, you'll go and see the movie just to prove me wrong. I wish I had the strength to not go to Summer movies, but y'know, we just have to.So "Pearl Harbor" absolutely stinks in my opinion. In parts it flows like a really bad soap opera (complete with Patrick Duffy style character resurrections), in parts like a simple compilation of the best of Bruckheimer.Most striking of all is that in contrast to all the criticism of Hollywood being too "American" regarding historical movies, in this effort, the Americans are presented as a self-pitying, stupid, stuttering, nerve-jangling useless bunch of preppies. All, surely, to build that suspense for the bombing scenes (I'm sure I wasn't the only one who smiled when realisation dawned that *Action's finally approaching!* -- believe me, you *want* the Americans to lay down and die after the first hour). The love story is laughable, the score is mostly good but headachingly repetitive sampling chunks of "The Thin Red Line" and Bruckheimer's other hits, the actors are... well, simply put, the actors are no Tom Cruises or Gene Hackmans or Sean Connery. Bruckheimer has to realise that he has a package that doesn't yield to tinkering. Leave the serious stuff to Spielberg, keep the story, sure, but fill it with decent actors as usual. *Please*!As to the battle scenes, if that's why you're going - don't bother. I read one magazine saying "you've never seen anything like it" - well, that's a lie, it's all been seen before. The only unique shot is the one you've seen, the POV shot from the bomb going down on Pearl Harbor. Everything else is like a video game. This is *not* the zenith of CGI, that won't happen until a good director uses them to realise a good script. If you can, resist seeing this movie. I'm so pleased that the average user rating on this site is lower than I expected it to be. It shows there's sense in the world. We deserve better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pearl Harbor" is worth seeing, no matter what you may have heard. There is a love story which takes up a major portion of beginning of the film but there is enough history in it to keep your interest. The historical details of the film are good for the most part, however there are some major problems here and there. The first one I noticed was the uniforms of the U.S. This uniform used for this film was wrong. There had been some changes to it in the late 1930's when the army air corp was beginning its transition to becoming the USAF in the late 40's. The second major problem was the ability of Ben Affleck's character of Rafe, being able to go to England and fight in the RAF's Eagle squadron as an activity duty U.S. officer in 1940. This could not happen as the U.S. and nearly 50 other countries had signed a neutrality treaty before World War I. This practice was strictly prohibited. The third significant problem was the character of Admiral Kimmal of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. He was not concerned with the Pearl being attacked and in fact, NO ONE was concerned at all. At that time in history, it was considered far too difficult to take two carrier groups over 4000 nautical miles and hit Pearl. The fourth major problem was the character of Jappannese Admiral Yammamoto. He was portrayed as just a leader and almost seemed an after thought. In fact, he was the most brilliant stratagist and one of the best leaders the Japannese had. His planning of his attack on Pearl was painstakingly detailed and planned. There were also some minor problem, but ones that could not have been avoided, such as the visible features on the Japannese carriers that are only seen on our Nimitz Class carriers. The biggiest problem I had with the film was the love story. They spent way too much time on it and it detracted, severely from the story of Pearl Harbor. They should have cut nearly 45 minutes of the love story and concentrated more on the planning of the attack on Pearl and Dolittle's raid on Japan. This would have made the film much better and would have given more feeling and/or meaning to the film. It appeared to me that Bay and company failed to realize that Pearl Harbor really "means" something to Americans, especially to the Vets. Overall, worth your while (7 out of 10).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It may seem unfair for one to review this movie without having seen it but the typical Hollywood hype has caused virtually all of us to have "experienced" this trashy film before it was even released. As an historian, I admit to being a harsh critic when it comes to making a movie about a real historic event. Tora Tora Tora was an excellent re-creation of the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, but this movie is grossly inaccurate. I find it amusing to read reviews of this movie. It was loved by younger viewers (aka the MTV/Brittney Spears generation)for its special effects but older viewers have trashed it for its silly dialogues and predictable love triangle. But what turned me off months before the movie was released to general audiences was the fact that Ben Affleck plays an American fighter pilot who gets into the air that day to take on hundreds of Japanese planes. How absurd!!!!!!! It is a well-documented fact that only two American fighter pilots, lieutenants Welsh and Taylor, managed to get into the air on December 7 and in their outclassed P-40s, managed to combine to shoot down seven Japanese planes. Taylor was wounded in his arm by .30mm slugs from a Zero. It is sacreligious to have any actor portray a fictional fighter pilot in such a well-documented event. Garbage as usual.</fullReview>

Michael Bay's eye for a good scene kept things moving for me, although the the raid on Pearl Harbour itself was more lifeless than the one shown in the trailer due to the complete lack of musical scoring. Hans Zimmer what the hell were you up to?As for the actors... well i never did like Alec Baldwin. Affleck reprised his role from Armageddon minus anything that vaguely made that character human. Hartnett and Beckinsale were alright. Cuba rocked. Jon Voight... star of the film.Overall: Disappointing, not very entertaining, too long although not a *bad* way to spend 3 hours, and definitely not moving.

		<fullReview>When I came out of the cinema after seeing this movie, I felt like I'd been in there for years. To put it simply, it's overlong, overblown and definitely overhyped. The plot is trivial compared to the actual events, and the dialogue leaves a lot to be desired. I've never heard a script so full of cliches in any film before. I like Ben Affleck as an actor in films like Chasing Amy and Dogma, but he doesn't have the presence to carry a film like this. Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale make the best of the terrible script, and overall the acting is fine if not great. The film is not emotionally involving as the characters are severely underdeveloped stereotypes, so I ended up not really caring what happened to any of them. It is also completely predictable. While watching it, I had the nagging feeling that I'd seen it all somewhere before, only better. It does have its good points however, as the actual war scenes are very well filmed and more involving than the rest of the film. It's a shame that they spent so much time and money on what amounts to slightly more than a third of the film that they left the script to the last minute. This film had the potential to be great - well-known historical events, big budget to achieve this and a decent cast - all let down by an awful script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw Pearl Harbor and I have to say that I was extremely disappointed in what I saw! Though I have to admit that the special effects in the battle scene were stunning, it did little to compensate for the great disrespect it gave to the battle at Pearl Harbor.Pearl Harbor is one of those topics which deserves reverent care when the storyline is drawn up. For example, in the film Saving Private Ryan, all attempts are made to present war and the battle on D-Day in a realistic, true-to-history way without all the flowery Hollywood glamour all-too-often seen in war films. Where the film Pearl Harbor went wrong was when it presented a grave battle in American history as an interruption to a cheesy romance.I love Ben Affleck and Cuba Gooding Jr. and all the other cameo actors, and under another director, they would have probably given award-winning performances. But it is hard to get past a script laden with cliche lines which make you nausious by the 2 hour mark.I rated this film as a 3 on the IMDB voting scale. It would have been a 1 if not for the amazing effects during the battle scenes. In my opinion, this movie is a complete waste of time for any real movie lover, and especially for those into war films like myself. This is just another American John Wayne interpretation of history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood at it's worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Holy cow! What a load of crap this movie was. Granted, the actual bombing of Pearl Harbor scene was well done (if you leave out the fact that the only two planes to make it in the air, of course, belong to our heroes). And while I liked the Cuba Gooding Jr. Character walk-through part it was obvious that the creators said...hmm, we need some authentic hero story from the raid to counter-balance the tripe we're trying to unload with the two main heroes. The best part of the scene was not the pyro-technics, nor the horror of the men as they died (both of which, I might add, were done infinitely better in Saving Private Ryan, a movie this one tried to compare itself with, yet without coming close to the true emotion and pain of it's predecessor), but the hospital scenes which showed the most true emotion and acting in the movie. Outside of this, the rest of the movie was a melodramatic, walk-through, cheesey-dialogued, self-important piece of Hollywood trite romance at it's worst. I have enjoyed Bay's films in the past because while they tend to have these paint-by-numbers romances in them, the films aren't overwhelmed by them. He has undertaken the task of putting Pearl Harbor back "on the map" of American History, only to drive it off a cliff 3 hours too late. There's too many good World War Two movies out there to have to watch this junk. Try "The Big Red One" or "Stalag 17" before spending hard earned money just so other atrocities like this one will be made in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>why, oh why did jerry bruckheimer and michael bay re-make titanic? the parallels are startling, from the love triangle (even going as far as the not-quite-well-known british actress playing american) set against a national tragedy, to the talented actors wasted on a dismal script. and, like titanic, the film succeeds in its endeavor to make teenage girls care more about the strikingly handsome actors and their petty problems than the thousands of lives lost. some fans of the film may think i'm being overly harsh, and perhaps they are right. the film is visually stunning (if over-edited at times), although the action shots are sometimes cliched (planes going between buildings in an alley reeks of the star wars trilogy). the effects are spectacular, although i'm not sure the bruckheimer/bay philosophy of "bigger, faster, louder, more" is always appropriate, especially for a sequence that lasts upwards of 30 minutes. i got tired just watching it. however, the love story was incredibly contrived. kate beckinsale's character, evelyn is completely transparent and has no personality to speak of; the only background we get on rafe and danny is a 5-minute sequence at the beginning of the film where we see danny's WWI veteran father physically abuse him, and rafe "come to his rescue". other than that, they are cliched stereotypes: rafe (ben affleck), the cocky pilot (with an apparent learning disability to make him appear more realistic--an unresolved plot element which is mentioned at two points in the film and never again), and danny (josh hartnett), the soft-spoken shy guy who depends on rafe to boost his self-confidence. what we have is a love triangle that isn't really a triangle--danny doesn't get involved with evelyn until after rafe's "death," and after rafe comes back, neither one of them actually have much to do with her (except, of course, getting in a fist-fight and lamenting their love for the same woman--no matter that rafe had only known evelyn 4 weeks when he went off to england, and danny and evelyn had only had one real date--in modern hollywood, this is what passes for love). and speaking of that fist-fight, did it strike anyone else as odd that rafe and danny jump in the same car and escape, and in the very next scene, they are on the beach together as if nothing had happened? in any case, the love triangle should have been resolved during or directly after the pearl harbor bombing so that we could skip the last hour altogether. don't get me wrong, i actually enjoyed the doolittle's raid section, i just think it should have been its own movie. historically speaking, the film was correct in dates and large events, but there were a number of small inaccuracies. some of them have to do with modern equipment being visible on some of the ships in the harbor, and not many civilians would notice these. others, like attending the charlie chaplin film "the great dictator," which evelyn and danny find each other at in october of 1941 are possible, but not very plausible (the film was released in 1940 and i'm not sure how likely it would be to still be in theaters). the biggest anachronism comes from danny during the bombing when he says "i think world war II just started." at this point in history, the war was not being referred to as WWII yet. that name came later, at least in the united states. also, the japanese admiral speaks of "getting in the war" when they had BEEN in the war for nearly 10 years.having not lived through world war II, i can't comment on the portrayal of the actual bombing or the japanese, but if michael bay was trying for the most PC script possible, i think he succeeded. sure, the american pilots call them "dirty japs," but i have a feeling this is one of the mildest names that would have been used for the people who bombed our harbor and killed thousands of american naval officers. i believe that most of them would have had quite a few more choice phrases for the japanese. with all the gore, mass death and haunting images of the wounded, i am amazed that this film squeaked by with a PG-13 rating. i can't imagine a realistic war film without an R rating, but then pearl harbor falls far short of realistic. it does not challenge the viewer visually or intellectually, and the actors try to make up for a horrible script, filled with what seems like every war cliche ever invented, but in the end, even they cannot save this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cliched romance, poor continuity, badly scripted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The script writers for this certainly are not original, the basic story of 2 lads from the same town going off to fight has been covered dozens of times in film history and they fall out because they both love the same woman is also hardly new and quite frankly has been done better in other movies. The soundtrack is piece after piece of irritating sentimental that grates on the ears(especially in the scene where hero has just told the girl he has voluntered to fly for the RAF).I also cannot believe a film that cost $135 million contains so many continuity and technical errors. In one shot what is supposed to be the japanese fleet is clearly a modern US carrier battlegroup(look at the carrier, angled flight decks weren't invented till after the war), but the next time we saw the japanese fleet it was ww2 era carrier(surely they should have spotted this glaring continuity error especially it is also a technical error).The film would have been semi-okay if it had ended after the attack on Pearl Harbour, but they had this awful tacked on bit with the 2 lads taking part in the B25 raid on tokyo launched from the carrier Shangri-La.The only good thing was cuba gooding jnr's all too brief performance. I think overall this movie tried to be too many things and failed at all of them, if you want 2 men loving the same woman who loves them both try Casablanca, if you 2 young men going to war Try Gallipoli and if you want to see movie about the attack on pearl harbour watch Tora Tora Tora.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent action replay of the actual attack but I thought the film was trying to be all things to all men, and that's never easy:1. The romance angle would have made a good film by itself2. The historical details were not as accurate as they could have been - wasn't the liner 'Queen Mary' used as a troop ship in WW2 and painted all in grey ? And the time when Rafe flew with the RAF in the Eagle Squadron was said to be 1941, but the type of combat action shown was typical of the Battle of Britain period in summer 1940. The Luftwaffe had given up daylight bombing raids over Britain by 1941 in favour of night attacks, i.e. 'The Blitz'. In any case its main activity in 1941 was supporting the German invasion of Russia.3. The account of the Japanese planning of the attack and the American code breakers attempting to fathom out what was going on is another aspect that could well have made a good story in its own right.But I think the way the critics have panned Kate Beckinsale's American accent is very unfair. It did not strike me as implausible, certainly no worse than the efforts of US actors to speak in English accents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems incredible that one of the most pivotal events in American history is used as a vehicle for a conventional love triangle story with half an hour of 'amazing' special effects. To see this on Armeggedon or Top Gun, both fiction, is one thing. To see this on a film relating to a real event I think dishonours the war dead, and this is before you take into account the slur that yet another piece of revisionist script portrays. It was bad enough that Hollywood chose to do it in films about the British (e.g. U-571) but it is amazing that even its own country's history is not safe. If the US filmgoing audience think this is a suitable vehicle for a pyrotecnic blockbuster extravaganza, I give up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally Hollow and Insulting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the past couple of years, producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay have proven themselves to be extremely adept at creating `popcorn movies' - good, solid action films that probably aren't going to win any Oscars, but are undeniably entertaining. The secret to making these sorts of films (`The Rock', `Armageddon') seems to be to hype up the action and to not take things terribly seriously. Unfortunately, Bruckheimer and Bay took the same cavalier attitude in making `Pearl Harbor', a film whose very subject matter demands a certain amount of respect. By its very nature, `Pearl Harbor' should've been a film that made the audience ponder the absolute senseless horror of war . . . instead, it's a popcorn movie. The fact that the attack on Pearl Harbor is treated with so little respect is not only disappointing, it's downright insulting. SPOILERS ALERT Like `Titanic', the film `Pearl Harbor' uses a romance between fictional characters to help tell a true story. Not a bad idea, except the romance in `Pearl Harbor' is so wooden and forced, watching it is like having a salad fork stuck in your eye. (For those of you who thought the romance in `Titanic' was bad . . . heh, heh, wait 'til you see `Pearl Harbor'!) The film starts with two childhood friends from Tennessee named Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett). After the obligatory opening childhood sequence to demonstrate how tight these two guys really are, we get to see them enter the Army Air Corps and both fall in love - gee, who could've seen this coming? - with the same pretty young nurse, Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale). Evelyn first chooses Rafe as her love interest, but when he's reported dead, Danny gets his chance. The reports of Rafe's death turn out to be greatly exaggerated, and he of course returns to find Evelyn . . . in Pearl Harbor, mere hours before the start of the bombing.Forgetting the actual bombing for a second, the romance is so witless it's funny. I kept expecting to see Crow and Tom Servo from MST3K pop in the corner of the movie screen. Lines like "I'm gonna give Danny my whole heart, but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you" scream Tori Spelling TV-Movie-Of-The-Week . . . the fact that they're in a big-budget movie like this is hysterical. The problem is, the romance is so uninteresting that it's impossible to care about either Rafe, Danny, or Evelyn - so when the bombs start falling on Pearl Harbor, their fate really doesn't matter. This lack of emotional investment in any of these characters turns large sections of the film into something that can only be watched with clinical detachment instead of with genuine feeling, and the fact that it doesn't really matter if the main characters live or die makes the movie, very, very boring. As Rafe, Ben Affleck continues to demonstrate that he's little more than a good-looking store mannequin. Kate Beckinsale, who's normally quite a good actress, puts in an equally wooden performance as Evelyn, as does Josh Hartnett as Danny. Considering that these three are the leads of the film, that's just pathetic.As for the bombing of Pearl Harbor itself - well, even if you're willing to ignore the many historical inaccuracies, the bombing is handled with such inept direction that it's embarrassing. Despite the fact that it technically looks very good, it's constructed in a manner that suggests adolescent glee, not somber reality. The battle scenes of `Saving Private Ryan' were designed to evoke horror. The sinking scenes in `Titanic' managed to evoke similar feelings of dread. In `Pearl Harbor', there's nothing but cartoonish violence. There's an attitude of `look how cool this is!' throughout the bombing that's completely inappropriate. For example, during the destruction of the USS Arizona in the film, Michael Bay cuts to the reaction of a cook as a bomb strikes the ship . . . the cook gives a Buckwheat-esque reaction that belongs in a `Three Stooges' short. When I saw this in the theater, the audience, for the most part, laughed heartily at the cook's reaction. I'll only pose this question: Should anything at all about the destruction of the USS Arizona, where thousands died in senseless slaughter, be something to laugh at? The actual bombing of Pearl Harbor seems to be little more to Bruckheimer and Bay than an excuse to make an action movie and to blow things up. They rarely give the actual bombing - and its survivors - the respect they deserve, and their few attempts to actually do so are heavy-handed and pandering in nature. In another director's hands, the story still would've been awful, but at least the tone of the film might've been on the mark. Hopefully, Bay will never get another change to butcher a serious subject like this again, and will stick to stuff like `The Rock' from now on. Are there positives in this film? There's some, I guess, but not enough to make `Peal Harbor' good. Despite Michael Bay's mishandling of the tone of battle sequences, they are technically brilliant, and the effects work is outstanding. (However, I get the feeling Bay should be paying out some cash to James Cameron, Terrence Malick, and Steven Spielberg for so shamelessly ripping shots from their films. Bay is apparently turning into a new version of Brian DePalma - a technically brilliant director with no style of his own.) Cuba Gooding Jr's performance as Dorie Miller is great . . . for the ten minutes he's actually in the movie. It's nice, but he either needed to be a more significant character or cut from the film entirely. Ditto the smaller roles of model James King as Nurse Betty, and Dan Ackroyd as Thurman - they're excellent, but underused. Even though their performances are great, the overall film might've been better if losing the scenes using their characters meant trimming an hour off this already bloated film. The only small role that was both outstanding and critical to the film was Jon Voight as FDR - he was inspiring to watch, and was one of the few important characters who didn't seem to be sleepwalking through the film.If `Pearl Harbor' was a film about a completely fictional subject - like `Armageddon' - it would still be incredibly dull and mediocre, bordering on bad. The fact that it deals with an important historical event brimming with true stories of heroism and tragedy makes the film `Pearl Harbor' even worse. It's an insulting film that's not worth renting, let alone watching in the theater. Grade: C-</fullReview>

Its entertainment value is confined to the 45-minute blitzkrieg on Pearl Harbour. THAT was a SFX tour-de-force.The rest of the movie SUCKED:- the love story SUCKED, the dialogue SUCKED, the ending SUCKED, the acting SUCKED. There was one incident of comic relief that had me chortling - where this guy put some ointment under his eyes to look dewy-eyed for a girl. Other than that, attempts at levity SUCKED.And mind you, I was determined at all costs to be entertained, having paid 50 Ringgit to see a charity screening (that's a lot considering the normal ticket price is 9 Ringgit). After the attack sequence, I slept during the anti-climactic Doolittle raids. Somebody tell me the ending, 'coz I sure as heck ain't watching this movie again.</fullReview>

Yes, that's right. They have taken Pearl Harbor, a historical event that lead the United States to enter the second world war, and turned it into a 'chick flick'. Another act that will live in infamy.Maybe I'm being too harsh. Maybe 18-and-under girls like this movie because it is giving them facts with which they are unfamiliar. How the Japanese government was planning war; the work of the code breakers; spotting the incoming bombers on an early radar system; the total surprise; the loss of life; the start of a period of intensity and determination which has not since been equaled in the US. Maybe the guys have all read the books (30 Seconds Over Tokyo), watched Tora, Tora, Tora,; The World at War, etc. and know some of the facts.If you already know the facts, this movie is a poor retelling. If you are completely clueless about December 7, 1941 maybe you can use it to jumpstart your neglected education.One other reason to go see it: vintage airplanes.I gave it a 3</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not enjoy Pearl Harbor at all. The pacing of the movie between the action and romance did not mesh. A sign of this would be the soundtrack of the movie where it cues to every moment as being anti-climatic. The characters dressed the part but never embodied themselves to that history in time. I didn't care to see what happened to them either way. The action was your standard Bruckheimer fare - loud, big, and lots of it. But the problem was that the characters and plot were so badly developed that you just can't wait for the sappy cartoon romance to end and let the movie cut to the next action sequence. For a better Pearl Harbor movie, I recommend "Tora! Tora!" or better yet, the Spielberg classic "1941".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just because it worked once didn't mean it would again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The major problem with Pearl Harbor is that Bruckheimer and Bay used the same formula as Titanic. Big mistake! First of all, Titanic was a disaster flick interwoven with a love story. A big ship sinking would basically appeal to the general movie-going public. Throw in a romance for extra measure-BOOM! You got a hit! With Pearl Harbor, Bruckheimer and Bay made a movie about love and centered it around war. Then they went after two different audiences: teenagers particularly girls-thus the weak and tired love triangle, and adults-mainly veterans and survivors of Pearl Harbor.It didn't work because they focused too much on the love story where you only see 35 minutes of Pearl Harbor getting bombed. This movie shouldn't have been 3 hours and 20 minutes long. You spend 2 hours just waiting to see the bombing, which was supposed to be the selling point, judging from the trailer and the title.Now what they should have done was make Pearl Harbor about Pearl Harbor. The movie should have focused on the events that led up to the attack on Pearl Harbor, the actual bombing itself, and the results from it. Love could've played a small supporting role. Because of this, the small (and I do mean small) focus on Dorrie Miller (adequately played by Cuba Gooding, Jr.) just seemed totally irrelevant. As an African-American man, I applaud Bruckheimer and Bay for at least acknowledging that the brothas were actually there, which Saving Private Ryan conveniently forgot to do! But the plot contrivance with the love story and the bombing just made Cuba seem out of place. By the end of the movie, you're wondering why they even bothered putting the brotha in there.And the love story itself... totally lacked realism and compassion. I would even go so far as to say that Kate Beckinsale's Evelyn was reduced to a common whore, having gotten herself in between two best friends.Overall, Pearl Harbor was a disappointment!What works for one movie won't work for another!Peace!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the granddaughter of a Pearl Harbor survivor, I had high expectations of this movie when I first saw the trailer. From the point of initially hearing about it to actually seeing it, I read many reviews, none of which were too flattering. Too expensive. Too many explosives. Not enough plot. An unconvincing love story. I went to see it anyway, not sure what to expect anymore other than a long (3 hour) movie. I sat. I watched. And I have to say - all those negative reviews were incredibly unwarranted. The money spent was well worth it. The romance, although criticized as being sort of in the way, was not "unconvincing" and made the movie better. It was realistic and touching. Historically, it seemed fairly accurate but not very in-depth. Overall, I thought the movie was very good and does not deserve all of the negative reviews. Some, yes, but not all. I highly recommend it to anyone that doesn't mind sitting in the theater for 3 hours. (Hey, if you did it for Titanic, you can do it for this. And this is worth it...) I'm not a movie critic and so maybe I'm not able to sit and criticize it. As your average moviegoer, I actually enjoyed this movie. Unlike the critics, I thought the characters weren't boring and the movie wasn't just an excuse to rake in the box office profits. I don't know the exact points to look for in defining a "good" movie but as a member of the general public, I thought it was, in fact, good. I would consider this to be a worthy tribute to the actual Pearl Harbor. I commend Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer. They did a good job on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw the movie today and enjoyed it. The special effects were a little over done and seemed like a video game in some scenes. However, I hangar with several of the Tora pilots from the Houston area that had their Jap replica aircraft barged to Pearl Harbor, and later flown to the Lexington and the Battle ship Texas. Will Bonefas who at 67 years of age, had his Val replica repainted in a wax based paint to resemble the silver and black color scheme of the attacking aircraft. Flying for 6 or 7 weeks took place at Pearl and also included Steve Hinton flying the P40. One of the replicas actually crashed while filming. The 72 year old pilot was shakened but survived! Later, Will flew to Corpus Christi Texas to a repainted carrier Lexington that was turned into a jap carrier and the later into the Hornet. There was some veteran opposition due to this carrier flying the Jap flag. The B25 and tora planes were actually launched off the static carrier. A final set was flown at the battleship Texas which was also repainted to resemble the Arizona and the Iowa. These aircraft were modified in 1969 for the film Tora Tora Tora and were WW2 AT6 advanced trainers and BT13 trainers with extended fuselages and modified tail feathers. Very few enemy aircraft exist today. Take time when the movie concludes and observe all of the credits. It is amazing how many fine folks participated in this movie. And of course, take a look at the pilot credits. These type of details help the realism and probably add to the 140 million price tag. And what would the rest of us pilots give to fly in this movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the opening of `Pearl Harbor', we find two boyhood friends - Rafe Mcawley and Danny Walker, playing at a farm. We learn that Danny's father is a war veteran turned abusive father and Rafe is Danny's best friend, loyally looking out for him and assuming the role as an older brother. The audience is jetted towards the future, months before the attack of Pearl Harbor - where the two buddies, Rafe played by Ben Affleck and Danny played by Josh Hartnett, much older and excellent pilots, are training. Rafe meets Kate Beckinsale's character, Evelyn Johnson during an eye test. Although, using Danny's help, he cheats because of his dyslexia, she passes him. The two instantly fall in love and play back and forth until Evelyn finally surrenders and the two are whisked into cheesy, dragging romance. Beckinsale and Affleck have no chemistry and I, personally, did not connect or care about the two. However, they did do the best with the sappy and unrealistic lines that were written for them - and their bliss does provide a clear contrast and foreshadowing of the horror to come. Beckinsale was nothing extraordinary, but she does surprise the audience later in the film - her character becoming more profound and heroic. Rafe abandons Evelyn and Danny when he volunteers to fly with the highly respected `Eagle Squadron' with the British where he will go to war - and I'm afraid that I can't spoil what happens thereon. Any way, a love triangle between Danny, Rafe and Evelyn takes shape. While Affleck and Beckinsale were not very believable or intriguing, Hartnett and Beckinsale played off each other very well and were extremely funny and touching. Some of the supporting roles are not very original and they added little to the to the movie. But after the film picks up a little, we go on a realistic thrill ride throughout the attack of Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle brigade.Despite the critc's harsh and unfair bashing of `Pearl Harbor', I found it an incredible experience. Perhaps the critics have lost sight of what a movie is made for - the audience. The director, Michael Bay, seemed very impatient in the beginning of the movie, however I felt he made up for this with his powerful and heart-stopping depiction of the actual attack and brigade. Although the love triangle is what holds the movie together and perhaps makes it a little more interesting and develops the characters, the movie really is about war and being an American and it focuses mainly on the relationship between Danny and Rafe, which is very compelling - as well as entertaining. You will be proud to be an American, despite our mistakes, when you walk out of the theatre - trust me. Jon Voight had Roosevelt down to a T. Cuba Gooding Jr. also delivered a wonderful performance as an actual cook at Pearl Harbor. However, I felt his story was overshadowed a little and deserved more time. Alec Baldwin took a lot from this movie - his performance was laughable and I found it very hard to believe that he was at all sincere as Doolittle - an actual general who led men to revenge after the attack. However, overall - Josh Hartnett stole the spotlight, giving his greatest performance by far. Although he was not an unknown actor prior to this, hopefully this film will be a great step up in his career... he was very captivating on screen and in my opinion he was the star of the film, not Affleck. In conclusion, I highly recommend you see this movie - it really will blow you away, don't expect too much in the beginning except for some pretty good comedy - but don't worry, it will get better. Michael Bay did an amazing job depicting the war scenes... the movie is barely `R'- you'll see what I mean. So, what are you waiting for? Yeah, it's no masterpiece, but it makes up for its faults and it did get its message across very successfully - this is one to see at the theatre, certainly a crowd pleaser. I only wish that Bay was a little less impatient and had tried to make this film a masterpiece and spent a little more time developing the characters and perfecting them. But what can you do, he accomplished a pretty hard task very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Pearl Harbor the weekend it opened. I think it was an awesome movie that everyone should see. It portrayed the attack on Pearl very well, as confirmed by several veterans of WWII. It opened my eyes to the horror and reality of it in a way not many movies have done.And now the down side: Normally I am a real "chick flick" lover and appreciate a good love story, but not in this one. The love story was nearly half the movie. Personally I think it took away from the quality of the film more than it added.On the whole, I greatly enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie should never have been made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning**** This contains spoilers**** I made the mistake of entering the theater with expectations for the first time in a long while. This film was very aesthetically pleasing; the special effects were outstanding and the sets were intricate and believable. However, the actors were poorly cast and the screenplay was wordy and contrived.Ben Affleck, who at the release of this film completed the requirements for graduation of the School of Overacting (Founding Member Richard Crenna), is too whiny and slack-jawed to handle the role of leading man in this picture. I wanted him to die (SPOILER) and was disappointed when he didn't. Josh Hartnett was believable at best, but his performance suffered from Affleck's lack of believability. Kate Beckinsale was also mediocre, although I did enjoy the fugue-like scenes during the inital attack.This movie tried to be too much and was very crowded, even though it was three hours long. The Cuba Gooding aside was completely superfluous. Although I enjoyed his character, the subplot added little. The best performance hands-down was that of Jon Voight as FDR. The heavily made-up Voight turned in a stunningly accurate portrayal of a great leader. Rent this movie or get it on pay-per-view, but only if you have 3 hours to waste. I feel that I have grown less intelligent by watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lots of good scenes when they actually get into the bombing and the Japanese point of view was also done fairly well. The horribly sappy love story really shot the film down. The character Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale) and the other nurse were not portrayed very well, women in the 40's didn't act like that. To improve the movie they should have completely ditched the love story along with Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett and stuck used the story of Doris 'Dorie' Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who was the most interesting and of the characters presented and one of the few who was a real person. Overall I'd say you might as well pass on this one it wasn't really worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERSI didn't expect much coming from Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer. Don't get me wrong, I own quite a few of their movies. But, as in those movies, it was extremely similar: (Armageddon - Ben Affleck goes into space and she loses her father) (Pearl Harbor - Ben Affleck goes to England, is thought dead, she gets pregnant by his best friend, Ben comes back, and she loses his best friend). Now, I love Ben Affleck. I think he's turned out some pretty good performances. I was impressed with the majority of the cast. Explain something to me though, why is Cuba Gooding,Jr. doing so many period peices? Jon Voight was great as Roosevelt,Mako as always was great, Kate Beckensale was good as Evelyn, and I was pleasantly surprised with Dan Ackroyd. I had no idea he was in this movie. William Fitchner was excellent as young Danny's father. You may recognize him from Armageddon. Again, seeming to refer to Bruckheimer's "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" theory. Find a pretty girl, throw her into a tumultuous love story, lots of explosions, and a happy ending.My father was in WW2, and for him this movie was pretty much dead on, once it got to the fight scenes. He was an aircraft engineer, and was at Pearl after all the fighting. He saw the carnage first hand. Said that was how it looked in the aftermath, so at least they got something right.In a way, Im glad this movie was made, as much as Im dogging it. It was a good film, I didnt check my watch once (although I did get up to go to the bathroom). My son will hopefully never know war, but I want him to know what the U.S. went through as a country to get to where we are today. The closeset Ive ever come to war was when my older brother was sent to Desert Shield/Storm. That didnt really seem like a war to me, though. I was able to watch it on CNN. I feel M*A*S*H was more of a war to me. Sad, isnt it? A television show that was on when I was a child seemed more real to me than an acutal war that happened when I was 16. I just hope that we never have to face world war 3, since we would all be demolished. We would never know what hit us. Thank you to all the people who kept America free, after this sleeping giant had been awoken. Especially you, dad.</fullReview>

For those that are not aware, floater bars are used for skydivers so they can hang more people outside the airplane before launching a formation. Take a close look and you'll see them.2) Why did do many planes in a single formation have the same tail number? Looked like one plane copied over and over again.3) I thought Alec Baldwin was leaving the country if George Bush was elected. Why hasn't he left yet?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw the movie today and enjoyed it. The special effects were a little over done and seemed like a video game in some scenes. However, I hangar with several of the Tora pilots from the Houston area that had their Jap replica aircraft barged to Pearl Harbor, and later flown to the Lexington and the Battle ship Texas. Will Bonefas who at 67 years of age, had his Val replica repainted in a wax based paint to resemble the silver and black color scheme of the attacking aircraft. Flying for 6 or 7 weeks took place at Pearl and also included Steve Hinton flying the P40. One of the replicas actually crashed while filming. The 72 year old pilot was shakened but survived! Later, Will flew to Corpus Christi Texas to a repainted carrier Lexington that was turned into a jap carrier and the later into the Hornet. There was some veteran opposition due to this carrier flying the Jap flag. The B25 and tora planes were actually launched off the static carrier. A final set was flown at the battleship Texas which was also repainted to resemble the Arizona and the Iowa. These aircraft were modified in 1969 for the film Tora Tora Tora and were WW2 AT6 advanced trainers and BT13 trainers with extended fuselages and modified tail feathers. Very few enemy aircraft exist today. Take time when the movie concludes and observe all of the credits. It is amazing how many fine folks participated in this movie. And of course, take a look at the pilot credits. These type of details help the realism and probably add to the 140 million price tag. And what would the rest of us pilots give to fly in this movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've found that the movies to roar on to the big screen lately have lacked a bit of originallity. Pearl Harbor, needless to say, is just another moneymaking piece of trash that is no more exciting then Tuesdays with Morey. If you took Cameron's stupid script for "Titanic", changed the names, the location, and the disaster, you've got "Pearl Harbor". A two hour drawn out love story backed by a one hour disaster backed by three more minutes of useless info to take place of credits. It's like Micheal Bay decided to feed his brain to Hannibal while Bruckheimer spent a load of money on movie that could have been directed by Renny Harlin. In a nutshell. Spend your hard-earned money on good movies like Shrek or even Moulin Rouge, but do not waste your time with this worthless Hollywood creation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good movie surrounding the days preceding Pearl Harbor, and the Doolittle raid on Tokyo that occurred in April of 1942. The love that Rafe, Billy, and Evelyn share is especially nice, you don't have to be a fan of love stories to like it. The special effects are good, using technology of today to show several fighter scenes during the Pearl Harbor attack. But if you are someone who knows the events of the attack, or the Doolittle raid, you will be a little disappointed in the movies accuracy. But it is definitely worth watching; just see it with an open mind, and understand that it was meant to be a fictional account, and that the Director had no intention to be accurate concerning the attack on Pearl Harbor, nor did he try. Enjoy the movie, and take along a tissue or handkerchief, you'll need it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like a bomb, Pearl Harbor had a lot of potential. From the first movie trailer to the endless promotion, it kept building and building to that moment where it can break loose and explode into a fantastic movie, lighting up the big screen. But when that moment came, it merely let loose some crackles that fireworks would make and not the explosion it was very capable of.The movie begins in Tennessee, 1923. Friends Danny (Josh Hartnett, although this is a younger version of Danny first seen) and Rafe (Ben Affleck, with the same situation) are best friends and aspiring pilots. When the years pass, they've acquired their dream and are now pilots for the military. Soon, Rafe, by order of General Dolittle (Alec Baldwin), is shipped to fight in England, much to the distress of army nurse and Rafe's girlfriend Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale). But in America, Danny, Evelyn, and other army members are shipped to safety in Pearl Harbor (resulting in dramatic irony for us, since we know exactly how "safe" Pearl Harbor really is). Rafe's plane crashes during a fight, resulting in news to Danny, Evelyn, and other friends that Rafe is dead. But after a few months of grieving, Evelyn and Danny develop a love for each other, only to find out later that Rafe is actually alive and coming back to Pearl Harbor, making their romance a part of a love triangle.Cinematically, this movie was brilliant. The war sequence far into the movie was very compelling and awesome to watch. And one scene I thought was a little overlooked amongst all the publicity was the scenes in the hospital prior to the Pearl Harbor bombing. The blurriness and shaking seen was a great way to show the stress in that hospital. The acting was great too. Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett really showed us the strength of their acting muscles. Kate Beckinsale also made a very good first impression on me and I hope she'll get some more projects in the future. My personal favorite was Cuba Gooding Jr. as real military hero Dori Miller, a cook who took on fighting the Japanese during the Pearl Harbor attack.However, the dialogue was something that really bothered me in this movie. It had so many cliche'd lines, especially in exchanges of love. I'm not saying that in order to have a good script, you need great, dramatic, poetic lines. I mean, not every screenwriter is a poet or a classic author. It's just that where corny lines were placed, a much better line could've been used. One big example is when Evelyn and Danny are about to make love behind some curtains. Danny is over Evelyn, and you can almost feel their passion. It seems like it's going to be so romantic. But then, Danny speaks his sentence of love, romance, and passion..."My heart's pounding." That's it. See what I mean? That was one of many scenes where the dialogue's potential was totally wasted.This movie could've been spectacular. And it was good. Great, even. Better than I had begun to think, what with new views of the movie surfacing. But it could've been so much more, and that's the only thing that disappointed me.7/10, B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top Titanic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's obvious that when Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay heard about the record breaking gross for TITANIC, they put heads together and said, "let's make our own 20th century tragic disaster film." Thus in early 1998 Bruckheimer and Bay announced the planning on making the film PEARL HARBOR. The original cast included Cameron Diaz and Gene Hackman, but through time the actors became Kate Beckinsdale and Jon Voight. But it would be expected that there would be big explosions and special effects for this film. And this film does have big explosions and special effects. But first let's get to the plot (which some would critize that there really isn't one). Ben Affleck plays Kentucky native Rafe McCawley (with a bad Southern accent) and Josh Hartnett is his long time best friend Danny Walker. Rafe falls in love with volunteer nurse Evelyn Johnson (the ravishing beautiful Kate Beckinsdale), and Rafe tells Evelyn that he is going over to England to help the English fight against the Nazi's, since this is in early 1941. Rafe's plane is hit while flying causing his plane to crash and Danny and Evelyn to think he's dead. So to put the past behind, Evelyn falls in love with Danny, and realizes that Danny is more "fun" to be with. Then Rafe comes back stateside and shocks both Danny and Evelyn, and did I forget to mention that this is in Hawaii and it's December 6th 1941? Anyways, just when Rafe and Danny's friendship is about to come to a end, dozens of Japanesse airplanes fly into Hawaii and begin attacking Pearl Harbor, thus making it a frighting and unforgettable scenes to watch.There is good news and bad news about this film. The good news, the attack of Pearl Harbor is frighting, spectacular, exciting, and unforgettable. The bad news, in this 3 hour plus film, it takes 90 minutes for the film to get to the attack. So it's another obvious factor, Bay is trying to pull the romantic factor from TITANIC to make the character's three dimensional. But there's a difference, Leonardo DiCapprio and Kate Winslet had chemistry, Affleck, Beckinsdale and Hartnett don't. That makes the first nintey minutes of PEARL HARBOR very very s-l-o-w and unintresting. You just want everyone to die just so it can get to the attack, since the characters are so cliche. And the supporting characters are no better for both the men (the guy who tries to get a girl in bed, the one who stutters, the one who wonders why can't he get a girl) and the women (the flirt, the brain, the obese one, etc.) Then the film shows scenes of airplane flying in the clouds during a sunset that looks like something from Bruckheimer's other flying film, TOP GUN (which also was another boring romance film). I was just waiting to hear Berlin's "Take My Breath Away" being played in the soundtrack. Then it happens. The attack. The Japanesse planes fly in looking like something from one of the STAR WARS films. They fly over a valley, over a woman hanging clothes on a line, and by a baseball field where kids are playing a early morning game. The first torpedo is dropped, as the sailors wonder was is heading towards them, and BOOM!!! All hell breaks loose. For the next seventy minutes is very horrific scenes of sailors getting shot, blown up, or even drowned. This is when the movie works, it's just as intense as the sinking of TITANIC and just has frighting as the attack of Normady in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. The film's pacing went from 10 mph to 100 mph!!! Then, the attack is over and the film drops back to 15 mph, brining the sappy love story back into the spotlight, and making the audience groan. I did enjoy the acts of PEARL HARBOR II and III, but part I should have been cut, massively. Bay figured that people want a three hour romantic epic, and yes we do, but we also want intresting characters!! I really didn't care much of the acting by the actors who played fictional characters (but Kate Beckinsdale was so pretty to look at that I would rather be with her and die at Pearl Harbor than to be on the sinking Titanic with Kate Wislet). It's the actors who play the factual characters that are good: Cuba Gooding Jr. playing Dorie Miller, a colored sailor who fought back at the Japanesse during the attack; Jon Voight as the respectable President Roosevelt who will not let America fall down to the Japanesse; and Alec Baldwin as the crusty and brave Col. Doolittle who led the defense attack at Tokyo because of Pearl Harbor. I did also highly enjoy the score by Academy winner Hans Zimmer. The score to this film is more romantic and whimiscal, unlike his dramatic scores like from THE ROCK, CRIMSON TIDE, and GLADIATOR, so it was a very nice different change. And Randall Wallace does succeed and fail with the script, he succeeds during and after the attack, he fails during the first 90 minutes. But compared to the other summer films (MUMMY RETURNS, SHREK, and KNIGHT'S TALE) PEARL HARBOR is the best summer film, so far. I know it's not saying much since so far this is a very disappointing summer, but I did enjoy it more than the others. It's not a classic that Touchstone Pictures is pushing it to be, and it's no TITANIC that Bruckheimer and Bay are trying to make it be. But it is entertaining and enjoyable, and is worth watching. But Michael Bay must remember this old saying, "less is better" and for this film, that would have made this film better. **** (out of five)</fullReview>

I didn't get any sense of the love the characters felt for each other, as I have with other love stories (including Titanic). I am not sure if this was due to poor acting, directing, or scripting; perhaps a combination.While the actual Pearl Harbor (bombing) scenes were spectacular, the rest of the movie's shallowness cannot make up for this sad example of an epic.

		<fullReview>-Warning-A few spoilers. "Pearl Harbor" isn't a bad movie, but it certainly isn't an epic the likes of "Titanic," which I didn't like either by the way. "Harbor" follows the lives of two childhood friends (Ben Affleck &amp; Josh Harnett) who are enlisted as pilots in the same military divison and everything is going fine. But when Affleck goes to fight in England, he leaves behind his girlfriend (Kate Beckinsale, who gives the only good performance in the movie) who doesn't want him to go. Well when news reaches the states that Affleck died in battle Beckinsale and Harnett get together, after just a month or two of mouring over Affleck's death. But of course Affleck can't be dead, since the movie must be stretched out over the 3 hour+ running time. The 'Pearl Harbor' incident doesn't even occur until halfway through the movie and even that's not the end of the film, there's still a good hour left. This isn't a great movie, most of the performances are either over the top or aren't memorable or both and the attack on Pearl Harbor isn't even that spectacular, which isn't something I would expect from a film with a $150+ budget. ** out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Bay needs to remember that he's only good at Eye Candy and can't do emotional drama worth a dime. Then again with Randall Wallace writing... who can blame him. The movie is filled with an extremely predictable plot with overly used twists and turns and highly cliched lines. To sum it up, I could write the script/plot out for you on a cocktail napkin.Then there's dilemma, how do you end a movie about Pearl Harbor. Can't exactly have the Japanese bomb the fleet and roll the credits. Can't show the bombing of Hiroshima and/or Nagasaki, especially if you're Disney. Almost 4 years of history lie between Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima with many choices. In my opinion they picked the write event but they drew it out so much it could have filled another movie. Mainly do to the unnecessary love story. The saving grace of this film... the 45 minute bombing scene. D-Day scene from Saving Private Ryan made soldiers cry. The bombing scene from Pearl Harbor will make sailors (and other service men and women)cry. Some of the technical aspects of the scene were wrong, but only military servicemen or historians will notice. All in all, don't see this movie if you can't stomach cheese in a movie. Cause this one is full of it. Aside from the 45 minute Pearl Harbor bombing and the 5-15 minutes of so of the Doolittle raid, the rest of the movie is basically... boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor. The mere mention of those words arouse a lot of emotions in most Americans. Patriotism, for one. Anger, maybe. And yet somehow this movie manages to trivialize the whole business. SPOILERS The name of the movie suggests that it should be a bold, sweeping view of the Japanese sneak attack on the American naval base, and its effects on America, Japan, and the world as we know it. That is not the movie that I watched. This movie concerns only the effect on a rather dull love triangle, with a few snippets of Cuba Gooding Jr. and Jon Voight acting presidential for good measure.The movie begins with shots of two small boys, and we know that they will grow up to be Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett; we have seen the trailers, after all. And indeed they do, they grow into the hunky, mach, back slapping pilots that we see ten minutes later, all grown up. Their names are Rafe and Danny, and they are best friends. Rafe falls in love with a nurse named Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), later is sent to Britain to fight the Nazis. He is reported dead, and that's when Danny becomes romantically involved with Evelyn. The conflict really starts to heat up when Rafe comes back, not only alive, but monumentally p***ed-off that his best buddy moved in on his girlfriend.This love triangle business is okay, but its not really what we came to the theater for, and its not long before we are checking our watches, saying "Hey, aren't there supposed to be some explosions in this movie?" Indeed there are, and this is what Michael Bay is really good at giving us. It doesn't dissappoint, visiting familiar Bay territory: shouting, shooting, slow motion shots of men dying while the orchestra plays solemnly in the background.My problem with the movie is this: it doesn't give us a single character that we remotely care about. Rafe and Danny are both slightly annoying, the love story with Evelyn unconvincing. I've seen better love triangles on Jerry Springer. Whoever wrote the script has a knack for writing memorably cheesy dialogue ("I've given my whole heart to Danny," Evelyn says sweetly, "but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you."). When the attack finally came, it was too late for the film; the Japanese were bombing the snot out of them and I just didn't care. And the action sequence, while somewhat exciting, was a little too violence glorifying for me. When Rafe and Danny lead separate Japanese planes on a crash course for each other, that was when I held up my hands in surrender. That kind of stuff is okay for The Rock or Armageddon, but this is American History, for crying out loud! Show a little respect!The whole time I watched the movie, I was wondering what the veterans who were sitting just behind me thought of the movie. The hot shot pilots shooting off smart-alecky lines, the flirty nurses looking alluring while jabbing syringes into peoples hindquarters...this is the greatest generation? Please. This is a joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor, A Perfect Backdrop for A Love Story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers Dazzling, exciting, and powerful. Words that can describe the exciting battle scenes portrayed in Pearl Harbor. But are they the same words you would mix in with a love story? Displayed before audiences on May 25th, was another case of Hollywood's journey to take a historical disaster and make it into a love story. Not a bad idea, but we've seen this before. Does anyone remember 1997's record breaking Titanic? Not to bash Pearl Harbor, this was a very exciting movie. I guess when I think of making Pearl Harbor into a movie, I think of Saving Private Ryan or A Thin Red Line. War movie or love story, the action was spectacular. Some of the best battle scenes caught on film. When you can take a journey on a Japanese bomb as it falls out of the sky and watch the crew of a destroyer scatter on deck to avoid the ultimate demise. With the mixture of big budget special effects and live action, the battle scenes are anything short of pure entertainment. This small review cannot begin to describe the proportions of this cinematic epic battle. That is something you must see for yourself.As for a love story, that's what most of this film was meant to be. The typical story of boy meets girl, they fall in love, boy heads off to war, boy believed dead, girl falls for best friend. The love story only gets interesting when Rafe McCawley, brilliantly portrayed by Ben Affleck, returns from the dead to be with his love. It just so happens at this point that the Japanese decide to invade Pearl Harbor. The casting of this film did bring out two new fresh faces to the spotlight, Josh Harnett and Kate Beckinsale. Harnett put out a very solid performance, but I think it's his pretty boy looks that will score him more roles. As for playing a girl torn between two lovers, Beckinsale pulled off the task nicely. The rest of the cast was well set, with a lot of familiar faces that can draw crowds and drive up the budget. As an additional note, Dan Aykroyd's cameo appearance as a military code breaker was very well done.At two hours and fifteen minutes, Michael Bay decided that the movie could not be over and he spawned a whole new adventure for our heroes. At this point in a film most viewers are ready for a happy ending. Take Titanic for instance. When the ship sank the movie was basically over. In this case, and with the average running time of films today, there was plenty of room for more action. This is an element that the audiences will have to decide if they enjoyed or not. Overall the film was pretty good. I can't see Pearl Harbor running up a tally of six hundred million, but it should not have a problem making the 140 million-dollar budget back. When the film is eventually released on video, as long people are still buying videocassettes, the girls can have the first cassette filled with hot stars and plenty of dramatic steamy love scenes for all tearjerker fans alike. The boys can then enjoy the second cassette littered with epic and titanic size battle scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I have to say, this was a GREAT movie! It was very entertaining and the special effects were amazing!!! It had a great plot but I felt it strayed away from the topic at hand, the bombing of Pearl Harbor. I didn't expect the time span to be so large. I thought it'd start a little before the bombing then stop after it. But as I watched it seemed to make sense why they did it. Before the bombing the movie showed some info about the times, what was going on in the world, and what was going on in the minds of both America and Japan. Which I think was good because it gave more understanding of the bombing to people who don't know much about it. It also gave some more info to those of us who already know about it. But making the movie a love story was purely a move to get more viewers. I'm not saying that it was a bad idea, I'm just saying that it became more of the main plot of the movie over the bombing. It did make for a good plot though. And Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett are really hot so... Plus, their looks matched their parts. Seriously, Ben Affleck looks more like his charactor, more sure of himself, a little older, etc. While Josh Harnett looks more naive, shy, and humble. Plus Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) wasn't as annoying as I thought she would be. All in all, this was a very entertaining movie which I highly recommend!</fullReview>

Anyone can write a bad script. But with this film, even the cinematography is cheesy. Note to Michael Bay: Just because you can move the camera, doesn't mean you should. Even the simplest of scenes, containing nothing more than "meaningful" exchanges between characters, are made up of sweeping camera angles that just give your heart strings a nice tug.As for the title of this review; when you have a scene in your movie where, for dramatic purposes, a wheelchair bound character (FDR) stands up, you are doing nothing more than begging critics to dump on your movie. Roland Emmerich followed up his really bad disaster movie (Godzilla) with a really bad historical epic (The Patriot). Now Michael Bay is following suit with his contributions to both genres (Armageddon &amp; Pearl Harbor). So I'm sure we can expect really bad children's movies coming from both of them soon.The fact that directors who show a little proficiency in directing action sequences feel the need to direct the rest of a movie is beyond me.

		<fullReview>This unfortunate movie focuses most of its attention on the supposed love story of two men who fall for the same woman. Sadly, this focus of the movie was the worst part about it. I didn't get any sense of the love the characters felt for each other, as I have with other love stories (including Titanic). I am not sure if this was due to poor acting, directing, or scripting; perhaps a combination.While the actual Pearl Harbor (bombing) scenes were spectacular, the rest of the movie's shallowness cannot make up for this sad example of an epic.

		<shortDescription>Top Titanic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's obvious that when Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay heard about the record breaking gross for TITANIC, they put heads together and said, "let's make our own 20th century tragic disaster film." Thus in early 1998 Bruckheimer and Bay announced the planning on making the film PEARL HARBOR. The original cast included Cameron Diaz and Gene Hackman, but through time the actors became Kate Beckinsdale and Jon Voight. But it would be expected that there would be big explosions and special effects for this film. And this film does have big explosions and special effects. But first let's get to the plot (which some would critize that there really isn't one). Ben Affleck plays Kentucky native Rafe McCawley (with a bad Southern accent) and Josh Hartnett is his long time best friend Danny Walker. Rafe falls in love with volunteer nurse Evelyn Johnson (the ravishing beautiful Kate Beckinsdale), and Rafe tells Evelyn that he is going over to England to help the English fight against the Nazi's, since this is in early 1941. Rafe's plane is hit while flying causing his plane to crash and Danny and Evelyn to think he's dead. So to put the past behind, Evelyn falls in love with Danny, and realizes that Danny is more "fun" to be with. Then Rafe comes back stateside and shocks both Danny and Evelyn, and did I forget to mention that this is in Hawaii and it's December 6th 1941? Anyways, just when Rafe and Danny's friendship is about to come to a end, dozens of Japanesse airplanes fly into Hawaii and begin attacking Pearl Harbor, thus making it a frighting and unforgettable scenes to watch.There is good news and bad news about this film. The good news, the attack of Pearl Harbor is frighting, spectacular, exciting, and unforgettable. The bad news, in this 3 hour plus film, it takes 90 minutes for the film to get to the attack. So it's another obvious factor, Bay is trying to pull the romantic factor from TITANIC to make the character's three dimensional. But there's a difference, Leonardo DiCapprio and Kate Winslet had chemistry, Affleck, Beckinsdale and Hartnett don't. That makes the first nintey minutes of PEARL HARBOR very very s-l-o-w and unintresting. You just want everyone to die just so it can get to the attack, since the characters are so cliche. And the supporting characters are no better for both the men (the guy who tries to get a girl in bed, the one who stutters, the one who wonders why can't he get a girl) and the women (the flirt, the brain, the obese one, etc.) Then the film shows scenes of airplane flying in the clouds during a sunset that looks like something from Bruckheimer's other flying film, TOP GUN (which also was another boring romance film). I was just waiting to hear Berlin's "Take My Breath Away" being played in the soundtrack. Then it happens. The attack. The Japanesse planes fly in looking like something from one of the STAR WARS films. They fly over a valley, over a woman hanging clothes on a line, and by a baseball field where kids are playing a early morning game. The first torpedo is dropped, as the sailors wonder was is heading towards them, and BOOM!!! All hell breaks loose. For the next seventy minutes is very horrific scenes of sailors getting shot, blown up, or even drowned. This is when the movie works, it's just as intense as the sinking of TITANIC and just has frighting as the attack of Normady in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. The film's pacing went from 10 mph to 100 mph!!! Then, the attack is over and the film drops back to 15 mph, brining the sappy love story back into the spotlight, and making the audience groan. I did enjoy the acts of PEARL HARBOR II and III, but part I should have been cut, massively. Bay figured that people want a three hour romantic epic, and yes we do, but we also want intresting characters!! I really didn't care much of the acting by the actors who played fictional characters (but Kate Beckinsdale was so pretty to look at that I would rather be with her and die at Pearl Harbor than to be on the sinking Titanic with Kate Wislet). It's the actors who play the factual characters that are good: Cuba Gooding Jr. playing Dorie Miller, a colored sailor who fought back at the Japanesse during the attack; Jon Voight as the respectable President Roosevelt who will not let America fall down to the Japanesse; and Alec Baldwin as the crusty and brave Col. Doolittle who led the defense attack at Tokyo because of Pearl Harbor. I did also highly enjoy the score by Academy winner Hans Zimmer. The score to this film is more romantic and whimiscal, unlike his dramatic scores like from THE ROCK, CRIMSON TIDE, and GLADIATOR, so it was a very nice different change. And Randall Wallace does succeed and fail with the script, he succeeds during and after the attack, he fails during the first 90 minutes. But compared to the other summer films (MUMMY RETURNS, SHREK, and KNIGHT'S TALE) PEARL HARBOR is the best summer film, so far. I know it's not saying much since so far this is a very disappointing summer, but I did enjoy it more than the others. It's not a classic that Touchstone Pictures is pushing it to be, and it's no TITANIC that Bruckheimer and Bay are trying to make it be. But it is entertaining and enjoyable, and is worth watching. But Michael Bay must remember this old saying, "less is better" and for this film, that would have made this film better. **** (out of five)</fullReview>

I mean the director dragged them and dragged them. Everyone in the theatre agreed. 35 minutes could have been dropped off this film and nobody would have noticed.Great war scenes. Its just that the break from action to kissing was a big jump. Didn't make sense. I'm sure it will do a gazillion.

The attack parts are done real well, I really liked when they show the prospective of an aircraft flying through the harbor during the attack, it is almost like a really good video game.

		<shortDescription>The good and bad of it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a frequent filmgoer, I have seen the trailers for Pearl Harbor probably 50 times in theaters, and they predisposed me to disliking the film. Then the reviews started coming out with one-star-out-of-four ratings, and my early bird friends were saying "good one hour movie that takes 3 hours" or "tolerate a lousy two and a half for an excellent half hour." So I finally went, with little enthusiasm. I was surprised that the movie seemed like about two hours, and that there were more acceptable minutes than expected; this moved it from one to two stars in my book. Still, the bad stuff is plentiful and truly awful.Some good things: Consistently excellent computer special effects, more authentic warbirds used than any other movie (at least in recent memory), a true sense of the horror of the bombing was brought to the audience, Jon Voight as Roosevelt, the fact that the film makers balanced the Japanese attack with our symbolic Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, fine Japanese actor Mako, some really convincing portrayals of Americans by quite a few British actors (these must have been requested by them, since there is hardly a shortage of American actors), Dan Aykroyd in another well done serious role, Mt. Fuji in the background of the U.S. Steel Plant in Gary, IndianaSome bad things: The very visible lines from lower lip to ears where the prosthetic chin was added to Jon Voight's much shorter one (fewer closeups would have helped...note to director; when using so much makeup, check the results before giving the go ahead for real filming!), Josh Hartnett (however, this guy would have been useful for any film where Tommy Lee Jones needs to have a flashback to his youth), repeated lack of faith by the filmmakers in the power of the historical truth (the correct number of Japanese planes, flying in correct formations, instead of the plague-of-locusts swarms they are shown buzzing around in, would have worked just as well), I know they were working with a modern carrier deck and whatever historic flying planes they could get their hands on, but let's use those computer effects to touch up the scenes (erase steam modern catapults, fill in obviously modern carrier deck shape, correct for engine and option differences in the Japanese planes), horrible and pointless and irritating and excessive slo-motion/soft focus effects, incredibly inappropriate and mood- breaking modern pop music at the end of the final scene.Most Missed Thing: One of the most important and inspiring things to come out of the attack on Pearl Harbor was the brilliant and resourceful resurrection of the harbor and some of its ships (some were refloated) in a very short period after the attack. This incredible effort helped put the USA back in the game. It was totally ignored in this movie; not even the slightest mention was made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know, I know!!! We are not supposed to like this film. And the revisionists who hate America think it is awful. But for me, as an old broad who was a child when Pearl was attacked, and remembers how scared we were, this really brought back memories of that time. I've just spent an hour reading all the bad reviews and comments on other boards, and it is amazing how many will not see the film but just KNOW it is horrible. I was caught up in the story of the farm boys learning to fly and ending up at Pearl on that fateful day. The romance is not unique, just as the thousands of romances of everyday people were not unique - just real. The sneak attact (and you have to really hate the U.S.A. to believe it could have been stopped and wasn't) is an intense 45 minutes and by the end had me in tears. People in my age range will probably be caught up in the memories as well. I watched the survivors of Pearl Harbor,who were consulted on their memories for the film, on the History Channel discussing the film and the all agree they are glad the film was made even though it was a "Hollywood version" of what happened. Just see it and decide for yourself. I gave it a 7 out of ten, so shoot me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor was a surprise for me in terms of cinematic experience, and proved once again that it remains a mystery why film critics are allowed a venue to voice their opinions.This film was a pure joy to behold from beginning to end, and is one of the more entertaining movies to come along in a while. I was apprehensive when I learned that the bulk of the film revolves around a love triangle, but this thematic device does not detract an ounce from the overall plot. It is simply a backstory for a series of events that leads to one of America's most terrifying experiences. The interspersing scenes of Jon Voigt's poignant President F.D. Roosevelt and the Nipponese battle plan under Admiral Yamamoto and General Genda gave us a fictionalized, yet strong, portrayal of these leaders.The 45-minute sequence of Nippon's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor is one of the greatest in film history. Never have I been so emotionally touched by a movie sequence, and I doubt that I will ever again. To see my country struck with such a blatant show of military aggression is disheartening and mind-blowing, but on screen, is truly captivating. A few tears came to my eye when I saw fellow Texan Doris "Dorie" Miller go against his appointed station and at the near expense of his life to man a machine gun on the deck of the U.S.S. West Virginia. Miller won the Navy Cross for his actions, and he deserved it. Some would say that Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s performance and Miller's scenes in this film were not needed, but I disagree...Dorie Miller's story must be told for posterity's sake, and this was the perfect venue for it.Of all of the fine performances of the film, Alec Baldwin's portrayal of then Colonel James Doolittle was the immediate stand-out. Baldwin showed a definite affinity for the pilot and commander, and his depiction of Doolittle shows this.I ask readers of this review who have not yet seen Pearl Harbor to do so. It is not as over long as many reviewers have stated, and its three-hour length moves along a brisk pace. I think it's important for Americans to see this film and realize the sacrifices that our grandparents and elders made in order to keep our nation and the world safe from tyranny. It's just too bad that it has to be a movie to finally put that point across.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, it's summer. It's blockbuster time. Take it with a grain of salt.War isn't pretty, or is it?The effects in this movie are pretty spectacular. The acting and script are pretty dreadful.But...See it on the big screen and be enveloped in the fight sequences and Hawaiian lighting. Don't expect much else but the spectacle and you won't be disappointed.What this movie really showed was that Ben Affleck is a MOVIE STAR. Everybody else in camera range just dissolved into the background whenever he was in the shot and I really didn't care all that much about the other characters or stories when he wasn't on screen. His acting wasn't the point here - he was just lit and shot beautifully. Not bad getting your own $145 million star vehicle after special effects. Josh Hartnett just became the bitter bridesmaid. Kate who? And what happened to Alec Baldwin's acting ability?!? Serious guffaws whenever he was delivering dialogue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The script that'll live in infamy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor may be victim of its own hype. The promotions thatbombarded the media as merciless as the Japanese attack,showed cheesy shots of children playing with planes that I sawbefore on the last 15 minutes of the movie Armageddon. My lowexpectations were met accordingly. Though the jaw-droppingrecreation of the attack of Pearl Harbor is worth the price of theticket alone, the movie was sandwiched with a story worthy of ascreenwriting 101 class. It all came down to money. To make thegamble they made with the budget less risky, they softened anddumbed down history, so the desirable audience of the samebraindead teens that make MTV so popular could watch it. Theblurry camera that was shamelessly used in scenes to mask thegore was laughably ridiculous. The acting was worthy of a TVmovie of the week, at least they kept a straight face saying theirgod-awful lines. The real life characters, not surprisingly, werebetter scripted than their fictional partners, what makes mewonder what'd happen if they based the whole story more in facts.Pearl Harbor would've been a great movie several years ago,before Saving Private Ryan raised the bar on war films. World WarII movies of decades past had the same cardboard stories andcharacters, but they were fine for their time. At least Michael Bayentertains us with the boomfest, and proves no other moviedirector blows up stuff better than him. The moral question is that ifthis real life tragedy should be made into a pop corn flick with lotsof explosions. If you want to see another World War II movie full ofpossibilities, but ruined with a cheesy love triangle, walk to the endof the hallway at the multiplex showing Pearl Harbor and catchEnemy at the Gates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fantasy, lousy history...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a work of complete fiction, Pearl Harbor works quite well. The plot is fairly interesting, albeit with a fairly slow and drawn-out start to the love story. The special effects are truly stunning - they're believable and there are a lot of them. The problem is, Pearl Harbor isn't supposed to be a work of complete fiction - it is supposed to be a history of a real event, interwoven with a fictional love story.It is here that Pearl Harbor fails, in the worst possible way. The retelling of Pearl Harbor is one-sided, one-dimensional and hence utterly false. This robs the film of its purpose, and for me destroyed any emotional impact of either the historical or the emotional/fictional aspects it entails.Probably the worst thing with this film is the intense racism it contains. From start to finish, the Japanese are portrayed as hateful, thoughtless robots with the exception of one character who's portrayed as doubt-filled - but only because he believes the attack may not benefit Japan. Of course, the American side is depicted as heroes and heroines every one...A few examples of this disparity: pretty much without exception, every single Japanese character in the film has a grimace, scowl, or look of death on his face; Americans are given all of the 'good' emotions (laughter, happiness, sadness, fear, etc. - but never hatred). Whenever an American dies, we're treated to a display of the humanity of the dying character; whenever a Japanese person dies, we see little if anything. (For example, only once do we see a Japanese pilot when his plane is shot down. He falls from the plane but the camera ignores him - he is, after all, only Japanese, not human). Americans only shoot planes and bomb buildings; people aren't "involved". Japanese are depicted as shooting at people instead of the planes they're standing next to; at drowning sailors instead of the ships they're drowning alongside. The whole film is set alongside US flags, US children playing, even Santa Claus gets an appearance. The only thing missing is the apple pie... The Japanese people, by contrast, make only two tiny appearances - some kids playing with a kite in the background of one scene, and a Japanese lady walking in the grounds of a house in another.I've never been tempted to walk out mid-film before. I was strongly tempted with Pearl Harbor, but didn't because I felt I shouldn't judge the film without seeing the whole thing. Now I've seen it, I find the result to be a very, very poor retelling of a historic event. See it as a work of fiction, or don't see it at all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Readers digest's condensed view of WWII pacific theater films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film begs the question, "Why bother?" Every aspect of this film has been done better in at least one movie. The love story cannot compare to "From Here to Eternity." The events at Pearl Harbor are surpassed by "Tora, Tora, Tora." The Doolittle raid was covered more enjoyably in "60 Seconds Over Tokyo." This film is a pale version of all those great movies. Was this movie great as some reviewers contend? Not when compared to those and "The Battle of Midway", "The Flying Leathernecks", or even "South Pacific". The CGI was impressive at some times and unwatchable at others. When crew members fell off the bombed out ships, they flew in parabolic arcs. Now I don't expect animators to be physics majors, but I would like them to have seen something fall. The "Top Gun" gimmickry was hard to take as well. Oh, look at the bad boys. Make sure you remember what they get chewed out for, because it's the secret weapon later on.Moving on to the events of the day. Yes, we were caught by surprise, though new evidence presents intriguing new questions to the debate. Yes, the bases were devastated. Yes, there were signs that any Monday morning quarterback could spot. But, as the attack happened, training took over. "Pearl Harbor" depicts most of those caught in the event to be wholly inept cowards. I've since gone back and reviewed some real footage of the event, and watched brave men strip machine guns from crippled planes while under fire, stepping in to take the place of those who are shot. Damage control teams fighting fires as enemy planes strafe. This movie is a disservice to all their memories. "If you want historical accuracy, go to the library" is what I believe one reviewer wrote. I have two very important questions for that reviewer, and all who believe that. Was Pearl Harbor such a boring event that lies need to be told in order to be entertaining? Did the brave men and women who chose to defend our country at a time when most turned their backs on the events in Europe and Asia need to be portrayed so poorly, and on the day that is reserved to commemorate them? Idiotic scenes of Americana saturate the beginning of the attack; a group of boys playing baseball, a woman hanging clothes on the line. IT WAS 7:00 IN THE MORNING! Does anyone who watched the movie know why Cuba Gooding Jr's character got a medal? I'll give you a hint. It was not for boxing.There are many wonderful stories yet to be told about Pearl Harbor, and CGI can bring that event to us more vividly than ever before, so save your praises for this horse. It's dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most offensive movie I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this schlockfest last night, and I am really offended. The name Pearl Harbor means something very solemn and sacred to this country, and there is something morally wrong about taking this subject matter and turning it into a brainless soap opera/thrill ride. I don't know which was lamer; the "love triangle" or the directors' efforts at historical accuracy (They didn't even depict the Japanese Admiral's reason for the attack correctly! duh.) When Hollywood decides to do a movie about an actual historical event, they have a responsibility to depict it accurately and with some taste. What a waste of all those millions of dollars. There were so many things that grated on my nerves, like the "nurses" who always traveled in a clump and looked like Veronica Lake wannabes. Hint to the directors - check out some actual pictures of nurses in the forties. They didn't look like that! They wore their hair up and were regular people. I was hoping somebody would steal their lipstick..then we would have seen real emotion! If the makers of "Pearl Harbor" were aiming to copy "Titanic", they did at least get one aspect down -- it was a disaster, all right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The good and bad of it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a frequent filmgoer, I have seen the trailers for Pearl Harbor probably 50 times in theaters, and they predisposed me to disliking the film. Then the reviews started coming out with one-star-out-of-four ratings, and my early bird friends were saying "good one hour movie that takes 3 hours" or "tolerate a lousy two and a half for an excellent half hour." So I finally went, with little enthusiasm. I was surprised that the movie seemed like about two hours, and that there were more acceptable minutes than expected; this moved it from one to two stars in my book. Still, the bad stuff is plentiful and truly awful.Some good things: Consistently excellent computer special effects, more authentic warbirds used than any other movie (at least in recent memory), a true sense of the horror of the bombing was brought to the audience, Jon Voight as Roosevelt, the fact that the film makers balanced the Japanese attack with our symbolic Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, fine Japanese actor Mako, some really convincing portrayals of Americans by quite a few British actors (these must have been requested by them, since there is hardly a shortage of American actors), Dan Aykroyd in another well done serious role, Mt. Fuji in the background of the U.S. Steel Plant in Gary, IndianaSome bad things: The very visible lines from lower lip to ears where the prosthetic chin was added to Jon Voight's much shorter one (fewer closeups would have helped...note to director; when using so much makeup, check the results before giving the go ahead for real filming!), Josh Hartnett (however, this guy would have been useful for any film where Tommy Lee Jones needs to have a flashback to his youth), repeated lack of faith by the filmmakers in the power of the historical truth (the correct number of Japanese planes, flying in correct formations, instead of the plague-of-locusts swarms they are shown buzzing around in, would have worked just as well), I know they were working with a modern carrier deck and whatever historic flying planes they could get their hands on, but let's use those computer effects to touch up the scenes (erase steam modern catapults, fill in obviously modern carrier deck shape, correct for engine and option differences in the Japanese planes), horrible and pointless and irritating and excessive slo-motion/soft focus effects, incredibly inappropriate and mood- breaking modern pop music at the end of the final scene.Most Missed Thing: One of the most important and inspiring things to come out of the attack on Pearl Harbor was the brilliant and resourceful resurrection of the harbor and some of its ships (some were refloated) in a very short period after the attack. This incredible effort helped put the USA back in the game. It was totally ignored in this movie; not even the slightest mention was made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brought Back Memories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know, I know!!! We are not supposed to like this film. And the revisionists who hate America think it is awful. But for me, as an old broad who was a child when Pearl was attacked, and remembers how scared we were, this really brought back memories of that time. I've just spent an hour reading all the bad reviews and comments on other boards, and it is amazing how many will not see the film but just KNOW it is horrible. I was caught up in the story of the farm boys learning to fly and ending up at Pearl on that fateful day. The romance is not unique, just as the thousands of romances of everyday people were not unique - just real. The sneak attact (and you have to really hate the U.S.A. to believe it could have been stopped and wasn't) is an intense 45 minutes and by the end had me in tears. People in my age range will probably be caught up in the memories as well. I watched the survivors of Pearl Harbor,who were consulted on their memories for the film, on the History Channel discussing the film and the all agree they are glad the film was made even though it was a "Hollywood version" of what happened. Just see it and decide for yourself. I gave it a 7 out of ten, so shoot me.</fullReview>

The love triangle depicted was completly uncredible, and even unintentionly funny at certain times. Alex Baldwin gave the only semi-credible performance as James Dolittle.

		<shortDescription>Why "Pearl Harbor" isn't great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor was a disappointment for many reasons. First, it is a 3-hour movie and it takes 2 hours to get to the 20 minute Pearl Harbor scene. This movie didn't even focus on the horror of Pearl Harbor...it focused on the cliche love story. The love story was weak with many horrible lines such as "It is cold here. My only source of warmth is thinking of you." Oh, c'mon. Get more creative than that! There are too many movies with the "I look at the sunset and think of you" stuff. This movie should have focused on Pearl Harbor. It got way too "Titanic-Like" with taking a real life situation and drowning it in an overdone love story. "Saving Private Ryan" didn't need a love story to get an emotional response from its audience. The special effects are great and the only reason to watch the movie. Otherwise, I feel horrible that the survivors of Pearl Harbor have to be given this movie to remember their acts of courage and bravery for our country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tora Tora Tora meets Romeo and Juliete</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was excited and eagerly anticipating the release of this film. So eager that the day it came out I went out and got tickets right after work for a late showing. However, I came into this movie with the wrong mindset. I came in anticipating this to be a huge modern version of "Tora Tora Tora" but with a story involved. Instead what I feel that I got was 3 hours of love story/Hollywood. From all the previews and specials on TV I was under the impression this movie was completely about the Battle of Pearl Harbor. I think the way this movie played out, the Battle did not even need to be in the movie, as far as I'm concerned it was as 'bout as relevent to the movie as a car chase scene would be to any action movie. I understand that without the story involved all you really have is a documentary with special effects. However I feel that the story took too much center stage. Many have compared this movie to Titanic and they do fall into the category of a story written around a historical tragedy. However I feel that in "Titanic" the story led up to the sinking and worked around the sinking. In the case of "Pearl Harbor", the battle came and went with the story still going on and I don't feel it changed any of the characters outlooks, opinions, or attitudes for that matter. I'm sorry but if I were to go through such a tragic ordeal, the last thing I would be thinking about is who loves who more. I think this movie gave us more love story and only touching on the historical events that led up to and prior to the attack. Basically this movie was about 2 pilots and a nurse they both love, I feel that as much emphasis as they gave to this part of the movie, the attack on Pearl Harbor could have merely been something one of them read in a newspaper. I am not going to give this movie a thumbs down, because the actual battle scene was outstanding minus the part about the 2 stars and their dogfight scenes. Check your history, I do think that only 2 planes actually made it off the ground but I don't think they came off an airfield nor did they do hot dog stunts either. Take a moment to remember those that have died and those who have survived to give you the freedom you have today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable, but has some problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***MAJOR SPOILERS***Although this picture invites comparison to Titanic, there will be no best picture nod for Pearl Harbor. Titanic was a love story within the backdrop of a sinking ship. It transcended all prior Titanic movies and disaster films. Pearl harbor, on the other hand, takes three historical events (the American's participation in the RAF pre-war, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and the Doolittle raid) and glues it together with a weak love story.Here are some bullets of why the movie could have been better:The female lead is a cardboard character. We never learn anything about her except that she is quick to fall in love and is a bit 'easy' for a 40's girl. The only reason that the men seem to fall in love with her is that she is good looking. From the beginning she is given to the viewers as a "nurse" and we don't get much more background on her character. It makes it hard to relate to the love story when we barely understand why either man would be interested in her, and we don't understand her at all. Moreso, it is also difficult to get involved with her story line later in the film when she finally gets some screen time that isn't just eye-candy.The love triangle doesn't really work from a dramatic standpoint. I mean there is no tension associated with it. For the whole Doolittle raid, I could have cared less who got killed and who came back. I figured it would be one of them that died, but didn't really care which one. It was not clear why the "nurse" would choose either of them over the other. I had no stake in either relationship and thus there was no dramatic tension. Do we care who she ends up with? Did it matter which one? Nope. It all just seems a bit strange to me, she was willing to take whichever survived. Weird.A minor point, but I thought about it during the film during the excessively *LONG* setup for the battle (the calm before the storm I guess). Heck if you are going to spend millions to make a film look historically accurate, then spend some money on some body makeup. Fact: soldiers (including the nurses) in the '40s stationed in Hawaii would have had serious tans. Tanning was considered healthy and the correlation with skin cancer had not yet been established. From what we see of these characters they spend a lot of time barely dressed on the beach, but they are as white as a sheet of paper.Our two pilots, last we see them, are in the air shooting down zeros. Yahoo this if fun! Next thing you know, they are in the hospital, "how can we help". As viewers, we totally loose the continuity of the film. I'm asking myself, uhhh... where did they come from? What happend to all their buddies at the airfield? Next thing you know they are helping with the Arizona (for about 15 second) and then they are back at the hospital. This was lame. It detracted and distracted from the film. Sure it provided a mechanism to show some melodramic scenes, but wouldn't a few secondary characters have been better to fill out this part of the story without causing it to be so choppy?Cuba. Ok, I love Cuba, but he is a token in this movie. His story line is totally contrived. For an actor that can add so much energy to a film, he is a token character with a pitiful add-on story. Unfortunately, his story doesn't fit with the rest of the narrative. When we all meet him and learn that all he wanted to do was to shoot a gun, we all know what is coming. Strange thing, in a blurt of exposition, we learn about why he wanted to join the Navy. Funny that we got that background on him with as little screen time as he had and we didn't even get that much background on the cardboard nurse. Hmmm. Guess this was a guy's flick so why bother with the women. Perhaps if this was an ensemble cast that followed several story lines, then Cuba's role would work. However, instread, we get the love story, with Cuba tacked on. Waste of talent and a waste of time.A long long long build up to the bombing scene. We get the long build up of the "life as usual" on Hawaii. See how unsuspecting they were. In case you didn't get it the first time, we will show you two other times that they have nothing to do at the hospital. Peaceful, peaceful, peaceful. And then the battle starts to commence, the Japanese start to move in, and we get the "calm before the storm" scenes. People walking about unawares that all hell is about to break loose. Boy that took a long time. I was happy when the first torpedo finally hit!The Doolittle raid. Ok, for those that say this is a love story like Titanic, explain the need for this raid to the dramatic structure of the film. It would have been a much better film if the Pearl Harbor bombing had been written to showcase the resolution of the love triangle. However, during the bombing, the love story is essentially on hold. Our boys just run around, oops now they're in a plane, no a hospital, no a boat, and then all of the sudden its over. Ok, now we are back to the love story, hmmm... what should we do. Ok, how about the Doolittle raid? Frankly by this point I was checking my watch. This whole raid could have been cut from the screenplay. I know that many of you will argue that the Doolittle raid puts the film in historical perspective. But that is not really what the movie is about... its about the love story. This is the biggest problem with the film, no dramatic direction, no dramatic tension.Who cared when Betty died? Show of hands? Me neither. A) it was predictable. B) she joined the army to meet boys, what an interesting character, not!How PC can you get? Heck, I liked the Japanese general... he seemed like a nice guy. Anybody that is complaining about anit-Japanese sentiment hasn't seen the film - it takes long strides not to villify the Japanese. And Cuba's role, though it hinted (just barely) at racism, didn't really have any meat - heck he seemed like he had a pretty good deal going. There were undertones of some sort of race related something, but no real story there. If you are going to make a statement - make it! Don't just tip toe around the subject. Heck, there was more about the Brit/Yank discrimination in the RAF than any sort of black/white thing.Unfortunately, from a directorial standpoint, this movie also draws comparisons to Armageddon. It suffers from many of the same problems. It tends to meander and loose direction and has no dramatic tension to pull the viewer from scene to scene. Armageddon didn't have that either. However, suffice it to say that it is a much more solid screenplay than Armageddon.Ok, now, after telling all of you why the film could have been better, I will say that it was basically watchable. There was enough of a story and enough of a historical interested that I was entertained. If I were you, I would go see it, but I bet you won't see it twice.I can't see rating it higher than a 5, unless you are pretty gullible for the melodramtic, predictable, Hollywood, and hackneyed. Its movies like these that makes me believe that I could make a living writing screenplays instead of reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An okay movie, but hardly up to all of the hype around it. The whole thing had very little to do with Pearl Harbor itself. I would've found it more interesting if the film started with the bombing, then we got 2 hours of Doolittle (Alec Baldwin) and the planned bombing raid on Tokyo.It wasn't poor, the film just seemed to drag in spots. A few quicker flashbacks rather than the first 45 minutes developing the story might've made the film a bit tighter and not so long. I found myself checking my watch many times during the movie thinking, "when are they gonna actually bomb Pearl Harbor" and "when does it end?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Combine 3 parts Casablanca, 2 parts From Here to Eternity, a dash of Tora! Tora! Tora!, a pinch of Dr. Strangelove, and Tom Seizemore as a Sargeant for color.Michael Bay's film seems to be an amalgamation of a number of other films, notably Casablanca, Tora! and Eternity. It lacks the poignancy of each of those films, instead filling 2 hours and 20 minutes of time with cliche-ridden and sappy dialogue, boring visuals and characters who are either flat and boring, or oversized caricatures of real figures. The remaining 40 minutes of the attack which gives the film its title is visually boring and sterile, failing to elicit any of the intense feelings one would normally associate with the "dastardly" attack by the naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. Instead, the audience is assaulted by machine gun chatter, ricochets, large explosions and CGI effects. But the attack lacks the human factor, failing to make the connection felt with the D-Day sequence of Saving Private Ryan. Instead, the audience feels numb as row after row of extras are mowed down like so many Star Trek red shirts, while the main characters standing beside them stand unscathed and unshaken.Even the real figures in the film are exaggerated beyond belief, to cliche status. Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s portrayal of Doris Miller feels tacked on to the film, Admiral Husban Kimmel is shown as a Sun-Tzu-esque figure, rather than the unimaginative line officer history has shown him to be, and Jon Voight's portrayal of FDR is almost laughably over the top, particularly in a scene reminiscent of Peter Seller's Dr. Strangelove. Worse still is the portrayal of the Japanese in the film, further insulted by the conglomeration of a number of Admirals into Mako's Admiral Yamamoto.The film is also rife with historical exaggerations and inaccuracies, particularly in dealing with the RAF Eagle Squadrons and the Doolittle raid on Tokyo.All in all, an unsatisfying waste of three hours better spent at the video store renting this film's predecessors.</fullReview>

This movie tries to touch too many people's lives. It felt like a soap opera stretched three hours with a lot of explosives and computer graphics..... The movie seemed like it couldn't decide whether it wanted to be funny or serious. It's neither. I remember a scene where a ship was sinking and a sailor say he can't swim, and audience laughs. There was one line by a Japanese pilot explaining why he is ready to throw his life. What about the black cook, who never shot a gun before until the chaos of the bombing pushed him to become extra courageous? The captain of the boat says one line to him the whole life, and when he is about to die, the black cook talks to him and comes to his coffin after the bombing as if the captain was his best friend. What was up with all the "unnecessary" shots of the girl in Hawaiian background? The Japanese admiral's lines were so biased....towards US. Unbelievable. Just very thin, very hollow, Hollywood movie. Typical Bruckheimer movie. Unnecessarily long. Nothing close to an epic movie. It's pretty much a dumb movie. Don't waste three hours of your life on this.... Waste only two hours in other movies. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since seeing Saving Private Ryan, I've been waiting for a war film to match up. It didn't happen with this turkey! Having been bombarded (no pun intended) by the trailers for Pearl Harbor for about five months, I was sure this was going to be great production. But not since seeing the Sun set in the west in The Green Berets have I been so outraged at having dropped twenty dollars! I had the impression that the film was about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. SILLY ME!!!! Actually, in a three hour film, anything remotely relavant to Pearl Harbor lasts about 35 minutes. There's an hour and a half of sophomoric love triangle between Affleck and Kate Beckinsale (who is'nt hard to look at!) and Josh Hartnett with the "who will live to get the girl!!!" angle (she can't have both!!) coupled with 20 minutes of childhood memories which I guess fell into the category of character development and about thirty minutes (the best minutes of the film) about Doolittle's raid on Tokyo. Bruckheimer must have been asleep while directing this film and after 10 minutes of love interest schlock, you should be too. Affleck looked as if he'd been bitten by a Tsetse fly and Jon Voight was almost nightmarish in his portrayal of FDR. I know Cuba Gooding Jr. was cast in the film for a reason, but since his role consisted of a boxing match and machine gunning a couple of Zero's, you wonder why he took the role. Oh yeah, did you catch the phrase "totally" which was used twice in the film, a la "Valley Girls???" Geez, I thought this was the 1940's!!! This film was so bad that even the wardrobes looked sloppy, uniforms that were ill fitting, hair styles that were sometimes questionable and hey, the SOUNDTRACK!!! (or lack of it!!) This would have been a perfect time to showcase the fantastic music of the 1940's and have it come alive for younger viewers that had never heard that music, but the soundtrack was conspicuous by it's abscence!! Almost like they did'nt want to pay the royalties for anything authentic, I think I heard about eight bars of Cole Porter and the rest sounded like 1941 Muzak!! I DID like the special effects and hats off the FX crew for their STUNNING performance!!! Quite a visual experience. In closing, there was a real missed opportunity here to entertain and inform, but instead we were offered "Days of Our Lives" mated up with "McHale's Navy!" Any historical perspective was avoided and I understand Disney is re editing the film for Japanese audiences to soften any suggestion that Imperial Japan was an aggressor in that era. At the rate our educational system is failing to give children a firm anchor in history, it's doubly sad that this film fell so short of the mark. In addition, I was hoping our World War II veterans and particulary Pearl Harbor veterans would have been more directly honored in the film. They ARE the Greatest Generation!! Well, I guess I'll just sit back and wait for the next attempt and hope Disney has nothing to do with it!! (Walt WOULD'NT be happy!!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having the romance angle is fine, such times do indeed take a toll on relationships. But one of the most pivital times of the modern era seems to take a backseat to this exagerated and predictable love triangle. When you had tears in your eyes, and I did, you also feel like you are being manipulated rather than feeling empathy for someone you have come to care about, to think of as real. The agony of war is not due to the extreme soap operas of the beautiful people that it creates, but the swath it cuts through every day ordinary folks, who feel the loss of their loved ones just as much. I would have liked to see much more focus on the shuffleing of power in the governments of both sides and the intel-crypto rooms of both sides etc. Regarding the Computer Graphics, its good. It still has a generated feel in some of the panaromic battle scenes, but the smaller shots where they are mixing real life and CG etc are really well done.

		<shortDescription>Why "Pearl Harbor" isn't great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor was a disappointment for many reasons. First, it is a 3-hour movie and it takes 2 hours to get to the 20 minute Pearl Harbor scene. This movie didn't even focus on the horror of Pearl Harbor...it focused on the cliche love story. The love story was weak with many horrible lines such as "It is cold here. My only source of warmth is thinking of you." Oh, c'mon. Get more creative than that! There are too many movies with the "I look at the sunset and think of you" stuff. This movie should have focused on Pearl Harbor. It got way too "Titanic-Like" with taking a real life situation and drowning it in an overdone love story. "Saving Private Ryan" didn't need a love story to get an emotional response from its audience. The special effects are great and the only reason to watch the movie. Otherwise, I feel horrible that the survivors of Pearl Harbor have to be given this movie to remember their acts of courage and bravery for our country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was excited and eagerly anticipating the release of this film. So eager that the day it came out I went out and got tickets right after work for a late showing. However, I came into this movie with the wrong mindset. I came in anticipating this to be a huge modern version of "Tora Tora Tora" but with a story involved. Instead what I feel that I got was 3 hours of love story/Hollywood. From all the previews and specials on TV I was under the impression this movie was completely about the Battle of Pearl Harbor. I think the way this movie played out, the Battle did not even need to be in the movie, as far as I'm concerned it was as 'bout as relevent to the movie as a car chase scene would be to any action movie. I understand that without the story involved all you really have is a documentary with special effects. However I feel that the story took too much center stage. Many have compared this movie to Titanic and they do fall into the category of a story written around a historical tragedy. However I feel that in "Titanic" the story led up to the sinking and worked around the sinking. In the case of "Pearl Harbor", the battle came and went with the story still going on and I don't feel it changed any of the characters outlooks, opinions, or attitudes for that matter. I'm sorry but if I were to go through such a tragic ordeal, the last thing I would be thinking about is who loves who more. I think this movie gave us more love story and only touching on the historical events that led up to and prior to the attack. Basically this movie was about 2 pilots and a nurse they both love, I feel that as much emphasis as they gave to this part of the movie, the attack on Pearl Harbor could have merely been something one of them read in a newspaper. I am not going to give this movie a thumbs down, because the actual battle scene was outstanding minus the part about the 2 stars and their dogfight scenes. Check your history, I do think that only 2 planes actually made it off the ground but I don't think they came off an airfield nor did they do hot dog stunts either. Take a moment to remember those that have died and those who have survived to give you the freedom you have today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable, but has some problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***MAJOR SPOILERS***Although this picture invites comparison to Titanic, there will be no best picture nod for Pearl Harbor. Titanic was a love story within the backdrop of a sinking ship. It transcended all prior Titanic movies and disaster films. Pearl harbor, on the other hand, takes three historical events (the American's participation in the RAF pre-war, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and the Doolittle raid) and glues it together with a weak love story.Here are some bullets of why the movie could have been better:The female lead is a cardboard character. We never learn anything about her except that she is quick to fall in love and is a bit 'easy' for a 40's girl. The only reason that the men seem to fall in love with her is that she is good looking. From the beginning she is given to the viewers as a "nurse" and we don't get much more background on her character. It makes it hard to relate to the love story when we barely understand why either man would be interested in her, and we don't understand her at all. Moreso, it is also difficult to get involved with her story line later in the film when she finally gets some screen time that isn't just eye-candy.The love triangle doesn't really work from a dramatic standpoint. I mean there is no tension associated with it. For the whole Doolittle raid, I could have cared less who got killed and who came back. I figured it would be one of them that died, but didn't really care which one. It was not clear why the "nurse" would choose either of them over the other. I had no stake in either relationship and thus there was no dramatic tension. Do we care who she ends up with? Did it matter which one? Nope. It all just seems a bit strange to me, she was willing to take whichever survived. Weird.A minor point, but I thought about it during the film during the excessively *LONG* setup for the battle (the calm before the storm I guess). Heck if you are going to spend millions to make a film look historically accurate, then spend some money on some body makeup. Fact: soldiers (including the nurses) in the '40s stationed in Hawaii would have had serious tans. Tanning was considered healthy and the correlation with skin cancer had not yet been established. From what we see of these characters they spend a lot of time barely dressed on the beach, but they are as white as a sheet of paper.Our two pilots, last we see them, are in the air shooting down zeros. Yahoo this if fun! Next thing you know, they are in the hospital, "how can we help". As viewers, we totally loose the continuity of the film. I'm asking myself, uhhh... where did they come from? What happend to all their buddies at the airfield? Next thing you know they are helping with the Arizona (for about 15 second) and then they are back at the hospital. This was lame. It detracted and distracted from the film. Sure it provided a mechanism to show some melodramic scenes, but wouldn't a few secondary characters have been better to fill out this part of the story without causing it to be so choppy?Cuba. Ok, I love Cuba, but he is a token in this movie. His story line is totally contrived. For an actor that can add so much energy to a film, he is a token character with a pitiful add-on story. Unfortunately, his story doesn't fit with the rest of the narrative. When we all meet him and learn that all he wanted to do was to shoot a gun, we all know what is coming. Strange thing, in a blurt of exposition, we learn about why he wanted to join the Navy. Funny that we got that background on him with as little screen time as he had and we didn't even get that much background on the cardboard nurse. Hmmm. Guess this was a guy's flick so why bother with the women. Perhaps if this was an ensemble cast that followed several story lines, then Cuba's role would work. However, instread, we get the love story, with Cuba tacked on. Waste of talent and a waste of time.A long long long build up to the bombing scene. We get the long build up of the "life as usual" on Hawaii. See how unsuspecting they were. In case you didn't get it the first time, we will show you two other times that they have nothing to do at the hospital. Peaceful, peaceful, peaceful. And then the battle starts to commence, the Japanese start to move in, and we get the "calm before the storm" scenes. People walking about unawares that all hell is about to break loose. Boy that took a long time. I was happy when the first torpedo finally hit!The Doolittle raid. Ok, for those that say this is a love story like Titanic, explain the need for this raid to the dramatic structure of the film. It would have been a much better film if the Pearl Harbor bombing had been written to showcase the resolution of the love triangle. However, during the bombing, the love story is essentially on hold. Our boys just run around, oops now they're in a plane, no a hospital, no a boat, and then all of the sudden its over. Ok, now we are back to the love story, hmmm... what should we do. Ok, how about the Doolittle raid? Frankly by this point I was checking my watch. This whole raid could have been cut from the screenplay. I know that many of you will argue that the Doolittle raid puts the film in historical perspective. But that is not really what the movie is about... its about the love story. This is the biggest problem with the film, no dramatic direction, no dramatic tension.Who cared when Betty died? Show of hands? Me neither. A) it was predictable. B) she joined the army to meet boys, what an interesting character, not!How PC can you get? Heck, I liked the Japanese general... he seemed like a nice guy. Anybody that is complaining about anit-Japanese sentiment hasn't seen the film - it takes long strides not to villify the Japanese. And Cuba's role, though it hinted (just barely) at racism, didn't really have any meat - heck he seemed like he had a pretty good deal going. There were undertones of some sort of race related something, but no real story there. If you are going to make a statement - make it! Don't just tip toe around the subject. Heck, there was more about the Brit/Yank discrimination in the RAF than any sort of black/white thing.Unfortunately, from a directorial standpoint, this movie also draws comparisons to Armageddon. It suffers from many of the same problems. It tends to meander and loose direction and has no dramatic tension to pull the viewer from scene to scene. Armageddon didn't have that either. However, suffice it to say that it is a much more solid screenplay than Armageddon.Ok, now, after telling all of you why the film could have been better, I will say that it was basically watchable. There was enough of a story and enough of a historical interested that I was entertained. If I were you, I would go see it, but I bet you won't see it twice.I can't see rating it higher than a 5, unless you are pretty gullible for the melodramtic, predictable, Hollywood, and hackneyed. Its movies like these that makes me believe that I could make a living writing screenplays instead of reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An okay movie, but hardly up to all of the hype around it. The whole thing had very little to do with Pearl Harbor itself. I would've found it more interesting if the film started with the bombing, then we got 2 hours of Doolittle (Alec Baldwin) and the planned bombing raid on Tokyo.It wasn't poor, the film just seemed to drag in spots. A few quicker flashbacks rather than the first 45 minutes developing the story might've made the film a bit tighter and not so long. I found myself checking my watch many times during the movie thinking, "when are they gonna actually bomb Pearl Harbor" and "when does it end?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Combine 3 parts Casablanca, 2 parts From Here to Eternity, a dash of Tora! Tora! Tora!, a pinch of Dr. Strangelove, and Tom Seizemore as a Sargeant for color.Michael Bay's film seems to be an amalgamation of a number of other films, notably Casablanca, Tora! and Eternity. It lacks the poignancy of each of those films, instead filling 2 hours and 20 minutes of time with cliche-ridden and sappy dialogue, boring visuals and characters who are either flat and boring, or oversized caricatures of real figures. The remaining 40 minutes of the attack which gives the film its title is visually boring and sterile, failing to elicit any of the intense feelings one would normally associate with the "dastardly" attack by the naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. Instead, the audience is assaulted by machine gun chatter, ricochets, large explosions and CGI effects. But the attack lacks the human factor, failing to make the connection felt with the D-Day sequence of Saving Private Ryan. Instead, the audience feels numb as row after row of extras are mowed down like so many Star Trek red shirts, while the main characters standing beside them stand unscathed and unshaken.Even the real figures in the film are exaggerated beyond belief, to cliche status. Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s portrayal of Doris Miller feels tacked on to the film, Admiral Husban Kimmel is shown as a Sun-Tzu-esque figure, rather than the unimaginative line officer history has shown him to be, and Jon Voight's portrayal of FDR is almost laughably over the top, particularly in a scene reminiscent of Peter Seller's Dr. Strangelove. Worse still is the portrayal of the Japanese in the film, further insulted by the conglomeration of a number of Admirals into Mako's Admiral Yamamoto.The film is also rife with historical exaggerations and inaccuracies, particularly in dealing with the RAF Eagle Squadrons and the Doolittle raid on Tokyo.All in all, an unsatisfying waste of three hours better spent at the video store renting this film's predecessors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[Spoiler Warning]In one word, it's a very thin movie. It follows the story of two best friends and a girl who becomes their love interest. This movie tries to touch too many people's lives. It felt like a soap opera stretched three hours with a lot of explosives and computer graphics..... The movie seemed like it couldn't decide whether it wanted to be funny or serious. It's neither. I remember a scene where a ship was sinking and a sailor say he can't swim, and audience laughs. There was one line by a Japanese pilot explaining why he is ready to throw his life. What about the black cook, who never shot a gun before until the chaos of the bombing pushed him to become extra courageous? The captain of the boat says one line to him the whole life, and when he is about to die, the black cook talks to him and comes to his coffin after the bombing as if the captain was his best friend. What was up with all the "unnecessary" shots of the girl in Hawaiian background? The Japanese admiral's lines were so biased....towards US. Unbelievable. Just very thin, very hollow, Hollywood movie. Typical Bruckheimer movie. Unnecessarily long. Nothing close to an epic movie. It's pretty much a dumb movie. Don't waste three hours of your life on this.... Waste only two hours in other movies. :)</fullReview>

I mean there is no tension associated with it. For the whole Doolittle raid, I could have cared less who got killed and who came back. I figured it would be one of them that died, but didn't really care which one. It was not clear why the "nurse" would choose either of them over the other. I had no stake in either relationship and thus there was no dramatic tension. Do we care who she ends up with? Did it matter which one? Nope. It all just seems a bit strange to me, she was willing to take whichever survived. Weird.A minor point, but I thought about it during the film during the excessively *LONG* setup for the battle (the calm before the storm I guess). Heck if you are going to spend millions to make a film look historically accurate, then spend some money on some body makeup. Fact: soldiers (including the nurses) in the '40s stationed in Hawaii would have had serious tans. Tanning was considered healthy and the correlation with skin cancer had not yet been established. From what we see of these characters they spend a lot of time barely dressed on the beach, but they are as white as a sheet of paper.Our two pilots, last we see them, are in the air shooting down zeros. Yahoo this if fun! Next thing you know, they are in the hospital, "how can we help". As viewers, we totally loose the continuity of the film. I'm asking myself, uhhh... where did they come from? What happend to all their buddies at the airfield? Next thing you know they are helping with the Arizona (for about 15 second) and then they are back at the hospital. This was lame. It detracted and distracted from the film. Sure it provided a mechanism to show some melodramic scenes, but wouldn't a few secondary characters have been better to fill out this part of the story without causing it to be so choppy?Cuba. Ok, I love Cuba, but he is a token in this movie. His story line is totally contrived. For an actor that can add so much energy to a film, he is a token character with a pitiful add-on story. Unfortunately, his story doesn't fit with the rest of the narrative. When we all meet him and learn that all he wanted to do was to shoot a gun, we all know what is coming. Strange thing, in a blurt of exposition, we learn about why he wanted to join the Navy. Funny that we got that background on him with as little screen time as he had and we didn't even get that much background on the cardboard nurse. Hmmm. Guess this was a guy's flick so why bother with the women. Perhaps if this was an ensemble cast that followed several story lines, then Cuba's role would work. However, instread, we get the love story, with Cuba tacked on. Waste of talent and a waste of time.A long long long build up to the bombing scene. We get the long build up of the "life as usual" on Hawaii. See how unsuspecting they were. In case you didn't get it the first time, we will show you two other times that they have nothing to do at the hospital. Peaceful, peaceful, peaceful. And then the battle starts to commence, the Japanese start to move in, and we get the "calm before the storm" scenes. People walking about unawares that all hell is about to break loose. Boy that took a long time. I was happy when the first torpedo finally hit!The Doolittle raid. Ok, for those that say this is a love story like Titanic, explain the need for this raid to the dramatic structure of the film. It would have been a much better film if the Pearl Harbor bombing had been written to showcase the resolution of the love triangle. However, during the bombing, the love story is essentially on hold. Our boys just run around, oops now they're in a plane, no a hospital, no a boat, and then all of the sudden its over. Ok, now we are back to the love story, hmmm... what should we do. Ok, how about the Doolittle raid? Frankly by this point I was checking my watch. This whole raid could have been cut from the screenplay. I know that many of you will argue that the Doolittle raid puts the film in historical perspective. But that is not really what the movie is about... its about the love story. This is the biggest problem with the film, no dramatic direction, no dramatic tension.Who cared when Betty died? Show of hands? Me neither. A) it was predictable. B) she joined the army to meet boys, what an interesting character, not!How PC can you get? Heck, I liked the Japanese general... he seemed like a nice guy. Anybody that is complaining about anit-Japanese sentiment hasn't seen the film - it takes long strides not to villify the Japanese. And Cuba's role, though it hinted (just barely) at racism, didn't really have any meat - heck he seemed like he had a pretty good deal going. There were undertones of some sort of race related something, but no real story there. If you are going to make a statement - make it! Don't just tip toe around the subject. Heck, there was more about the Brit/Yank discrimination in the RAF than any sort of black/white thing.Unfortunately, from a directorial standpoint, this movie also draws comparisons to Armageddon. It suffers from many of the same problems. It tends to meander and loose direction and has no dramatic tension to pull the viewer from scene to scene. Armageddon didn't have that either. However, suffice it to say that it is a much more solid screenplay than Armageddon.Ok, now, after telling all of you why the film could have been better, I will say that it was basically watchable. There was enough of a story and enough of a historical interested that I was entertained. If I were you, I would go see it, but I bet you won't see it twice.I can't see rating it higher than a 5, unless you are pretty gullible for the melodramtic, predictable, Hollywood, and hackneyed. Its movies like these that makes me believe that I could make a living writing screenplays instead of reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An okay movie, but hardly up to all of the hype around it. The whole thing had very little to do with Pearl Harbor itself. I would've found it more interesting if the film started with the bombing, then we got 2 hours of Doolittle (Alec Baldwin) and the planned bombing raid on Tokyo.It wasn't poor, the film just seemed to drag in spots. A few quicker flashbacks rather than the first 45 minutes developing the story might've made the film a bit tighter and not so long. I found myself checking my watch many times during the movie thinking, "when are they gonna actually bomb Pearl Harbor" and "when does it end?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Combine 3 parts Casablanca, 2 parts From Here to Eternity, a dash of Tora! Tora! Tora!, a pinch of Dr. Strangelove, and Tom Seizemore as a Sargeant for color.Michael Bay's film seems to be an amalgamation of a number of other films, notably Casablanca, Tora! and Eternity. It lacks the poignancy of each of those films, instead filling 2 hours and 20 minutes of time with cliche-ridden and sappy dialogue, boring visuals and characters who are either flat and boring, or oversized caricatures of real figures. The remaining 40 minutes of the attack which gives the film its title is visually boring and sterile, failing to elicit any of the intense feelings one would normally associate with the "dastardly" attack by the naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. Instead, the audience is assaulted by machine gun chatter, ricochets, large explosions and CGI effects. But the attack lacks the human factor, failing to make the connection felt with the D-Day sequence of Saving Private Ryan. Instead, the audience feels numb as row after row of extras are mowed down like so many Star Trek red shirts, while the main characters standing beside them stand unscathed and unshaken.Even the real figures in the film are exaggerated beyond belief, to cliche status. Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s portrayal of Doris Miller feels tacked on to the film, Admiral Husban Kimmel is shown as a Sun-Tzu-esque figure, rather than the unimaginative line officer history has shown him to be, and Jon Voight's portrayal of FDR is almost laughably over the top, particularly in a scene reminiscent of Peter Seller's Dr. Strangelove. Worse still is the portrayal of the Japanese in the film, further insulted by the conglomeration of a number of Admirals into Mako's Admiral Yamamoto.The film is also rife with historical exaggerations and inaccuracies, particularly in dealing with the RAF Eagle Squadrons and the Doolittle raid on Tokyo.All in all, an unsatisfying waste of three hours better spent at the video store renting this film's predecessors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since seeing Saving Private Ryan, I've been waiting for a war film to match up. It didn't happen with this turkey! Having been bombarded (no pun intended) by the trailers for Pearl Harbor for about five months, I was sure this was going to be great production. But not since seeing the Sun set in the west in The Green Berets have I been so outraged at having dropped twenty dollars! I had the impression that the film was about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. SILLY ME!!!! Actually, in a three hour film, anything remotely relavant to Pearl Harbor lasts about 35 minutes. There's an hour and a half of sophomoric love triangle between Affleck and Kate Beckinsale (who is'nt hard to look at!) and Josh Hartnett with the "who will live to get the girl!!!" angle (she can't have both!!) coupled with 20 minutes of childhood memories which I guess fell into the category of character development and about thirty minutes (the best minutes of the film) about Doolittle's raid on Tokyo. Bruckheimer must have been asleep while directing this film and after 10 minutes of love interest schlock, you should be too. Affleck looked as if he'd been bitten by a Tsetse fly and Jon Voight was almost nightmarish in his portrayal of FDR. I know Cuba Gooding Jr. was cast in the film for a reason, but since his role consisted of a boxing match and machine gunning a couple of Zero's, you wonder why he took the role. Oh yeah, did you catch the phrase "totally" which was used twice in the film, a la "Valley Girls???" Geez, I thought this was the 1940's!!! This film was so bad that even the wardrobes looked sloppy, uniforms that were ill fitting, hair styles that were sometimes questionable and hey, the SOUNDTRACK!!! (or lack of it!!) This would have been a perfect time to showcase the fantastic music of the 1940's and have it come alive for younger viewers that had never heard that music, but the soundtrack was conspicuous by it's abscence!! Almost like they did'nt want to pay the royalties for anything authentic, I think I heard about eight bars of Cole Porter and the rest sounded like 1941 Muzak!! I DID like the special effects and hats off the FX crew for their STUNNING performance!!! Quite a visual experience. In closing, there was a real missed opportunity here to entertain and inform, but instead we were offered "Days of Our Lives" mated up with "McHale's Navy!" Any historical perspective was avoided and I understand Disney is re editing the film for Japanese audiences to soften any suggestion that Imperial Japan was an aggressor in that era. At the rate our educational system is failing to give children a firm anchor in history, it's doubly sad that this film fell so short of the mark. In addition, I was hoping our World War II veterans and particulary Pearl Harbor veterans would have been more directly honored in the film. They ARE the Greatest Generation!!

		<fullReview>Some complain that this is just a romance with the bombing of Pearl Harbor as the backdrop, but I disagree. The romance fits in perfectly because any given soldier would probably have had a girl waiting for him back home (hence, the 1950's baby boom). It would almost be unrealistic to focus on individual WWII soldiers without a romance of some sort. I suppose that the film makers could have focused on the historical event without being too personal, but in so doing they would be leaving out an essential element of war, that the men and women who fight and die are real people like the rest of us.</fullReview>

They know that with enough advertising and coverage (good AND bad), enough popcorn chewing Joe Sixpacks will ante up to make them a pot more money to blow on making yet more appalingly bad films.Pearl Harbor is approximately 23 hours long, and has cast of seventy four million people. We all know Randall Wallace (Braveheart, Man in the Iron Mask) is a visionary - he keeps telling us so - but perhaps he could have considered getting some help with a project this big. The characters are shallow and uninvolving; I just don't *care* what happens to them, especially in the context of the actual important things going on around them.To be fair, Pearl Harbor isn't as great a travesty as Braveheart, but it's an over long, over hyped, under acted, under paced and just basically drab and awful and appallingly cynical and pointless piece of drivel.Dare to be different.

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is three hours long, and three hours stupid. I found it impossible not be offended by the movie, in part by its morals, and in part by its pathetic plot.It is filled with wooden dialogue (the best being 'World War Two has just started!' - which might make a French, German, Italian, English, Polish, etc veteran wonder what he had been fighting in since 1939), and horrible moments of contrived comic relief. Such as a guy who has a stutter, which is obviously supposed to be something we can all laugh at. Like people with mental and physical disabilities perhaps.Unfortunately, Pearl Harbor isn't just bad in terms of dialogue, acting, and romantic plot - it has a sour message. The attack was good because it let the U.S. join the war; the war was good because it allowed the U.S. to become strong and victorious and dominate the world. Japan's attack Pearl Harbor was sneaky and 'dastardly' - the U.S. attack on Tokyo was honorable. The final voice over at the end was insensitive film making. A better ending would have been simply: 'Four years after the attack on Pearl Harbor which killed over 3,000 Americans, the U.S. dropped two atomic weapons upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing over 100,000 Japanese...' That would have been the 'honorable' thing to do.If you have to watch this movie, watch it as an example of how awful movies can be, even with a budget this big.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor's technical aspects are astonishing but its plot is lacking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is a film that tries too hard to make too much money by giving us harrowing battles, Hollywood hunks, and a Hollywood romance. It's real focus should be to honor those who died at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.Michael Bay's trademark, flashy direction is quite evident here. In many of his shots and sequences it is quite apparent that his borrowing from Titanic and Saving Private Ryan.Randall Wallace's screenplay is overly clichéd and includes many one-dimensional characters. Many of the lines of dialogue are quite annoying and melodramatic. The performances are merely mediocre. Ben Affleck needed more expression and emotion both in his speech and facial expressions. Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett give average performances, but when they try to be emotional it's painfully clear that their emotions are forced and fake. Cuba Gooding Jr. overplays his character but his screen time is minimum so he's not as annoying as he would be. Jon Voight is very convincing as President Franklin D. Roosevelt and gives the best performance of the film.The pacing is both poor and excellent. The beginning of the film is rather slow. There's simply too much there and it bogs the film down. On the other hand, the editing for the battle scenes is appropriately face-paced and riveting.The CGI work and pyrotechnics of Pearl Harbor are first-rate. The sound effects and sound effects editing are also terrific.John Schwartzman's cinematography is reasonably good. His use of the `shaky cam' technique is reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan.Hans Zimmer's melodramatic musical score suits the vast scale of the film nicely.With a little bit more care placed in the editing, better actors, and a tighter script; Pearl Harbor could have been the gem it was made out to be through its extensive advertising.</fullReview>

Such as a guy who has a stutter, which is obviously supposed to be something we can all laugh at. Like people with mental and physical disabilities perhaps.Unfortunately, Pearl Harbor isn't just bad in terms of dialogue, acting, and romantic plot - it has a sour message. The attack was good because it let the U.S. join the war; the war was good because it allowed the U.S. to become strong and victorious and dominate the world. Japan's attack Pearl Harbor was sneaky and 'dastardly' - the U.S. attack on Tokyo was honorable. The final voice over at the end was insensitive film making. A better ending would have been simply: 'Four years after the attack on Pearl Harbor which killed over 3,000 Americans, the U.S. dropped two atomic weapons upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing over 100,000 Japanese...' That would have been the 'honorable' thing to do.If you have to watch this movie, watch it as an example of how awful movies can be, even with a budget this big.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Special Effects. Not so good story line.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I went to see this movie I heard that the reviews were going to be not so good for it. Friday I read the paper and it was excactely as I thought ,but since I don't like critics even though I have become one. I said I am going to see it. I did and I agree with the critics this time. First of all the Special Effects were absoultely awsome. I mean this is one of those movies where it is very hard to tell the anything digitaly created. It was just so great.. The plot is were I had problems It seemed that Ben Afflek and Josh Hartnet seemed to get into Every single major battle out of coincedence... Don't get me wrong it was good but it's not worth the hype.Grade 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor's technical aspects are astonishing but its plot is lacking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is a film that tries too hard to make too much money by giving us harrowing battles, Hollywood hunks, and a Hollywood romance. It's real focus should be to honor those who died at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.Michael Bay's trademark, flashy direction is quite evident here. In many of his shots and sequences it is quite apparent that his borrowing from Titanic and Saving Private Ryan.Randall Wallace's screenplay is overly clichéd and includes many one-dimensional characters. Many of the lines of dialogue are quite annoying and melodramatic. The performances are merely mediocre. Ben Affleck needed more expression and emotion both in his speech and facial expressions. Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett give average performances, but when they try to be emotional it's painfully clear that their emotions are forced and fake. Cuba Gooding Jr. overplays his character but his screen time is minimum so he's not as annoying as he would be. Jon Voight is very convincing as President Franklin D. Roosevelt and gives the best performance of the film.The pacing is both poor and excellent. The beginning of the film is rather slow. There's simply too much there and it bogs the film down. On the other hand, the editing for the battle scenes is appropriately face-paced and riveting.The CGI work and pyrotechnics of Pearl Harbor are first-rate. The sound effects and sound effects editing are also terrific.John Schwartzman's cinematography is reasonably good. His use of the `shaky cam' technique is reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan.Hans Zimmer's melodramatic musical score suits the vast scale of the film nicely.With a little bit more care placed in the editing, better actors, and a tighter script; Pearl Harbor could have been the gem it was made out to be through its extensive advertising.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Repeat after me: "It's only a movie."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as movies go this one has got something for everyone. It's got action, romance, beautiful scenery, and a bit of patriotism thrown in for good measure. If the critics and viewers who are commenting on this movie were around sixty or seventy years ago, no movie would have been worthy to see or have won an Oscar. On the other hand if you happen to love those old black and whites that were packed full of sappy romance and corny dialogue, then you'll love this movie as much as I did. Is it the best picture ever made? No. But it is a great movie just the same. I've heard a lot of people say that the first hour and a half is a waste and should have just been cut. Sure, it should have. Just jump right to the action scenes without knowing the characters who were involved. If this was strictly a movie about an important part of history, there would be no need to know the players, but this is a movie about how that one event, that most of us know only from our history books, actually effected those people who were involved. Maybe those who are saying that they didn't care about what happened to the characters are the same ones who feel that the first half of the movie should have ended up on the cutting room floor. Maybe if they had paid more attention that first hour and actually gotten to know the characters instead of simply waiting for the bombing scenes, they may have cared more about what happened to those characters. Is this movie a little corny? Perhaps to those who feel that the generation who actually lived through Pearl Harbor are old and corny. Many may think that these people are old fashioned and out of the loop, and perhaps that's why many think this movie is sappy, but you can't have a WWII movie without a little sappy romance thrown in. You can't have a lot of steamy, erotic love scenes among unmarried people. This was their life, and maybe they don't find it as corny and sappy as many do. I think the movie portrayed the Japanese in a very human way. They were not made out to be monsters or murderers, but people just like the Americans, who entered into a war. The hospital and bombing scenes were excellently done. I believe they helped convey the confusion and sadness that those who lived through the attack felt. If you have a heart you can't help but be moved by what these people went through. The movie might have portrayed the Tokyo bombing raid as righteous, but at the time it is was a victory for Americans. It proved that they couldn't so easily be beaten, that they would fight back. It was a boost to the American spirit. All in all I believe that Pearl Harbor is a great movie. Don't avoid seeing this movie because of what the critics have to say, and don't see this movie because of all the hype surrounding it. Go and see this movie because it is good entertainment, and it might just make you give a little bit more respect to your parents and grandparents after seeing a little bit of what they lived through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the subject matter for this type of movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets forget for a second, which is very easy to do in this movie, that the name of the film is Pearl Harbor. Let us forget for a moment that the horror of he attack scenes, something done very well, does not depict the reality of what happened. In other words, let us just look at this film for a moment as if it were a fantastical story created out of the minds of the people who worked on it. In that context this movie is not horrible.Saving Graces- What this movie truly has to draw on are a few things. First and foremost the special effects which are just dazzling. The team of Bay and Bruck did a wonderful job of creating reality on the screen and doing, if only for a moment, what every great WAR movie does and that is bring the action and the horror right to you. Secondly, the score and cinematography, which never gets a lot of attention since no one goes to the movies for that, is magnificant. It looks like old America, smells like old America, and at least sounds like an epic even if it doesn't exactly live up to that. Thirdly, Ben Affleck leads the list of a few wonderful acting jobs done on this film. Affleck, for the first time, looks like the leading man he is so often proclaimed as. At no time during his on screen perfromance did I beginning looking for Matt Damon or Bruce Willis to come and save him from being the focal point of the scene. He was everything a leading man must be, sensitive enough to appeal to the women and "kick-a%*" enough for the men. John Voight as a perfect FDR and Dan Akroyd as a fictional Japanese decoder are wonderful in the movie and everytime they go off screen you are hoping it won't be too long until they are back on.Not worth the money- Where this movie falls short, however, is in expressing a story, other than the invasion, that people actually care about. The love triangle is absurd and so uninvolving by the end no on cares who ends up with who. Kate Beckinsale, keep calling her Blanchett wich she most definetely not, plays the love torn nurse who, through a turn of events I will not reveal, falls in love with two childhood friends Rafe (Afflek) and Danny (Hartnett). Beckinsale is aweful and fails to show even the slightest bit of creative maturity when forced into scenes calling for her to be distraught. Hartnett, as opposed to Affleck, is a bore everytime he is on the screen and plays his part with about as much emotion as Al Gore on Valium. Though neither actor are given the break of having good lines, I still cannot get over the fact that the same man who wrote Braveheart penned this nightmare of a script, still neither showed the ability to carry even the most rudimentary emotions over the screen. In the most dramatic parts of the movie both of these characters react as if their nephews roomates cousins grilriends dog died of old age at 22 years old. There is no emotion, and the worst is Beckinsale who many times is caught dried eyed as she convulses from uncontrollable anguish. Not only is the acting horrible, the love story absurd, but it becomes an even greater blow to the movie when you realize that 80%, and I do mean 80% or more of this 31/2 movie is devoted to that same love story. It is absolutely amazing that SOOO much time could be spent on this story and by the end the characters remained severely underdeveloped and the audience apathetic to their eventual outcome.The real shame of this movie, and I didn't even touch on the end part which is actually too badly done to even be funny, is the fact that this movie not only could have been but SHOULD have been so much better. This wasn't named "Hawaiian Love" but it was named Pearl Harbor. Real men, real heroes, real people lived and died on that faithful day and because of that this movie is an insult. My grandfather was stationed in Pearl Harbor in 1941 and was lucky enough, three days before the attack, to put to sea. He returned two days after the attack, helped rebuild a fleet and bury men, and sometimes, on nights when maybe he had had a few to many beers, spoke of the tapping he had heard from the men trapped within the Arizona. This was not a movie that should or could have afforded misrepresentations of the truth, silly "two pilots vs. twenty, no problem" battle scenes, and most importantly, the idea that the amazing events of not only that day but the months that preceded it were not enough of a story to draw on. Having heard the tension and sorrow in my grandfathers voice as he told the stories of the friends he lost that day it is hard for me to care whether or not 12-14 year old girls need to see Josh Harnett without a shirt on to max out the dollars. This was a movie that SHOULD have focused on Pearl Harbor instead of treating it as an afterthought. Could you have included everyday reality of the people who lived the Pear Harbor experience, maybe even a less contrived love story? Most certainly, but only as a sattelite to the main story. In the end what this did was bring to the cinemas a $150 million extravaganza, with wonderful effects and huge explosions, that does not even attempt to honor the men who died there. How embarrassing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>could be worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was about to write a terrible review of this film, but on further reflection I thought otherwise. The movie, as it turns out, was better than I thought it was going to be. With Bruckhiemer at the helm, I totally thought the events of Dec 7, 1941 would be mangled into some kind of quasi American victory, complete with flag waving and people shouting, "follow me, men!"For the most part, I feel as though Pearl Harbor accurately depicted the sound thrashing the Americans received on that day.But I agree with most of the people here that the love story was pretty weak....possibly even lame.Also, the final third of the movie could have been deleted. I just saw no point to it. It simply should have ended at Pearl Harbor. I don't think Bruckhiemer could have slept at night without showing the Americans scoring some kind of victory.Furthermore, the naration at the end seems to indicate that the Doolittle raid on Tokyo is the turning point of the war. I think this just takes away from, and belittles the true turning point - the incredible Battle of Midway. I guess the Doolittle raid was easier to tack on the end than would Midway.The one thing I wish this film had more of was the Japanese perspective. Although the film did touch on it a couple times, I wish we could have seen more planning of the attack. Or perhaps some of the private thoughts of the Japanese Admiralty and the regular soldiers as they sailed across the sea to attack the "sleeping giant". Were they brimming with confidence, nervous, or down-right scared as I would be?As for the acting, it was fair considering the script they had to read from. John Voit was pretty good as FDR and I particularly enjoyed Dan Aykroyds character.I guess this is a case of viewer beware. Don't go there expecting the Pacific version of Private Ryan. If you treat it for what it is, entertaining summer fare, you might enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was Long, unsympathetic and a huge cliche altogether. I could even guess correctly what Evelyn's unborn son would be named : after his dad biological father of course!To say i was disappointed with the movie is an understatement. The love story is soooo flaky. The only part i like about the romance is when Evelyn's recount how she met Rafe to her fellow nurses while riding to NYC. That's the only thing enjoyable and remotely memorable in the entire movie.The worst part must be the reunion of the 2 lovers, Evelyn &amp; Rafe. There was no real emotions, it was like, the two saw each other, stand there for a few seconds, then Rafe calmly said to Evelyn, 'Hi i am still alive, come sit over there and we will do some catching up!'Where's the HUG? where's the raw emotions, the real joy, sadness, sweetness of finding back one's long lost love? maybe its just bad acting.Wallace is a credible writer, but this time round, he just lost it! maybe he tried to squeeze too many things into one single movie.And the much-hyped battle sequence, i really didn't feel sorry for the dead. it was just bomb bomb bomb. i wasn't that impressed. Maybe that's what one would call special effects over-exposure. its no more thrilling now that i get to see cutting edge special effects on every single movie, too saturated. it just isn't enough anymore for a movie to depend on special effects.Ultimately its the story-telling Hollywood. Time to go back to the basics! A good movie like 'As Good As It Gets' or "LA Confidential" needs to cutting edge special effects of any kind. it doesn't need to run 184 minutes of screen time and have thousands of extras!for those of you who haven't seen it, take a book along and read during the first hour and the last hour, in between the battle.good luck!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Hollywood Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think critics has been reading far too many negative Pearl reviews prior to formulating their own opinions. Many comment that the movie has too many historical inaccuracies, not enough on the "why" of the attack, and simply too much fluff away from the action. Note: Movie buffs--those who go for the pure entertainment value: This movie definitely entertains and charms the audience. It is the classic (in the best sense of the word) fantasy film where, in the end, the good guy rides away with the girl on a white stallion. It is by no means a precise historical documentary. Nor was it meant to be. Let's leave that task to the History channel. It is a Hollywood love story wrapped around two friends loving the same gal. The "day that will live in infamy" is the backdrop for this great movie...3+ hours of technologically advanced entertainment. Sure, the action was top notch, but so was the story.Without question, this is the best movie(A+)I've seen in a long time. Pearl Harbor 2001 should bring home all the academy awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully crafted saga when war came to our front door.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the critics comments about this movie, I almost didn't go to see it. Thank goodness, I have stopped counting on critics to determine my viewing. This movie was wonderfully done. It shows the age of innocence when the men who went to war still believed in the greatness of America and exemplified the dreams and hopes of the country.One of the complaints I heard was that the movie sounded too much like a 1940's movie. Yes, there was a reason for that. Perhaps because it took place during the 1940s and they wanted us to remember how life was back then.Of the interviews given by survivors of the attack, nearly all had declared how true to life this movie was. That they could remember the sounds of the bombs as they exploded, the screams and cries of the sailors who were far from ready to embark on a war, let alone have their very ships blown out from beneath them.The language, the actions, the hopes and expectations were authentically reflected in this movie. I can see this will become a classic in the coming years. Saving Private Ryan showed the abject horror of the Second World War. Pearl Harbor gave us a glimpse of the innocence and, perhaps the overt optimism, which was felt during this time. If anyone criticizes this movie for being too formulaic, perhaps they need to see the movies of the fifties and sixties made about WWII, From Here to Eternity, South Pacific and others. I feel this will be a classic. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, I did not plan to see this movie. However, I ended up watching it on opening day. My expectations weren't low, even though I've been hurt by numerous Bruckheimer-produced failures before (Con Air, Gone in Sixty Seconds, and worst of all, Armageddon). I went in with a LINE of people, filing quietly into a theater that was simply packed. However, even the mounds of hype didn't help me to enjoy this movie. It did not save me when the gaudy camera angles began, the sappy music flooded my ears, and the sh*t-script started spouting itself at my brain. My argument is not necessarily against the actors (who can't help who directs them, nor can they be blamed for the terrifyingly disgusting script), but it is against the script. The dialogue is, in a word, crappy. Frequent one-liners do NOT make a movie good, ever. The main target of the script seemed to make a love story (in a triangle, no doubt). The movie shouldn't have been named Pearl Harbor. Because of the disgusting plot, it should have been something like "Love Harbor" or "Disneyfied Crap". The latter embodies the movie very well, in that the movie was a Disneyed up recreation of overly patriotic views on something real. That isn't to say that the incidents that occurred surrounding the event weren't interesting. As a matter of fact, history is compelling and complex enough, filled with wonderful characters and story elements, that it doesn't need a poorly-written love triangle to motivate it. Whoever had their hands in writing the screenplay should cut them off, and spare us the annoying drivel that we see too often in Bruckheimer/Disney films. Not only did this movie try to make up boring stuff to fill in the gaps between explosions, but it also attempted to alter history. Why are the Japanese so cold and emotionless? Who knows? The only halfway sympathetic one was the admiral. In truth, the Japanese were supposed to give warning to the Americans prior to the assault, and were not aware that they were attacking unprepared targets. Yet, the movie refuses to acknowledge this, even going so far as to have a commanding officer gloating about surprising the sleeping Americans. In an attempt to be patriotic, Pearl Harbor also made the Americans heartless b****rds. No one cares, of course, because we all live in America and want to see ourselves winning all the time. That doesn't mean that it isn't horribly wrong. In the movie, we let the racial slurs fly and blow up Japanese just to blow them up. Never mind the fact that Ben Affleck's character had his as* kicked by the Germans less than an hour in... On, the topic of the explosions, I'm forced to say that I am not impressed. The explosions were actually pretty good, but there were far too few of them. Nothing cool happens until about two thirds of the way through, and then it ends before you want it to. The finale of the film, which does involve explosions, was dull and boring, and by that time I didn't care enough anyway. I was sleepy. And I WASN'T sleepy before the movie had started. The direction was pure Bay. That's not a horrible thing in and of itself, but it was like Bay to the Nth here, and THAT is a bad thing. Every second it was different angle, and each one was either in a contrasting color tone to the previous one, panning quickly, or shaking terribly. Not to mention the hospital scenes involving what looked like a digitally-added blur effect. Who thought of that? It was friggin' retarded. It was poorly-placed and didn't mix well with the rabid intercuts everywhere. And let's not forget the jittery "Cops"-esque following shots. I was surprised whenever I saw a smooth shot of ANYTHING in that theater. Movies are cool, and experimental direction is cool, but only when it doesn't result in me nearly having seizures. The movie was so nauseating, I could barely sit through it with opened eyes. I wanted to vomit, and not just because of the poor performances. The movie is best summed up with the ending, in which Beckinsale's character has to give a voiceover explanation of what you just spent three hours watching. Not only was the character giving the voiceover completely out of place in doing so, but if the movie had actually done its job of expressing anything you'd care about, the voiceover wouldn't be needed. It just seems like Bruckheimer and crew didn't care at all about this film. Instead of telling you a story that you care about, they're trying to tell you that they believe in what they made. Even then, it was a half-effort. Thanks for wasting nine of my dollars, guys. I didn't appreciate it. Then again, after looking at the script, I probably wouldn't have cared either. Don't watch this movie. Unless you're a total friggin' cretin, you won't enjoy it.</fullReview>

Even a monkey editing this movie could have chopped out half the movie : the complicated and crappy love story, the long and boring dog fights with the japanese fighters, the whole doolittle episode (but that would show America in a bad light!!). either that or else they shouldn't have named the movie "Pearl Harbour" as the name gives an impression of it being more factual or documentry like. This movie is "Saving Private Ryan" meets "Titanic" but ends up being worse than both of these movies (which were bad movies to start with!). Worse still Cuba gooding has no role in the movie !!really crappy movie except for the special effects on the bombing scenes, you will be contemplating walking out of the hall after the first half hour. ** 1/10 **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I certainly can't fault the special effects or pyrotechnics in the movie, it never seems to capture a sense of urgency. In short, the movie comes across as surreal, unengaging, and the characters remain shallow and undeveloped. The portrayal of americans as bumbling, lascivious drunks and playboys almost makes you want to root for the Japanese, who viewed the attack as a necessity to preserve their way of life, and to keep the Empire from crumbling. During the dogfighting scenes, you find yourself wondering who is shooting at whom, and when a plane finally explodes, you are left with a feeling of indifference. After watching this film, I felt as if I should have done something else for 3 hours, such as perhaps watch two other movies instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The team of Bay, Bruckheimer, and Ben do it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, first off let me say that Bay and Bruckheimer are an unstoppable duo. Together, they create some of the most memorable movies to date, and Pearl Harbor will be among those movies. The overall presentation of the movie was fantastic. With stylish camera angles and some very slick CG, the movie looked great. The acting was top-notch. Affleck, Harnett, and Beckinsdale all played the leads very well, and Voight was brilliant as Roosevelt. As far as the writing goes, the love story was a nice touch, but it seems to be a trend nowadays to attach romance to historical events, Titanic anyone? But I will say the love triangle scenario in this movie was far more interesting than Titanic's. The second act of the movie, the actual attack on Pearl Harbor, seemed rather familiar to me. Was this a remake of the 1970 classic "Tora!Tora!Tora!" ? I mean a lot of the scenes seemed like updated versions of "Tora!"...others were direct rip-offs, even some of the dialogue was taken directly from "Tora!" Aside from that little observation, the movie is very much worth watching. Whether you're a sucker for romance comedies, Greek tragedies, or all-out action flicks this movie has something for everyone. Just witnessing Affleck's color-changing face trick is worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good summer flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film.I also like reading about history. But I don't have to pay $8 to go to the local library and check out a book on Pearl Harbor and spend the next 2 weeks reading about it. It's for free. But it's also rather boring, too. Most historical books - hell, history itself - is boring.So I go to see films and see fiction interwoven into the fabric of reality - which of course is what the 2001 "Pearl Harbor" is.Hey, this movie is Hollywoodized - don't kid yourself. Facts about this raid are "dumbed" down for the overwight, hot-dog eating American audience. But who cares, right? If you want to read or see about what *really* happened in 1941, rent "Tora Tora Tora" in all of its bland, black-and-white boringness.But if you want to go see a rip-roaring "fun" movie - leave behind your history book and just have fun. Let me repeat myself."Just. Have. Fun!"There is a love story. Something about two guys chasing after the same woman. One of the men goes to Hawaii. The other to Britain to help our cousins stave off those dastardly Nazis. One of the two gets shot down, he's believe to be dead, yadda yadda yadda, something something, they do it in some hanging parachutes and then... the "real" reason we paid what we did to see this flick: the attack.You know, you gotta tip your hat to the Japanese military when you realize the sheer scope of the attack (hundreds of planes - broken up between high-altitude bombers, fighters and torpedo planes) and the damage they wrought (2,000-plus dead and more than a dozen ships hit in less than 2 hours).The entire attack - more than 30 minutes long but it seems like 10 minutes - is amazing. A few critics said the fx was worse than those seen on Titanic - I disagree. The aerial combat was breathtaking. The bombing and raking of Americans in the water was done extremely well. I found myself ducking from the bullets spat from the diving Zeros, much like I did during the opening of "Saving Private Ryan." And some of my favorite war footage didn't occur over the skies of Hawaii, but rather over Britain, when British and the American "Eagle Squadron" jumped from lumbering Nazi bombers near the British coast. Great footage - puts anything seen in "Memphis Belle" to shame in a hurry.OK, there were some cheesy points: two American fighters manage - ala Star Wars - to out-fly, out-gun and out-fx 7 Japanese Zeros, which of course was great to watch but totally bogus in real life. Sorry, when the odds in aerial combat are 3-1, the 1 will lose everytime. But that scene was balanced with Cuba Gooding's shootdown from the deck of a stricken ship of a diving torpedo bomber - great effects.Once the battle is completed, there is somewhat of a letdown, and it seems too long of a pause from when the bombs finish dropping over Oahu and when Doolittle's bombers drop American bombs on Tokyo. Still, this raid has seldom been touched by Hollywood, and it was refreshing to see.My favorite scenes from the whole movie were, of course, the ones shown on the previews months ago - tiny snippets of Americana throughout the Hawaiian Islands rudely brought up cold by these menacing - and yet beautiful - Japanese planes. A woman with wet clothes from a clothesline; boy scouts on a tromp through the hills; a baseball game. Beautiful, mesmerizing, and yes, menacing.My only regret - and something I was anticipated and was disappointed when it didn't occur - is that Bay failed to show snippes of Japanese everyday life in and around Tokyo suddenly ground to a halt as the B-25's roared overhead. There was one scene of several Japanese women looking up and running, as the bombers - getting kissed by ak-ak fire and smoke - can be seen in the corner of the screen at the top of a hill.Regardless, this is a great summer movie that *will* entertain you. C'mon folks - that's all movies can do. Not teach our kids history. They get school for that. And it's not to tell how things happened back then. The History Channel and our grandfathers are for that. This movie tells a good story. That' what you get for your $8 bucks.Enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lets forget for a second, which is very easy to do in this movie, that the name of the film is Pearl Harbor. Let us forget for a moment that the horror of he attack scenes, something done very well, does not depict the reality of what happened. In other words, let us just look at this film for a moment as if it were a fantastical story created out of the minds of the people who worked on it. In that context this movie is not horrible.Saving Graces- What this movie truly has to draw on are a few things. First and foremost the special effects which are just dazzling. The team of Bay and Bruck did a wonderful job of creating reality on the screen and doing, if only for a moment, what every great WAR movie does and that is bring the action and the horror right to you. Secondly, the score and cinematography, which never gets a lot of attention since no one goes to the movies for that, is magnificant. It looks like old America, smells like old America, and at least sounds like an epic even if it doesn't exactly live up to that. Thirdly, Ben Affleck leads the list of a few wonderful acting jobs done on this film. Affleck, for the first time, looks like the leading man he is so often proclaimed as. At no time during his on screen perfromance did I beginning looking for Matt Damon or Bruce Willis to come and save him from being the focal point of the scene. He was everything a leading man must be, sensitive enough to appeal to the women and "kick-a%*" enough for the men. John Voight as a perfect FDR and Dan Akroyd as a fictional Japanese decoder are wonderful in the movie and everytime they go off screen you are hoping it won't be too long until they are back on.Not worth the money- Where this movie falls short, however, is in expressing a story, other than the invasion, that people actually care about. The love triangle is absurd and so uninvolving by the end no on cares who ends up with who. Kate Beckinsale, keep calling her Blanchett wich she most definetely not, plays the love torn nurse who, through a turn of events I will not reveal, falls in love with two childhood friends Rafe (Afflek) and Danny (Hartnett). Beckinsale is aweful and fails to show even the slightest bit of creative maturity when forced into scenes calling for her to be distraught. Hartnett, as opposed to Affleck, is a bore everytime he is on the screen and plays his part with about as much emotion as Al Gore on Valium. Though neither actor are given the break of having good lines, I still cannot get over the fact that the same man who wrote Braveheart penned this nightmare of a script, still neither showed the ability to carry even the most rudimentary emotions over the screen. In the most dramatic parts of the movie both of these characters react as if their nephews roomates cousins grilriends dog died of old age at 22 years old. There is no emotion, and the worst is Beckinsale who many times is caught dried eyed as she convulses from uncontrollable anguish. Not only is the acting horrible, the love story absurd, but it becomes an even greater blow to the movie when you realize that 80%, and I do mean 80% or more of this 31/2 movie is devoted to that same love story. It is absolutely amazing that SOOO much time could be spent on this story and by the end the characters remained severely underdeveloped and the audience apathetic to their eventual outcome.The real shame of this movie, and I didn't even touch on the end part which is actually too badly done to even be funny, is the fact that this movie not only could have been but SHOULD have been so much better. This wasn't named "Hawaiian Love" but it was named Pearl Harbor. Real men, real heroes, real people lived and died on that faithful day and because of that this movie is an insult. My grandfather was stationed in Pearl Harbor in 1941 and was lucky enough, three days before the attack, to put to sea. He returned two days after the attack, helped rebuild a fleet and bury men, and sometimes, on nights when maybe he had had a few to many beers, spoke of the tapping he had heard from the men trapped within the Arizona. This was not a movie that should or could have afforded misrepresentations of the truth, silly "two pilots vs. twenty, no problem" battle scenes, and most importantly, the idea that the amazing events of not only that day but the months that preceded it were not enough of a story to draw on. Having heard the tension and sorrow in my grandfathers voice as he told the stories of the friends he lost that day it is hard for me to care whether or not 12-14 year old girls need to see Josh Harnett without a shirt on to max out the dollars. This was a movie that SHOULD have focused on Pearl Harbor instead of treating it as an afterthought. Could you have included everyday reality of the people who lived the Pear Harbor experience, maybe even a less contrived love story? Most certainly, but only as a sattelite to the main story. In the end what this did was bring to the cinemas a $150 million extravaganza, with wonderful effects and huge explosions, that does not even attempt to honor the men who died there. How embarrassing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>could be worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was about to write a terrible review of this film, but on further reflection I thought otherwise. The movie, as it turns out, was better than I thought it was going to be. With Bruckhiemer at the helm, I totally thought the events of Dec 7, 1941 would be mangled into some kind of quasi American victory, complete with flag waving and people shouting, "follow me, men!"For the most part, I feel as though Pearl Harbor accurately depicted the sound thrashing the Americans received on that day.But I agree with most of the people here that the love story was pretty weak....possibly even lame.Also, the final third of the movie could have been deleted. I just saw no point to it. It simply should have ended at Pearl Harbor. I don't think Bruckhiemer could have slept at night without showing the Americans scoring some kind of victory.Furthermore, the naration at the end seems to indicate that the Doolittle raid on Tokyo is the turning point of the war. I think this just takes away from, and belittles the true turning point - the incredible Battle of Midway. I guess the Doolittle raid was easier to tack on the end than would Midway.The one thing I wish this film had more of was the Japanese perspective. Although the film did touch on it a couple times, I wish we could have seen more planning of the attack. Or perhaps some of the private thoughts of the Japanese Admiralty and the regular soldiers as they sailed across the sea to attack the "sleeping giant". Were they brimming with confidence, nervous, or down-right scared as I would be?As for the acting, it was fair considering the script they had to read from. John Voit was pretty good as FDR and I particularly enjoyed Dan Aykroyds character.I guess this is a case of viewer beware. Don't go there expecting the Pacific version of Private Ryan. If you treat it for what it is, entertaining summer fare, you might enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was Long, unsympathetic and a huge cliche altogether. I could even guess correctly what Evelyn's unborn son would be named : after his dad biological father of course!To say i was disappointed with the movie is an understatement. The love story is soooo flaky. The only part i like about the romance is when Evelyn's recount how she met Rafe to her fellow nurses while riding to NYC. That's the only thing enjoyable and remotely memorable in the entire movie.The worst part must be the reunion of the 2 lovers, Evelyn &amp; Rafe. There was no real emotions, it was like, the two saw each other, stand there for a few seconds, then Rafe calmly said to Evelyn, 'Hi i am still alive, come sit over there and we will do some catching up!'Where's the HUG? where's the raw emotions, the real joy, sadness, sweetness of finding back one's long lost love? maybe its just bad acting.Wallace is a credible writer, but this time round, he just lost it! maybe he tried to squeeze too many things into one single movie.And the much-hyped battle sequence, i really didn't feel sorry for the dead. it was just bomb bomb bomb. i wasn't that impressed. Maybe that's what one would call special effects over-exposure. its no more thrilling now that i get to see cutting edge special effects on every single movie, too saturated. it just isn't enough anymore for a movie to depend on special effects.Ultimately its the story-telling Hollywood. Time to go back to the basics! A good movie like 'As Good As It Gets' or "LA Confidential" needs to cutting edge special effects of any kind. it doesn't need to run 184 minutes of screen time and have thousands of extras!for those of you who haven't seen it, take a book along and read during the first hour and the last hour, in between the battle.good luck!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Hollywood Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think critics has been reading far too many negative Pearl reviews prior to formulating their own opinions. Many comment that the movie has too many historical inaccuracies, not enough on the "why" of the attack, and simply too much fluff away from the action. Note: Movie buffs--those who go for the pure entertainment value: This movie definitely entertains and charms the audience. It is the classic (in the best sense of the word) fantasy film where, in the end, the good guy rides away with the girl on a white stallion. It is by no means a precise historical documentary. Nor was it meant to be. Let's leave that task to the History channel. It is a Hollywood love story wrapped around two friends loving the same gal. The "day that will live in infamy" is the backdrop for this great movie...3+ hours of technologically advanced entertainment. Sure, the action was top notch, but so was the story.Without question, this is the best movie(A+)I've seen in a long time. Pearl Harbor 2001 should bring home all the academy awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The team of Bay, Bruckheimer, and Ben do it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, first off let me say that Bay and Bruckheimer are an unstoppable duo. Together, they create some of the most memorable movies to date, and Pearl Harbor will be among those movies. The overall presentation of the movie was fantastic. With stylish camera angles and some very slick CG, the movie looked great. The acting was top-notch. Affleck, Harnett, and Beckinsdale all played the leads very well, and Voight was brilliant as Roosevelt. As far as the writing goes, the love story was a nice touch, but it seems to be a trend nowadays to attach romance to historical events, Titanic anyone? But I will say the love triangle scenario in this movie was far more interesting than Titanic's. The second act of the movie, the actual attack on Pearl Harbor, seemed rather familiar to me. Was this a remake of the 1970 classic "Tora!Tora!Tora!" ? I mean a lot of the scenes seemed like updated versions of "Tora!"...others were direct rip-offs, even some of the dialogue was taken directly from "Tora!" Aside from that little observation, the movie is very much worth watching. Whether you're a sucker for romance comedies, Greek tragedies, or all-out action flicks this movie has something for everyone. Just witnessing Affleck's color-changing face trick is worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good summer flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film.I also like reading about history. But I don't have to pay $8 to go to the local library and check out a book on Pearl Harbor and spend the next 2 weeks reading about it. It's for free. But it's also rather boring, too. Most historical books - hell, history itself - is boring.So I go to see films and see fiction interwoven into the fabric of reality - which of course is what the 2001 "Pearl Harbor" is.Hey, this movie is Hollywoodized - don't kid yourself. Facts about this raid are "dumbed" down for the overwight, hot-dog eating American audience. But who cares, right? If you want to read or see about what *really* happened in 1941, rent "Tora Tora Tora" in all of its bland, black-and-white boringness.But if you want to go see a rip-roaring "fun" movie - leave behind your history book and just have fun. Let me repeat myself."Just. Have. Fun!"There is a love story. Something about two guys chasing after the same woman. One of the men goes to Hawaii. The other to Britain to help our cousins stave off those dastardly Nazis. One of the two gets shot down, he's believe to be dead, yadda yadda yadda, something something, they do it in some hanging parachutes and then... the "real" reason we paid what we did to see this flick: the attack.You know, you gotta tip your hat to the Japanese military when you realize the sheer scope of the attack (hundreds of planes - broken up between high-altitude bombers, fighters and torpedo planes) and the damage they wrought (2,000-plus dead and more than a dozen ships hit in less than 2 hours).The entire attack - more than 30 minutes long but it seems like 10 minutes - is amazing. A few critics said the fx was worse than those seen on Titanic - I disagree. The aerial combat was breathtaking. The bombing and raking of Americans in the water was done extremely well. I found myself ducking from the bullets spat from the diving Zeros, much like I did during the opening of "Saving Private Ryan." And some of my favorite war footage didn't occur over the skies of Hawaii, but rather over Britain, when British and the American "Eagle Squadron" jumped from lumbering Nazi bombers near the British coast. Great footage - puts anything seen in "Memphis Belle" to shame in a hurry.OK, there were some cheesy points: two American fighters manage - ala Star Wars - to out-fly, out-gun and out-fx 7 Japanese Zeros, which of course was great to watch but totally bogus in real life. Sorry, when the odds in aerial combat are 3-1, the 1 will lose everytime. But that scene was balanced with Cuba Gooding's shootdown from the deck of a stricken ship of a diving torpedo bomber - great effects.Once the battle is completed, there is somewhat of a letdown, and it seems too long of a pause from when the bombs finish dropping over Oahu and when Doolittle's bombers drop American bombs on Tokyo. Still, this raid has seldom been touched by Hollywood, and it was refreshing to see.My favorite scenes from the whole movie were, of course, the ones shown on the previews months ago - tiny snippets of Americana throughout the Hawaiian Islands rudely brought up cold by these menacing - and yet beautiful - Japanese planes. A woman with wet clothes from a clothesline; boy scouts on a tromp through the hills; a baseball game. Beautiful, mesmerizing, and yes, menacing.My only regret - and something I was anticipated and was disappointed when it didn't occur - is that Bay failed to show snippes of Japanese everyday life in and around Tokyo suddenly ground to a halt as the B-25's roared overhead. There was one scene of several Japanese women looking up and running, as the bombers - getting kissed by ak-ak fire and smoke - can be seen in the corner of the screen at the top of a hill.Regardless, this is a great summer movie that *will* entertain you. C'mon folks - that's all movies can do. Not teach our kids history. They get school for that. And it's not to tell how things happened back then. The History Channel and our grandfathers are for that. This movie tells a good story. That' what you get for your $8 bucks.Enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The truth, as always, is somewhere in the middle. The movie doesn't suffer because it's somewhat historically inaccurate or isn't morally/politically satisfying. These are wholly beside the point; it's a FICTIONAL Hollywood epic. But is it a good movie, i.e. good entertainment? Well, no.It's beautifully, amazingly shot even if there are a few rather silly visual cliches and slo-mo drama. The battle sequences are very well done. The directing is fine, but not great. But the writing ruins it all. The dialogue is unbearably bad. The plot is convoluted and pointless -- exacerbated by the 3-hour running time and a syrupy, irritating score.Best plan is to arrive an hour late and leave an hour early and see the skillful cinematography &amp; effects in the middle. Bring headphones and listen to your favorite music thus preventing any stray dialogue from ruining the experience...or your dinner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The attack of Pearl Harbor, as shown in the film, could be a great resource for history classes. Other than that, this movie doesn't have many high points. I loved the trailer (Going to a lot of movies, I must have seen it 7 times), the music from The Thin Red Line fit perfectly. The trailer made it look like it was a grand epic, with a little love story to make romantics happy.Sadly, this is not the case. The first hour and 15 minutes (or so) of the film focuses mostly on the love story, and what will later become a love triangle. It is predictable, sappy, and overdone, not in an enjoyable way (as it was in You've Got Mail), but in a manner that becomes tiring all too quickly. At times you almost wish the Japanese would hurry up and bomb the place all ready, just so we can leave the pathetic attempt at romance alone.Then there's the music. If you want a good movie, you must have good music. If you saw the trailer, you know what I mean by good music. Music that stirs the soul, the moves you just by hearing it. This was not the music we had for Pearl Harbor. I will confess now than I've never been a huge Zimmer fan, but I do believe when the time calls for it he can do well. I wasn't expecting much, but even I was disappointed by his score. One point which stands out to me was when Affleck was chasing a bomber after the bombing, while music played in a background which would of fit better in a Saturday morning action cartoon than this movie. The score was uninspired, and the "great theme", which was Zimmer's excuse for rushing the rest of the music, wasn't all that profound.Another problem the film has is a contradiction between the script and the title. You would suppose the main characters would have us involved quite a bit with the events of Pearl Harbor. Sadly, the filmmakers are more concerned with telling their love story then what happened on the Infamous Day. The main characters get so off track, that another character (Cuba Gooding Jr.) has to be inserted into the story for no other reason than to have a point of view on Battleship Row during the bombing. The main characters are away from the action for the first half of the attack, and when they do enter they are not even involved in the major areas Pearl Harbor is known for. I have heard some comparisons between this film and Titanic. Though they both had love stories, Titanic was just as focused on the sinking of the ship as it was on its fictional tale of love. Pearl Harbor seems to be a love story which is interrupted by a bombing.I may be a fool, but I somewhat judge a movie by its trailer. This can be misleading, especially with comedies, but usually dramatic films give you a good idea of the story in the trailer. All in all, get Pearl Harbor on DVD, but watch the trailer and the battle scenes only. The rest is a waste of your time. Two stars out of four.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahhh, Got Any Gum?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is the deal with this movie. I went in to the theater expecting to see a movie about Pearl Harbor. After about 90 minutes, I did see this Pearl Harbor movie. This "Pearl Harbor" movie lasted at most one hour. After this two and a half hour romp, i was disgusted to see that there still was another 33 minutes left.For a film being called Pearl Harbor, there was very little focus on the events of Pearl Harbor. Instead the majority of the film was focusing on the love triangle between two boys fighting over the same girl. The problem with this was that the love was too artificial and not real at all. The characters seemed as though they were paper thin, and did not have any interest in one another.Although I will give credit where credit is due, when the movie stuck to its title, it was an exposition on a grand scale. The visuals of the bombing were stunning, and amazing. I was captivated for this 40-60 minute time period, that is about all. The other two hours were meaningless jargon gathered in an attempt to make this Disney's "Titanic." That is exactly what Disney got, a love story as pitiful as Titanic, with some nice visuals to try and compensate for where the movie lacks.While watching this movie, I felt myself just wanting to be watching other movies. I wanted to be watching "The Rock," another Michael Bay joint. This movie is better than Pearl Harbor, two fold. I also found myself wanting to watch Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. This is a much better telling of a war story.All in all, when going to see Pearl Harbor, I just expected to see a movie about Pearl Harbor. If I wanted a love story, I would have seen a film like Bounce, or When Harry Met Sally. Michael Bay should stick to what he is good at, and that is action. Pearl Harbor succeeds a great deal when it deals with action. It is too bad that it only lasts for about 40 minutes of a 180 minute film. Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film - only if it 'calls to mind'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers!It's a great film. But . . . . it IS cliched. Basically, what you have is a 21st century war propaganda film . . . about WWII. Remember now - after the movie - BUY WAR BONDS!Or, in other words, if the film works, at points, I think it's really for no other reason than that it was released on Memorial Day. I found it very moving when, toward the end, the dead still entombed in the Arizona Memorial, were mentioned by the narrator. If you identify with the love interest, and clearly the critics are loathe to do so, but where the sets and costumes and 'Francis-style' lighting encourage one to think 1940s . . 1940s, then she becomes a symbol; as you'd expect from a propaganda film. She's not just the 'dame' in the love triangle. Rather, she's the women who lost men in wartime, who served in the nursing core, both at Pearl and so many other places, and so forth. Frankly, I think Private Buckaroo, or Action in the North Atlantic, and Walking in the Sun, and so on, were better propaganda efforts, actually produced during the war. But . . . this is 2001, after all. In Titanic, the tacked on love story represented nothing but the characters, themselves, and badly at that. If Evelyn and the others are seen to represent so many others from that era, then Titanic, it's not.As for the characters, then, it's difficult to see Danny as a pilot. He doesn't look it any more than Cruise did in the much earlier Bruckheimer-fest of Top Gun (where the tacked on love story, there, was disastrous, and for the career of McGillis, as well - Kelly who?). Now Anthony Edwards, I believed. And one can imagine Rafe, both in England and elsewhere. Old photos from Britain, during the Battle of Britain, show 'fly-boys' who literally look like Hollywood's central-casting image of a fighter pilot - but for real. So Affleck is believable because . . he's that. He's the guy on the poster, telling you about those war bonds. Beckinsale's Evelyn is also nearly believable. But I think I believe the romance and proposal from the stuttering 'Red', much more easily.Ironically, I found the Doolittle Raid more involving than the sneak attack on Pearl. It's interesting that critics trying to demonstrate some command of history, here and elsewhere, forget conveniently that the attack was a secret, sneak attack. There was no 'warrior code' to be found, anywhere. It was purely a cowardly bombing run on a military base, one asleep and unaware than some particular country was literally now in a shooting war with the US. It was like the 'japs' shooting an unarmed country in the back, as it were. And it surely infuriated the American people - precisely - for that reason. That wasn't propaganda and lies. That was the reality. One could argue Roosevelt 'set it up', and so on, and so forth. But nobody made or forced the Imperial Japanese fleet to bomb the American Pacific Fleet when war had not even been declared. All for the Empire, when it was the very idea of that Japanese Empire which had to be defeated - as it was for Italy and Germany, and their '1000-year empires'. It's why the exploits of the sub crew in Das Boot, an extraordinary film, are such a tragedy - for their individual heroism, their 'imperial' cause rightly reduces them to playing the heavy.The Doolittle Raid seemed the better of the two key sequences only because more of the details seemed to be revealed. The plane crash in China may have been the most striking sequence. And historically the raid was a huge propaganda victory for the Allies who felt themselves clawing at the cliff of survival in the face of the Axis; and just as mentioned by the film's narrator, here. The raid on Pearl seemed a little light on such details. The smoke, for example, is almost absent when compared with photos and footage of just after the 2nd wave. In reality it looked like a massive tire fire, a firestorm. In the film, it looked like isolated smudge pots. The oil soaked sailors seemed believable. But the immediate rescue efforts seemed a little weak. They had more equipment than that ready to go. But film budgets are film budgets, even if they're huge. And where was the scout plane which led the attack? I thought surely that was the purpose of the opening scene in the duster - because of the visual similarity to the Japanese scout.Overall, sure . . . Rafe and Danny sink the carriers at Midway - well, if the film continued that long, sure it would have been Rafe. And he'd probably have been piloting the Enola Gay, as well, after having just single-handedly shot down a German mini-jet. Film makers can be excused for 'composite experiencing'. And such cliche as in this film is also - about - other films. It's not honest by itself. It calls . . to mind, other things. But if the critics wanted a good story, as they say, then they wouldn't make such a play about Shawshank - a hopelessly overrated effort - or American Beauty or other such wastes. That they pan this effort says nothing about filmmaking, and everything about agendas. I and others can have our agendas. And I most surely do. All those on imdb.com can have their agendas. And clearly many do. But critics tell us it's about the movies, for them - and they seem even less about the movies than the PR flacks which ginned up the Shawshank count here on this website. It's not so much that this film is 'critic proof'. I doubt few liked Raiders of the Lost Ark when first released. I think the LA guy panned it, only to have to quickly 'amend' his review a month or so, later (Champlin was his name?). It's really - why . .. . critics? I understand the concept. It's the execution that puzzles me. What the heck is a critic if he's just a Clinton-shilling Ebert, or some other slow-witted, mindless zealot who could care less about the steak, and prefers to tell the sizzle how it sounds? You know - guy - what about . . . the actual movie? That's what we're paying to see.</fullReview>

The battle scenes were great, and the acting wasn't bad, but this bore a striking resemblance to Armageddon, with a little Titanic thrown in. The love story aspect was annoying, failing to get my attention and historically, it was crap.SPOILER: For instance, Dolittle was ASSIGNED to go on the raid, it wasn't a choice.As well as that it was at least a half hour too long and it was predictable.SPOILER: For instance, it was easy to tell that Affleck was going to come back, he was top billed.Guys, stay away.

		<shortDescription>Special Effects: A+ rest of the movie: D-</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A technical marvel of a movie, the actual scenes of the attack were beautifully rendered (as we might expect from a major summer blockbuster). Like just about every film of its ilk, the filmmakers seem to have blown the entire budget on major stars and effects, with little thought about characters or dialogue.As in Titanic, we are introduced to several fictional characters and are expected to care enough about them to become involved in the movie. The exposition is weak however, as is the dialogue. As a result, the lead-up to the actual attack is nothing more than counting the number of "famous last words" lines: "Pearl Harbor? That's about as far from the war as you can get!"; "We feel that Pearl is the least likely spot for an attack."; etc.The main plot line, a love triangle between Rafe, Danny and Evelyn, is weakly set up. Danny's character is pretty weakly defined and the story arc is so predictable it is laughable.Donal Logue's South Carolinian redneck backwoodsman character in The Patriot, after fighting alongside a freed slave for most of a year, tells the man before battle "I'm honored to serve alongside you. Honored." It was all I could do to not laugh aloud in the theatre. This movie has a number of lines like this one -- Alec Baldwin's Jimmy Doolittle has to deliver several of them, making me wonder how many takes it took him to deliver his speeches with a straight face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to have a few words with Michael Bay. If you're going to have a love story in a war movie, make it deep and passionate, with acting worth the film it is stored on. The script was awful, with the most unrealistic dialogue ever, save personal injury attorney ads. But despite this hour plus of shallowness, I still watched this movie with an open mind. My mind, however, began forming harsher judgements about this movie as the Japanese appeared more and more. They were represented in the most ridiculous manner, with government meetings in outside teahouses, headband tying rituals for the fighter pilots, and percussion that practically cried "Stormtroopers!" overwhelming their scenes to boot. I was embarrassed for the Japanese to the same extreme that I was embarrassed for the way the Native Americans were represented in Dances With Wolves. Let's be honest, the whole world was scheming during this time. Why make the Japanese out to be barbarians? Yes, what they did to Pearl Harbor was devastatingly awful, but look what we did to Nagasaki and Hiroshima. We killed how many MILLION? And don't forget that generations today are still recovering from God-knows how many types of cancer those two bombs invoked. But, of course, the only U.S. retaliation pictured in this movie is a mere "pin-prick," as Alec Baldwin puts it. I fear the kind of stereotyped pretense the term "Japanese" will carry in the minds of those under 10 who see this movie. On a more positive note, it would be hard to overlook the amazing action sequences, and I wonder not how $135 million was spent on this movie. I just wish that the breathtaking views of this attack were in a movie that involved a higher standard of acting and scripting. I walked in with hopes (even, dare I say, expectations!) of seeing another semi-historical movie in ranks with tasteful greats such as JFK, Braveheart, Schindler's List, Apocalypse Now, and Rambo III (just kidding) but walked out feeling like I had seen an action packed v</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ending, subject make this movie awful....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that upon leaving the theatre I had what you might call an ok feeling about this movie. Like so many people I ran the gammot of emotions with this movie; very excited about its release and then very skeptical after the awful reviews it received even before opening night. Going on Saturday my expectations were low and by that time I do not think it was going to take much for those expectations to be if not passed then at least met. Upon further reflection, however, I realized how good this movie could have been and how much of a disgrace it ended up being. The only reason to see this movie on the big screen is the 40 minute battle scene that actually depicts the attack on Pearl Harbor(remember the movie is over 3 hrs long) The effects are breathtaking and the depiction of this horror is actually very well done. Unfortunately that is about all that is done well. Now, leaving the film what disturbed me the most was the end. I will not give anything away but EVERYTHING after the attack on Pearl Harbor is tedious, predictable, and sometimes down right laughable. Alec Baldwin, who supposedly steals the movie according to some critcs, is amazingly bad for such a small role. His lines are all cliched to the max and his mannerism's'are prototypical old-school army man. Affleck is ok and gets the most out of a bad script, delivering some not so funny lines in a funny way and not so poignant lines with surprising feeling. Voight as FDR is great and Akroyd, though not in it much, is a pleasure to watch. Besides that the rest of the acting is extremely poor. Hartnett gives an amazingly un-emotional performance and even though the script gave few chances for any character development Hartnett, for a supposedly budding star and heart-throb, is overshadowed by anyone on screen with him. Blanchet, as the love torn nurse, is only watchable during the battle scene when she does a good job of mixing the horror of the moment with the need to stay calm to help injured service men. Though gorgeous onscreen, and she has the look of an old style movie star in this film, Blanchet does not convince the audience of any true emotion during the film. FYI Michael Bay, if you have casted an actress who cannot cry when asked to, use age old methods to draw out the tears. Too many times, in moments when Blanchets character should be distraught, she remains dry eyed, while pretending to sob.As I said, at first the major problem I had with this flick was the ending, which is about as bad an endig as you can get, and I do mean the entire hour of film after the attack. After having a day to think about it however, I realized what a disgrace this movie was and how Bay and Bruck used a horrible moment in American history to make an overly-hyped, big booming action flick that will make money. Granted nothing may ever reach the accuracy of Saving Private Ryan or even Platoon, yet this movie really makes no attempt to relate the seriousness of the moment. This was Armageddon and The Rock, with the same effects, the same "one or two men can take on an army" concept, and an emphasis on horribly cliched moments and phrases. This movie could have been a wondeful depiction of that terrible day in 1941, could have brought the horrors of war, and espacially naval and air combat, home, and could have still done most of this while including a less time consuming, non-sensical love triangle. You may say, "why do we need the horrors of war brought home once again, whats the matter with a more light-hearted movie." You may have a point, but when dealing with REAL events it seems to me that the people who died must be honored, and honoring them means getting what ACTUALLY happened right. The fact that Bay and Bruck made little attempt to get all the details right is horrible. At least Titanic, another movie I am not in love with, made a good attempt to get history right and in the end focused the movie away from the Leo, Kate love fest and on he carnage that ensued. This movie fails not only as a product, that is a run of the mill movie, but also fails horribly as a cinematic repesentation of history. Veterans, who were honored, and righfully so, by the power of Ryan should be insulted by the almost insignificant role there horrible day plays in this film. Only 40 minutes devoted to Pearl Harbor in a movie named Pearl Harbor(that runs 3 hours)? An almost anxious jump away from the action back to the love-story? This not only fails as a movie, at least a $150 million movie, but also insults what many of our grandfathers and even grandmothers went through. For that, and that alone, stay away from this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Desperate Titanic Wanna-be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start by saying that for quite a while I was looking forward to seeing this movie--that first teaser trailer blew me away, and just having seen that made me want to go out and see it. So I waited the months and the months until about a week before it came out, and I was reading some horrendous reviews from some of the finest critics out there. The one that made me go and see this movie was from Harry Knowles, who I usually tend to agree with about movies. So I went in expecting a fine film, and came out having seen a movie that is just about as bad a movie as you can get(with maybe the exception of Batman and Robin, or The Mummy Returns). The whole love story is wholly unoriginal and extrememly uninspired. Throughout the whole movie you just know what's going to happen next between Danny, Rafe, and Evelyn. I had the ending of the movie figured out almost right after the Pearl Harbor attack, which, for my money, is the highlight of the movie(the only highlight, by the way). The movie was WAAAAY too long(I got up to go to the bathroom twice, and didn't care at all that I missed some of the movie). Probably the finest performance of the movie was given by Leland Orser(the killer from the Bone Collector), the man that Evelyn saves in the hospital. John Schwartzmann's cinematography is excellent, as usual, as is Hans Zimmers score. I'm truly sad that the movie turned out the way that it did, because it had so many things going for it--an incredibly cinematic event, good actors(they're not great actors by any standard), a very cinematic director who COULD be great if he had the right script and the right producer, and a very accomplished composer. Unfortunately, it also has a VERY weak script from Randall Wallace, writer of Braveheart(who is blatantly ripping off James Cameron's Titanic here in almost every respect), terrible acting from almost all sides, and again it's length--and I usually love a 3-hour movie. But not here. This movie should have ended after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, but it couldn't do that--the studio heads have to sell this movie to the teenage girls who wouldn't know if this was historically accurate or not(it wasn't, for the most part). It makes me truly sad that this movie is going to be a huge moneymaker--I doubt if it will be the next Titanic, but it might make about 300 million or so. In closing, I'll just say that the only reason I would go to see this movie, or even recommend it, is the bombing sequence(or the first 25 minutes, at least). It is sad when a films visual effects are its finest accomplishment, but that is the sad fact here. God help the future of american cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed in so many ways...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mention of the two words Pearl Harbor conjures up so many different emotions. One in particular, is sorrow. Another is anger, and with hindsight, regret.When I think of Pearl Harbor, I view it as the day that the U.S. lost its innocence and its reluctance into entering WWII wilfully. Even critics of the U.S. Military policy would be hard-pressed to see this day of infamy as anything but.Over 3000 people died, most of them, even before they even had a chance to know what hit them. To them, a motion picture that would document and help us to remember the spirit of these brave men and women would go a long way for the rest of us to remember them by and to never forget what sacrifice for love of country really is.That being said, this movie doesn't even come close to render justice to those who lost their lives. In fact, this movie trivializes and may down the road; even contribute to the falsification of its memory. That is even beside the fact that it's an awful movie. ****** THERE ARE SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THIS PORTION OF THE REVIEW. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE, DO NOT READ ON (OR READ ON AT YOUR OWN PERIL) ******What is the point of showing lots of stuff being blown up and planes whizzing around doing acrobatic tricks in a historical context?This is confusing for me because for a film that wants to 'accurately' depict what it was like to be there, it sure likes to gloss over the human component. Why are explosions, crashes, bullets, fire, ships sinking and pilots rah-rahing are given absolute cinematographic clarity and visceral impact, yet the hospital wards filled with the burned, the wounded, the dying and the dead - the result of such a blatant act of war - blurred almost to the point where they're nothing more than figures pawing their way through the ether?I certainly abhor pain and suffering, but in this case, blurring and softening the human plight of this attack doesn't offer a counter-point to the pyrotechnics we're seeing. It removes the consequences of using instruments of mass destruction, and it certainly doesn't help us re-sensitise ourselves to the fact that regardless of what this war was about or who started it, it was messy, dangerous and tragic. I think we're past the point where we can make overly-glorified movies that forget their sense of history and perspective. Back in the late 40s and early 50s, they could justify their glorifications due to the Hayes code, and the massive debt of sensitivity owed to the men and women of the Armed forces, who still had these events fresh in their minds. You would think 60 years would be enough to give a more sound perspective. Apparently, for some movie directors and producers, it's not enough time, nor a compelling enough reason.Had the premise of this movie were to be a video-game or a popcorn movie, then my chief criticisms would be the lackadaisical acting, the boring love triangle, and the simply awful dialogue in places. `Just get me into a plane' says our square-jawed hero. Sounds like a 12-year old wanting to get into those virtual video-game rides down at the arcade centre.But this movie can cause more damage than simply be a vessel of bad acting, bad dialogue or story. It has the potential to re-write history like it was an arcade game, and worse, make us forget what really transpired on December 7th, 1941.If this movie makes mountains of cash, it will be a testimony on how we consumers effectively turn historical moments into trivia, and our ability to draw understanding from tragedy reduced to terms of bankability.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good War, Bad Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The attack of Pearl Harbor, as shown in the film, could be a great resource for history classes. Other than that, this movie doesn't have many high points. I loved the trailer (Going to a lot of movies, I must have seen it 7 times), the music from The Thin Red Line fit perfectly. The trailer made it look like it was a grand epic, with a little love story to make romantics happy.Sadly, this is not the case. The first hour and 15 minutes (or so) of the film focuses mostly on the love story, and what will later become a love triangle. It is predictable, sappy, and overdone, not in an enjoyable way (as it was in You've Got Mail), but in a manner that becomes tiring all too quickly. At times you almost wish the Japanese would hurry up and bomb the place all ready, just so we can leave the pathetic attempt at romance alone.Then there's the music. If you want a good movie, you must have good music. If you saw the trailer, you know what I mean by good music. Music that stirs the soul, the moves you just by hearing it. This was not the music we had for Pearl Harbor. I will confess now than I've never been a huge Zimmer fan, but I do believe when the time calls for it he can do well. I wasn't expecting much, but even I was disappointed by his score. One point which stands out to me was when Affleck was chasing a bomber after the bombing, while music played in a background which would of fit better in a Saturday morning action cartoon than this movie. The score was uninspired, and the "great theme", which was Zimmer's excuse for rushing the rest of the music, wasn't all that profound.Another problem the film has is a contradiction between the script and the title. You would suppose the main characters would have us involved quite a bit with the events of Pearl Harbor. Sadly, the filmmakers are more concerned with telling their love story then what happened on the Infamous Day. The main characters get so off track, that another character (Cuba Gooding Jr.) has to be inserted into the story for no other reason than to have a point of view on Battleship Row during the bombing. The main characters are away from the action for the first half of the attack, and when they do enter they are not even involved in the major areas Pearl Harbor is known for. I have heard some comparisons between this film and Titanic. Though they both had love stories, Titanic was just as focused on the sinking of the ship as it was on its fictional tale of love. Pearl Harbor seems to be a love story which is interrupted by a bombing.I may be a fool, but I somewhat judge a movie by its trailer. This can be misleading, especially with comedies, but usually dramatic films give you a good idea of the story in the trailer. All in all, get Pearl Harbor on DVD, but watch the trailer and the battle scenes only. The rest is a waste of your time. Two stars out of four.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is the deal with this movie. I went in to the theater expecting to see a movie about Pearl Harbor. After about 90 minutes, I did see this Pearl Harbor movie. This "Pearl Harbor" movie lasted at most one hour. After this two and a half hour romp, i was disgusted to see that there still was another 33 minutes left.For a film being called Pearl Harbor, there was very little focus on the events of Pearl Harbor. Instead the majority of the film was focusing on the love triangle between two boys fighting over the same girl. The problem with this was that the love was too artificial and not real at all. The characters seemed as though they were paper thin, and did not have any interest in one another.Although I will give credit where credit is due, when the movie stuck to its title, it was an exposition on a grand scale. The visuals of the bombing were stunning, and amazing. I was captivated for this 40-60 minute time period, that is about all. The other two hours were meaningless jargon gathered in an attempt to make this Disney's "Titanic." That is exactly what Disney got, a love story as pitiful as Titanic, with some nice visuals to try and compensate for where the movie lacks.While watching this movie, I felt myself just wanting to be watching other movies. I wanted to be watching "The Rock," another Michael Bay joint. This movie is better than Pearl Harbor, two fold. I also found myself wanting to watch Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. This is a much better telling of a war story.All in all, when going to see Pearl Harbor, I just expected to see a movie about Pearl Harbor. If I wanted a love story, I would have seen a film like Bounce, or When Harry Met Sally. Michael Bay should stick to what he is good at, and that is action. Pearl Harbor succeeds a great deal when it deals with action. It is too bad that it only lasts for about 40 minutes of a 180 minute film. Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers!It's a great film. But . . . . it IS cliched. Basically, what you have is a 21st century war propaganda film . . . about WWII. Remember now - after the movie - BUY WAR BONDS!Or, in other words, if the film works, at points, I think it's really for no other reason than that it was released on Memorial Day. I found it very moving when, toward the end, the dead still entombed in the Arizona Memorial, were mentioned by the narrator. If you identify with the love interest, and clearly the critics are loathe to do so, but where the sets and costumes and 'Francis-style' lighting encourage one to think 1940s . . 1940s, then she becomes a symbol; as you'd expect from a propaganda film. She's not just the 'dame' in the love triangle. Rather, she's the women who lost men in wartime, who served in the nursing core, both at Pearl and so many other places, and so forth. Frankly, I think Private Buckaroo, or Action in the North Atlantic, and Walking in the Sun, and so on, were better propaganda efforts, actually produced during the war. But . . . this is 2001, after all. In Titanic, the tacked on love story represented nothing but the characters, themselves, and badly at that. If Evelyn and the others are seen to represent so many others from that era, then Titanic, it's not.As for the characters, then, it's difficult to see Danny as a pilot. He doesn't look it any more than Cruise did in the much earlier Bruckheimer-fest of Top Gun (where the tacked on love story, there, was disastrous, and for the career of McGillis, as well - Kelly who?). Now Anthony Edwards, I believed. And one can imagine Rafe, both in England and elsewhere. Old photos from Britain, during the Battle of Britain, show 'fly-boys' who literally look like Hollywood's central-casting image of a fighter pilot - but for real. So Affleck is believable because . . he's that. He's the guy on the poster, telling you about those war bonds. Beckinsale's Evelyn is also nearly believable. But I think I believe the romance and proposal from the stuttering 'Red', much more easily.Ironically, I found the Doolittle Raid more involving than the sneak attack on Pearl. It's interesting that critics trying to demonstrate some command of history, here and elsewhere, forget conveniently that the attack was a secret, sneak attack. There was no 'warrior code' to be found, anywhere. It was purely a cowardly bombing run on a military base, one asleep and unaware than some particular country was literally now in a shooting war with the US. It was like the 'japs' shooting an unarmed country in the back, as it were. And it surely infuriated the American people - precisely - for that reason. That wasn't propaganda and lies. That was the reality. One could argue Roosevelt 'set it up', and so on, and so forth. But nobody made or forced the Imperial Japanese fleet to bomb the American Pacific Fleet when war had not even been declared. All for the Empire, when it was the very idea of that Japanese Empire which had to be defeated - as it was for Italy and Germany, and their '1000-year empires'. It's why the exploits of the sub crew in Das Boot, an extraordinary film, are such a tragedy - for their individual heroism, their 'imperial' cause rightly reduces them to playing the heavy.The Doolittle Raid seemed the better of the two key sequences only because more of the details seemed to be revealed. The plane crash in China may have been the most striking sequence. And historically the raid was a huge propaganda victory for the Allies who felt themselves clawing at the cliff of survival in the face of the Axis; and just as mentioned by the film's narrator, here. The raid on Pearl seemed a little light on such details. The smoke, for example, is almost absent when compared with photos and footage of just after the 2nd wave. In reality it looked like a massive tire fire, a firestorm. In the film, it looked like isolated smudge pots. The oil soaked sailors seemed believable. But the immediate rescue efforts seemed a little weak. They had more equipment than that ready to go. But film budgets are film budgets, even if they're huge. And where was the scout plane which led the attack? I thought surely that was the purpose of the opening scene in the duster - because of the visual similarity to the Japanese scout.Overall, sure . . . Rafe and Danny sink the carriers at Midway - well, if the film continued that long, sure it would have been Rafe. And he'd probably have been piloting the Enola Gay, as well, after having just single-handedly shot down a German mini-jet. Film makers can be excused for 'composite experiencing'. And such cliche as in this film is also - about - other films. It's not honest by itself. It calls . . to mind, other things. But if the critics wanted a good story, as they say, then they wouldn't make such a play about Shawshank - a hopelessly overrated effort - or American Beauty or other such wastes. That they pan this effort says nothing about filmmaking, and everything about agendas. I and others can have our agendas. And I most surely do. All those on imdb.com can have their agendas. And clearly many do. But critics tell us it's about the movies, for them - and they seem even less about the movies than the PR flacks which ginned up the Shawshank count here on this website. It's not so much that this film is 'critic proof'. I doubt few liked Raiders of the Lost Ark when first released. I think the LA guy panned it, only to have to quickly 'amend' his review a month or so, later (Champlin was his name?). It's really - why . .. . critics? I understand the concept. It's the execution that puzzles me. What the heck is a critic if he's just a Clinton-shilling Ebert, or some other slow-witted, mindless zealot who could care less about the steak, and prefers to tell the sizzle how it sounds? You know - guy - what about . . . the actual movie? That's what we're paying to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A technical marvel of a movie, the actual scenes of the attack were beautifully rendered (as we might expect from a major summer blockbuster). Like just about every film of its ilk, the filmmakers seem to have blown the entire budget on major stars and effects, with little thought about characters or dialogue.As in Titanic, we are introduced to several fictional characters and are expected to care enough about them to become involved in the movie. The exposition is weak however, as is the dialogue. As a result, the lead-up to the actual attack is nothing more than counting the number of "famous last words" lines: "Pearl Harbor? That's about as far from the war as you can get!"; "We feel that Pearl is the least likely spot for an attack."; etc.The main plot line, a love triangle between Rafe, Danny and Evelyn, is weakly set up. Danny's character is pretty weakly defined and the story arc is so predictable it is laughable.Donal Logue's South Carolinian redneck backwoodsman character in The Patriot, after fighting alongside a freed slave for most of a year, tells the man before battle "I'm honored to serve alongside you. Honored." It was all I could do to not laugh aloud in the theatre. This movie has a number of lines like this one -- Alec Baldwin's Jimmy Doolittle has to deliver several of them, making me wonder how many takes it took him to deliver his speeches with a straight face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to have a few words with Michael Bay. If you're going to have a love story in a war movie, make it deep and passionate, with acting worth the film it is stored on. The script was awful, with the most unrealistic dialogue ever, save personal injury attorney ads. But despite this hour plus of shallowness, I still watched this movie with an open mind. My mind, however, began forming harsher judgements about this movie as the Japanese appeared more and more. They were represented in the most ridiculous manner, with government meetings in outside teahouses, headband tying rituals for the fighter pilots, and percussion that practically cried "Stormtroopers!" overwhelming their scenes to boot. I was embarrassed for the Japanese to the same extreme that I was embarrassed for the way the Native Americans were represented in Dances With Wolves. Let's be honest, the whole world was scheming during this time. Why make the Japanese out to be barbarians? Yes, what they did to Pearl Harbor was devastatingly awful, but look what we did to Nagasaki and Hiroshima. We killed how many MILLION? And don't forget that generations today are still recovering from God-knows how many types of cancer those two bombs invoked. But, of course, the only U.S. retaliation pictured in this movie is a mere "pin-prick," as Alec Baldwin puts it. I fear the kind of stereotyped pretense the term "Japanese" will carry in the minds of those under 10 who see this movie. On a more positive note, it would be hard to overlook the amazing action sequences, and I wonder not how $135 million was spent on this movie. I just wish that the breathtaking views of this attack were in a movie that involved a higher standard of acting and scripting. I walked in with hopes (even, dare I say, expectations!) of seeing another semi-historical movie in ranks with tasteful greats such as JFK, Braveheart, Schindler's List, Apocalypse Now, and Rambo III (just kidding) but walked out feeling like I had seen an action packed v</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ending, subject make this movie awful....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that upon leaving the theatre I had what you might call an ok feeling about this movie. Like so many people I ran the gammot of emotions with this movie; very excited about its release and then very skeptical after the awful reviews it received even before opening night. Going on Saturday my expectations were low and by that time I do not think it was going to take much for those expectations to be if not passed then at least met. Upon further reflection, however, I realized how good this movie could have been and how much of a disgrace it ended up being. The only reason to see this movie on the big screen is the 40 minute battle scene that actually depicts the attack on Pearl Harbor(remember the movie is over 3 hrs long) The effects are breathtaking and the depiction of this horror is actually very well done. Unfortunately that is about all that is done well. Now, leaving the film what disturbed me the most was the end. I will not give anything away but EVERYTHING after the attack on Pearl Harbor is tedious, predictable, and sometimes down right laughable. Alec Baldwin, who supposedly steals the movie according to some critcs, is amazingly bad for such a small role. His lines are all cliched to the max and his mannerism's'are prototypical old-school army man. Affleck is ok and gets the most out of a bad script, delivering some not so funny lines in a funny way and not so poignant lines with surprising feeling. Voight as FDR is great and Akroyd, though not in it much, is a pleasure to watch. Besides that the rest of the acting is extremely poor. Hartnett gives an amazingly un-emotional performance and even though the script gave few chances for any character development Hartnett, for a supposedly budding star and heart-throb, is overshadowed by anyone on screen with him. Blanchet, as the love torn nurse, is only watchable during the battle scene when she does a good job of mixing the horror of the moment with the need to stay calm to help injured service men. Though gorgeous onscreen, and she has the look of an old style movie star in this film, Blanchet does not convince the audience of any true emotion during the film. FYI Michael Bay, if you have casted an actress who cannot cry when asked to, use age old methods to draw out the tears. Too many times, in moments when Blanchets character should be distraught, she remains dry eyed, while pretending to sob.As I said, at first the major problem I had with this flick was the ending, which is about as bad an endig as you can get, and I do mean the entire hour of film after the attack. After having a day to think about it however, I realized what a disgrace this movie was and how Bay and Bruck used a horrible moment in American history to make an overly-hyped, big booming action flick that will make money. Granted nothing may ever reach the accuracy of Saving Private Ryan or even Platoon, yet this movie really makes no attempt to relate the seriousness of the moment. This was Armageddon and The Rock, with the same effects, the same "one or two men can take on an army" concept, and an emphasis on horribly cliched moments and phrases. This movie could have been a wondeful depiction of that terrible day in 1941, could have brought the horrors of war, and espacially naval and air combat, home, and could have still done most of this while including a less time consuming, non-sensical love triangle. You may say, "why do we need the horrors of war brought home once again, whats the matter with a more light-hearted movie." You may have a point, but when dealing with REAL events it seems to me that the people who died must be honored, and honoring them means getting what ACTUALLY happened right. The fact that Bay and Bruck made little attempt to get all the details right is horrible. At least Titanic, another movie I am not in love with, made a good attempt to get history right and in the end focused the movie away from the Leo, Kate love fest and on he carnage that ensued. This movie fails not only as a product, that is a run of the mill movie, but also fails horribly as a cinematic repesentation of history. Veterans, who were honored, and righfully so, by the power of Ryan should be insulted by the almost insignificant role there horrible day plays in this film. Only 40 minutes devoted to Pearl Harbor in a movie named Pearl Harbor(that runs 3 hours)? An almost anxious jump away from the action back to the love-story? This not only fails as a movie, at least a $150 million movie, but also insults what many of our grandfathers and even grandmothers went through. For that, and that alone, stay away from this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Desperate Titanic Wanna-be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start by saying that for quite a while I was looking forward to seeing this movie--that first teaser trailer blew me away, and just having seen that made me want to go out and see it. So I waited the months and the months until about a week before it came out, and I was reading some horrendous reviews from some of the finest critics out there. The one that made me go and see this movie was from Harry Knowles, who I usually tend to agree with about movies. So I went in expecting a fine film, and came out having seen a movie that is just about as bad a movie as you can get(with maybe the exception of Batman and Robin, or The Mummy Returns). The whole love story is wholly unoriginal and extrememly uninspired. Throughout the whole movie you just know what's going to happen next between Danny, Rafe, and Evelyn. I had the ending of the movie figured out almost right after the Pearl Harbor attack, which, for my money, is the highlight of the movie(the only highlight, by the way). The movie was WAAAAY too long(I got up to go to the bathroom twice, and didn't care at all that I missed some of the movie). Probably the finest performance of the movie was given by Leland Orser(the killer from the Bone Collector), the man that Evelyn saves in the hospital. John Schwartzmann's cinematography is excellent, as usual, as is Hans Zimmers score. I'm truly sad that the movie turned out the way that it did, because it had so many things going for it--an incredibly cinematic event, good actors(they're not great actors by any standard), a very cinematic director who COULD be great if he had the right script and the right producer, and a very accomplished composer. Unfortunately, it also has a VERY weak script from Randall Wallace, writer of Braveheart(who is blatantly ripping off James Cameron's Titanic here in almost every respect), terrible acting from almost all sides, and again it's length--and I usually love a 3-hour movie. But not here. This movie should have ended after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, but it couldn't do that--the studio heads have to sell this movie to the teenage girls who wouldn't know if this was historically accurate or not(it wasn't, for the most part). It makes me truly sad that this movie is going to be a huge moneymaker--I doubt if it will be the next Titanic, but it might make about 300 million or so. In closing, I'll just say that the only reason I would go to see this movie, or even recommend it, is the bombing sequence(or the first 25 minutes, at least). It is sad when a films visual effects are its finest accomplishment, but that is the sad fact here. God help the future of american cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed in so many ways...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mention of the two words Pearl Harbor conjures up so many different emotions. One in particular, is sorrow. Another is anger, and with hindsight, regret.When I think of Pearl Harbor, I view it as the day that the U.S. lost its innocence and its reluctance into entering WWII wilfully. Even critics of the U.S. Military policy would be hard-pressed to see this day of infamy as anything but.Over 3000 people died, most of them, even before they even had a chance to know what hit them. To them, a motion picture that would document and help us to remember the spirit of these brave men and women would go a long way for the rest of us to remember them by and to never forget what sacrifice for love of country really is.That being said, this movie doesn't even come close to render justice to those who lost their lives. In fact, this movie trivializes and may down the road; even contribute to the falsification of its memory. That is even beside the fact that it's an awful movie. ****** THERE ARE SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THIS PORTION OF THE REVIEW. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE, DO NOT READ ON (OR READ ON AT YOUR OWN PERIL) ******What is the point of showing lots of stuff being blown up and planes whizzing around doing acrobatic tricks in a historical context?This is confusing for me because for a film that wants to 'accurately' depict what it was like to be there, it sure likes to gloss over the human component. Why are explosions, crashes, bullets, fire, ships sinking and pilots rah-rahing are given absolute cinematographic clarity and visceral impact, yet the hospital wards filled with the burned, the wounded, the dying and the dead - the result of such a blatant act of war - blurred almost to the point where they're nothing more than figures pawing their way through the ether?I certainly abhor pain and suffering, but in this case, blurring and softening the human plight of this attack doesn't offer a counter-point to the pyrotechnics we're seeing. It removes the consequences of using instruments of mass destruction, and it certainly doesn't help us re-sensitise ourselves to the fact that regardless of what this war was about or who started it, it was messy, dangerous and tragic. I think we're past the point where we can make overly-glorified movies that forget their sense of history and perspective. Back in the late 40s and early 50s, they could justify their glorifications due to the Hayes code, and the massive debt of sensitivity owed to the men and women of the Armed forces, who still had these events fresh in their minds. You would think 60 years would be enough to give a more sound perspective. Apparently, for some movie directors and producers, it's not enough time, nor a compelling enough reason.Had the premise of this movie were to be a video-game or a popcorn movie, then my chief criticisms would be the lackadaisical acting, the boring love triangle, and the simply awful dialogue in places. `Just get me into a plane' says our square-jawed hero. Sounds like a 12-year old wanting to get into those virtual video-game rides down at the arcade centre.But this movie can cause more damage than simply be a vessel of bad acting, bad dialogue or story. It has the potential to re-write history like it was an arcade game, and worse, make us forget what really transpired on December 7th, 1941.If this movie makes mountains of cash, it will be a testimony on how we consumers effectively turn historical moments into trivia, and our ability to draw understanding from tragedy reduced to terms of bankability.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good War, Bad Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The attack of Pearl Harbor, as shown in the film, could be a great resource for history classes. Other than that, this movie doesn't have many high points. I loved the trailer (Going to a lot of movies, I must have seen it 7 times), the music from The Thin Red Line fit perfectly. The trailer made it look like it was a grand epic, with a little love story to make romantics happy.Sadly, this is not the case. The first hour and 15 minutes (or so) of the film focuses mostly on the love story, and what will later become a love triangle. It is predictable, sappy, and overdone, not in an enjoyable way (as it was in You've Got Mail), but in a manner that becomes tiring all too quickly. At times you almost wish the Japanese would hurry up and bomb the place all ready, just so we can leave the pathetic attempt at romance alone.Then there's the music. If you want a good movie, you must have good music. If you saw the trailer, you know what I mean by good music. Music that stirs the soul, the moves you just by hearing it. This was not the music we had for Pearl Harbor. I will confess now than I've never been a huge Zimmer fan, but I do believe when the time calls for it he can do well. I wasn't expecting much, but even I was disappointed by his score. One point which stands out to me was when Affleck was chasing a bomber after the bombing, while music played in a background which would of fit better in a Saturday morning action cartoon than this movie. The score was uninspired, and the "great theme", which was Zimmer's excuse for rushing the rest of the music, wasn't all that profound.Another problem the film has is a contradiction between the script and the title. You would suppose the main characters would have us involved quite a bit with the events of Pearl Harbor. Sadly, the filmmakers are more concerned with telling their love story then what happened on the Infamous Day. The main characters get so off track, that another character (Cuba Gooding Jr.) has to be inserted into the story for no other reason than to have a point of view on Battleship Row during the bombing. The main characters are away from the action for the first half of the attack, and when they do enter they are not even involved in the major areas Pearl Harbor is known for. I have heard some comparisons between this film and Titanic. Though they both had love stories, Titanic was just as focused on the sinking of the ship as it was on its fictional tale of love. Pearl Harbor seems to be a love story which is interrupted by a bombing.I may be a fool, but I somewhat judge a movie by its trailer. This can be misleading, especially with comedies, but usually dramatic films give you a good idea of the story in the trailer. All in all, get Pearl Harbor on DVD, but watch the trailer and the battle scenes only. The rest is a waste of your time. Two stars out of four.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahhh, Got Any Gum?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is the deal with this movie. I went in to the theater expecting to see a movie about Pearl Harbor. After about 90 minutes, I did see this Pearl Harbor movie. This "Pearl Harbor" movie lasted at most one hour. After this two and a half hour romp, i was disgusted to see that there still was another 33 minutes left.For a film being called Pearl Harbor, there was very little focus on the events of Pearl Harbor. Instead the majority of the film was focusing on the love triangle between two boys fighting over the same girl. The problem with this was that the love was too artificial and not real at all. The characters seemed as though they were paper thin, and did not have any interest in one another.Although I will give credit where credit is due, when the movie stuck to its title, it was an exposition on a grand scale. The visuals of the bombing were stunning, and amazing. I was captivated for this 40-60 minute time period, that is about all. The other two hours were meaningless jargon gathered in an attempt to make this Disney's "Titanic." That is exactly what Disney got, a love story as pitiful as Titanic, with some nice visuals to try and compensate for where the movie lacks.While watching this movie, I felt myself just wanting to be watching other movies. I wanted to be watching "The Rock," another Michael Bay joint. This movie is better than Pearl Harbor, two fold. I also found myself wanting to watch Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. This is a much better telling of a war story.All in all, when going to see Pearl Harbor, I just expected to see a movie about Pearl Harbor. If I wanted a love story, I would have seen a film like Bounce, or When Harry Met Sally. Michael Bay should stick to what he is good at, and that is action. Pearl Harbor succeeds a great deal when it deals with action. It is too bad that it only lasts for about 40 minutes of a 180 minute film. Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film - only if it 'calls to mind'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers!It's a great film. But . . . . it IS cliched. Basically, what you have is a 21st century war propaganda film . . . about WWII. Remember now - after the movie - BUY WAR BONDS!Or, in other words, if the film works, at points, I think it's really for no other reason than that it was released on Memorial Day. I found it very moving when, toward the end, the dead still entombed in the Arizona Memorial, were mentioned by the narrator. If you identify with the love interest, and clearly the critics are loathe to do so, but where the sets and costumes and 'Francis-style' lighting encourage one to think 1940s . . 1940s, then she becomes a symbol; as you'd expect from a propaganda film. She's not just the 'dame' in the love triangle. Rather, she's the women who lost men in wartime, who served in the nursing core, both at Pearl and so many other places, and so forth. Frankly, I think Private Buckaroo, or Action in the North Atlantic, and Walking in the Sun, and so on, were better propaganda efforts, actually produced during the war. But . . . this is 2001, after all. In Titanic, the tacked on love story represented nothing but the characters, themselves, and badly at that. If Evelyn and the others are seen to represent so many others from that era, then Titanic, it's not.As for the characters, then, it's difficult to see Danny as a pilot. He doesn't look it any more than Cruise did in the much earlier Bruckheimer-fest of Top Gun (where the tacked on love story, there, was disastrous, and for the career of McGillis, as well - Kelly who?). Now Anthony Edwards, I believed. And one can imagine Rafe, both in England and elsewhere. Old photos from Britain, during the Battle of Britain, show 'fly-boys' who literally look like Hollywood's central-casting image of a fighter pilot - but for real. So Affleck is believable because . . he's that. He's the guy on the poster, telling you about those war bonds. Beckinsale's Evelyn is also nearly believable. But I think I believe the romance and proposal from the stuttering 'Red', much more easily.Ironically, I found the Doolittle Raid more involving than the sneak attack on Pearl. It's interesting that critics trying to demonstrate some command of history, here and elsewhere, forget conveniently that the attack was a secret, sneak attack. There was no 'warrior code' to be found, anywhere. It was purely a cowardly bombing run on a military base, one asleep and unaware than some particular country was literally now in a shooting war with the US. It was like the 'japs' shooting an unarmed country in the back, as it were. And it surely infuriated the American people - precisely - for that reason. That wasn't propaganda and lies. That was the reality. One could argue Roosevelt 'set it up', and so on, and so forth. But nobody made or forced the Imperial Japanese fleet to bomb the American Pacific Fleet when war had not even been declared. All for the Empire, when it was the very idea of that Japanese Empire which had to be defeated - as it was for Italy and Germany, and their '1000-year empires'. It's why the exploits of the sub crew in Das Boot, an extraordinary film, are such a tragedy - for their individual heroism, their 'imperial' cause rightly reduces them to playing the heavy.The Doolittle Raid seemed the better of the two key sequences only because more of the details seemed to be revealed. The plane crash in China may have been the most striking sequence. And historically the raid was a huge propaganda victory for the Allies who felt themselves clawing at the cliff of survival in the face of the Axis; and just as mentioned by the film's narrator, here. The raid on Pearl seemed a little light on such details. The smoke, for example, is almost absent when compared with photos and footage of just after the 2nd wave. In reality it looked like a massive tire fire, a firestorm. In the film, it looked like isolated smudge pots. The oil soaked sailors seemed believable. But the immediate rescue efforts seemed a little weak. They had more equipment than that ready to go. But film budgets are film budgets, even if they're huge. And where was the scout plane which led the attack? I thought surely that was the purpose of the opening scene in the duster - because of the visual similarity to the Japanese scout.Overall, sure . . . Rafe and Danny sink the carriers at Midway - well, if the film continued that long, sure it would have been Rafe. And he'd probably have been piloting the Enola Gay, as well, after having just single-handedly shot down a German mini-jet. Film makers can be excused for 'composite experiencing'. And such cliche as in this film is also - about - other films. It's not honest by itself. It calls . . to mind, other things. But if the critics wanted a good story, as they say, then they wouldn't make such a play about Shawshank - a hopelessly overrated effort - or American Beauty or other such wastes. That they pan this effort says nothing about filmmaking, and everything about agendas. I and others can have our agendas. And I most surely do. All those on imdb.com can have their agendas. And clearly many do. But critics tell us it's about the movies, for them - and they seem even less about the movies than the PR flacks which ginned up the Shawshank count here on this website. It's not so much that this film is 'critic proof'. I doubt few liked Raiders of the Lost Ark when first released. I think the LA guy panned it, only to have to quickly 'amend' his review a month or so, later (Champlin was his name?). It's really - why . .. . critics? I understand the concept. It's the execution that puzzles me. What the heck is a critic if he's just a Clinton-shilling Ebert, or some other slow-witted, mindless zealot who could care less about the steak, and prefers to tell the sizzle how it sounds? You know - guy - what about . . . the actual movie? That's what we're paying to see.</fullReview>

The exposition is weak however, as is the dialogue. As a result, the lead-up to the actual attack is nothing more than counting the number of "famous last words" lines: "Pearl Harbor? That's about as far from the war as you can get!"; "We feel that Pearl is the least likely spot for an attack."; etc.The main plot line, a love triangle between Rafe, Danny and Evelyn, is weakly set up. Danny's character is pretty weakly defined and the story arc is so predictable it is laughable.Donal Logue's South Carolinian redneck backwoodsman character in The Patriot, after fighting alongside a freed slave for most of a year, tells the man before battle "I'm honored to serve alongside you. Honored." It was all I could do to not laugh aloud in the theatre. This movie has a number of lines like this one -- Alec Baldwin's Jimmy Doolittle has to deliver several of them, making me wonder how many takes it took him to deliver his speeches with a straight face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor- Dishonoring The Dishonorable Past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to have a few words with Michael Bay. If you're going to have a love story in a war movie, make it deep and passionate, with acting worth the film it is stored on. The script was awful, with the most unrealistic dialogue ever, save personal injury attorney ads. But despite this hour plus of shallowness, I still watched this movie with an open mind. My mind, however, began forming harsher judgements about this movie as the Japanese appeared more and more. They were represented in the most ridiculous manner, with government meetings in outside teahouses, headband tying rituals for the fighter pilots, and percussion that practically cried "Stormtroopers!" overwhelming their scenes to boot. I was embarrassed for the Japanese to the same extreme that I was embarrassed for the way the Native Americans were represented in Dances With Wolves. Let's be honest, the whole world was scheming during this time. Why make the Japanese out to be barbarians? Yes, what they did to Pearl Harbor was devastatingly awful, but look what we did to Nagasaki and Hiroshima. We killed how many MILLION? And don't forget that generations today are still recovering from God-knows how many types of cancer those two bombs invoked. But, of course, the only U.S. retaliation pictured in this movie is a mere "pin-prick," as Alec Baldwin puts it. I fear the kind of stereotyped pretense the term "Japanese" will carry in the minds of those under 10 who see this movie. On a more positive note, it would be hard to overlook the amazing action sequences, and I wonder not how $135 million was spent on this movie. I just wish that the breathtaking views of this attack were in a movie that involved a higher standard of acting and scripting. I walked in with hopes (even, dare I say, expectations!) of seeing another semi-historical movie in ranks with tasteful greats such as JFK, Braveheart, Schindler's List, Apocalypse Now, and Rambo III (just kidding) but walked out feeling like I had seen an action packed v</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ending, subject make this movie awful....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that upon leaving the theatre I had what you might call an ok feeling about this movie. Like so many people I ran the gammot of emotions with this movie; very excited about its release and then very skeptical after the awful reviews it received even before opening night. Going on Saturday my expectations were low and by that time I do not think it was going to take much for those expectations to be if not passed then at least met. Upon further reflection, however, I realized how good this movie could have been and how much of a disgrace it ended up being. The only reason to see this movie on the big screen is the 40 minute battle scene that actually depicts the attack on Pearl Harbor(remember the movie is over 3 hrs long) The effects are breathtaking and the depiction of this horror is actually very well done. Unfortunately that is about all that is done well. Now, leaving the film what disturbed me the most was the end. I will not give anything away but EVERYTHING after the attack on Pearl Harbor is tedious, predictable, and sometimes down right laughable. Alec Baldwin, who supposedly steals the movie according to some critcs, is amazingly bad for such a small role. His lines are all cliched to the max and his mannerism's'are prototypical old-school army man. Affleck is ok and gets the most out of a bad script, delivering some not so funny lines in a funny way and not so poignant lines with surprising feeling. Voight as FDR is great and Akroyd, though not in it much, is a pleasure to watch. Besides that the rest of the acting is extremely poor. Hartnett gives an amazingly un-emotional performance and even though the script gave few chances for any character development Hartnett, for a supposedly budding star and heart-throb, is overshadowed by anyone on screen with him. Blanchet, as the love torn nurse, is only watchable during the battle scene when she does a good job of mixing the horror of the moment with the need to stay calm to help injured service men. Though gorgeous onscreen, and she has the look of an old style movie star in this film, Blanchet does not convince the audience of any true emotion during the film. FYI Michael Bay, if you have casted an actress who cannot cry when asked to, use age old methods to draw out the tears. Too many times, in moments when Blanchets character should be distraught, she remains dry eyed, while pretending to sob.As I said, at first the major problem I had with this flick was the ending, which is about as bad an endig as you can get, and I do mean the entire hour of film after the attack. After having a day to think about it however, I realized what a disgrace this movie was and how Bay and Bruck used a horrible moment in American history to make an overly-hyped, big booming action flick that will make money. Granted nothing may ever reach the accuracy of Saving Private Ryan or even Platoon, yet this movie really makes no attempt to relate the seriousness of the moment. This was Armageddon and The Rock, with the same effects, the same "one or two men can take on an army" concept, and an emphasis on horribly cliched moments and phrases. This movie could have been a wondeful depiction of that terrible day in 1941, could have brought the horrors of war, and espacially naval and air combat, home, and could have still done most of this while including a less time consuming, non-sensical love triangle. You may say, "why do we need the horrors of war brought home once again, whats the matter with a more light-hearted movie." You may have a point, but when dealing with REAL events it seems to me that the people who died must be honored, and honoring them means getting what ACTUALLY happened right. The fact that Bay and Bruck made little attempt to get all the details right is horrible. At least Titanic, another movie I am not in love with, made a good attempt to get history right and in the end focused the movie away from the Leo, Kate love fest and on he carnage that ensued. This movie fails not only as a product, that is a run of the mill movie, but also fails horribly as a cinematic repesentation of history. Veterans, who were honored, and righfully so, by the power of Ryan should be insulted by the almost insignificant role there horrible day plays in this film. Only 40 minutes devoted to Pearl Harbor in a movie named Pearl Harbor(that runs 3 hours)? An almost anxious jump away from the action back to the love-story? This not only fails as a movie, at least a $150 million movie, but also insults what many of our grandfathers and even grandmothers went through. For that, and that alone, stay away from this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Desperate Titanic Wanna-be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start by saying that for quite a while I was looking forward to seeing this movie--that first teaser trailer blew me away, and just having seen that made me want to go out and see it. So I waited the months and the months until about a week before it came out, and I was reading some horrendous reviews from some of the finest critics out there. The one that made me go and see this movie was from Harry Knowles, who I usually tend to agree with about movies. So I went in expecting a fine film, and came out having seen a movie that is just about as bad a movie as you can get(with maybe the exception of Batman and Robin, or The Mummy Returns). The whole love story is wholly unoriginal and extrememly uninspired. Throughout the whole movie you just know what's going to happen next between Danny, Rafe, and Evelyn. I had the ending of the movie figured out almost right after the Pearl Harbor attack, which, for my money, is the highlight of the movie(the only highlight, by the way). The movie was WAAAAY too long(I got up to go to the bathroom twice, and didn't care at all that I missed some of the movie). Probably the finest performance of the movie was given by Leland Orser(the killer from the Bone Collector), the man that Evelyn saves in the hospital. John Schwartzmann's cinematography is excellent, as usual, as is Hans Zimmers score. I'm truly sad that the movie turned out the way that it did, because it had so many things going for it--an incredibly cinematic event, good actors(they're not great actors by any standard), a very cinematic director who COULD be great if he had the right script and the right producer, and a very accomplished composer. Unfortunately, it also has a VERY weak script from Randall Wallace, writer of Braveheart(who is blatantly ripping off James Cameron's Titanic here in almost every respect), terrible acting from almost all sides, and again it's length--and I usually love a 3-hour movie. But not here. This movie should have ended after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, but it couldn't do that--the studio heads have to sell this movie to the teenage girls who wouldn't know if this was historically accurate or not(it wasn't, for the most part). It makes me truly sad that this movie is going to be a huge moneymaker--I doubt if it will be the next Titanic, but it might make about 300 million or so. In closing, I'll just say that the only reason I would go to see this movie, or even recommend it, is the bombing sequence(or the first 25 minutes, at least). It is sad when a films visual effects are its finest accomplishment, but that is the sad fact here. God help the future of american cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed in so many ways...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mention of the two words Pearl Harbor conjures up so many different emotions. One in particular, is sorrow. Another is anger, and with hindsight, regret.When I think of Pearl Harbor, I view it as the day that the U.S. lost its innocence and its reluctance into entering WWII wilfully. Even critics of the U.S. Military policy would be hard-pressed to see this day of infamy as anything but.Over 3000 people died, most of them, even before they even had a chance to know what hit them. To them, a motion picture that would document and help us to remember the spirit of these brave men and women would go a long way for the rest of us to remember them by and to never forget what sacrifice for love of country really is.That being said, this movie doesn't even come close to render justice to those who lost their lives. In fact, this movie trivializes and may down the road; even contribute to the falsification of its memory. That is even beside the fact that it's an awful movie. ****** THERE ARE SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THIS PORTION OF THE REVIEW. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE, DO NOT READ ON (OR READ ON AT YOUR OWN PERIL) ******What is the point of showing lots of stuff being blown up and planes whizzing around doing acrobatic tricks in a historical context?This is confusing for me because for a film that wants to 'accurately' depict what it was like to be there, it sure likes to gloss over the human component. Why are explosions, crashes, bullets, fire, ships sinking and pilots rah-rahing are given absolute cinematographic clarity and visceral impact, yet the hospital wards filled with the burned, the wounded, the dying and the dead - the result of such a blatant act of war - blurred almost to the point where they're nothing more than figures pawing their way through the ether?I certainly abhor pain and suffering, but in this case, blurring and softening the human plight of this attack doesn't offer a counter-point to the pyrotechnics we're seeing. It removes the consequences of using instruments of mass destruction, and it certainly doesn't help us re-sensitise ourselves to the fact that regardless of what this war was about or who started it, it was messy, dangerous and tragic. I think we're past the point where we can make overly-glorified movies that forget their sense of history and perspective. Back in the late 40s and early 50s, they could justify their glorifications due to the Hayes code, and the massive debt of sensitivity owed to the men and women of the Armed forces, who still had these events fresh in their minds. You would think 60 years would be enough to give a more sound perspective. Apparently, for some movie directors and producers, it's not enough time, nor a compelling enough reason.Had the premise of this movie were to be a video-game or a popcorn movie, then my chief criticisms would be the lackadaisical acting, the boring love triangle, and the simply awful dialogue in places. `Just get me into a plane' says our square-jawed hero. Sounds like a 12-year old wanting to get into those virtual video-game rides down at the arcade centre.But this movie can cause more damage than simply be a vessel of bad acting, bad dialogue or story. It has the potential to re-write history like it was an arcade game, and worse, make us forget what really transpired on December 7th, 1941.If this movie makes mountains of cash, it will be a testimony on how we consumers effectively turn historical moments into trivia, and our ability to draw understanding from tragedy reduced to terms of bankability.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good War, Bad Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The attack of Pearl Harbor, as shown in the film, could be a great resource for history classes. Other than that, this movie doesn't have many high points. I loved the trailer (Going to a lot of movies, I must have seen it 7 times), the music from The Thin Red Line fit perfectly. The trailer made it look like it was a grand epic, with a little love story to make romantics happy.Sadly, this is not the case. The first hour and 15 minutes (or so) of the film focuses mostly on the love story, and what will later become a love triangle. It is predictable, sappy, and overdone, not in an enjoyable way (as it was in You've Got Mail), but in a manner that becomes tiring all too quickly. At times you almost wish the Japanese would hurry up and bomb the place all ready, just so we can leave the pathetic attempt at romance alone.Then there's the music. If you want a good movie, you must have good music. If you saw the trailer, you know what I mean by good music. Music that stirs the soul, the moves you just by hearing it. This was not the music we had for Pearl Harbor. I will confess now than I've never been a huge Zimmer fan, but I do believe when the time calls for it he can do well. I wasn't expecting much, but even I was disappointed by his score. One point which stands out to me was when Affleck was chasing a bomber after the bombing, while music played in a background which would of fit better in a Saturday morning action cartoon than this movie. The score was uninspired, and the "great theme", which was Zimmer's excuse for rushing the rest of the music, wasn't all that profound.Another problem the film has is a contradiction between the script and the title. You would suppose the main characters would have us involved quite a bit with the events of Pearl Harbor. Sadly, the filmmakers are more concerned with telling their love story then what happened on the Infamous Day. The main characters get so off track, that another character (Cuba Gooding Jr.) has to be inserted into the story for no other reason than to have a point of view on Battleship Row during the bombing. The main characters are away from the action for the first half of the attack, and when they do enter they are not even involved in the major areas Pearl Harbor is known for. I have heard some comparisons between this film and Titanic. Though they both had love stories, Titanic was just as focused on the sinking of the ship as it was on its fictional tale of love. Pearl Harbor seems to be a love story which is interrupted by a bombing.I may be a fool, but I somewhat judge a movie by its trailer. This can be misleading, especially with comedies, but usually dramatic films give you a good idea of the story in the trailer. All in all, get Pearl Harbor on DVD, but watch the trailer and the battle scenes only. The rest is a waste of your time. Two stars out of four.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahhh, Got Any Gum?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is the deal with this movie. I went in to the theater expecting to see a movie about Pearl Harbor. After about 90 minutes, I did see this Pearl Harbor movie. This "Pearl Harbor" movie lasted at most one hour. After this two and a half hour romp, i was disgusted to see that there still was another 33 minutes left.For a film being called Pearl Harbor, there was very little focus on the events of Pearl Harbor. Instead the majority of the film was focusing on the love triangle between two boys fighting over the same girl. The problem with this was that the love was too artificial and not real at all. The characters seemed as though they were paper thin, and did not have any interest in one another.Although I will give credit where credit is due, when the movie stuck to its title, it was an exposition on a grand scale. The visuals of the bombing were stunning, and amazing. I was captivated for this 40-60 minute time period, that is about all. The other two hours were meaningless jargon gathered in an attempt to make this Disney's "Titanic." That is exactly what Disney got, a love story as pitiful as Titanic, with some nice visuals to try and compensate for where the movie lacks.While watching this movie, I felt myself just wanting to be watching other movies. I wanted to be watching "The Rock," another Michael Bay joint. This movie is better than Pearl Harbor, two fold. I also found myself wanting to watch Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. This is a much better telling of a war story.All in all, when going to see Pearl Harbor, I just expected to see a movie about Pearl Harbor. If I wanted a love story, I would have seen a film like Bounce, or When Harry Met Sally. Michael Bay should stick to what he is good at, and that is action. Pearl Harbor succeeds a great deal when it deals with action. It is too bad that it only lasts for about 40 minutes of a 180 minute film. Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film - only if it 'calls to mind'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers!It's a great film. But . . . . it IS cliched. Basically, what you have is a 21st century war propaganda film . . . about WWII. Remember now - after the movie - BUY WAR BONDS!Or, in other words, if the film works, at points, I think it's really for no other reason than that it was released on Memorial Day. I found it very moving when, toward the end, the dead still entombed in the Arizona Memorial, were mentioned by the narrator. If you identify with the love interest, and clearly the critics are loathe to do so, but where the sets and costumes and 'Francis-style' lighting encourage one to think 1940s . . 1940s, then she becomes a symbol; as you'd expect from a propaganda film. She's not just the 'dame' in the love triangle. Rather, she's the women who lost men in wartime, who served in the nursing core, both at Pearl and so many other places, and so forth. Frankly, I think Private Buckaroo, or Action in the North Atlantic, and Walking in the Sun, and so on, were better propaganda efforts, actually produced during the war. But . . . this is 2001, after all. In Titanic, the tacked on love story represented nothing but the characters, themselves, and badly at that. If Evelyn and the others are seen to represent so many others from that era, then Titanic, it's not.As for the characters, then, it's difficult to see Danny as a pilot. He doesn't look it any more than Cruise did in the much earlier Bruckheimer-fest of Top Gun (where the tacked on love story, there, was disastrous, and for the career of McGillis, as well - Kelly who?). Now Anthony Edwards, I believed. And one can imagine Rafe, both in England and elsewhere. Old photos from Britain, during the Battle of Britain, show 'fly-boys' who literally look like Hollywood's central-casting image of a fighter pilot - but for real. So Affleck is believable because . . he's that. He's the guy on the poster, telling you about those war bonds. Beckinsale's Evelyn is also nearly believable. But I think I believe the romance and proposal from the stuttering 'Red', much more easily.Ironically, I found the Doolittle Raid more involving than the sneak attack on Pearl. It's interesting that critics trying to demonstrate some command of history, here and elsewhere, forget conveniently that the attack was a secret, sneak attack. There was no 'warrior code' to be found, anywhere. It was purely a cowardly bombing run on a military base, one asleep and unaware than some particular country was literally now in a shooting war with the US. It was like the 'japs' shooting an unarmed country in the back, as it were. And it surely infuriated the American people - precisely - for that reason. That wasn't propaganda and lies. That was the reality. One could argue Roosevelt 'set it up', and so on, and so forth. But nobody made or forced the Imperial Japanese fleet to bomb the American Pacific Fleet when war had not even been declared. All for the Empire, when it was the very idea of that Japanese Empire which had to be defeated - as it was for Italy and Germany, and their '1000-year empires'. It's why the exploits of the sub crew in Das Boot, an extraordinary film, are such a tragedy - for their individual heroism, their 'imperial' cause rightly reduces them to playing the heavy.The Doolittle Raid seemed the better of the two key sequences only because more of the details seemed to be revealed. The plane crash in China may have been the most striking sequence. And historically the raid was a huge propaganda victory for the Allies who felt themselves clawing at the cliff of survival in the face of the Axis; and just as mentioned by the film's narrator, here. The raid on Pearl seemed a little light on such details. The smoke, for example, is almost absent when compared with photos and footage of just after the 2nd wave. In reality it looked like a massive tire fire, a firestorm. In the film, it looked like isolated smudge pots. The oil soaked sailors seemed believable. But the immediate rescue efforts seemed a little weak. They had more equipment than that ready to go. But film budgets are film budgets, even if they're huge. And where was the scout plane which led the attack? I thought surely that was the purpose of the opening scene in the duster - because of the visual similarity to the Japanese scout.Overall, sure . . . Rafe and Danny sink the carriers at Midway - well, if the film continued that long, sure it would have been Rafe. And he'd probably have been piloting the Enola Gay, as well, after having just single-handedly shot down a German mini-jet. Film makers can be excused for 'composite experiencing'. And such cliche as in this film is also - about - other films. It's not honest by itself. It calls . . to mind, other things. But if the critics wanted a good story, as they say, then they wouldn't make such a play about Shawshank - a hopelessly overrated effort - or American Beauty or other such wastes. That they pan this effort says nothing about filmmaking, and everything about agendas. I and others can have our agendas. And I most surely do. All those on imdb.com can have their agendas. And clearly many do. But critics tell us it's about the movies, for them - and they seem even less about the movies than the PR flacks which ginned up the Shawshank count here on this website. It's not so much that this film is 'critic proof'. I doubt few liked Raiders of the Lost Ark when first released. I think the LA guy panned it, only to have to quickly 'amend' his review a month or so, later (Champlin was his name?). It's really - why . .. . critics? I understand the concept. It's the execution that puzzles me. What the heck is a critic if he's just a Clinton-shilling Ebert, or some other slow-witted, mindless zealot who could care less about the steak, and prefers to tell the sizzle how it sounds? You know - guy - what about . . . the actual movie? That's what we're paying to see.</fullReview>

I will not give anything away but EVERYTHING after the attack on Pearl Harbor is tedious, predictable, and sometimes down right laughable. Alec Baldwin, who supposedly steals the movie according to some critcs, is amazingly bad for such a small role. His lines are all cliched to the max and his mannerism's'are prototypical old-school army man. Affleck is ok and gets the most out of a bad script, delivering some not so funny lines in a funny way and not so poignant lines with surprising feeling. Voight as FDR is great and Akroyd, though not in it much, is a pleasure to watch. Besides that the rest of the acting is extremely poor. Hartnett gives an amazingly un-emotional performance and even though the script gave few chances for any character development Hartnett, for a supposedly budding star and heart-throb, is overshadowed by anyone on screen with him. Blanchet, as the love torn nurse, is only watchable during the battle scene when she does a good job of mixing the horror of the moment with the need to stay calm to help injured service men. Though gorgeous onscreen, and she has the look of an old style movie star in this film, Blanchet does not convince the audience of any true emotion during the film. FYI Michael Bay, if you have casted an actress who cannot cry when asked to, use age old methods to draw out the tears. Too many times, in moments when Blanchets character should be distraught, she remains dry eyed, while pretending to sob.As I said, at first the major problem I had with this flick was the ending, which is about as bad an endig as you can get, and I do mean the entire hour of film after the attack. After having a day to think about it however, I realized what a disgrace this movie was and how Bay and Bruck used a horrible moment in American history to make an overly-hyped, big booming action flick that will make money. Granted nothing may ever reach the accuracy of Saving Private Ryan or even Platoon, yet this movie really makes no attempt to relate the seriousness of the moment. This was Armageddon and The Rock, with the same effects, the same "one or two men can take on an army" concept, and an emphasis on horribly cliched moments and phrases. This movie could have been a wondeful depiction of that terrible day in 1941, could have brought the horrors of war, and espacially naval and air combat, home, and could have still done most of this while including a less time consuming, non-sensical love triangle. You may say, "why do we need the horrors of war brought home once again, whats the matter with a more light-hearted movie." You may have a point, but when dealing with REAL events it seems to me that the people who died must be honored, and honoring them means getting what ACTUALLY happened right. The fact that Bay and Bruck made little attempt to get all the details right is horrible. At least Titanic, another movie I am not in love with, made a good attempt to get history right and in the end focused the movie away from the Leo, Kate love fest and on he carnage that ensued. This movie fails not only as a product, that is a run of the mill movie, but also fails horribly as a cinematic repesentation of history. Veterans, who were honored, and righfully so, by the power of Ryan should be insulted by the almost insignificant role there horrible day plays in this film. Only 40 minutes devoted to Pearl Harbor in a movie named Pearl Harbor(that runs 3 hours)? An almost anxious jump away from the action back to the love-story? This not only fails as a movie, at least a $150 million movie, but also insults what many of our grandfathers and even grandmothers went through. For that, and that alone, stay away from this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Desperate Titanic Wanna-be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start by saying that for quite a while I was looking forward to seeing this movie--that first teaser trailer blew me away, and just having seen that made me want to go out and see it. So I waited the months and the months until about a week before it came out, and I was reading some horrendous reviews from some of the finest critics out there. The one that made me go and see this movie was from Harry Knowles, who I usually tend to agree with about movies. So I went in expecting a fine film, and came out having seen a movie that is just about as bad a movie as you can get(with maybe the exception of Batman and Robin, or The Mummy Returns). The whole love story is wholly unoriginal and extrememly uninspired. Throughout the whole movie you just know what's going to happen next between Danny, Rafe, and Evelyn. I had the ending of the movie figured out almost right after the Pearl Harbor attack, which, for my money, is the highlight of the movie(the only highlight, by the way). The movie was WAAAAY too long(I got up to go to the bathroom twice, and didn't care at all that I missed some of the movie). Probably the finest performance of the movie was given by Leland Orser(the killer from the Bone Collector), the man that Evelyn saves in the hospital. John Schwartzmann's cinematography is excellent, as usual, as is Hans Zimmers score. I'm truly sad that the movie turned out the way that it did, because it had so many things going for it--an incredibly cinematic event, good actors(they're not great actors by any standard), a very cinematic director who COULD be great if he had the right script and the right producer, and a very accomplished composer. Unfortunately, it also has a VERY weak script from Randall Wallace, writer of Braveheart(who is blatantly ripping off James Cameron's Titanic here in almost every respect), terrible acting from almost all sides, and again it's length--and I usually love a 3-hour movie. But not here. This movie should have ended after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, but it couldn't do that--the studio heads have to sell this movie to the teenage girls who wouldn't know if this was historically accurate or not(it wasn't, for the most part). It makes me truly sad that this movie is going to be a huge moneymaker--I doubt if it will be the next Titanic, but it might make about 300 million or so. In closing, I'll just say that the only reason I would go to see this movie, or even recommend it, is the bombing sequence(or the first 25 minutes, at least). It is sad when a films visual effects are its finest accomplishment, but that is the sad fact here. God help the future of american cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed in so many ways...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mention of the two words Pearl Harbor conjures up so many different emotions. One in particular, is sorrow. Another is anger, and with hindsight, regret.When I think of Pearl Harbor, I view it as the day that the U.S. lost its innocence and its reluctance into entering WWII wilfully. Even critics of the U.S. Military policy would be hard-pressed to see this day of infamy as anything but.Over 3000 people died, most of them, even before they even had a chance to know what hit them. To them, a motion picture that would document and help us to remember the spirit of these brave men and women would go a long way for the rest of us to remember them by and to never forget what sacrifice for love of country really is.That being said, this movie doesn't even come close to render justice to those who lost their lives. In fact, this movie trivializes and may down the road; even contribute to the falsification of its memory. That is even beside the fact that it's an awful movie. ****** THERE ARE SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THIS PORTION OF THE REVIEW. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE, DO NOT READ ON (OR READ ON AT YOUR OWN PERIL) ******What is the point of showing lots of stuff being blown up and planes whizzing around doing acrobatic tricks in a historical context?This is confusing for me because for a film that wants to 'accurately' depict what it was like to be there, it sure likes to gloss over the human component. Why are explosions, crashes, bullets, fire, ships sinking and pilots rah-rahing are given absolute cinematographic clarity and visceral impact, yet the hospital wards filled with the burned, the wounded, the dying and the dead - the result of such a blatant act of war - blurred almost to the point where they're nothing more than figures pawing their way through the ether?I certainly abhor pain and suffering, but in this case, blurring and softening the human plight of this attack doesn't offer a counter-point to the pyrotechnics we're seeing. It removes the consequences of using instruments of mass destruction, and it certainly doesn't help us re-sensitise ourselves to the fact that regardless of what this war was about or who started it, it was messy, dangerous and tragic. I think we're past the point where we can make overly-glorified movies that forget their sense of history and perspective. Back in the late 40s and early 50s, they could justify their glorifications due to the Hayes code, and the massive debt of sensitivity owed to the men and women of the Armed forces, who still had these events fresh in their minds. You would think 60 years would be enough to give a more sound perspective. Apparently, for some movie directors and producers, it's not enough time, nor a compelling enough reason.Had the premise of this movie were to be a video-game or a popcorn movie, then my chief criticisms would be the lackadaisical acting, the boring love triangle, and the simply awful dialogue in places. `Just get me into a plane' says our square-jawed hero. Sounds like a 12-year old wanting to get into those virtual video-game rides down at the arcade centre.But this movie can cause more damage than simply be a vessel of bad acting, bad dialogue or story. It has the potential to re-write history like it was an arcade game, and worse, make us forget what really transpired on December 7th, 1941.If this movie makes mountains of cash, it will be a testimony on how we consumers effectively turn historical moments into trivia, and our ability to draw understanding from tragedy reduced to terms of bankability.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good War, Bad Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The attack of Pearl Harbor, as shown in the film, could be a great resource for history classes. Other than that, this movie doesn't have many high points. I loved the trailer (Going to a lot of movies, I must have seen it 7 times), the music from The Thin Red Line fit perfectly. The trailer made it look like it was a grand epic, with a little love story to make romantics happy.Sadly, this is not the case. The first hour and 15 minutes (or so) of the film focuses mostly on the love story, and what will later become a love triangle. It is predictable, sappy, and overdone, not in an enjoyable way (as it was in You've Got Mail), but in a manner that becomes tiring all too quickly. At times you almost wish the Japanese would hurry up and bomb the place all ready, just so we can leave the pathetic attempt at romance alone.Then there's the music. If you want a good movie, you must have good music. If you saw the trailer, you know what I mean by good music. Music that stirs the soul, the moves you just by hearing it. This was not the music we had for Pearl Harbor. I will confess now than I've never been a huge Zimmer fan, but I do believe when the time calls for it he can do well. I wasn't expecting much, but even I was disappointed by his score. One point which stands out to me was when Affleck was chasing a bomber after the bombing, while music played in a background which would of fit better in a Saturday morning action cartoon than this movie. The score was uninspired, and the "great theme", which was Zimmer's excuse for rushing the rest of the music, wasn't all that profound.Another problem the film has is a contradiction between the script and the title. You would suppose the main characters would have us involved quite a bit with the events of Pearl Harbor. Sadly, the filmmakers are more concerned with telling their love story then what happened on the Infamous Day. The main characters get so off track, that another character (Cuba Gooding Jr.) has to be inserted into the story for no other reason than to have a point of view on Battleship Row during the bombing. The main characters are away from the action for the first half of the attack, and when they do enter they are not even involved in the major areas Pearl Harbor is known for. I have heard some comparisons between this film and Titanic. Though they both had love stories, Titanic was just as focused on the sinking of the ship as it was on its fictional tale of love. Pearl Harbor seems to be a love story which is interrupted by a bombing.I may be a fool, but I somewhat judge a movie by its trailer. This can be misleading, especially with comedies, but usually dramatic films give you a good idea of the story in the trailer. All in all, get Pearl Harbor on DVD, but watch the trailer and the battle scenes only. The rest is a waste of your time. Two stars out of four.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahhh, Got Any Gum?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is the deal with this movie. I went in to the theater expecting to see a movie about Pearl Harbor. After about 90 minutes, I did see this Pearl Harbor movie. This "Pearl Harbor" movie lasted at most one hour. After this two and a half hour romp, i was disgusted to see that there still was another 33 minutes left.For a film being called Pearl Harbor, there was very little focus on the events of Pearl Harbor. Instead the majority of the film was focusing on the love triangle between two boys fighting over the same girl. The problem with this was that the love was too artificial and not real at all. The characters seemed as though they were paper thin, and did not have any interest in one another.Although I will give credit where credit is due, when the movie stuck to its title, it was an exposition on a grand scale. The visuals of the bombing were stunning, and amazing. I was captivated for this 40-60 minute time period, that is about all. The other two hours were meaningless jargon gathered in an attempt to make this Disney's "Titanic." That is exactly what Disney got, a love story as pitiful as Titanic, with some nice visuals to try and compensate for where the movie lacks.While watching this movie, I felt myself just wanting to be watching other movies. I wanted to be watching "The Rock," another Michael Bay joint. This movie is better than Pearl Harbor, two fold. I also found myself wanting to watch Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. This is a much better telling of a war story.All in all, when going to see Pearl Harbor, I just expected to see a movie about Pearl Harbor. If I wanted a love story, I would have seen a film like Bounce, or When Harry Met Sally. Michael Bay should stick to what he is good at, and that is action. Pearl Harbor succeeds a great deal when it deals with action. It is too bad that it only lasts for about 40 minutes of a 180 minute film. Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film - only if it 'calls to mind'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers!It's a great film. But . . . . it IS cliched. Basically, what you have is a 21st century war propaganda film . . . about WWII. Remember now - after the movie - BUY WAR BONDS!Or, in other words, if the film works, at points, I think it's really for no other reason than that it was released on Memorial Day. I found it very moving when, toward the end, the dead still entombed in the Arizona Memorial, were mentioned by the narrator. If you identify with the love interest, and clearly the critics are loathe to do so, but where the sets and costumes and 'Francis-style' lighting encourage one to think 1940s . . 1940s, then she becomes a symbol; as you'd expect from a propaganda film. She's not just the 'dame' in the love triangle. Rather, she's the women who lost men in wartime, who served in the nursing core, both at Pearl and so many other places, and so forth. Frankly, I think Private Buckaroo, or Action in the North Atlantic, and Walking in the Sun, and so on, were better propaganda efforts, actually produced during the war. But . . . this is 2001, after all. In Titanic, the tacked on love story represented nothing but the characters, themselves, and badly at that. If Evelyn and the others are seen to represent so many others from that era, then Titanic, it's not.As for the characters, then, it's difficult to see Danny as a pilot. He doesn't look it any more than Cruise did in the much earlier Bruckheimer-fest of Top Gun (where the tacked on love story, there, was disastrous, and for the career of McGillis, as well - Kelly who?). Now Anthony Edwards, I believed. And one can imagine Rafe, both in England and elsewhere. Old photos from Britain, during the Battle of Britain, show 'fly-boys' who literally look like Hollywood's central-casting image of a fighter pilot - but for real. So Affleck is believable because . . he's that. He's the guy on the poster, telling you about those war bonds. Beckinsale's Evelyn is also nearly believable. But I think I believe the romance and proposal from the stuttering 'Red', much more easily.Ironically, I found the Doolittle Raid more involving than the sneak attack on Pearl. It's interesting that critics trying to demonstrate some command of history, here and elsewhere, forget conveniently that the attack was a secret, sneak attack. There was no 'warrior code' to be found, anywhere. It was purely a cowardly bombing run on a military base, one asleep and unaware than some particular country was literally now in a shooting war with the US. It was like the 'japs' shooting an unarmed country in the back, as it were. And it surely infuriated the American people - precisely - for that reason. That wasn't propaganda and lies. That was the reality. One could argue Roosevelt 'set it up', and so on, and so forth. But nobody made or forced the Imperial Japanese fleet to bomb the American Pacific Fleet when war had not even been declared. All for the Empire, when it was the very idea of that Japanese Empire which had to be defeated - as it was for Italy and Germany, and their '1000-year empires'. It's why the exploits of the sub crew in Das Boot, an extraordinary film, are such a tragedy - for their individual heroism, their 'imperial' cause rightly reduces them to playing the heavy.The Doolittle Raid seemed the better of the two key sequences only because more of the details seemed to be revealed. The plane crash in China may have been the most striking sequence. And historically the raid was a huge propaganda victory for the Allies who felt themselves clawing at the cliff of survival in the face of the Axis; and just as mentioned by the film's narrator, here. The raid on Pearl seemed a little light on such details. The smoke, for example, is almost absent when compared with photos and footage of just after the 2nd wave. In reality it looked like a massive tire fire, a firestorm. In the film, it looked like isolated smudge pots. The oil soaked sailors seemed believable. But the immediate rescue efforts seemed a little weak. They had more equipment than that ready to go. But film budgets are film budgets, even if they're huge. And where was the scout plane which led the attack? I thought surely that was the purpose of the opening scene in the duster - because of the visual similarity to the Japanese scout.Overall, sure . . . Rafe and Danny sink the carriers at Midway - well, if the film continued that long, sure it would have been Rafe. And he'd probably have been piloting the Enola Gay, as well, after having just single-handedly shot down a German mini-jet. Film makers can be excused for 'composite experiencing'. And such cliche as in this film is also - about - other films. It's not honest by itself. It calls . . to mind, other things. But if the critics wanted a good story, as they say, then they wouldn't make such a play about Shawshank - a hopelessly overrated effort - or American Beauty or other such wastes. That they pan this effort says nothing about filmmaking, and everything about agendas. I and others can have our agendas. And I most surely do. All those on imdb.com can have their agendas. And clearly many do. But critics tell us it's about the movies, for them - and they seem even less about the movies than the PR flacks which ginned up the Shawshank count here on this website. It's not so much that this film is 'critic proof'. I doubt few liked Raiders of the Lost Ark when first released. I think the LA guy panned it, only to have to quickly 'amend' his review a month or so, later (Champlin was his name?). It's really - why . .. . critics? I understand the concept. It's the execution that puzzles me. What the heck is a critic if he's just a Clinton-shilling Ebert, or some other slow-witted, mindless zealot who could care less about the steak, and prefers to tell the sizzle how it sounds? You know - guy - what about . . . the actual movie? That's what we're paying to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A technical marvel of a movie, the actual scenes of the attack were beautifully rendered (as we might expect from a major summer blockbuster). Like just about every film of its ilk, the filmmakers seem to have blown the entire budget on major stars and effects, with little thought about characters or dialogue.As in Titanic, we are introduced to several fictional characters and are expected to care enough about them to become involved in the movie. The exposition is weak however, as is the dialogue. As a result, the lead-up to the actual attack is nothing more than counting the number of "famous last words" lines: "Pearl Harbor? That's about as far from the war as you can get!"; "We feel that Pearl is the least likely spot for an attack."; etc.The main plot line, a love triangle between Rafe, Danny and Evelyn, is weakly set up. Danny's character is pretty weakly defined and the story arc is so predictable it is laughable.Donal Logue's South Carolinian redneck backwoodsman character in The Patriot, after fighting alongside a freed slave for most of a year, tells the man before battle "I'm honored to serve alongside you. Honored." It was all I could do to not laugh aloud in the theatre. This movie has a number of lines like this one -- Alec Baldwin's Jimmy Doolittle has to deliver several of them, making me wonder how many takes it took him to deliver his speeches with a straight face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to have a few words with Michael Bay. If you're going to have a love story in a war movie, make it deep and passionate, with acting worth the film it is stored on. The script was awful, with the most unrealistic dialogue ever, save personal injury attorney ads. But despite this hour plus of shallowness, I still watched this movie with an open mind. My mind, however, began forming harsher judgements about this movie as the Japanese appeared more and more. They were represented in the most ridiculous manner, with government meetings in outside teahouses, headband tying rituals for the fighter pilots, and percussion that practically cried "Stormtroopers!" overwhelming their scenes to boot. I was embarrassed for the Japanese to the same extreme that I was embarrassed for the way the Native Americans were represented in Dances With Wolves. Let's be honest, the whole world was scheming during this time. Why make the Japanese out to be barbarians? Yes, what they did to Pearl Harbor was devastatingly awful, but look what we did to Nagasaki and Hiroshima. We killed how many MILLION? And don't forget that generations today are still recovering from God-knows how many types of cancer those two bombs invoked. But, of course, the only U.S. retaliation pictured in this movie is a mere "pin-prick," as Alec Baldwin puts it. I fear the kind of stereotyped pretense the term "Japanese" will carry in the minds of those under 10 who see this movie. On a more positive note, it would be hard to overlook the amazing action sequences, and I wonder not how $135 million was spent on this movie. I just wish that the breathtaking views of this attack were in a movie that involved a higher standard of acting and scripting. I walked in with hopes (even, dare I say, expectations!) of seeing another semi-historical movie in ranks with tasteful greats such as JFK, Braveheart, Schindler's List, Apocalypse Now, and Rambo III (just kidding) but walked out feeling like I had seen an action packed v</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ending, subject make this movie awful....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that upon leaving the theatre I had what you might call an ok feeling about this movie. Like so many people I ran the gammot of emotions with this movie; very excited about its release and then very skeptical after the awful reviews it received even before opening night. Going on Saturday my expectations were low and by that time I do not think it was going to take much for those expectations to be if not passed then at least met. Upon further reflection, however, I realized how good this movie could have been and how much of a disgrace it ended up being. The only reason to see this movie on the big screen is the 40 minute battle scene that actually depicts the attack on Pearl Harbor(remember the movie is over 3 hrs long) The effects are breathtaking and the depiction of this horror is actually very well done. Unfortunately that is about all that is done well. Now, leaving the film what disturbed me the most was the end. I will not give anything away but EVERYTHING after the attack on Pearl Harbor is tedious, predictable, and sometimes down right laughable. Alec Baldwin, who supposedly steals the movie according to some critcs, is amazingly bad for such a small role. His lines are all cliched to the max and his mannerism's'are prototypical old-school army man. Affleck is ok and gets the most out of a bad script, delivering some not so funny lines in a funny way and not so poignant lines with surprising feeling. Voight as FDR is great and Akroyd, though not in it much, is a pleasure to watch. Besides that the rest of the acting is extremely poor. Hartnett gives an amazingly un-emotional performance and even though the script gave few chances for any character development Hartnett, for a supposedly budding star and heart-throb, is overshadowed by anyone on screen with him. Blanchet, as the love torn nurse, is only watchable during the battle scene when she does a good job of mixing the horror of the moment with the need to stay calm to help injured service men. Though gorgeous onscreen, and she has the look of an old style movie star in this film, Blanchet does not convince the audience of any true emotion during the film. FYI Michael Bay, if you have casted an actress who cannot cry when asked to, use age old methods to draw out the tears. Too many times, in moments when Blanchets character should be distraught, she remains dry eyed, while pretending to sob.As I said, at first the major problem I had with this flick was the ending, which is about as bad an endig as you can get, and I do mean the entire hour of film after the attack. After having a day to think about it however, I realized what a disgrace this movie was and how Bay and Bruck used a horrible moment in American history to make an overly-hyped, big booming action flick that will make money. Granted nothing may ever reach the accuracy of Saving Private Ryan or even Platoon, yet this movie really makes no attempt to relate the seriousness of the moment. This was Armageddon and The Rock, with the same effects, the same "one or two men can take on an army" concept, and an emphasis on horribly cliched moments and phrases. This movie could have been a wondeful depiction of that terrible day in 1941, could have brought the horrors of war, and espacially naval and air combat, home, and could have still done most of this while including a less time consuming, non-sensical love triangle. You may say, "why do we need the horrors of war brought home once again, whats the matter with a more light-hearted movie." You may have a point, but when dealing with REAL events it seems to me that the people who died must be honored, and honoring them means getting what ACTUALLY happened right. The fact that Bay and Bruck made little attempt to get all the details right is horrible. At least Titanic, another movie I am not in love with, made a good attempt to get history right and in the end focused the movie away from the Leo, Kate love fest and on he carnage that ensued. This movie fails not only as a product, that is a run of the mill movie, but also fails horribly as a cinematic repesentation of history. Veterans, who were honored, and righfully so, by the power of Ryan should be insulted by the almost insignificant role there horrible day plays in this film. Only 40 minutes devoted to Pearl Harbor in a movie named Pearl Harbor(that runs 3 hours)? An almost anxious jump away from the action back to the love-story? This not only fails as a movie, at least a $150 million movie, but also insults what many of our grandfathers and even grandmothers went through. For that, and that alone, stay away from this movie.</fullReview>

I had the ending of the movie figured out almost right after the Pearl Harbor attack, which, for my money, is the highlight of the movie(the only highlight, by the way). The movie was WAAAAY too long(I got up to go to the bathroom twice, and didn't care at all that I missed some of the movie). Probably the finest performance of the movie was given by Leland Orser(the killer from the Bone Collector), the man that Evelyn saves in the hospital. John Schwartzmann's cinematography is excellent, as usual, as is Hans Zimmers score. I'm truly sad that the movie turned out the way that it did, because it had so many things going for it--an incredibly cinematic event, good actors(they're not great actors by any standard), a very cinematic director who COULD be great if he had the right script and the right producer, and a very accomplished composer. Unfortunately, it also has a VERY weak script from Randall Wallace, writer of Braveheart(who is blatantly ripping off James Cameron's Titanic here in almost every respect), terrible acting from almost all sides, and again it's length--and I usually love a 3-hour movie. But not here. This movie should have ended after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, but it couldn't do that--the studio heads have to sell this movie to the teenage girls who wouldn't know if this was historically accurate or not(it wasn't, for the most part). It makes me truly sad that this movie is going to be a huge moneymaker--I doubt if it will be the next Titanic, but it might make about 300 million or so. In closing, I'll just say that the only reason I would go to see this movie, or even recommend it, is the bombing sequence(or the first 25 minutes, at least). It is sad when a films visual effects are its finest accomplishment, but that is the sad fact here. God help the future of american cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed in so many ways...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mention of the two words Pearl Harbor conjures up so many different emotions. One in particular, is sorrow. Another is anger, and with hindsight, regret.When I think of Pearl Harbor, I view it as the day that the U.S. lost its innocence and its reluctance into entering WWII wilfully. Even critics of the U.S. Military policy would be hard-pressed to see this day of infamy as anything but.Over 3000 people died, most of them, even before they even had a chance to know what hit them. To them, a motion picture that would document and help us to remember the spirit of these brave men and women would go a long way for the rest of us to remember them by and to never forget what sacrifice for love of country really is.That being said, this movie doesn't even come close to render justice to those who lost their lives. In fact, this movie trivializes and may down the road; even contribute to the falsification of its memory. That is even beside the fact that it's an awful movie. ****** THERE ARE SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THIS PORTION OF THE REVIEW. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE, DO NOT READ ON (OR READ ON AT YOUR OWN PERIL) ******What is the point of showing lots of stuff being blown up and planes whizzing around doing acrobatic tricks in a historical context?This is confusing for me because for a film that wants to 'accurately' depict what it was like to be there, it sure likes to gloss over the human component. Why are explosions, crashes, bullets, fire, ships sinking and pilots rah-rahing are given absolute cinematographic clarity and visceral impact, yet the hospital wards filled with the burned, the wounded, the dying and the dead - the result of such a blatant act of war - blurred almost to the point where they're nothing more than figures pawing their way through the ether?I certainly abhor pain and suffering, but in this case, blurring and softening the human plight of this attack doesn't offer a counter-point to the pyrotechnics we're seeing. It removes the consequences of using instruments of mass destruction, and it certainly doesn't help us re-sensitise ourselves to the fact that regardless of what this war was about or who started it, it was messy, dangerous and tragic. I think we're past the point where we can make overly-glorified movies that forget their sense of history and perspective. Back in the late 40s and early 50s, they could justify their glorifications due to the Hayes code, and the massive debt of sensitivity owed to the men and women of the Armed forces, who still had these events fresh in their minds. You would think 60 years would be enough to give a more sound perspective. Apparently, for some movie directors and producers, it's not enough time, nor a compelling enough reason.Had the premise of this movie were to be a video-game or a popcorn movie, then my chief criticisms would be the lackadaisical acting, the boring love triangle, and the simply awful dialogue in places. `Just get me into a plane' says our square-jawed hero. Sounds like a 12-year old wanting to get into those virtual video-game rides down at the arcade centre.But this movie can cause more damage than simply be a vessel of bad acting, bad dialogue or story. It has the potential to re-write history like it was an arcade game, and worse, make us forget what really transpired on December 7th, 1941.If this movie makes mountains of cash, it will be a testimony on how we consumers effectively turn historical moments into trivia, and our ability to draw understanding from tragedy reduced to terms of bankability.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The attack of Pearl Harbor, as shown in the film, could be a great resource for history classes. Other than that, this movie doesn't have many high points. I loved the trailer (Going to a lot of movies, I must have seen it 7 times), the music from The Thin Red Line fit perfectly. The trailer made it look like it was a grand epic, with a little love story to make romantics happy.Sadly, this is not the case. The first hour and 15 minutes (or so) of the film focuses mostly on the love story, and what will later become a love triangle. It is predictable, sappy, and overdone, not in an enjoyable way (as it was in You've Got Mail), but in a manner that becomes tiring all too quickly. At times you almost wish the Japanese would hurry up and bomb the place all ready, just so we can leave the pathetic attempt at romance alone.Then there's the music. If you want a good movie, you must have good music. If you saw the trailer, you know what I mean by good music. Music that stirs the soul, the moves you just by hearing it. This was not the music we had for Pearl Harbor. I will confess now than I've never been a huge Zimmer fan, but I do believe when the time calls for it he can do well. I wasn't expecting much, but even I was disappointed by his score. One point which stands out to me was when Affleck was chasing a bomber after the bombing, while music played in a background which would of fit better in a Saturday morning action cartoon than this movie. The score was uninspired, and the "great theme", which was Zimmer's excuse for rushing the rest of the music, wasn't all that profound.Another problem the film has is a contradiction between the script and the title. You would suppose the main characters would have us involved quite a bit with the events of Pearl Harbor. Sadly, the filmmakers are more concerned with telling their love story then what happened on the Infamous Day. The main characters get so off track, that another character (Cuba Gooding Jr.) has to be inserted into the story for no other reason than to have a point of view on Battleship Row during the bombing. The main characters are away from the action for the first half of the attack, and when they do enter they are not even involved in the major areas Pearl Harbor is known for. I have heard some comparisons between this film and Titanic. Though they both had love stories, Titanic was just as focused on the sinking of the ship as it was on its fictional tale of love. Pearl Harbor seems to be a love story which is interrupted by a bombing.I may be a fool, but I somewhat judge a movie by its trailer. This can be misleading, especially with comedies, but usually dramatic films give you a good idea of the story in the trailer. All in all, get Pearl Harbor on DVD, but watch the trailer and the battle scenes only. The rest is a waste of your time. Two stars out of four.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahhh, Got Any Gum?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is the deal with this movie. I went in to the theater expecting to see a movie about Pearl Harbor. After about 90 minutes, I did see this Pearl Harbor movie. This "Pearl Harbor" movie lasted at most one hour. After this two and a half hour romp, i was disgusted to see that there still was another 33 minutes left.For a film being called Pearl Harbor, there was very little focus on the events of Pearl Harbor. Instead the majority of the film was focusing on the love triangle between two boys fighting over the same girl. The problem with this was that the love was too artificial and not real at all. The characters seemed as though they were paper thin, and did not have any interest in one another.Although I will give credit where credit is due, when the movie stuck to its title, it was an exposition on a grand scale. The visuals of the bombing were stunning, and amazing. I was captivated for this 40-60 minute time period, that is about all. The other two hours were meaningless jargon gathered in an attempt to make this Disney's "Titanic." That is exactly what Disney got, a love story as pitiful as Titanic, with some nice visuals to try and compensate for where the movie lacks.While watching this movie, I felt myself just wanting to be watching other movies. I wanted to be watching "The Rock," another Michael Bay joint. This movie is better than Pearl Harbor, two fold. I also found myself wanting to watch Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. This is a much better telling of a war story.All in all, when going to see Pearl Harbor, I just expected to see a movie about Pearl Harbor. If I wanted a love story, I would have seen a film like Bounce, or When Harry Met Sally. Michael Bay should stick to what he is good at, and that is action. Pearl Harbor succeeds a great deal when it deals with action. It is too bad that it only lasts for about 40 minutes of a 180 minute film. Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film - only if it 'calls to mind'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers!It's a great film. But . . . . it IS cliched. Basically, what you have is a 21st century war propaganda film . . . about WWII. Remember now - after the movie - BUY WAR BONDS!Or, in other words, if the film works, at points, I think it's really for no other reason than that it was released on Memorial Day. I found it very moving when, toward the end, the dead still entombed in the Arizona Memorial, were mentioned by the narrator. If you identify with the love interest, and clearly the critics are loathe to do so, but where the sets and costumes and 'Francis-style' lighting encourage one to think 1940s . . 1940s, then she becomes a symbol; as you'd expect from a propaganda film. She's not just the 'dame' in the love triangle. Rather, she's the women who lost men in wartime, who served in the nursing core, both at Pearl and so many other places, and so forth. Frankly, I think Private Buckaroo, or Action in the North Atlantic, and Walking in the Sun, and so on, were better propaganda efforts, actually produced during the war. But . . . this is 2001, after all. In Titanic, the tacked on love story represented nothing but the characters, themselves, and badly at that. If Evelyn and the others are seen to represent so many others from that era, then Titanic, it's not.As for the characters, then, it's difficult to see Danny as a pilot. He doesn't look it any more than Cruise did in the much earlier Bruckheimer-fest of Top Gun (where the tacked on love story, there, was disastrous, and for the career of McGillis, as well - Kelly who?). Now Anthony Edwards, I believed. And one can imagine Rafe, both in England and elsewhere. Old photos from Britain, during the Battle of Britain, show 'fly-boys' who literally look like Hollywood's central-casting image of a fighter pilot - but for real. So Affleck is believable because . . he's that. He's the guy on the poster, telling you about those war bonds. Beckinsale's Evelyn is also nearly believable. But I think I believe the romance and proposal from the stuttering 'Red', much more easily.Ironically, I found the Doolittle Raid more involving than the sneak attack on Pearl. It's interesting that critics trying to demonstrate some command of history, here and elsewhere, forget conveniently that the attack was a secret, sneak attack. There was no 'warrior code' to be found, anywhere. It was purely a cowardly bombing run on a military base, one asleep and unaware than some particular country was literally now in a shooting war with the US. It was like the 'japs' shooting an unarmed country in the back, as it were. And it surely infuriated the American people - precisely - for that reason. That wasn't propaganda and lies. That was the reality. One could argue Roosevelt 'set it up', and so on, and so forth. But nobody made or forced the Imperial Japanese fleet to bomb the American Pacific Fleet when war had not even been declared. All for the Empire, when it was the very idea of that Japanese Empire which had to be defeated - as it was for Italy and Germany, and their '1000-year empires'. It's why the exploits of the sub crew in Das Boot, an extraordinary film, are such a tragedy - for their individual heroism, their 'imperial' cause rightly reduces them to playing the heavy.The Doolittle Raid seemed the better of the two key sequences only because more of the details seemed to be revealed. The plane crash in China may have been the most striking sequence. And historically the raid was a huge propaganda victory for the Allies who felt themselves clawing at the cliff of survival in the face of the Axis; and just as mentioned by the film's narrator, here. The raid on Pearl seemed a little light on such details. The smoke, for example, is almost absent when compared with photos and footage of just after the 2nd wave. In reality it looked like a massive tire fire, a firestorm. In the film, it looked like isolated smudge pots. The oil soaked sailors seemed believable. But the immediate rescue efforts seemed a little weak. They had more equipment than that ready to go. But film budgets are film budgets, even if they're huge. And where was the scout plane which led the attack? I thought surely that was the purpose of the opening scene in the duster - because of the visual similarity to the Japanese scout.Overall, sure . . . Rafe and Danny sink the carriers at Midway - well, if the film continued that long, sure it would have been Rafe. And he'd probably have been piloting the Enola Gay, as well, after having just single-handedly shot down a German mini-jet. Film makers can be excused for 'composite experiencing'. And such cliche as in this film is also - about - other films. It's not honest by itself. It calls . . to mind, other things. But if the critics wanted a good story, as they say, then they wouldn't make such a play about Shawshank - a hopelessly overrated effort - or American Beauty or other such wastes. That they pan this effort says nothing about filmmaking, and everything about agendas. I and others can have our agendas. And I most surely do. All those on imdb.com can have their agendas. And clearly many do. But critics tell us it's about the movies, for them - and they seem even less about the movies than the PR flacks which ginned up the Shawshank count here on this website. It's not so much that this film is 'critic proof'. I doubt few liked Raiders of the Lost Ark when first released. I think the LA guy panned it, only to have to quickly 'amend' his review a month or so, later (Champlin was his name?). It's really - why . .. . critics? I understand the concept. It's the execution that puzzles me. What the heck is a critic if he's just a Clinton-shilling Ebert, or some other slow-witted, mindless zealot who could care less about the steak, and prefers to tell the sizzle how it sounds? You know - guy - what about . . . the actual movie? That's what we're paying to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you know your history it is pretty easy to seperate the fact from the fiction in this movie. It seems that most of the reviewers that hate this movie seem to think that it is supposed to be Tora! Tora! Tora! 2001. The producers of Pearl Harbor added a love story to this movie in order to make the characters more real. If there was no love story then we would have a dry historical account of the war with no characters to root for. Taken for what it is, Pearl Harbor is an excellent movie. It has developed characters, history, love, and action. If all you want is action go see The Mummy II. If you want history rent Tora! Tora! Tora! I personally thought both of those movies were boring. Pearl Harbor, on the other hand, is a well balanced movie. I felt even more proud to be an American after viewing this movie. We have the best country in the world and we know how to make the best summer blockbusters in the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came in with some lower expectations for this film and it still didn't meet them. There is no connection at all between any of the leads here, although it's the fault of the story and script as much as the actors and the director. Cuba Gooding Jr. turns in a fine performance despite being in the movie 10 minutes tops. It's a shame, because his character and FDR are the only characters you'll care about in this movie.Our fearless leads are paper-thin, there's NOTHING different between Danny and Raph...we're supposed to like them because they used to always dream of flying...their nurse girlfriend in the love triangle Evelyn has absolutely no background at all, we don't know where she's from or what she did before back home and it doesn't really matter because she's a hot nurse, right? There's another guy in the lovable crew that stutters and some assorted nurses no one cares about. Pretty awful stuff.The film is shot pretty well and the SFX are generally good (but not a blow-away great as one might expect). But they are used in a way that's not nearly as effective as Saving Private Ryan or Titanic, which the battle scenes will make you think of. There is not much else redeeming here, the score is quite forgettable and generic despite coming from Hans Zimmer. The attempts at humor fall pretty flat. The whole movie is extremely predictable to boot.Let's not forget what happens after the Pearl Harbor attack itself; the ending hour or so of the movie should have been completely cut as it only serves to make the film worse... this is really when the movie sinks into "The Perfect Storm"-level badness. Most of what did actually work in the movie gets thrown out the window for a completely pointless attempt to give us patriotic feelings or something, I guess.Bay's other films like the Rock and Armageddon (both of which I enjoyed), however maligned they are, are vastly superior to this one. At least those films had some characters to care about. There was tension there that this movie lacks... this movie is truly lacking heart.Still probably worth a rental just for the 45-minute battle scene but the rest is very worthless. 3/10 (just for the Battle Scene), rest of the movie (1/10)</fullReview>

From the super sappy romantic invasion, to the cheesy bombs dropping from Balwin's mouth, Pearl harbor was, hate to say it, a dud.I'm a fan of a good romantic war movie as much as the next sensitive, in touch with his feelings kind of a guy, but the unrelenting cross fire between Afleck, Harnett and Nurse Beckinsale had me ducking for cover more than once. The actual battle scenes were pretty cool although way Hollywood but I knew this wasn't supposed to be a history lesson. If not for them, I would have raised the white flag after the first hour.Although the incredible hype over this movie would make any real American shell out 8 clams for this battle fatigued epic, I suggest you wait for the video and save your cash for war bonds.That is all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Just so you know, what I'm writing about the movie in no way reflects my opinions of the actual Pearl Harbor. I totally recognize the heroic sacrific they made to ensure our way of life, and this is strictly about the MOVIE) I was so excited about seeing this movie. The previews made it look like a 100% adrenline rush. A love story? Okay, as long as it isn't overblown. Unfortuantly, I was gravely mistaken. Probably the most entertaining thing about the whole movie was the first half of the attack. It was simply amazing, watching the Zeros swarm in and out of the ships. But, the second half, when Ben Affleck takes to the sky, became boring because the whole thing was SO TEDIOUS. Man, this movie was so overdone. The first hour and a half were INSANELY BORING. EVERYONE has to answer every question with a monologue. The characters are uninteresting, boring and I can't even name five people from the lot. The love triangle was contrived and allowed everyone in the movie to become part of a war cliche. Everything was tedious about the introduction. It was like staring at a wall for fourty-five minutes with romatic music in the background. Even after the attack, it was so tedious because SO LITTLE action happened. Contrived, sappy, melodramatic and generally BAD is what Pearl Harbor is. If you want to see a good World War II movie, see Enemy at the Gates. This gets a 4/10, only for the attack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just lost three hours plus travel time on this movie, so I'll be brief here to spare myself a bit.I'd read the reviews and properly lowered my expectations because a couple of friends wanted to see PEARL HARBOR. Even those lowered expectations weren't met. This souless thing... yeesh. Blows every opportunity it has. It saps the buildup toward the Japanese attack of any mounting sense of dread, manages to make four love stories unbelievable (including Ben and Josh's -- hey, folks, "best buddies" is a love story whether you like it or not), makes the full-on attack pretty tensionless, and insults the first decorated black soldier by pinning it on him while he's still alive. Jon Voight is pretty good as FDR, I'll say that, but even his makeup in his first scene is bad enough to be pretty distracting (it smooths out later).My buddies wanted to see it for the action, and we all came away disappointed. The cinematography is mostly expert, though the decision to use a flawed lens in a key hospital sequence was, well, flawed. It muddled things to have characters drifting in and out of focus as they moved about in the frame, and rather than evoking (as TRAFFIC did), it distracts. Brave idea, though.I dearly hope I've put someone off seeing this. My sacrifice will have been worth it. And if you've decided you'll just wait for the video, I'd strongly suggest not even bothering then. It really is that poor: poor of imagination, poor of craft, poor of humanity. With an epic war movie and love story, this kills.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Living in Hawaii all my life and having worked on base at Pearl Harbor, I've probably heard more hype about this movie than most. I heard things like, "It's going to be the next Titanic." I saw the movie on opening night, and it's far from being a Titanic or Gladiator. The movie was somewhat slow and lacked depth. I wondered how they would work a good love story into something like the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the answer is that it isn't a very good love story. I didn't get the feeling that the characters were really in love, other than they told each other they were. In lust, possibly. The notion of a love triangle to begin with was a bad idea. It's not something very romantic and not bound to make many girls weepy eyed. The attack on Pearl Harbor was visually impressive, but didn't draw much emotion in the way Titanic did because you didn't really care about the characters. The movie also had less than I thought it would about Pearl Harbor, for a movie entitled, "Pearl Harbor." All in all, I would say the movie was just okay. It's worth seeing in the theaters for the special effects, but other than that, I'd say it's one to wait for the home video release. It would've been better if it was shorter and less drawn out, the characters had more depth, and the story surrounding the two best friends as being superhero ace fighter pilots wasn't so cheesy. At times I felt like Bruckheimer and Bay were trying to do a remake of Armageddon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe I'm wasting my limited, precious time on writing a review for this film ? but I was just so incensed from watching it that I had to go back to my PC and deliver the goods! Like many people, I was attracted to the trailer, and also I'm a war-monger. And when Hollywood dumps a lot of dollars into a big war picture, I'll be Johnny-on-the-Spot. In light of this, I took my fellow-war-monger friend with me ? expecting at least a competent picture. And, after both watching `Enemy at the Gates' ? we were hungry for a better war picture, and had one since `The Thin Red Line'. However, more often than not, we were turning to each other and rolling our eyes during `Pearl Harbor'. Spoiler Alert First of all, Randall Wallace has a lot of explaining to do. I liked `Braveheart' ? which was a passable film with a competent script ? but `Pearl Harbor's script is just LOUSY. After beginning with the clichéd love triangle, complete with the over-used But-I-Thought-You-Were-Dead angle ? the script offers us a lot of superficial characters with trite and laughable lines. As I glanced at my watch (for the umpteenth) time to see how much longer I would have to suffer through this major letdown, a whole hour went by focusing on the trite love triangle ? with no setup regarding the Japanese. When the Japanese finally make their appearance, they are portrayed as robotic and stereotyped. What's more, the writer didn't bother to personalize or dramatize the attack/plan from the Japanese perspective. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays the token politically-correct black guy who may be a cook, but get him in the boxing ring and look out ? as if we really care by this point. Echoing another viewer's comments, this character is redundant ? he's just there for the minorities in the audience.The story really should've ended at Pearl. But wait, there's more! The Doolittle Raid on Tokyo. The only good thing about this part was that it killed off one of the leads. I don't know how many people were laughing when Alec Baldwin was giving his pep talk to the pilots in the ready room ? but it was more than one, myself included. Baldwin cannot play a gruff, tough military man ? he's just too sensitive and urbane, and his performance came off as too campy and laughable. As far as the acting goes, most of the veteran actors are good, and I'm talking about Voight and the like. The leads are another story. The two pilots Rafe and Danny are just good old boy southerners who are patriotic and loving the same woman ? but that's ABOUT IT. We barely get to know these characters. FDR had more character development than these hayseeds. Kate Beckinsale (FOX!) was passable, but she suffers the same fate as every other actor in the movie: She just doesn't have the LINES. I don't want to sound chauvinistic, but there were SO MANY scenes with the nurses ? it almost came off like a chick flick. I wouldn't have minded it so much, but the writer didn't develop these women, nor give them any flaws, dreams, fears, ANYTHING: It was all, `Tee-hee, tee-hee, did you see that cute pilot staring at me?'. Jesus! I was almost CHOKING from all the close-ups in `Pearl'. Now, where is the pony in all this s***? His name is: SFX. The aerial sequences and the attack on the Seventh Fleet are quite amazing ? thanks to the folks at ILM. Unfortunately, we had to sit through two hours of forgettable cinema to get to them. And I thought `Enemy at the Gates' was a mediocre film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three hours. Sure seemed like five.This movie had some very impressive ads. You saw children camping on hillsides and playing baseball as japanese planes flew by. You looked at the huge theater lobby posters of those same shots and thought, 'Damn that's an evocative shot. There's got to be a great story behind those images.' Nope. Not a chance. That would require depth and plot development. This move sells itself as another Saving Private Ryan, would actually prefer to be another Titanic, and actually delivers schlocky soap opera fluff.The best part of the evening was the fun we had playing, 'Guess the movie they wanted to rip off', with every scene in the film. As has been mentioned constantly, the movie would really love to be Titanic ("for the chicks"), with some vague attempts at a PG-13 de-gored Pvt. Ryan ("to pull the guys in"). Everything from 'From Here to Eternity', to just about every WWII genre pic you'd care to name, to Bay's own 'Armageddon' are in heavy visual rotation.I particularly enjoyed the completely pace-killing editing they did during some of the first actually well-done FX footage: Well executed fx shots of Afleck's spitfire dog fighting with german aircraft. BOOM! Spectacular explosion of a german aircraft... STOP! Now lets take a lovely pensive look at Kate Beckinsale wandering around aimlessly, and completely irrelevently, back in the states. NOW BACK TO THE ACTION!Lather rinse repeat. They did this throughout the film. Talk about frustrating!The first 45mins to an hour were pretty much a waste of time to anyone that had come to see the movie in the previews. The events from Dec. 7th, though factually 'out there' at least were pretty well executed. But the remainder of the film, involving a particularly bad fictionalized 30min compressed version of Doolittle's raid on Japan (involving our intrepid fighter jocks as Mitchell Bomber pilot's no less - It's unfortunate that the scenes of Aflleck and Hartnett flying the Enola Gay over Hiroshima had to be cut for time.:P), was really an after-thought at best.There were at least three potentially good films trapped in this bloated whale: A love story about a spunky fighter pilot who abandon's his true love to run off to fight with the Brits before the war; The story of the world-changing events surrounding Dec. 7th; and the story of Doolittle's raid. Any one of which could have been a good film (and generally have been in the past, see '30 Seconds Over Tokyo' for example). Instead we get one bloated, completely misadvertised piece of fluff. Heck I probably wouldn't have minded two of the three overstuffed plots above, if they'd been even mentioned in the previews.Save your time, save your money. Rent the DVD and skip to the battle sequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My impression of Pearl Harbor left a lot to be desired; to me it was a 1 1/2 hour love story combined with a 1 1/2 hour blood and gore presentation designed to numb the senses. The attack was overdone, the director seemed intent on accounting for every one of the 2400 + Americans killed on that infamous day.Admittedly the technical re-creation aided by computer generated events and special effects were Oscar-quality. There were numerous instances where the equipment and weaponary were of a much latter vintage..but you have to work with what you have. Aerial views of the Japanese fleet looked more like what it was, our modern-day Navy. Aircraft carriers of the 1940's did not have the elaborate superstructure or the angled flight deck as an example. As a documentary, it was superficial; as a love story, too corny.In summary, the special effect were the only attribute, forget about the storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well the first of many exciting summer blockbusters has arrived and it delivers on the special effects front, but not much elsewhere.Pearl Harbor is a story about two friends (can't remember their names in the movie and don't care enough to check) who like to fly planes. One of them gets a great girlfriend but decides to go off and fight the war, after his plane gets shot down everyone assumes he's dead and his friend decides to put the moves on his girlfriend. You can probably guess where the movie goes from here. Oh, I forgot to mention that they all wind up at Pearl Harbor on December 7 1941. The story is predictable and hokey but not quite as laughably cheesy as Titanic. Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale all deliver better performances that Leonardo Dicaprio or Kate Winslet, but that's really not saying much.Anyway, enough about the stupid story. On to the battle scenes! The movie really delivers on this aspect with some of the biggest, most fantastic special effects I've seen to date. It's got huge explosions, wizzing bullets, crashing planes, fast paced dogfights, sinking ships, falling bombs and anything else you can think of. The Pearl Harbor attack scene is the highlight, of course, lasting about 40 minutes or so. However there are a couple other scenes that are quite impressive as well. Don't expect perfect historical accuracy though as this is something of a watered down version of the attack. One thing most veterans claim is the most memorable aspect of the attack is the oil spread all over the water igniting and burning sailors alive. There are no shots of this but there are a few inside the hospital of sailors covered in oil. This is a PG-13 Disney production though so expect the actual blood and gore to be at a minimum.My biggest problem with Pearl Harbor is the length. They essentially took a love story that could've been packed into less than an hour of footage and extended it over two hours. This can get quite annoying for the first 2/3rds of the film is extremely slow and uninteresting. If they had trimmed even half an hour off it would've made the film much more enjoyable. Oh well, I'll probably buy the DVD so I can skip straight to the good parts.So if you're looking for a big special effects extravaganza then Pearl Harbor will surely hit home, although you might consider walking in an hour late. If you're looking for a truly excellent movie with lots of depth, I would recommend you steer clear of Pearl Harbor and find a theater playing Memento instead. I'm going to do something I haven't done before which is give Pearl Harbor a couple different ratings. My final rating for the movie as a whole is a 5 out of 10. If they had chopped 20-30 minutes off the useless crap I would've given it a 6. 30-45 minutes would've gotten it a 7. And 45 minutes to an hour would've gotten it an 8. That's my opinion, enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is the finest mediocre film that I've ever seen.First, I will admit that the photography is delicious and gorgeous, and that the war scenes are fantastic and extreme well-done.But then, that's about all the nice things I can say about this film.Most of the acting is bland and rather wooden, and any good acting that might be there is ruined by a script dominated by a dull, uninvolving love story and silly, often putrid lines of dialogue. I had forgotten that so many cliches could be found in one script.Michael Bay is at his finest during scenes of great action, but he seems really uninspired and lifeless during any scene not requiring some adrenaline. He also cuts away far too often, and many of his close-ups look too close-up. The score is repetitive to the point of being grating as well.This has also has to be the most blatantly condescending and emotionally manipulative film I've seen in a while.At least I could enjoy the beautiful photography whenever the story annoyed me.Non-war scenes: 3.5/10 (lame), 65% of the film War scenes: 8.5/10 (excellent), 35% of the filmAverage Rating: (3.5 x .65) + (8.5 x .35) = 5.25/10--Mediocre</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie, which was probably foolish considering the people behind it. Pearl Harbor should have a historically accurate dramatization. Instead it was another "blockbuster" style movie from Bruckhiemer/Bay, and Company. You would think such an important event in United States history would have inspired a sophisticated rendering, but, alas, money takes precedent over art. It just wasn't the epic it wanted to be. There were good points. Jon Voight was excellent as FDR, the actual attack was superbly done, and Cuba Gooding Jr. stole my heart. We could have done without the love triangle. It seemed so shallow and unimportant against the backdrop of an event that shook America's isolation idealism to the core. Some say Pearl Harbor was aspiring to be the next Titanic. All I can say is, at the end of Titanic, I wasn't thinking about my rear end being numb. I'll have to wait for The Lord of the Rings to fulfill my epic desires.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Living in Hawaii all my life and having worked on base at Pearl Harbor, I've probably heard more hype about this movie than most. I heard things like, "It's going to be the next Titanic." I saw the movie on opening night, and it's far from being a Titanic or Gladiator. The movie was somewhat slow and lacked depth. I wondered how they would work a good love story into something like the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the answer is that it isn't a very good love story. I didn't get the feeling that the characters were really in love, other than they told each other they were. In lust, possibly. The notion of a love triangle to begin with was a bad idea. It's not something very romantic and not bound to make many girls weepy eyed. The attack on Pearl Harbor was visually impressive, but didn't draw much emotion in the way Titanic did because you didn't really care about the characters. The movie also had less than I thought it would about Pearl Harbor, for a movie entitled, "Pearl Harbor." All in all, I would say the movie was just okay. It's worth seeing in the theaters for the special effects, but other than that, I'd say it's one to wait for the home video release. It would've been better if it was shorter and less drawn out, the characters had more depth, and the story surrounding the two best friends as being superhero ace fighter pilots wasn't so cheesy. At times I felt like Bruckheimer and Bay were trying to do a remake of Armageddon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe I'm wasting my limited, precious time on writing a review for this film ? but I was just so incensed from watching it that I had to go back to my PC and deliver the goods! Like many people, I was attracted to the trailer, and also I'm a war-monger. And when Hollywood dumps a lot of dollars into a big war picture, I'll be Johnny-on-the-Spot. In light of this, I took my fellow-war-monger friend with me ? expecting at least a competent picture. And, after both watching `Enemy at the Gates' ? we were hungry for a better war picture, and had one since `The Thin Red Line'. However, more often than not, we were turning to each other and rolling our eyes during `Pearl Harbor'. Spoiler Alert First of all, Randall Wallace has a lot of explaining to do. I liked `Braveheart' ? which was a passable film with a competent script ? but `Pearl Harbor's script is just LOUSY. After beginning with the clichéd love triangle, complete with the over-used But-I-Thought-You-Were-Dead angle ? the script offers us a lot of superficial characters with trite and laughable lines. As I glanced at my watch (for the umpteenth) time to see how much longer I would have to suffer through this major letdown, a whole hour went by focusing on the trite love triangle ? with no setup regarding the Japanese. When the Japanese finally make their appearance, they are portrayed as robotic and stereotyped. What's more, the writer didn't bother to personalize or dramatize the attack/plan from the Japanese perspective. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays the token politically-correct black guy who may be a cook, but get him in the boxing ring and look out ? as if we really care by this point. Echoing another viewer's comments, this character is redundant ? he's just there for the minorities in the audience.The story really should've ended at Pearl. But wait, there's more! The Doolittle Raid on Tokyo. The only good thing about this part was that it killed off one of the leads. I don't know how many people were laughing when Alec Baldwin was giving his pep talk to the pilots in the ready room ? but it was more than one, myself included. Baldwin cannot play a gruff, tough military man ? he's just too sensitive and urbane, and his performance came off as too campy and laughable. As far as the acting goes, most of the veteran actors are good, and I'm talking about Voight and the like. The leads are another story. The two pilots Rafe and Danny are just good old boy southerners who are patriotic and loving the same woman ? but that's ABOUT IT. We barely get to know these characters. FDR had more character development than these hayseeds. Kate Beckinsale (FOX!) was passable, but she suffers the same fate as every other actor in the movie: She just doesn't have the LINES. I don't want to sound chauvinistic, but there were SO MANY scenes with the nurses ? it almost came off like a chick flick. I wouldn't have minded it so much, but the writer didn't develop these women, nor give them any flaws, dreams, fears, ANYTHING: It was all, `Tee-hee, tee-hee, did you see that cute pilot staring at me?'. Jesus! I was almost CHOKING from all the close-ups in `Pearl'. Now, where is the pony in all this s***? His name is: SFX. The aerial sequences and the attack on the Seventh Fleet are quite amazing ? thanks to the folks at ILM. Unfortunately, we had to sit through two hours of forgettable cinema to get to them. And I thought `Enemy at the Gates' was a mediocre film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three hours. Sure seemed like five.This movie had some very impressive ads. You saw children camping on hillsides and playing baseball as japanese planes flew by. You looked at the huge theater lobby posters of those same shots and thought, 'Damn that's an evocative shot. There's got to be a great story behind those images.' Nope. Not a chance. That would require depth and plot development.

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor: torpedoed by cliches.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's official: Michael Bay has terminal directorial ADD. I have to say that the reason why we are seeing this film in the first place is one of the most brilliantly orchestrated action sequences in the history of film. No one ever said Bay can't blow up things in a virtuoso way, and the 35 minute Pearl Harbor bombing segment is a jaw dropper. If only Randall Wallace's cliche ridden script had been equally explosive. You get the feeling that Bay wants to earn respectability, that he wants to slow down his hyper kinetic tempo to make a film with texture. Unfortunately, he can't help himself, instead relying on a Norman Rockwell storyline of an America that never existed outside of a middle school textbook. Is there any cliche left unturned here? The two guys in love with the same girl? The gee shucks "come back for the both of us" dialogue? The shots in the butt infirmary scene? Nurses and GIs thrown together in the cauldron of war? A few cryptic, rushed along scenes of inscrutably stoic Japanese officers, frenetic US politicians, military advisors, and a determined FDR all changing world history in Michael Bay's patented emotional shorthand??????? Of course, none of this movie lover's two cents is going to prevent making Jerry Bruckheimer an even richer man or Michael Bay from ignoring the blistering reviews that have already torpedoed this movie. Nuff said.</fullReview>

Everything was captured so perfect, I felt like I was right there alongside the guys. I'm sure some will disagree, but I do not know why. The emotions I felt during this movie were above and beyond the emotions I have had in other movies I have seen of this magnitude. The actors were great, Josh Hartnett deserves an A+ and will receive many roles after his breakout performance, although I thought his past movies were excellent as well. I believe many veterans of the war will bring this movie very close to their hearts. The feeling I received when death was on the line for the people, and they pulled through, just awesome. It comes down to fighting for what you believe in, and this movie was a great depiction of that period. I give it a 10!!! :)</fullReview>

In light of this, I took my fellow-war-monger friend with me ? expecting at least a competent picture. And, after both watching `Enemy at the Gates' ? we were hungry for a better war picture, and had one since `The Thin Red Line'. However, more often than not, we were turning to each other and rolling our eyes during `Pearl Harbor'. Spoiler Alert First of all, Randall Wallace has a lot of explaining to do. I liked `Braveheart' ? which was a passable film with a competent script ? but `Pearl Harbor's script is just LOUSY. After beginning with the clichéd love triangle, complete with the over-used But-I-Thought-You-Were-Dead angle ? the script offers us a lot of superficial characters with trite and laughable lines. As I glanced at my watch (for the umpteenth) time to see how much longer I would have to suffer through this major letdown, a whole hour went by focusing on the trite love triangle ? with no setup regarding the Japanese. When the Japanese finally make their appearance, they are portrayed as robotic and stereotyped. What's more, the writer didn't bother to personalize or dramatize the attack/plan from the Japanese perspective. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays the token politically-correct black guy who may be a cook, but get him in the boxing ring and look out ? as if we really care by this point. Echoing another viewer's comments, this character is redundant ? he's just there for the minorities in the audience.The story really should've ended at Pearl. But wait, there's more! The Doolittle Raid on Tokyo. The only good thing about this part was that it killed off one of the leads. I don't know how many people were laughing when Alec Baldwin was giving his pep talk to the pilots in the ready room ? but it was more than one, myself included. Baldwin cannot play a gruff, tough military man ? he's just too sensitive and urbane, and his performance came off as too campy and laughable. As far as the acting goes, most of the veteran actors are good, and I'm talking about Voight and the like. The leads are another story. The two pilots Rafe and Danny are just good old boy southerners who are patriotic and loving the same woman ? but that's ABOUT IT. We barely get to know these characters. FDR had more character development than these hayseeds. Kate Beckinsale (FOX!) was passable, but she suffers the same fate as every other actor in the movie: She just doesn't have the LINES. I don't want to sound chauvinistic, but there were SO MANY scenes with the nurses ? it almost came off like a chick flick. I wouldn't have minded it so much, but the writer didn't develop these women, nor give them any flaws, dreams, fears, ANYTHING: It was all, `Tee-hee, tee-hee, did you see that cute pilot staring at me?'. Jesus! I was almost CHOKING from all the close-ups in `Pearl'. Now, where is the pony in all this s***? His name is: SFX. The aerial sequences and the attack on the Seventh Fleet are quite amazing ? thanks to the folks at ILM. Unfortunately, we had to sit through two hours of forgettable cinema to get to them. And I thought `Enemy at the Gates' was a mediocre film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three hours. Sure seemed like five.This movie had some very impressive ads. You saw children camping on hillsides and playing baseball as japanese planes flew by. You looked at the huge theater lobby posters of those same shots and thought, 'Damn that's an evocative shot. There's got to be a great story behind those images.' Nope. Not a chance. That would require depth and plot development. This move sells itself as another Saving Private Ryan, would actually prefer to be another Titanic, and actually delivers schlocky soap opera fluff.The best part of the evening was the fun we had playing, 'Guess the movie they wanted to rip off', with every scene in the film. As has been mentioned constantly, the movie would really love to be Titanic ("for the chicks"), with some vague attempts at a PG-13 de-gored Pvt. Ryan ("to pull the guys in"). Everything from 'From Here to Eternity', to just about every WWII genre pic you'd care to name, to Bay's own 'Armageddon' are in heavy visual rotation.I particularly enjoyed the completely pace-killing editing they did during some of the first actually well-done FX footage: Well executed fx shots of Afleck's spitfire dog fighting with german aircraft. BOOM! Spectacular explosion of a german aircraft... STOP! Now lets take a lovely pensive look at Kate Beckinsale wandering around aimlessly, and completely irrelevently, back in the states. NOW BACK TO THE ACTION!Lather rinse repeat. They did this throughout the film. Talk about frustrating!The first 45mins to an hour were pretty much a waste of time to anyone that had come to see the movie in the previews. The events from Dec. 7th, though factually 'out there' at least were pretty well executed. But the remainder of the film, involving a particularly bad fictionalized 30min compressed version of Doolittle's raid on Japan (involving our intrepid fighter jocks as Mitchell Bomber pilot's no less - It's unfortunate that the scenes of Aflleck and Hartnett flying the Enola Gay over Hiroshima had to be cut for time.:P), was really an after-thought at best.There were at least three potentially good films trapped in this bloated whale: A love story about a spunky fighter pilot who abandon's his true love to run off to fight with the Brits before the war; The story of the world-changing events surrounding Dec. 7th; and the story of Doolittle's raid. Any one of which could have been a good film (and generally have been in the past, see '30 Seconds Over Tokyo' for example). Instead we get one bloated, completely misadvertised piece of fluff. Heck I probably wouldn't have minded two of the three overstuffed plots above, if they'd been even mentioned in the previews.Save your time, save your money. Rent the DVD and skip to the battle sequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well the first of many exciting summer blockbusters has arrived and it delivers on the special effects front, but not much elsewhere.Pearl Harbor is a story about two friends (can't remember their names in the movie and don't care enough to check) who like to fly planes. One of them gets a great girlfriend but decides to go off and fight the war, after his plane gets shot down everyone assumes he's dead and his friend decides to put the moves on his girlfriend. You can probably guess where the movie goes from here. Oh, I forgot to mention that they all wind up at Pearl Harbor on December 7 1941. The story is predictable and hokey but not quite as laughably cheesy as Titanic. Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale all deliver better performances that Leonardo Dicaprio or Kate Winslet, but that's really not saying much.Anyway, enough about the stupid story. On to the battle scenes! The movie really delivers on this aspect with some of the biggest, most fantastic special effects I've seen to date. It's got huge explosions, wizzing bullets, crashing planes, fast paced dogfights, sinking ships, falling bombs and anything else you can think of. The Pearl Harbor attack scene is the highlight, of course, lasting about 40 minutes or so. However there are a couple other scenes that are quite impressive as well. Don't expect perfect historical accuracy though as this is something of a watered down version of the attack. One thing most veterans claim is the most memorable aspect of the attack is the oil spread all over the water igniting and burning sailors alive. There are no shots of this but there are a few inside the hospital of sailors covered in oil. This is a PG-13 Disney production though so expect the actual blood and gore to be at a minimum.My biggest problem with Pearl Harbor is the length. They essentially took a love story that could've been packed into less than an hour of footage and extended it over two hours. This can get quite annoying for the first 2/3rds of the film is extremely slow and uninteresting. If they had trimmed even half an hour off it would've made the film much more enjoyable. Oh well, I'll probably buy the DVD so I can skip straight to the good parts.So if you're looking for a big special effects extravaganza then Pearl Harbor will surely hit home, although you might consider walking in an hour late. If you're looking for a truly excellent movie with lots of depth, I would recommend you steer clear of Pearl Harbor and find a theater playing Memento instead. I'm going to do something I haven't done before which is give Pearl Harbor a couple different ratings. My final rating for the movie as a whole is a 5 out of 10. If they had chopped 20-30 minutes off the useless crap I would've given it a 6. 30-45 minutes would've gotten it a 7. And 45 minutes to an hour would've gotten it an 8. That's my opinion, enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is the finest mediocre film that I've ever seen.First, I will admit that the photography is delicious and gorgeous, and that the war scenes are fantastic and extreme well-done.But then, that's about all the nice things I can say about this film.Most of the acting is bland and rather wooden, and any good acting that might be there is ruined by a script dominated by a dull, uninvolving love story and silly, often putrid lines of dialogue. I had forgotten that so many cliches could be found in one script.Michael Bay is at his finest during scenes of great action, but he seems really uninspired and lifeless during any scene not requiring some adrenaline. He also cuts away far too often, and many of his close-ups look too close-up. The score is repetitive to the point of being grating as well.This has also has to be the most blatantly condescending and emotionally manipulative film I've seen in a while.At least I could enjoy the beautiful photography whenever the story annoyed me.Non-war scenes: 3.5/10 (lame), 65% of the film War scenes: 8.5/10 (excellent), 35% of the filmAverage Rating: (3.5 x .65) + (8.5 x .35) = 5.25/10--Mediocre</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie, which was probably foolish considering the people behind it. Pearl Harbor should have a historically accurate dramatization. Instead it was another "blockbuster" style movie from Bruckhiemer/Bay, and Company. You would think such an important event in United States history would have inspired a sophisticated rendering, but, alas, money takes precedent over art. It just wasn't the epic it wanted to be. There were good points. Jon Voight was excellent as FDR, the actual attack was superbly done, and Cuba Gooding Jr. stole my heart. We could have done without the love triangle. It seemed so shallow and unimportant against the backdrop of an event that shook America's isolation idealism to the core. Some say Pearl Harbor was aspiring to be the next Titanic. All I can say is, at the end of Titanic, I wasn't thinking about my rear end being numb. I'll have to wait for The Lord of the Rings to fulfill my epic desires.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Living in Hawaii all my life and having worked on base at Pearl Harbor, I've probably heard more hype about this movie than most. I heard things like, "It's going to be the next Titanic." I saw the movie on opening night, and it's far from being a Titanic or Gladiator. The movie was somewhat slow and lacked depth. I wondered how they would work a good love story into something like the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the answer is that it isn't a very good love story. I didn't get the feeling that the characters were really in love, other than they told each other they were. In lust, possibly. The notion of a love triangle to begin with was a bad idea. It's not something very romantic and not bound to make many girls weepy eyed. The attack on Pearl Harbor was visually impressive, but didn't draw much emotion in the way Titanic did because you didn't really care about the characters. The movie also had less than I thought it would about Pearl Harbor, for a movie entitled, "Pearl Harbor." All in all, I would say the movie was just okay. It's worth seeing in the theaters for the special effects, but other than that, I'd say it's one to wait for the home video release. It would've been better if it was shorter and less drawn out, the characters had more depth, and the story surrounding the two best friends as being superhero ace fighter pilots wasn't so cheesy. At times I felt like Bruckheimer and Bay were trying to do a remake of Armageddon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor: torpedoed by cliches.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's official: Michael Bay has terminal directorial ADD. I have to say that the reason why we are seeing this film in the first place is one of the most brilliantly orchestrated action sequences in the history of film. No one ever said Bay can't blow up things in a virtuoso way, and the 35 minute Pearl Harbor bombing segment is a jaw dropper. If only Randall Wallace's cliche ridden script had been equally explosive. You get the feeling that Bay wants to earn respectability, that he wants to slow down his hyper kinetic tempo to make a film with texture. Unfortunately, he can't help himself, instead relying on a Norman Rockwell storyline of an America that never existed outside of a middle school textbook. Is there any cliche left unturned here? The two guys in love with the same girl? The gee shucks "come back for the both of us" dialogue? The shots in the butt infirmary scene? Nurses and GIs thrown together in the cauldron of war? A few cryptic, rushed along scenes of inscrutably stoic Japanese officers, frenetic US politicians, military advisors, and a determined FDR all changing world history in Michael Bay's patented emotional shorthand??????? Of course, none of this movie lover's two cents is going to prevent making Jerry Bruckheimer an even richer man or Michael Bay from ignoring the blistering reviews that have already torpedoed this movie. Nuff said.</fullReview>

This move sells itself as another Saving Private Ryan, would actually prefer to be another Titanic, and actually delivers schlocky soap opera fluff.The best part of the evening was the fun we had playing, 'Guess the movie they wanted to rip off', with every scene in the film. As has been mentioned constantly, the movie would really love to be Titanic ("for the chicks"), with some vague attempts at a PG-13 de-gored Pvt. Ryan ("to pull the guys in"). Everything from 'From Here to Eternity', to just about every WWII genre pic you'd care to name, to Bay's own 'Armageddon' are in heavy visual rotation.I particularly enjoyed the completely pace-killing editing they did during some of the first actually well-done FX footage: Well executed fx shots of Afleck's spitfire dog fighting with german aircraft. BOOM! Spectacular explosion of a german aircraft... STOP! Now lets take a lovely pensive look at Kate Beckinsale wandering around aimlessly, and completely irrelevently, back in the states. NOW BACK TO THE ACTION!Lather rinse repeat. They did this throughout the film. Talk about frustrating!The first 45mins to an hour were pretty much a waste of time to anyone that had come to see the movie in the previews. The events from Dec. 7th, though factually 'out there' at least were pretty well executed. But the remainder of the film, involving a particularly bad fictionalized 30min compressed version of Doolittle's raid on Japan (involving our intrepid fighter jocks as Mitchell Bomber pilot's no less - It's unfortunate that the scenes of Aflleck and Hartnett flying the Enola Gay over Hiroshima had to be cut for time.:P), was really an after-thought at best.There were at least three potentially good films trapped in this bloated whale: A love story about a spunky fighter pilot who abandon's his true love to run off to fight with the Brits before the war; The story of the world-changing events surrounding Dec. 7th; and the story of Doolittle's raid. Any one of which could have been a good film (and generally have been in the past, see '30 Seconds Over Tokyo' for example). Instead we get one bloated, completely misadvertised piece of fluff. Heck I probably wouldn't have minded two of the three overstuffed plots above, if they'd been even mentioned in the previews.Save your time, save your money.

		<fullReview>It's official: Michael Bay has terminal directorial ADD. I have to say that the reason why we are seeing this film in the first place is one of the most brilliantly orchestrated action sequences in the history of film. No one ever said Bay can't blow up things in a virtuoso way, and the 35 minute Pearl Harbor bombing segment is a jaw dropper. If only Randall Wallace's cliche ridden script had been equally explosive. You get the feeling that Bay wants to earn respectability, that he wants to slow down his hyper kinetic tempo to make a film with texture. Unfortunately, he can't help himself, instead relying on a Norman Rockwell storyline of an America that never existed outside of a middle school textbook. Is there any cliche left unturned here? The two guys in love with the same girl? The gee shucks "come back for the both of us" dialogue? The shots in the butt infirmary scene? Nurses and GIs thrown together in the cauldron of war? A few cryptic, rushed along scenes of inscrutably stoic Japanese officers, frenetic US politicians, military advisors, and a determined FDR all changing world history in Michael Bay's patented emotional shorthand??????? Of course, none of this movie lover's two cents is going to prevent making Jerry Bruckheimer an even richer man or Michael Bay from ignoring the blistering reviews that have already torpedoed this movie.

		<shortDescription>Historical fiction that delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Too often, movies predicted to be block-busters end up fizzling. Too often, Hollywood takes a historical event, makes a fictitious film based on it, and ruins both the event and the film. Happily, neither problem occurred with "Pearl Harbor." This is a film well worth a theater viewing, and not just for the special effects (which it has in plenty). It's long (about 3 hours), so be prepared, but unlike most long films I have seen, it does not drag. You wouldn't think an event as well known to us as Pearl Harbor would keep you on the edge of your seat, but at least for me, it did. I really felt like I was watching the actual attack on Pearl Harbor during the battle sequence. There are a few slightly graphic, bloody scenes in the hospital during and after the attack that perhaps we could have done without, but there wasn't too much gore -- nothing like "Saving Private Ryan" or "Patriot."I found the acting to be reasonably good. Kate Beckinsale has been a favorite of mine since her surprising performance in Kenneth Branagh's "Much Ado About Nothing," and she did an excellent job in "Pearl Harbor" as well. Ben Affleck turned in a good performance also, as did most of the supporting cast. There is of course the typical Hollywood love story in the film, but they managed to do it gracefully enough that it did not seem *too* trite (though it was a bit annoying at times). The directing was outstanding, the script was good, and the music was excellent. "Pearl Harbor" won't go down in history as the greatest movie ever made, but it's the best film I've seen so far this year, and it was good enough that I will probably buy the DVD when it comes out -- which means it was good enough to watch several times, since otherwise I would not wish to own it.My score: 8/10</fullReview>

Jon Voight is pretty good as FDR, I'll say that, but even his makeup in his first scene is bad enough to be pretty distracting (it smooths out later).My buddies wanted to see it for the action, and we all came away disappointed. The cinematography is mostly expert, though the decision to use a flawed lens in a key hospital sequence was, well, flawed. It muddled things to have characters drifting in and out of focus as they moved about in the frame, and rather than evoking (as TRAFFIC did), it distracts. Brave idea, though.I dearly hope I've put someone off seeing this. My sacrifice will have been worth it. And if you've decided you'll just wait for the video, I'd strongly suggest not even bothering then. It really is that poor: poor of imagination, poor of craft, poor of humanity.

		<fullReview>Billed as one of the blockbusters of the summer, Pearl Harbor provided three hours of entertainment with a few special nuggets and relatively few gaffes. Although audiences will probably remember this film for its epic battle sequences, it was the emotions and the thought-provoking situations that made this movie a success. This film fulfills the World War II combat film genre without resorting to many of its clichés. The film may not be 100% historically accurate, but it gives a good example of the kinds of things that did happen. Ben Affleck delivers a spell-binding performance as the film's hero. He keeps it real by bringing out the character's weaknesses in addition to his strengths. The plot kept the film moving, so the three hours literally flew by. However, the love-triangle scenario gets too predictable at the end, and at times you wonder if the characters feel the same emotions of the tragedy of war that the audience is feeling. The dialogue seemed a bit contrived in places, and a couple of lines seem to be lifted straight from previous World War II combat films. The narrator at the end of the film is entirely unnecessary. Rather than using the more effective technique of letting the audience decide for themselves what to take away from the film, the narrator tries to tell the audience what to think and fails by overdramatizing everything and sounding like a history lecturer. One thing this movie did not contain was a prejudice toward the Japanese. For the most part, the treatment was very even-handed by showing the Japanese pilots preparing for the attack and giving some of Japan's reasoning behind the attack. The little prejudice that is shown should be taken as an accurate portrayal of the times rather than the bias of the filmmakers. Overall, this movie definitely lives up to the hype. The epic battle scenes and the moving post-battle scenes are worth the price of admission themselves.</fullReview>

With what was spent on this fiasco, a good 50s "B" producer could have cranked out two years of dynamite entertainment. But audiences today need bigger, louder, more expensive thrills, at the sacrifice of acting and plot. Afleck couldn't carry Montgomery Clift's jock strap. This is a real sick venture. Stay home.

		<shortDescription>Contra Pearl Harbor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe I'm wasting my limited, precious time on writing a review for this film ? but I was just so incensed from watching it that I had to go back to my PC and deliver the goods! Like many people, I was attracted to the trailer, and also I'm a war-monger. And when Hollywood dumps a lot of dollars into a big war picture, I'll be Johnny-on-the-Spot. In light of this, I took my fellow-war-monger friend with me ? expecting at least a competent picture. And, after both watching `Enemy at the Gates' ? we were hungry for a better war picture, and had one since `The Thin Red Line'. However, more often than not, we were turning to each other and rolling our eyes during `Pearl Harbor'. Spoiler Alert First of all, Randall Wallace has a lot of explaining to do. I liked `Braveheart' ? which was a passable film with a competent script ? but `Pearl Harbor's script is just LOUSY. After beginning with the clichéd love triangle, complete with the over-used But-I-Thought-You-Were-Dead angle ? the script offers us a lot of superficial characters with trite and laughable lines. As I glanced at my watch (for the umpteenth) time to see how much longer I would have to suffer through this major letdown, a whole hour went by focusing on the trite love triangle ? with no setup regarding the Japanese. When the Japanese finally make their appearance, they are portrayed as robotic and stereotyped. What's more, the writer didn't bother to personalize or dramatize the attack/plan from the Japanese perspective. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays the token politically-correct black guy who may be a cook, but get him in the boxing ring and look out ? as if we really care by this point. Echoing another viewer's comments, this character is redundant ? he's just there for the minorities in the audience.The story really should've ended at Pearl. But wait, there's more! The Doolittle Raid on Tokyo. The only good thing about this part was that it killed off one of the leads. I don't know how many people were laughing when Alec Baldwin was giving his pep talk to the pilots in the ready room ? but it was more than one, myself included. Baldwin cannot play a gruff, tough military man ? he's just too sensitive and urbane, and his performance came off as too campy and laughable. As far as the acting goes, most of the veteran actors are good, and I'm talking about Voight and the like. The leads are another story. The two pilots Rafe and Danny are just good old boy southerners who are patriotic and loving the same woman ? but that's ABOUT IT. We barely get to know these characters. FDR had more character development than these hayseeds. Kate Beckinsale (FOX!) was passable, but she suffers the same fate as every other actor in the movie: She just doesn't have the LINES. I don't want to sound chauvinistic, but there were SO MANY scenes with the nurses ? it almost came off like a chick flick. I wouldn't have minded it so much, but the writer didn't develop these women, nor give them any flaws, dreams, fears, ANYTHING: It was all, `Tee-hee, tee-hee, did you see that cute pilot staring at me?'. Jesus! I was almost CHOKING from all the close-ups in `Pearl'. Now, where is the pony in all this s***? His name is: SFX. The aerial sequences and the attack on the Seventh Fleet are quite amazing ? thanks to the folks at ILM. Unfortunately, we had to sit through two hours of forgettable cinema to get to them. And I thought `Enemy at the Gates' was a mediocre film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Critical Masterpiece, But....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just returned from seeing Pearl Harbor, and as an 'indie' filmmaker, I feel that I am qualified to critique this film from a director's point of view. The film critics who have bashed this movie are way over the top with their criticisms. Yes, Randall Wallace's script has more romantic cliches than a Doris Day film festival; and yes, the love story took away from what should have been more focus on Japanese preparation before the actual sneak attack; and yes, the film could have been cut down to two hours and fifteen minutes and still have been very good; but I was not offended by the sometimes dumb dialogue. The corny lines were not as numerous as I had expected. Making a film like Pearl Harbor in the manner that Michael Bay did can take the life and breath out of anyone who is a director. I am sure he had plenty of help. For that reason, I was very impressed by the look of the film. From a cinemagraphic point of view, it was beautiful. The battle scenes were first-rate. For the men and women who actually went through the attack on Pearl Harbor, I applaud them for their courage of enduring that horror. I was very impressed with the special effects. I look for flaws in CGI's and could hardly find any. Two actors in the film who went unheralded during the pre-movie hype should be commended for their superb performances. Jon Voight played FDR so well, it was scary. His short screen time made a huge impact. The very reliable Mako, a veteran actor, did a great job as the 'hard-as-steel' Admiral Yamamoto. Though Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett gave satisfactory performances, if they had more realistic lines to say during the love triangle scenes, their performances would have been more credible. I understand why Randall Wallace wanted the Cuba Gooding, Jr. character in the film, but it easily could have been taken out, and it would have not affected the story. For that matter, the love story could have been taken out and replaced by the real story of sailors trapped in a ship underwater for weeks after the attack, perishing around Christmas. That would have made the movie more credible, then it might be worthy of an Oscar nomination for Best Picture at the 2002 Academy Awards. As it is, it will clean up the technical awards come Oscar time. Pearl Harbor is a film that accomplishes one thing - it entertains. Could it have been better? Sure. But most people do not have a clue the amount of heart and soul that goes into making a Hollywood epic. Despite the script, the man power and creativity by the people who are 'above-the-line' makes this movie worth seeing. I guarantee you, no matter what your opinion of this film is or will be, Pearl Harbor will not be forgotten for a long time to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess that's a pretty bold statement, but "Pearl Harbor" took me out of my seat and into the film--into the characters and situations--in a way that I've never felt before. And I've loved movies since before I can remember! I saw, back when "Titanic" or "Braveheart" came out, the reaction people had to them, and now, I've found my "Titanic." I know why they saw "Braveheart" a half dozen times. Watching Michael Bay's film, I was reduced to a child, bright-eyed and completely believing, and also forced to recognize my adulthood in the knowledge that people like my grandfather made great sacrifices in the second World War that I will never understand or appreciate. And I got to, for a short period of time, be someone I never was, who fought not just for his country, but for the love of an elegant, beautiful girl. I don't think I'll elaborate much more on any of this, as it could only cheapen the sentiment. I do suppose there will be many who didn't like the film, and mock those that did (there always are), and some of their complaints may even be valid, but there's no way anyone can tell me I didn't FEEL the joy, despair, love, and hope that I felt in that theater on May 25th, 2001.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really, to be totally fair, I should see this movie again, taking a notepad with me so I can note all that's wrong with it. But as it stands, maybe I'll be able to stay under the 1,000 word limit.I suppose if you had no idea what Pearl Harbor and World War II were all about and weren't aware of the mediocre at best talent of Michael Bay,, and you like silly love stories, you might think this movie is pretty good. I guess I don't inherently have a problem with setting a silly love story against the backdrop of such a serious topic. Even after seeing the movie, I still don't really have a big problem with it. Even some "classic" Pearl Harbor films include silly love stories (From Here to Eternity, In Harms Way). The problem with this one is that it's so BADLY written. Randall Wallace and Bay should be ashamed of themselves. The kind of simple, silly and chemistry-free dialogue written between Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsdale is the kind you'll find in classic films of the 40's. It was effective then, but it doesn't work today, not even in a period piece. The dialogue written for the love story in Titanic ain't Shakespeare, but for the most part, you're not sitting there groaning every time one of the characters opens their mouth like you are in this film. I'm no expert on World War II and Pearl Harbor, far from it. However, I have seen many classic and current films on the subject, and have a friend who IS an expert, so I think I know my fair share. Of course Bay is going to take liberties in making his film, every filmmaker does. Apparently, the Japanese fighter planes were not the same color in the movie as they were in real life. Things like that aren't going to bother me so much, but when only two planes were able to get off the ground during the actual assault, and those two planes are piloted by our Heroes in Pearl Harbor, that bothers me. It bothers me that Bay has his Japanese fighter planes flying over a baseball game that's going on at 8 in the morning because he thinks it's a good looking shot. I'm sure there are plenty of other glaring liberties taken by Bay in this film, but I'll leave them to the experts to point out.However, I do have one more fact related complaint about the film, that being Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character. Here we have, without a doubt, one of the most worthless characters in film history. Before I saw the movie, I thought that the character was just going to be a token black character added to make the film appeal to a broader demographic. I figured, since black men were pretty much limited to the kitchen on Naval ships in those days, that the character we see on the machine gun torrents in the trailers is fictional. Well, here's a news flash, he was a REAL person, we find out at the end, who received an award for his "brave" service! I certainly hope that Cuba had more scenes that were left on the cutting room floor for some reason, because if he agreed to do this silly, insignificant part in the film based on what I saw of him, I'm really disappointed. What an embarrassment to Gooding and his entire race. Bay should be ashamed for the way this REAL character is handled in the film (all three minutes of his screen time).Everyone likes to get emotionally involved in a film, and I'm no different. I'll admit, I found the trailer moving. I thought for sure I'd at least get a little weepy-eyed at some point of Pearl Harbor. As it turns out, Bay fails again. This film has instantly made my "Top Five Most Manipulative Films" list. It's embarrassing the length that Bay goes to, especially at the end, to try to get you to cry. A film like Saving Private Ryan can move you just by it's sheer horror and the nonverbal acting of it's characters. Wallace and Bay just POUR it on, though, in this film to the point where you're drowning. SPOILER AHEAD SPOILER AHEADThe manner in which Josh Hartnett's character dies is really badly written. It almost seems like they thought that Hartnett's plane going down wasn't heroic enough. He had to save his best buddy one more time after a VERY awkward confrontation with a Japanese patrol on the China coast in order to cement his status as a hero. Again, this is just bay trying to POUR on the sentimentality. Someone should have told him that the EVENTS THAT ACTUALLY TRANSPIRED between 12/41 and 4/42 provide more than enough sentiment by themselves. END SPOILERI didn't hate this movie. At the very least, my interest in the subject is higher than it's ever been, and I'm sure that the film will inspire a wave of new found interest in the subject by a new generation. So Bay does deserve some credit for that, but not too much. A better film about Pearl Harbor would have raised awareness, too. I'm just really disappointed that they took such a great and important subject and turned up with these results. I thought the actors, for the most part, did the best they could with the script. Alec Baldwin, in particular, was quite good as Dolittle. Some of his really silly lines will ultimately be memorable because he did such a good job of delivering them. The bombing of Pearl Harbor was, of course, the best part of the film, though it went on too long. Someone needed to tell Bay that just because the sinking of the Titanic lasted 45 minutes (screen time) doesn't mean that the bombing of Pearl Harbor had to last that long.Bay's biggest problem is that he's just no good at telling stories. Everytime I thought I was going to be moved, he cut. Every time he had a good idea or scene or camera angle going, he cut. Then, he sticks with scenes and ideas that go nowhere (like the train scene near the beginning). Who cares?A lot of the problems I have with a film can be overlooked if it's a silly, fun film like The Mummy Returns. That crew is allowed to defy the laws of physics and reality in general, because it's a fantasy film. I grant the makers of Pearl Harbor no such leeway. No matter how entertaining some parts of it may have been, I can't overlook the glaring problems that a film about such a serious topic is so bogged with.Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historical fiction that delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Too often, movies predicted to be block-busters end up fizzling. Too often, Hollywood takes a historical event, makes a fictitious film based on it, and ruins both the event and the film. Happily, neither problem occurred with "Pearl Harbor." This is a film well worth a theater viewing, and not just for the special effects (which it has in plenty). It's long (about 3 hours), so be prepared, but unlike most long films I have seen, it does not drag. You wouldn't think an event as well known to us as Pearl Harbor would keep you on the edge of your seat, but at least for me, it did. I really felt like I was watching the actual attack on Pearl Harbor during the battle sequence. There are a few slightly graphic, bloody scenes in the hospital during and after the attack that perhaps we could have done without, but there wasn't too much gore -- nothing like "Saving Private Ryan" or "Patriot."I found the acting to be reasonably good. Kate Beckinsale has been a favorite of mine since her surprising performance in Kenneth Branagh's "Much Ado About Nothing," and she did an excellent job in "Pearl Harbor" as well. Ben Affleck turned in a good performance also, as did most of the supporting cast. There is of course the typical Hollywood love story in the film, but they managed to do it gracefully enough that it did not seem *too* trite (though it was a bit annoying at times). The directing was outstanding, the script was good, and the music was excellent. "Pearl Harbor" won't go down in history as the greatest movie ever made, but it's the best film I've seen so far this year, and it was good enough that I will probably buy the DVD when it comes out -- which means it was good enough to watch several times, since otherwise I would not wish to own it.My score: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unbelievably poor in every way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just lost three hours plus travel time on this movie, so I'll be brief here to spare myself a bit.I'd read the reviews and properly lowered my expectations because a couple of friends wanted to see PEARL HARBOR. Even those lowered expectations weren't met. This souless thing... yeesh. Blows every opportunity it has. It saps the buildup toward the Japanese attack of any mounting sense of dread, manages to make four love stories unbelievable (including Ben and Josh's -- hey, folks, "best buddies" is a love story whether you like it or not), makes the full-on attack pretty tensionless, and insults the first decorated black soldier by pinning it on him while he's still alive. Jon Voight is pretty good as FDR, I'll say that, but even his makeup in his first scene is bad enough to be pretty distracting (it smooths out later).My buddies wanted to see it for the action, and we all came away disappointed. The cinematography is mostly expert, though the decision to use a flawed lens in a key hospital sequence was, well, flawed. It muddled things to have characters drifting in and out of focus as they moved about in the frame, and rather than evoking (as TRAFFIC did), it distracts. Brave idea, though.I dearly hope I've put someone off seeing this. My sacrifice will have been worth it. And if you've decided you'll just wait for the video, I'd strongly suggest not even bothering then. It really is that poor: poor of imagination, poor of craft, poor of humanity. With an epic war movie and love story, this kills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the tradition of "Titanic," sorry to say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, I liked this one better than James Cameron's "Titanic," but only liked it. It's the kind of movie that, like popcorn, is okay while your eating it, but doesn't leave you very full.The film's centerpiece, the attack on Pearl Harbor, is a special effects gold mine that generally comes off fairly well, although some of the stuff, like Japanese planes flying on their sides in between buildings, was a little silly looking. And every vehicle that was hit did NOT explode like a gasoline tanker truck. Following bombs down from a "bomb's eye view" also seemed a little silly.But in general, the scene went well.What went less well was the rest of the movie. For me, the love triangle around which the film was built came off as largely what it was, simply a vehicle to carry the story along to the Cameron/Spielberg style "big scene." For me, the problem was not the idea, but the execution.All three of the protagonists gave rather lifeless performances.Ben Afleck has done better work other places and always seems to me more suited to bad guy roles than he is to playing the hero. It's part of the problem with modern movies, though. There seem to be no Jimmy Stewarts or Henry Fondas or James Cagneys around, no larger than life personalities who can take these mediocre characters and lift them up. Josh Harnett was even weaker and other than being good looking, I simply didn't get what the girl saw in him.Kate Beckensale, who I have liked in many roles in the past, including "Brokedown Palace," "Last Days of Disco," and her British work, fails here in my view, underplaying most of her big scenes. Maybe it's the fact that she was a cardboard character, the Army nurse with no backstory to build upon, but she simply missed here, with the exception of her scene during the battle, where she got it together to some extent, but not completely. I expected better work from her.But the acting was universally flat among the three of them, and that usually points a finger at a director. Like Cameron, Spielberg and DeMille before them, big picture, spectacle directors usually aren't all that good at getting things out of actors and Bay seems to be in that mold -- better at blowing things up than whittling things down to their emotional cores.I give it a good, solid "B". It's entertaining, but not enlightening. I still feel a lot more for Henry Fonda's character in "Mr. Roberts." We never see him die, never see a shot fired in the whole movie, but he comes off as much more of a war hero than anyone in "Pearl Harbor."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Summer Movie version of War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not that Pearl harbor is a bad movie. In fact many parts of it were quite enjoyable. My dissatisfaction comes from the fact that this is obviously an attempt at a summer movie rather than an Oscar candidate. If I was a World War II vet (or any vet for that matter) or a Pearl Harbor survivor, I honestly think I'd be extremely ticked off.Pearl Harbor was a profound event in American History. The attack basically awakened America from its Great Depression and launched us into WWII and eventually the atomic age/cold war/etc. I get goose bumps every time I listen to FDR's famous speech. And yet this movie spends more time trying to entertain than providing the real drama of the tragedies of war. They show the Arizona exploding but don't follow it all the way down, I did not feel the sorrow in the aftermath scenes that I did in Saving Private Ryan, when this was an ultimately more tragic event in that we were the losers. If they wanted real drama drop 30 minutes of the love story and focus 30 more minutes on the tragedy of war.Saving Private Ryan this isn't. This is WWII meets Armaggedon. It's a very well done Summer Movie. However anything dealing with Pearl Harbor deserves better than a summer movie listing. 7-10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor was superbly marketed, almost everyone knew about this movie, i went in the theatre, i was really excited, but when the movie started, 20 minutes into it i got bored, the romance should have been atleast serious, no spark between Kate Beckinsale and Ben Affleck, this looked like a slap-stick comedy. Cuba Gooding Jr. didn't even have a major role, i have no idea what he was doing there. The romance failed to topple over Enemy of the Gates romance, the battles failed to top over Saving Private Ryan. Micheal Bay is too paranoid, and during some romance scenes he just cuts into a war build-up. Acting is horrible. Could be the worst movie of the year. Doesn't even deserve a rating. But i don't know why i gave it 1/10. Recommended: Hell No.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy of the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billed as one of the blockbusters of the summer, Pearl Harbor provided three hours of entertainment with a few special nuggets and relatively few gaffes. Although audiences will probably remember this film for its epic battle sequences, it was the emotions and the thought-provoking situations that made this movie a success. This film fulfills the World War II combat film genre without resorting to many of its clichés. The film may not be 100% historically accurate, but it gives a good example of the kinds of things that did happen. Ben Affleck delivers a spell-binding performance as the film's hero. He keeps it real by bringing out the character's weaknesses in addition to his strengths. The plot kept the film moving, so the three hours literally flew by. However, the love-triangle scenario gets too predictable at the end, and at times you wonder if the characters feel the same emotions of the tragedy of war that the audience is feeling. The dialogue seemed a bit contrived in places, and a couple of lines seem to be lifted straight from previous World War II combat films. The narrator at the end of the film is entirely unnecessary. Rather than using the more effective technique of letting the audience decide for themselves what to take away from the film, the narrator tries to tell the audience what to think and fails by overdramatizing everything and sounding like a history lecturer. One thing this movie did not contain was a prejudice toward the Japanese. For the most part, the treatment was very even-handed by showing the Japanese pilots preparing for the attack and giving some of Japan's reasoning behind the attack. The little prejudice that is shown should be taken as an accurate portrayal of the times rather than the bias of the filmmakers. Overall, this movie definitely lives up to the hype. The epic battle scenes and the moving post-battle scenes are worth the price of admission themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seems the skills of getting several points across in a few scenes is dead and gone in Hollywood. Never do in a crisp one minute scene what can take thirty, seems to be the rule of the day. This movie is long. My rear end got mega "level one" tired. That is a sure barometer of other problems in any movie. I guess when you try to tell a story that has been told five dozen times you feel obligated to put every cliche known to man in the effort.But you know in the world of let's make cash and damn art and damn anything else that looks like classic movie making, this one is demographically superb! No need to cover all the hits but there was even the "little dog" that managed to make it some how!The movie will make stacks of cash and in some perspectives it deserves to do so. The special effects are top of the line and and Ben Affleck may make a leading man yet. He's a good looking guy and too bad the words he was given to say were so shallow and ...trite.....but like the man said...."people who are trite are good as gold"!My father was at Pearl during the attack and he said the thing he remembers most was that the whole harbor was covered in oil and on fire. So much for realism huh? Anyway...I waited all the spring for this movie....I mean they started running trailers in January, and I got this. Well, if this is the "summer blockbuster"...I'm going fishing.</fullReview>

The movie did seem anti-climatic when Pearl Harbor occurred and then the movie continued another 45 minutes with the Dolittle raid, but it was worth it to see the movie's final catharsis. The final ending had an Armageddon dilemma (two men, one Ben Affleck again, who love the same women, who looks like Liv Tyler, and they are on an impossible mission). It had some great laugh in the beginning (Affleck's nose) and some real tear jerkers at the end. The may be this summer's perfect date movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DISNEY'S PC WHITEWASH OF HISTORY - U.S. STARTED the WAR!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pearl Harbor" has a running time of just over three hours, half of which is devoted to a cloying love story with plot turns so predictable they were hackneyed generations ago, and thirty minutes of combat scenes. Beyond that, we get History so whitewashed by Disney it would appear that the United States was to blame for World War Two. It is not a terrible movie, but it is big disappointment, and sure to anger veterans for its PC "history".In 1970, the excellent Pearl Harbor film, "Tora, Tora, Tora", did not have the benefit of digital special effects. "Pearl Harbor" does - and they are absolutely spectacular and alone make the movie worth seeing, and eventually getting on DVD. There are many poignant moments during the battle sequences, and the realism is remarkable - except for the near total absence of blood and gore, an unacceptable compromise Disney made to get its PG-13 rating. Much has been made of liberal Disney, ever Politically Correct, whitewashing History to not offend those in overseas markets - Japan and Germany. This absolutely true.We have here a timid, PC version of History so spineless, so gutless, so intellectually dishonest, one would think the United States was to blame for the war. The movie states that America cut off Japan's oil supply, thus all but forcing them into war, and into launching their infamous sneak attack on the U.S. Navy on December 7th, 1941. But at no time did "Pearl Harbor" ever mention why the U.S. cut off Japan's oil supply, which was due to years of Japanese aggression, war crimes, and atrocities in China, and an ever increasing Japanese totalitarian society dominated by militarists.To Disney, there was no need to "offend" the Japanese by mentioning their invasion of China, or the fact that Japan had allied itself, long before their sneak attack, as part of the despised Fascist Axis that included Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy. No, not mentioned. Germany itself is barely referred to in a few brief grainy newsreels. If someone doesn't understand the reasons for World War Two - and which side represented Good and which Evil - they will not learn the answer from "Pearl Harbor".Historical events are treated oddly. Sometimes very accurately, sometimes distorted, sometimes fictionalized. An example is the Doolittle raid. Our two heroes, fighter pilots, after shooting down a host of Japanese planes at Pearl, are recruited into becoming B-25 bomber pilots for Col. Jimmy Doolittle's subsequent bombing of Japan. This never would have happened; fighter pilots stayed fighter pilots. Doolittle, played by a self-satisfied and tough-talking Alec Baldwin, bore no similarity to the real Doolittle. His B-25's did not fly in formation when bombing Tokyo either. Although one of the planes was named "The Ruptured Duck" - accurate and a tribute to the great war film "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo". As the B-25's bombed Japan captured Americans, and Filipinos, were being subjected to Japanese atrocities and murders. Ignored by Disney, of course.The acting is no more than adequate given the script limitations.We have a banal romance mixed together with whitewashed Politically Correct History, but enough actual history and fabulous digital battle scenes to make "Pearl Harbor" worth seeing. Although be warned: you will squirm for the first ninety minutes before the attack starts. Hopefully though, the film will introduce World War II to the masses so ignorant of History thanks to public education failures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's PC WHITEWASH of HISTORY, and Schmaltzy Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pearl Harbor", the biggest, most expensive, most hyped, and most anticipated, of all the Summer season's films, has finally arrived. Like a bomb flung from a Japanese warplane it has crashed into theaters with a resounding noise. Yes, for what this film could have been it is, in fact, a Big Bomb; for what it is, overall, it can be considered a mediocre let down.The film has a running time of just over three hours, half of which is devoted to a schmaltzy love story with plot turns so predictable they were hackneyed generations ago. That includes the "lost lover back from the dead" routine, which was old even when it was done well, as in the classic "Waterloo Bridge" from 1941. We also received a noxious dose of an equally labored love triangle involving two lifetime friends. Beyond that, we get History so white-washed it would appear that the United States was to blame for World War Two.Some Disney apologists have claimed that there had to be a story wrapped around the history, "or else we'd be left with just a documentary". Not so. Out on DVD is 1970's excellent "Tora, Tora, Tora", a Japanese-American production on the attack, and it was factual and compelling without the need for a none too convincing romance. For those who do want romance, done well in the context of the attack and America's entrance into World War Two, I suggest they rent "From Here to Eternity" from 1954.Disney is telling us the actual attack sequence on the U.S. Naval base at Pearl Harbor lasted over 40 minutes in this movie. By my watch it was 30, tops, only about half of which involved attacks on American warships. The rest was much less spectacular aerial heroics by the two heroes.Be it noted that in 1970, "Tora, Tora, Tora" did not have the benefit of digital special effects. In 2001, "Pearl Harbor" does - and they are absolutely spectacular and alone make the movie worth seeing, and eventually getting on DVD to be able to savor each frame of the attack. There are many poignant moments during the battle sequences, and the realism and verisimilitude is remarkable - except for the near total absence of blood and gore, an unacceptable compromise Disney made to get its PG-13 rating. "Pearl Harbor" bears no resemblance to the real horrors of the opening sequences of "Saving Private Ryan".Much has been made of liberal Disney, ever Politically Correct, white-washing History to not offend those in overseas markets - Japan and Germany. This absolutely true.We have here a timid, PC version of History so spineless, so gutless, so intellectually dishonest, one would think the United States was to blame for the war.

No, not mentioned. Germany itself is barely referred to in a few brief grainy newsreels. If someone doesn't understand the reasons for World War Two - and which side represented Good and which Evil - they will not learn the answer from "Pearl Harbor".Historical events themselves are depicted in various ways ranging from complete distortion, to convenient omission, to fabrication, to absolute accuracy. Some of the more irritating examples follow.Jon Voight, doing a not very convincing interpretation of President Roosevelt, supposedly stood up on his own at a staff meeting to dramatize the need to strike back at Japan. Not so.Our two heroes, fighter pilots, after shooting down a host of Japanese planes at Pearl, are recruited into becoming B-25 bomber pilots for Col. Jimmy Doolittle's subsequent raid on Japan. This never would have happened; fighter pilots stayed fighter pilots. Doolittle, played by a self-satisfied and tough-talking Alec Baldwin, bore no similarity to the real Doolittle. His B-25's did not fly in formation when bombing Tokyo either. Although one of his planes was named "The Ruptured Duck" - accurate and a tribute to the great war film "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo", which should be rented and seen by all.The film made various historical alterations such as eliminating from Roosevelt's classic Declaration of War speech before Congress his last emphatic words after resolving to achieve the final victory: "So help us God". Perhaps God is not PC.The absence of the U.S. aircraft carriers during the bombing - so fortuitous for America's fortunes - was not referred to.Despite growing evidence that Roosevelt knew beforehand about the coming Japanese attack and wanted it as the only way to get America into the war against Hitler, the film ignores that issue totally and presents FDR as surprised by it.American Admiral Kimmell, commanding at Pearl, was somewhat overly scapegoated in 1941 for the disaster; here, he is shown much too favorably and as a victim of Naval leaders too obtuse to perceive the coming Japanese sneak attack, which is itself a specious over-simplification.The attack began with Japanese midget submarines infiltrating the harbor and being engaged by a U.S. destroyer. Ignored in the film.Doolittle's raid on Japan, and other cities besides Tokyo, actually resulted not in the Japanese moving back, as the end of movie narration claimed, but launching their biggest naval attack of the war. It, unfortunately for them, ended in defeat at the Battle of Midway, which was also not mentioned despite it being the true Turning Point of the war.Curiously, despite such historical issues distorted or dismissed, the movie was careful enough to show, accurately, details such as the famous flag of Admiral Togo, who defeated the Russians in 1904, flying over the Japanese flagship carrier, the Akagi.The performances of the three stars were adequate in the face of the banal dialogue they were forced to say. Ben Affleck and John Hartnett as the friends, and rivals over the same girl, did as well as could be expected. The glamorous nurse of their interests was played by Kate Beckinsale, looking lovely despite too much makeup even for 1941 - and apparently fighting anorexia during the filming.Big stars Cuba Gooding Jr, and Ted Sizemore, also appear and do well, despite roles that are little more than cameos. Gooding, playing the hero navy steward, and first black man to receive the Navy Cross, made us wish we could have seen a little more of his life in a segregated Navy, and a little less of the romance, although another film just dealt with that topic. Dan Aykroyd as a fictionalized Navy cryptographer, and Mako as Admiral Yamamoto, do little more than look ever more serious and dour scene to scene.Director Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer have done what they usually do with films - great action hanging together on a threadbare plot. For $140 million it is amazing they couldn't have found a better script. If they simply remade "Tora, Tora, Tora" word for word but with the new special effects it would have been better.So we have a banal romance mixed together with white-washed Politically Correct History, but enough actual history and fabulous digital battle scenes to make "Pearl Harbor" worth seeing. Although be warned: you will squirm for the first ninety minutes before the attack starts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, the Special FX are indeed spectacular. Tucked inside this 3-hour movie is about an hour's worth of special FX bonanza. These scenes are quite literally jaw-dropping. It almost makes the *other* two hours of sappy love story worth the trouble. With a $135 million budget and a great topic (Pearl Harbor), you would've thought Disney had a guaranteed hit on its hands. Unfortunately, all they had was a huge 135 million-dollar blunder.The script is atrocious --- it's hard to believe this from the same writer as Braveheart. Not even the trio of hot young Hollywood stars can make you overlook the horrendous dialogue and the one dimensional cardboard cutout characters. In this movie, you'll find some of the most cringe-worthy, cliche-ridden lines you could possibly imagine. It's hard to imagine how these actors were able to keep a straight face while reciting great lines like:"I'm gonna give Danny my whole heart, but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you.""If I had one more night to live, I'd want to spend it with you.""We may lose this battle, but we're going to win this war.""I want you to do me a favor: I want you to pray for both of us.""Let's play chicken with those Japanese [expletive]!" Needless to say, you'll get to hear more of these little gems during the movie's 3-hour run. At one point, the paralyzed President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Voight) stands up from his wheelchair and patriotically utters, "Don't tell me what I can't or cannot do!"It's moments like these that can make audience members in the theater laugh &amp; walk out early. A few actually did. I didn't --- I was having too much fun laughing with my friends.Rated * out of **** starsPG-13: (violence without blood, sex without nudity)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film would've been good, except for one thing: Jerry Bruckheimer. Bruckheimer Films should've stuck with fiction. It was obvious that they couldn't make a masterful film to describe the events of what happened that day, so they had to include a love story just to try and make it work as an epic. It turns out to be more of a "Titanic" with battleships and zeros than a true historical account. They also would go and greatly compromise historical accuracy for artistic intent, if you want to call a Bruckheimer film artistic. The sequence where Pearl Harbour is attacked is very well done and the special effects are among some of the best and most realistic, but the cliched dialogue, addition of fictional characters, and the inclusion of the insipid love story really brings this movie down. It may be entertaining to its intended core audience, the teenagers and twenty-somethings (although I am 19) that would absolutely adore cardboard cutout romance with the sex scene, but it would be perceived as a terribly mainstream film that fails utterly to be a gripping epic by those who appreciate good cinema. It would, however, no doubt pay for itself in the box office this summer season. But, high grossers are not always great films. It's still worth a watch, but the *real* good Pearl Harbour flick is still "Tora! Tora! Tora!". If you've not seen that film, watch it as it is a greatly accurate historical film pertaining to the subject of the attack on Pearl Harbour, and was produced in cooperation by American and Japanese production companies for 20th Century Fox. As for the best summer film, I think that honor would go to the upcoming "Final Fantasy" picture coming this July. - Reinhart</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was the most anticipated movie of the year, and it let me down a little bit. First off, I was expecting more out of Jerry Bruckheimer. After his amazing production- Remember the Titans- I thought this guy could do no wrong. I do like Michael Bay's amazing dramatics and camera shots, but I like Jerry Bruckheimer better. These two are not the ideal team (ie Armageddon. it was good, but not great) The love story was a little annoying. Now don't get me wrong, I am a 16 year old gal who ADORES Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett, but the sappy scenes and dumb script messed up the already dumb love triangle. The outcome was predictable. Kate Beckinsale is good, but she wasn't the right gal for this part. And there definitly wasn't enough of William Fitchner in this movie!But life goes on. Other then those minor things, this movie was pretty good. The photography was breattaking, and the Pearl Harbor attack scene was spectacular! Ben Affleck pulled off some impressive acting, as did Cuba Gooding,Jr., even tough he wasn't in it a whole lot. There were a few funny parts in it to lighten the mood, but when they wanted to scare you out of your pants the did that in the fight scenes- edge of the seat! I saw this with a man who had been at Pearl Harbor and he said it was incredibly realistic and very similar to that fateful day. One other thing- Hans Zimmer pulled of another great score, just as great as Gladiator- we will see if he gets a Golden Globe for this one.stars: *** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is sad.....and I don't mean the story is sad, the whole thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thats right, this is a sad excuse for a movie. I just saw the first show in my city and let me tell you I am embarrassed to be part of my generation. Apparently one of the most important events in world history is not interesting enough for a movie, we need a third rate love story to rope in my fellow 15-20 year old movie goers. This a pathetic attempt to ride the wave of pride stirred up by Saving Private Ryan while at the same time making it dumb enough for 15 year old girls to cry and see 4 times (thats 8 hours of you life wasted, since 2/3 of this movie is doo-doo). The dialougu in this movie is terrible in every sense, I think I laughed at every line Alec Baldwin said. For that matter 90% of the lines I laughed at, the only actors in this movie worth anything are John Voight and Cuba Gooding Jr., both are on screen for a grand total of 20 minutes. The redeeming factor of this movie is the part that is actually about Peral Harbor, about 40 minutes in the middle. It is visually astounding and while not quite as heart wrenching as Saving Private Ryan it does accuratley point out the hopelessness and desperation of the service men and women as they try valiantly survive. Even this is flawed, namely when all historical credibility and emotion goes out the window when our two heroes get in planes and get involved in an action sequence like something out of Independence Day. This made me angry that they ruined what was a very well staged and involving sequence for lame "watch the impossible fireworks and bang-bang" time. Also instead of laying out the raid in a coherent manner the filmakers instead it seems decided to just show parts they though would be "cool", a torpedo here, and explosion there, people dying there. You never get a feeling of whats going on. Another thing that bothered me is how we were suppose to be totally appaled by the Japenese strafing the sailors in the water, it was war and they were active enemies. It is no worse than what we did in Desert Storm when we attacked the fleeing Iraq army. In conclusion the script is laughable, I can't believe the same man that wrote Braveheart penned this. Braveheart wasn't pure history but it was involving and had human edge, it held together and was exciting. The biggest difference is that you didn't realize Braveheart was 3 hours long, I sure realized this was! This is a huge scam, you're basic summer movie crap sandwiched around a truly important and tragic event trying to give it cinematic credibility. The film didn't have to take this low road, Saving Private Ryan didn't budge an inch and made plenty of money, which seems to be all that matters. Apparently $140 million on a 2 hour movie just about Pearl Harbor wasn't as appealing to Hollywood as 40 minutes of Pearl Harbor in a 3 hour movie mostly ripped off from a hundred others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is probably one of the best films to come along so far in 2001. As I looked last night awaiting the early reviews of this long awaited epic film they were exactly what I was expecting so see. The critics bashed Pearl Harbor from beginning to end on just about every level except for its "precise re-enactment" of that fateful December 7th, 1941 attack. Now as I remember about 3 years ago or so a film by the name of Titanic came along, and as I remember suffered the same critical bashing upon its initial release, but as the film gained popularity these moans turned to praise. For nearly a year now we had heard of Pearl Harbor and just like everyone else would be if you had heard of something this far in advance your expectations would be extremely high. Critics bashed Pearl Harbor for its lack of character development and screenplay faults. Now of course you're probably not going to get the quality of a screenplay from a film of this scale and magnitude that the critics want because it's on such a grand scale. To try and focus on only one thing with this kind of summer blockbuster movie would bore the audience to death. Pearl Harbor has just enough of everything to keep the movie flowing nicely, and just when you think that it gets to slow, the attack sequence is presented. The nearly 40 minute attack is quite possibly the most impressive use of digital effects ever seen. It's almost impossible to detect the digital planes from the real ones. You can really see where they spent the money during the attack. And if this film doesn't win some kind of award for cinematography then something is seriously wrong in this country. All in all Pearl Harbor is probably going to be the best film to come out over the summer that is if Planet of the Apes and a few other films turn out to be as good as I hope they are. So I ask you to go in with a non-biased mind and sit through this modern day epic and if you come out of the theater without some kind of feeling of renewed patriotism then something is wrong, GO BACK AND SEE IT AGAIN!!!! AND PLEASE ALL CRITICS DON'T BASH PEARL HARBOR FOR BEING OVER DONE WITH AMERICAN PATRIOTISM BECAUSE THAT'S THE IDEA!!!!! When was the last time that this country did something that we all could be proud of, do you remember?? Didn't think so, this is something that should definitely should be celebrated and embraced for what it is not for what people wanted it to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor has great special effects, as do all Michael Bay/Jerry Brukenheimer films. The problem, traditionally, with their films is the story. I hoped Randall Wallace, writer of Braveheart, would offset this usual weakness; he did not.The story is predictable and contrived. You can almost see the producers gathering around saying, "well Titanic and Saving Private Ryan were hits, so let's combine them and make Pearl Harbor". The love story is weak bordering on insultingly weak. Also many of the supporting characters are paper-thinly developed. For instance, why was Cuba Gooding in this movie? Did anyone care about his character? It would have been better if they just abandoned the love story and focused on the war. For instance, they could have focused on the bonds of friendship developed in war or the loss of innocence in war. Doing so would have allowed for more fully developed characters.The strength of Pearl Harbor is the special effects and that's fine for a summer movie. However, good special effects are not enough when the subject is Pearl Harbor.</fullReview>

Did anyone care about his character? It would have been better if they just abandoned the love story and focused on the war. For instance, they could have focused on the bonds of friendship developed in war or the loss of innocence in war. Doing so would have allowed for more fully developed characters.The strength of Pearl Harbor is the special effects and that's fine for a summer movie. However, good special effects are not enough when the subject is Pearl Harbor.</fullReview>

Playing hard to get only made me realise how sore my bum was after so many hours in the seat waiting for something to happen and praying that somewhere, anywhere, the $150m+ budget had left room to hire a screenwriter with some understanding of snappy and/or engaging dialog.

		<fullReview>The biggest blockbuster of the summer?? Its big and its loud but its also very weak. I was very disappointed with the over the top Hollywood-ness of Pearl Harbor. The action scenes were great, the love story so so, the acting was blah and cliche. The exception was Jon Voight who portrayed President Roosevelt with strength, dignity and I believe in a very honest fashion. Overall a big disappointment; wait for the DVD!!</fullReview>

I refuse to waste my time any further by re-hashing everything that's wrong with this movie, which would pretty much be everything. Simply read the other comments of the users in here who disliked the film and they will tell you everything. Bad script. Laughable dialogue. No subtext ANYWHERE. Swelling, manipulative music cues. Shameless sentimentality. Sappy love story. Plus, you don't learn a single historical thing about Pearl Harbor, the attack, why it happened, etc. NOT ONE THING!!!!!!!!!!!!The worst thing is that there are going to be many who like this film, and actually think it's good (mostly teenagers, I would imagine, since according to this movie, they were the only people who fought at Pearl Harbor). They are likely the same "man on the street" people that Jay Leno interviews who don't know the name of our current president, yet know all the words to every Limp Bizkit and Backstreet Boys song.That, along with the fact that this movie ever got made is a sad indicator of where the collective IQ of our nation is heading.Maybe worst of all, this movie is a colossal insult to the brave WWII generation who actually faced real fears and dangers, who actually had to fight in battles and die to build and preserve our country and did it all without an exploitative Hans Zimmer score or a cheesy Faith Hill song to back them up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thats right, this is a sad excuse for a movie. I just saw the first show in my city and let me tell you I am embarrassed to be part of my generation. Apparently one of the most important events in world history is not interesting enough for a movie, we need a third rate love story to rope in my fellow 15-20 year old movie goers. This a pathetic attempt to ride the wave of pride stirred up by Saving Private Ryan while at the same time making it dumb enough for 15 year old girls to cry and see 4 times (thats 8 hours of you life wasted, since 2/3 of this movie is doo-doo). The dialougu in this movie is terrible in every sense, I think I laughed at every line Alec Baldwin said. For that matter 90% of the lines I laughed at, the only actors in this movie worth anything are John Voight and Cuba Gooding Jr., both are on screen for a grand total of 20 minutes. The redeeming factor of this movie is the part that is actually about Peral Harbor, about 40 minutes in the middle. It is visually astounding and while not quite as heart wrenching as Saving Private Ryan it does accuratley point out the hopelessness and desperation of the service men and women as they try valiantly survive. Even this is flawed, namely when all historical credibility and emotion goes out the window when our two heroes get in planes and get involved in an action sequence like something out of Independence Day. This made me angry that they ruined what was a very well staged and involving sequence for lame "watch the impossible fireworks and bang-bang" time. Also instead of laying out the raid in a coherent manner the filmakers instead it seems decided to just show parts they though would be "cool", a torpedo here, and explosion there, people dying there. You never get a feeling of whats going on. Another thing that bothered me is how we were suppose to be totally appaled by the Japenese strafing the sailors in the water, it was war and they were active enemies. It is no worse than what we did in Desert Storm when we attacked the fleeing Iraq army. In conclusion the script is laughable, I can't believe the same man that wrote Braveheart penned this. Braveheart wasn't pure history but it was involving and had human edge, it held together and was exciting. The biggest difference is that you didn't realize Braveheart was 3 hours long, I sure realized this was! This is a huge scam, you're basic summer movie crap sandwiched around a truly important and tragic event trying to give it cinematic credibility. The film didn't have to take this low road, Saving Private Ryan didn't budge an inch and made plenty of money, which seems to be all that matters. Apparently $140 million on a 2 hour movie just about Pearl Harbor wasn't as appealing to Hollywood as 40 minutes of Pearl Harbor in a 3 hour movie mostly ripped off from a hundred others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is probably one of the best films to come along so far in 2001. As I looked last night awaiting the early reviews of this long awaited epic film they were exactly what I was expecting so see. The critics bashed Pearl Harbor from beginning to end on just about every level except for its "precise re-enactment" of that fateful December 7th, 1941 attack. Now as I remember about 3 years ago or so a film by the name of Titanic came along, and as I remember suffered the same critical bashing upon its initial release, but as the film gained popularity these moans turned to praise. For nearly a year now we had heard of Pearl Harbor and just like everyone else would be if you had heard of something this far in advance your expectations would be extremely high. Critics bashed Pearl Harbor for its lack of character development and screenplay faults. Now of course you're probably not going to get the quality of a screenplay from a film of this scale and magnitude that the critics want because it's on such a grand scale. To try and focus on only one thing with this kind of summer blockbuster movie would bore the audience to death. Pearl Harbor has just enough of everything to keep the movie flowing nicely, and just when you think that it gets to slow, the attack sequence is presented. The nearly 40 minute attack is quite possibly the most impressive use of digital effects ever seen. It's almost impossible to detect the digital planes from the real ones. You can really see where they spent the money during the attack. And if this film doesn't win some kind of award for cinematography then something is seriously wrong in this country. All in all Pearl Harbor is probably going to be the best film to come out over the summer that is if Planet of the Apes and a few other films turn out to be as good as I hope they are. So I ask you to go in with a non-biased mind and sit through this modern day epic and if you come out of the theater without some kind of feeling of renewed patriotism then something is wrong, GO BACK AND SEE IT AGAIN!!!! AND PLEASE ALL CRITICS DON'T BASH PEARL HARBOR FOR BEING OVER DONE WITH AMERICAN PATRIOTISM BECAUSE THAT'S THE IDEA!!!!! When was the last time that this country did something that we all could be proud of, do you remember?? Didn't think so, this is something that should definitely should be celebrated and embraced for what it is not for what people wanted it to be.</fullReview>

The critics bashed Pearl Harbor from beginning to end on just about every level except for its "precise re-enactment" of that fateful December 7th, 1941 attack. Now as I remember about 3 years ago or so a film by the name of Titanic came along, and as I remember suffered the same critical bashing upon its initial release, but as the film gained popularity these moans turned to praise. For nearly a year now we had heard of Pearl Harbor and just like everyone else would be if you had heard of something this far in advance your expectations would be extremely high. Critics bashed Pearl Harbor for its lack of character development and screenplay faults. Now of course you're probably not going to get the quality of a screenplay from a film of this scale and magnitude that the critics want because it's on such a grand scale. To try and focus on only one thing with this kind of summer blockbuster movie would bore the audience to death. Pearl Harbor has just enough of everything to keep the movie flowing nicely, and just when you think that it gets to slow, the attack sequence is presented. The nearly 40 minute attack is quite possibly the most impressive use of digital effects ever seen. It's almost impossible to detect the digital planes from the real ones. You can really see where they spent the money during the attack. And if this film doesn't win some kind of award for cinematography then something is seriously wrong in this country. All in all Pearl Harbor is probably going to be the best film to come out over the summer that is if Planet of the Apes and a few other films turn out to be as good as I hope they are. So I ask you to go in with a non-biased mind and sit through this modern day epic and if you come out of the theater without some kind of feeling of renewed patriotism then something is wrong, GO BACK AND SEE IT AGAIN!!!! AND PLEASE ALL CRITICS DON'T BASH PEARL HARBOR FOR BEING OVER DONE WITH AMERICAN PATRIOTISM BECAUSE THAT'S THE IDEA!!!!! When was the last time that this country did something that we all could be proud of, do you remember?? Didn't think so, this is something that should definitely should be celebrated and embraced for what it is not for what people wanted it to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor has great special effects, as do all Michael Bay/Jerry Brukenheimer films. The problem, traditionally, with their films is the story. I hoped Randall Wallace, writer of Braveheart, would offset this usual weakness; he did not.The story is predictable and contrived. You can almost see the producers gathering around saying, "well Titanic and Saving Private Ryan were hits, so let's combine them and make Pearl Harbor". The love story is weak bordering on insultingly weak. Also many of the supporting characters are paper-thinly developed. For instance, why was Cuba Gooding in this movie? Did anyone care about his character? It would have been better if they just abandoned the love story and focused on the war. For instance, they could have focused on the bonds of friendship developed in war or the loss of innocence in war. Doing so would have allowed for more fully developed characters.The strength of Pearl Harbor is the special effects and that's fine for a summer movie. However, good special effects are not enough when the subject is Pearl Harbor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spectacle of Flaws...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SOME MONOR SPOILERS! A two-hour American military disaster expanded into a 3 hour and 3 minutes spectacle of Hollywood flaws! Totally a popcorn flick version of history! Yep, the half hour of special effects work well to prevent its failure to impress the audience! Filled with massive explosions, triggered with rousing orchestral swells and uncountable extras, it pumps up an enormous "Hollywood" war, bombarding the viewers with loads of clichés and macho pomposities! Dramatic, no doubt; spectacular, for sure; and ghoulish, as expected... and everything's overtly commercialized! Hey, it's a gigantic extravaganza to inflict the viewers' patriotic minds with visually compelling and unforgettable images. OK, it's entertainingly traumatizing,.. just like Star Wars' enchantment! Planes plummeting through the air and swooping between buildings; planes heading for the USS Arizona (blood-curling just to see its stock of torpedoes, bombs, and explosives!), Japanese bombs wreaking havoc, five battleships demolished, flames engulfing the harbor, thousands of men and women fighting for their lives, and salvage crews lifting the ship's gun turret to find bodies after bodies... a bunch of visual veracities garnished with an unimpressive and corny love-triangle yarn (marketing blitz, perhaps) that whops up a great deal of cheesy dialogue! A love story clearly without resonance and emotional pull! And the presence of undeveloped historical characters dabbed onto scenes to induce some historical credibility! Utterly a lame storyline with events flip-flopping between cinematic bliss and the writer's undeniably enthusiastic execution of romantic hoopla! Pardon me! If this film intends to show that America has lost its innocence with Pearl Harbor, it has failed miserably! And whoa, no Hawaiians and Asian Americans serving at Pearl Harbor, or even walking the streets? For the special effects, it's entertaining; for those familiar with it's history, it's a package wrapped up with Hollywood frills! </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Battle sequence is outstanding but cliche ridden plot makes this average</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to know whether to start with the good or the bad so I'll be kind and start with the good points.I should let it be clear from the start, least my negative points seem too strong, that I enjoyed Pearl Harbor - and it is hard to know why, but I enjoyed it in the way you are supposed to enjoy a summer blockbuster, a Titanic or more typically a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. If you approach these in the right frame of mind, empty your brain, don't think too much and let yourself be entertained (while not being too cynical or anal about historical fact meets historical licence). Then even if your favourite movies are the realm of Woody Allen and Neil LaBute (like myself) you can like a film like Pearl Harbor on its own level.The positives:The film held some surprises in the acting stakes, not least that Dan Aykroyd can be a very good serious actor (who knew!). Josh Hartnett is also strong and should come out of this the best, it can only do him good - high profile, leading role and he holds his own well. Cuba Gooding Jr, in a role that should have been bigger in my opinion, was moving and exciting to watch but the story used him far too little. Outstanding however, and I mean (am I really about to suggest that this film could get any statuettes!!!) supporting actor Oscar worthy as FDR. Almost unrecognisable under heavy prosthesis he delivers a believable and powerful performance that brings a sense of class to the scenes he appears in and is magnetic. You will be completely swept up when he is on screen, a performance that a Bruckheimer film really doesn't deserve and an audience wouldn't expect in one.The centre piece battle sequence is also superbly staged. While you may be looking at your watch during the 90 minutes it takes to get to it you won't even notice the time flying by during this sequence. Appearing like the last hour of Titanic meets the first 30 mins of Saving Private Ryan the epic scale and grandeur will sweep you up and keep you enthralled. And then you are back to the plot! Damn!Negatives:The obvious choice for a new live-action Pinocchio, Ben Affleck is so wooden that you'd expect to see a woodpecker land on his shoulder and have a tap. To be fair he gets all the hammy lines and cod-heroic bravura that accompany a character in this sort of cliche ridden story (think Bruce Willis in Armageddon) but he fails to rise above it and this hampers the film. Equally all the women in the film, led by Kate Beckinsale, are given thankless roles and end up as caricatures. Beckinsale is fine but not good. She walks through the role giving the annoying impression that she could do better but can't be bothered.The less said about the story and script the better. The dialogue is laughable (particularly in the first hour) and raises unintentional sniggers throughout. The over sentimental love story is about as contrived as a film can get and could be likened to an MGM musical in terms of realism! Randall Wallace (writer of The Man In The Iron Mask and Braveheart) may have done justice to the real life characters (Voight and Gooding Jr) and the battles but the story makes the script of Titanic look like Casablanca.Equally Michael Bay and Hans Zimmer need to be dragged out and shot for trying to manipulate the audience into accepting a love story that doesn't work. The music wells up, the hero shots come into full effect the trademark Bruckheimer/Bay slowmo running and contrived close-ups appear from nowhere. I fail to recall the last time a film used music so much to suggest the emotions you should be feeling when you are blatantly not in the same frame on mind as Mr Zimmer, the composer. The effect is grating, you'll wish you had a mute button for the first hour, or preferably a fast forward button. Bay and Wallace have managed to get every movie cliche you can imagine into this piece (most within the first ten minutes which is an appalling episode in the young lives of our two heroes as way of a backstory) and if you make a list of them before you go you'll be able to tick them off as you watch.To conclude the battle scenes make this worth watching on the big screen and Voight, Gooding Jr and Hartnett will hold your attention, but the story and dialogue let it down. An average film where it could have been great, but still a good entertainment is looked upon as such.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb action scenes, too much focus on love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I was among the lucky ones who were able to see this 3-hour long epic before it hit movie theaters all around the world. I expected great action scenes and high-level acting from Ben Affleck and all the others. And this was what I got, only with slightly too much romance... I have to tell you folks that every dime spent on blowing up carriers and fighter planes was worth it. Finally a movie where flames are not computer generated! Watching the Zeros fly in low towards Pearl Harbor gives you goosebumps. Your flesh is crawling with excitement whenever an action scene is on. IT IS JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE IT MORE PERFECT. BRAVO MR. BAY!!! One "flaw" of the movie, though is its length. So, my fellow action-fans, do not expect 3 hours of full-throttle machine-gunning and stunning explosions. The romance part is stripping this experience from you quite often. But it's not a big deal and the "corniness factor" is as low as possible. Josh Hartnett first proved his talent for me in The Faculty. This work of his, however, shows way beyond that performance. He's now in one league with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon... John Voight as the president of the United States was also a remarkable choice, and so was Tom Sizemore and Alec Baldwin in the supporting roles. Cuba Gooding, Jr. had only a minor part to play, but did it with strikingly convincing power. As usual... All in all, a magnificent movie was put together for us by Michael Bay, with outstanding performances and breath-taking, highly realistic action scenes. The romance part could have been cut a little shorter, but it is just an uplifting feeling to watch these guys play...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl harborFor Europe, World War II began with Poland's invasion in 1939. For China, it began eight years earlier with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. While the fighting waged abroad, the United States clung to its isolationist stance in the hope that these "regional" conflicts would be decided without them. This laissez-faire attitude was shattered at 8:00 am on December 7th 1941 with the surprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. While the intention was to immobilize the US fleet before they could become a factor in the Pacific Theater, it instead served to galvanize a nation.True friendship is a rare commodity, something that Danny and Rafe are lucky enough to share. Friends since childhood, they join the military together to become fighter pilots, find adventure and look after one another. Their relationship is strained by Rafe's decision to join the Eagle Squadron, a unit of the British Air Force filled with American volunteers. Although upset, Danny tells him to be careful and promises to look after Rafe's newfound girlfriend Evelyn. They soon discover that love and war are difficult bedfellows.If you skip the entertainment section of the newspaper, don't watch tv , never go to movies and live in a cave, it's possible that you haven't heard of this movie. Maybe. With a voluminous cast of name and no name actors, a budget bigger than most films gross, and lots of special effects, this film is going to draw huge crowds for the Memorial Day weekend. I have no doubt of this. What I'm curious to see is how the audiences will respond to it.Once again the trailers are deceiving: while there are hints of the romantic nature of the movie, the focus is on the attack of Pearl Harbor and leads you to believe that it will examine the whys and wherefores behind the event. The bulk of the screen time (and at three hours plus there's a whole lot of it) is devoted to the relationship between the three main characters. I found it interesting that the marketing campaign in Japan meanwhile stressed this aspect over the action. Enough about the marketing you say, what about the film?Historians and battle aficionados take note - other movies on this subject have been more historically accurate and informational. This movie is the Coles notes version of the events surrounding the infamous day in question. However, that means it will be more accessible to the casual moviegoer and no one will quibble about the superb special effects sequences (it is often difficult to discern what is a set and what is computer generated). I was surprised that the battle sequences, originally intended to be as graphic as those in "Saving Private Ryan", were considerably toned down. They opted for hazy dream-like sequences at the hospital that proved to be more disorienting than disturbing. The attack should have taken a more central role and been introduced sooner - there is little action for the first hour and a half - because younger viewers, and men (okay I'm generalizing here but it's true) will quickly lose interest. Especially when they have to sit through mushy stuff. : )While the romantic triangle is captivating (although things become a bit too complex at times - and no I won't give anything away here), the characters have little depth and the actors don't have much to work with. Ben Affleck is his usual affable self, giving a far better performance that he did in his last romantic lead (I've always liked him better than his cocky alter ego aka Matt Damon). Kate Beckinsale (looking remarkably different that she did in "Brokedown Palace") acquits herself adequately as the lovelorn lead, and Josh Hartnett, smolders as the fresh new kid (to me at least - I haven't seen him in anything previously) and demonstrates a modicum of skill along the way. Others aren't so lucky - Cuba Gooding Jr. barely qualifies as a supporting actor (things have been downhill since the Oscar), and Alec Baldwin has the misfortune to utter some of the worst lines ever written.Ultimately, Pearl Harbor has the elements required to be a summer blockbuster: it's being released at the right time, it has impressive special effects and action sequences, the story is pretty straightforward and it is very American. That doesn't mean that it's a good movie. Don't expect too much and it will make for a decent matinee (albeit a long one).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just come home from the screening of Pearl Harbor here in good old Buffalo, New York, and I'm hungry for a real movie. What a boring mishmash, a stupefying rehash of everything Bruckheimer and Bay (B &amp; B) have done before. There's even a shot where the pilots strut out of the hangar in the EXACT SAME goofy formation that the oil rigger astronauts used in Armageddon. The 45-minute bombing of Pearl Harbor is slick, but empty. It's video game, digital whoop-di-do time. The main problem is that the screenplay never really develops any characters, so you don't really care about anyone. The deaths at Pearl Harbor are cold and distant. B &amp; B make the mistake of thinking we'd really care about a TV commercial-style action flick with a silly, and I mean SILLY love story around which to hang the well-known plot. Hey Ben Affleck, your 15 minutes are up. Couldn't you have tried to have read ONE line with feeling? Josh Hartnett is the better of the leads, and that's not saying much because the script is so empty-headed. Kate Beckinsale keeps losing her American accent. All the nurses are photographed as if they've stepped out of a retro-ad for hair care products. And why on earth did B &amp; B decide to shoot the chaotic hospital scenes during the bombing as if we were watching 3-D without the glasses. What's with that? Or maybe the footage was damaged and B &amp; B decided to pretend to be arty and figured that all that out-of-focus stuff and humans with light rings around them (halos?) would seem miraculous or mystical. Overall, on a scale of 1 - 10, Pearl Harbor earns a 4. On a scale of 4 Stars, it earns 2. On a letter scale of A+ to F-, it earns a C-. A great movie could have been made about Pearl Harbor and its strategic importance to America, it's history, why our bases were there, its native people and what they thought about white bread Yanks. But no, B &amp; B wanted to have bombs away fun. Well, maybe this film's no total bomb, but its long and boring and at times the love story is laughable. The movie keeps repeating moments, as if, B &amp; B and their screenwriter, Randall Wallace truly had no ideas in their bag of FX tricks. This movie is less about Pearl Harbor and more about B &amp; B's egos. I'm gonna go watch Tora Tora Tora and From Here To Eternity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a while since I have had a less enjoyable time at a movie. Pearl Harbor is over three hours long, but it seems more like five! We start with a Top Gun introduction then move into establishing the romance aspect which feels extremely forced and is filled with cliches. This goes on (and on) with nothing original and anyone who has seen a few movies can predict every step of this relationship. When we finally do get to some battle scenes they are well done and interesting camera work, if your still awake at this point. The action scenes do a good job of depicting the chaos that I can imagine must have been going on. After the attack is over and you think it's just about done, the story manages to keep dragging on. The acting is very uninspiring and Cuba Gooding Jr. is completely wasted. This is probably the fourth movie I've seen centering around the attack on Pearl Harbor and by far the weakest one. The battle scenes save this movie from a worse rating. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kate Beckinsale was a good choice for the romantic lead as we've already seen Affleck and Charlize Theron together in Reindeer Games and him with Gwyneth Paltrow in Bounce and both of those were just in the OK category. Here, having a fresh face allows us to better accept her innocence and Affleck as a leading man not just going through the motions.Jon Voight as President Roosevelt and Alec Baldwin as Colonel Doolittle gave strong supporting performances. Baldwin demonstrated patriotism for a bombing mission for which President Roosevelt personally presented him The Congressional Medal of Honor. Voight gives us an Oscar caliber performance. We've all heard the words `?this day will live in infamy?', and in this film, Roosevelt shows compassion and leadership that were required for America to be the free country it remains today.The weakest part of the film is knowing that Evelyn's has a big secret that will be revealed at the appropriate time in another persons life .The entire romantic aspect of the film was more than a little contrived, too convenient and in general, hard to accept.There are however, some things the film has going for it that more than make up for its weaknesses. First and foremost, it pays a fine tribute to the men and women, black, white and Asian that fought to win World War II.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad directing, bad acting, and a script written like a course of "history- for- idiots" combined to make this 3 hour mess nearly unwatchable. Filmed like a cereal commercial, with some of the silliest casting imaginable, the love story at the heart of this foolishness, is so predictable and tedious that a good part of the 1400 people at the screening I attended spent most of their time in the lobby buying popcorn and candy to amuse themselves. The unintended laughter from Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsales's romance did little to enliven the proceedings. I have to say that Alec Baldwin, as Col. Doolittle, got most of the laughs, delivering his silly ,peppy, infantile, locker-room "get ready to rumble" speeches to his airmen before the famous "Tokyo Air Raid." The scenes of the Japanese preparing for war are priceless, replete with an outdoor staff meeting, in a series of open air tents, with children flying kites in the background is too silly for further comment. This movie must have cost nearly $200 million, with all the other costs including promotion and advertising this turkey has to cost over $400 million to release. What a waste of time.</fullReview>

This 3 hour and ten minute debacle had a hackneyed script, overwhelming score, cheesy camera tricks, and high school play level acting. The dialogue sounds as though the writer sat at a desk with a pile of scripts of war films and cut and pasted virtually this entire film. Every line out of these poor actors mouths were cliches and not even good cliches. Most of the acting talent was wasted and nowhere was that more evident than poor Cuba Gooding Jr. Never have I seen an Oscar winning actor in a more thankless and useless part that any one of a dozen no name actors would have killed for. On the whole, this looks like a tremendous waste of 200 million dollars and 3 hours and ten minutes of the audiences lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*****************SPOILERS *************** (particularly for those who have forgotten their history) My wife and I just saw at a preview and shared a reaction. Terrifyingly realistic (tho' a bit of obvious animation did pop up from time to time) cinematography, audio overkill, good flavor of history and highly predictable plot. And oh yeah, our European friends who (unfairly in my view) hated Pvt Ryan will hate PH even more: "I guess WW2 just started" was one comment (well, the French, English, Chinese, Russians etc probably had already been clued in)and "if there are more like you in America, anyone would be crazy to attack you" to an RAF (Yank) volunteer may have provided a bit of unnecessary telegraphing. Historical complaint: Dolittle's Raid was followed by Japanese executions of captured bombers as "war criminals", but that was never mentioned. And despite a news report I just read, the scene with the Asian American medic/MD helping a wounded man and being rejected by him did in fact make the film. Maybe it was a last minute addition.My wife thought the female lead did not have enough to do. on a separate topic: She gives kudos to Alec Baldwin's attempt at speaking Chinese. It was understandable ("I am an American"--to be used if confronted by Chinese soldiers after landing in China)Good movie but how about a surprise from time to time????</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrible movie.... bad cast, bad history, lame lame plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love historical movies, both ones based on true stories and ones that are historical fiction. I purchased this movie because I found it cheap somewhere and I thought, how bad could it be, and now I can't unload it on anyone. After watching it, I was pretty dismayed to see this have such a high rating on IMDb. i like to keep my reviews short and sweet for people who like me, know what they like and don't like and have short attention spans. First, the positives: Kate Beckinsdale looks great in this movie. On the down side, and it has a huge downside if you care about interesting plot and characters, ...this has none. It is formula romance drivel at its worst. The romantic story is lame, uninteresting, unbelievable, and miscast. if it was simply the same old drivel but done really well, I'd give it six. It wasn't</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I like this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am always confused by the amount of hate flung at this film. I have read dozens of biographies of pilots of ww2, and the film captures the romantic bravery of these men very well... The flying sequences were VERY good, the Battle of Britain sequence was brilliant (except for the "hammer down" thing. Sure, the Pearl harbor sequence was silly in places, like flying down streets, and the whole tower sequence, but fun silly. And the Doolittle thing was great. But here's my point. I first saw the film at a matinée, in an almost empty house. Most of the others were couples of the ww2 generation. At the end, as I left, these veterans were crying, holding each other tight as they left.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Diabolical INSULT To Film Making!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably going to be a short review but I literally have nothing to say about this movie that everyone else hasn't already said. Pearl Harbor is directed by Michael Bay, one of the worst film directors alive today. He made some alright films in the late 90's like Bad Boys and The Rock, but from Armageddon onwards he has created some of the worst action films I've ever had the displeasure of watching, like Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen. But Pearl Harbor is probably the worst thing he has ever produced. It really is disgraceful. The acting? Bland and one-note. The plot? An excruciatingly bad love story that has to be the most badly written love story in the history of fiction!! And the film is SO clichéd, it will make your toes curl at every opportunity. Nothing in this garbage is original. It is either ripped from every other war movie ever made, uses up every cliché in the book (from "I fought the Germans" to "get me a goddamn plane") and the parts that are original are HORRIFIC, with dreadful pieces of dialogue like "WW2 just started" (*shudder*). Truly an absolutely horrible excuse for a film. Even the special effects can't save it.And one last point. The history. Where do I even begin? I'll just say the one obvious inaccuracy and that is (for some reason) presenting it as more of a victory rather than a defeat! Michael Bay should be ashamed of himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is Terrible, A Waste Of Talent, History, And Money.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is a dramatic telling of the attack that brought America into World War II, with some romantic things thrown in.In honor of Veterans Day, I decided to watch this movie, and all I can say is that, I wish that I hadn't watched it, as it was absolutely terrible! Pearl Harbor is an awful movie, it's a waste of money, time, history, and talent. I had previously heard some really bad things concerning the director of this movie, Michael Bay, and while he is not completely to blame for the movie, he still deserves a lot of the blame. He, along with Jerry Bruckheimer and Randall Wallace seemed to know nothing about what had happened during the actual attack, the way that the attack is portrayed in this movie, it looked like a victory, when as everybody who knows about this attack knows, it was a defeat. There is almost nothing in this movie that corresponds to actual history, there are so many inaccuracies, that the movie should be retitled: Pearl Harbor: The Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer version. No kidding, it really should be, because they put no emphasis on the history and put all of the emphasis on the drama, visual effects, and the romance.In addition to the historical inaccuracies, there are also numerous scenes that had nothing to do with the plot. The opening scene for one thing, where these two boys climb into a plane and accidentally send it in flight. When I saw that, I just wanted to bang my head against the wall, when I was their age, I certainly knew better than to do something like that! But no, they had to learn it the hard way. The movie has a great cast, with people like Ben Affleck, Alec Baldwin, Kate Beckinsale, Jon Voight, and many more. And all of their talent is wasted, all of it. Ben Affleck plays a character who seems to be something like the next incarnation of Superman, during the attack on Pearl Harbor, he is seen going around rescuing people like no tomorrow. If fact, I was half expecting him to raise the Arizona out of the water and save all of the sailors who died on there. This is an insult to those who died on the Arizona, and to all of those who died in the attack as a whole.Michael Bay directs a script written by Randall Wallace, and like I mentioned, Wallace's script is terrible. In real life, you don't go from training in the air force one day to shooting down experienced German aircrafts the next day, sorry, it's just not going to happen. Also, President Roosevelt did not receive news of the attack from an aide or adviser running into the room, he was having lunch when he received a phone call telling him about the attack. And also, correct me if I'm wrong on this, but, President Roosevelt could not stand up by himself. There is a scene in a cabinet meeting where he rises from his chair. In real life, he had polio and had to be assisted when standing up. There are many more historical inaccuracies with this movie, but if I named all of them, I'd probably give away the hole movie. Pearl Harbor is an overlong, terrible, and very inaccurate telling of one of the most interesting events in United States history. This movie had potential, but the producers simply went to waste with it.All in all, this is one of the worst movies of 2001, and it's a shame that they had to waste such an interesting historical period with a horrible film. While director Michael Bay isn't completely to blame, he isn't completely blameless either, he also shares the blame with producer Jerry Bruckheimer and screenwriter Randall Wallace. Bruckheimer must have decided something along the lines of: "I'm going to make a movie about Pearl Harbor, but I'm going to do it the way that I envision it." And as a result, with get this movie that buys into the drama and the romance instead of the facts. So basically, if you want to see an effective World War II film, or an effective movie about attack on Pearl Harbor, then this movie is definitely not it. By the way, if you by some chance to decide to give this movie a go, then you had better be prepared to see something terrible.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie I have ever seen from Michael Bay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not that much of a Bay hater, heck I like Bad Boys, The Rock, Armageddon, and I actually do like the first Transformers movie. Well there are some missteps from him like The Island, I thought Bad Boys II was okay, Transformers 2 &amp; 4, and Pain &amp; Gain. This movie however....yeah....let's start with the good already.The only good things about this movie were the effects, production design and the Japanese attacking Pearl Harbor scene. That was a pretty emotional scene and a intense one, it was well shot and the action was well done. If it wasn't ruined by everything else.Now the bad.The acting is stiff as a wooden stick. They had talented actors in this movie, and only three of them (Aykroyd, Voight,and Gooding Jr.) did a valid job. The direction has no soul at all. The writing and dialog were cheesy as all hell. The Japanese (not to be racist) were nothing but stereotypes. And it's way too long. But none of them are the biggest problem with this movie. The biggest problem with this movie is the romance between Affleck, Harnett and Beckinsale being the main focus of the entire movie. They're obviously Jack and Rose from Titanic, except they are in Hawaii, it's the WWII era, you have another copy of Jack Dawson, and they're played by Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale. Plus, the only reason why the couple from Titanic worked in the first place is because the couple are in the RMS Titanic. This couple here are not in the Pearl Harbor most of the time, so why is this movie called Pearl Harbor then?It should have focus on two friends or two brothers (it doesn't matter if one of them might be gay) working at the Pearl Harbor and after the attack from the Japanese, they had to go to Japan to drop a nuclear bomb but before they go there, they had to tell their girlfriend that they may not be back alive and that kinda stuff. Now that should be the movie, but nope, we got to have a love triangle, as if that we have never seen this stuff in a long time.It's also blatantly inaccurate to the actual event. I mean like (spoilers!) I don't remember hearing about the Japanese planes attacking the hospital right next to the Pearl Harbor in my history class, because that never happened. It was stupid, insulting to the people who want to know about the attack and it's disrespectful to the people who either died or survived the Pearl Harbor attack. These kinds of things are why Michael Bay should never make a drama epic or a historical epic because he's more of a action oriented filmmaker, not a filmmaker that take things serious. But I know that they weren't making a documentary but you got to get the history right, Michael Bay, other than the time line.Overall: You know the sad thing about this movie is that I am a fan of war epics. I like movies from Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket or Platoon or Saving Private Ryan or any decent war epic out there. And I do like the historical drama genre. Stuff like Schindler's List, The Last Emperor, and heck I actually hate to admit that I did like Titanic. This one however, was by far the worst war epic and the worst historical drama epic (combined) that I have ever seen because even if the director may not be like Spielberg for drama, it had the potential to be a good movie. But I was not so pleased with this movie. If you want a Pearl Harbor movie, I'll suggest go watch Tora! Tora! Tora! or any documentary about the Pearl Harbor attack. This movie will disappoint you or let go of your interest about the tragic event.Score: 2.3/10</fullReview>

I have the movie at home and my parents told me that I would love this movie that it's a beautiful story. I wasn't so interested in the movie and after I watched it I knew it was a mistake. I don't see the point in the movie and even though it's supposed to be historical, it showed a really boring example of history. It's just 3 hours of either pointless romance or boringly continuous action. I don't recommend this movie if you of course want to enjoy watching movies. The story also doesn't make sense. They assume that a guy's bestfriend is dead. The guy who's still alive falls in love with the dead guys love life. Then it turns out that he was still alive and then beats up his bestfriend? Makes no sense at all and I was rather disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderous Cinematic Achievement Unfairly Maligned by the Reputation of it's Creators</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfairly maligned because of its stars, director and genre, Pearl Harbor is still a decent attempt at paying tribute to a significant, tragic event in American history, and does a pretty fine job of it. If only Bay had removed the clichéd love triangle aspects from the script, this might have been an overwhelming critical success. It's no "Saving Private Ryan", but it's a damn fine effort. You can hate me for saying this but I don't care; the cinematography is absolutely stunning and beautiful - I challenge you to not freeze any frame an not call it finely staged photography. As well, it's 3 hour run time flies by like a breeze. In addition, the 'cheesy' elements of the script were completely enjoyable; Bay makes it clear he's paying homage, (a la the scene at the start of the film where Affleck's character talks about paying respects to past achievements - "they call it an homage"), to the love stories on screen in the 1940's and 50's, the films which the characters in the film would watch and love, (the newsreels watched throughout the film are reminiscent/copies of Frank Capra's "Why We Fight" films from the same time period). This is a great film that will likely stand the test of time. Seriously. This is a damn good film. Matt Stone and Trey Parker don't own the public opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Titanic+Saving Private Ryan should be good right? Wrong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Titanic of war movies, Pearl Harbour sets a clichéd, cardboard cut out love story against the backdrop of a tragic historical event and despite blatantly borrowing from great films such as Titanic and Saving Private Ryan, it is a total misfire that fails to respect its audience or its subject matter. In fleeting moments the film shows potential: An inexplicably committed Hans Zimmer creates a very good soundtrack, while the visuals are stunning. From time to time, Michael Bay who if there was any justice in the world would be a pyrotechnics expert rather than a director, shows flashes of vision in his directing, particularly in the indulgent 40 minute attack sequence. Aside from that Pearl Harbour is just depressing. The film is like a dementor sucking your soul out as this outrageously awful blockbuster flop creaks through every badly written, groan inducing scene with glacial pacing. It takes the movie 1 hour and 20 minutes to get to the attack, which is rendered disrespectfully as a blockbuster showdown and lasts for 40 minutes, before we get the most pointless final hour of all time involving a revenge attack.All 3 of the leads are awful, while the dialogue is so cringe inducingly bad it can be funny but otherwise listening to the dialogue is a genuinely embarrassing experience which will leave you shaken for days. Michael Bay's direction is as robotic as ever and the film is, in general, a soulless, bloated bomb that deserves to sink without a trace. The final hour could have been erased easily, and with a talented director and a screenwriter who could actually write maybe this might have worked. The music is easily the best thing in the movie, and others may argue the attack sequence is spectacular but I disagree. It's loud, bloated, ugly and acts as it's some big entertaining blockbuster showdown instead of a very tragic day in American history. There are few silver linings or genuine defences for this film. Pearl Harbour is an insult to history, to war movies, to romantic movies, to sunsets, to action set pieces, to its critics, its audience and our intelligence and everyone involved should be ashamed. Especially the writer.3/10</fullReview>

The rest is, shall we say, less than stellar. Never mind that only twenty minutes is spent on the attack of Pearl Harbor...never mind that those twenty minutes had only one accurate fact (Yes kiddies, Cuba Gooding did get the one "vaguely accurate" portrayal in the entire movie), never mind that they try to get you to believe that two fighter pilots suddenly become qualified multi-engine, medium bomber pilots in order to participate in the Doolittle raid on Japan...never mind that those same two pilots were flying Curtis P-40 Tomahawks during the attack on Pearl Harbor, AND matching the Japanese flying Zero's (Two real life pilots DID take off from Haleiwa field during the attack. After calling ahead to get their planes ready,they drove 12 miles and jumped right into their cockpits, then downed 5 attacking planes. So that was vaguely accurate, although P-40's were never as maneuverable as they were depicted in the movie)......Well, you get the idea anyway.

		<shortDescription>Seems more like a disservice to those involved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Bay's approach to Pearl Harbor, centering around a tedious, contrived love-triangle is like watching a film about a first date on September 11, 2001. While one thing is going on that seems so trivial, so senseless, and so impulsive, a major historical event is taking place and instead of focusing on the bigger issue, we're stuck on a smaller, more secluded issue that is almost entirely irrelevant.The last time I witnessed such a big-budget miscalculation had to be when I watched Michael Bay's other atrocity Armageddon, which also victimized Ben Affleck into a senseless funk of action filmmaking. That was just an action film that exemplified the worst qualities of action cinema. Pearl Harbor, on the other hand, exercises the worst qualities of a war film, focusing on a lackluster love story and a brutal war without any agenda that I could find. Just one to milk sentiment from the audience and for a war film to rely on that move is almost cowardice. Do I need to cue Aerosmith's "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing?" The film follows Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett), two First Lieutenants for America during World War II. Thrill-seeking buddies, they both become involved in a relationship with Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), an army nurse. Rafe becomes romantically involved first, exchanging disgustingly cheesy dialog like "something hurts," after a fall injures his nose. "It's probably your nose," Evelyn replies. Rafe hits her with, "I think it's my heart." Groan-worthy dialog really doesn't stop there. When Rafe enrolls in the Eagle Squadron, he is shipped off to the dogfighting portion of combat, with rumors of his plane being shot down and being killed in the process. After this news circulates, while both heartbroken, Danny and Evelyn begin to have a relationship on their own, only to discover that Rafe is indeed alive and well and now angry his best friend has stolen his girl in the process.This is all troublesome indeed, but in the meantime, there is a giant, merciless war that shows no sign of ending going on right behind you guys, and this petty drama as the main focus of Michael Bay's epic seems a bit senseless, don't you think? I'm all for the humanization of war figures and characters involved in battles, but when there's a film about an enormous militaristic crisis and tragedy and its choice to focus on a love triangle instead of the real struggle at hand seems disingenuous. To use another analogy, it's like interviewing a couple who had a marital argument on a train that derailed about that argument. There's a larger, more interesting, more compelling, more emotionally touching story at hand and this is what you focus on? When we do see the battle at hand, and the action scenes, the production values are very high and the action is watchable. This is for about ten to fifteen minutes before the Michael Bay formula of making every explosion out to be an ear-shattering time bomb and every perilous instance to be a meteoric cacophony of sound that it becomes a muchness. Bay is a guy who loves to make his visuals loud and glossy and to that I give him credit. He should direct music videos for a living. His films, however, always assume this status and become nothing more than a showcase for visuals and a house for stale drama and characters that are developed in a way that feels like an obligation. Granted Bay has never written a film, a fact often misinterpreted, but I'm still trying to discover if screenplays handed to him are chocked full of character development and interesting human drama and, upon being handed back to the writer, are littered with footnotes about when to include an explosion or an action sequence in bold, red ink.It's odd to note that with a romance involved, a war at hand, and a serious dilemma between characters all occurring in one film, the three hours Pearl Harbor utilizes are dull and boring ones. Affleck and Hartnett are both capable actors, but are given dialog that just bleeds clichés, and accompanied by a script penned by Randall Wallace (the man responsible for writing Braveheart), I can't help but feel that the film's corny depiction of a 1940's romance and the scenes depicting the bombing of Pearl Harbor are a disservice and perhaps offensive to veterans of the war. The film feels like a Hollywood action movie, one that is intended as something to profit off of a tragedy and make entertainment out of it, rather than show the event as it really was. There are literally hundreds of ideas to base a film about Pearl Harbor off of and it's surprising to note that with the abundance of Holocaust films that are all very accomplished and smartly done, we have one widely known film about Pearl Harbor and it's a macro-disappointment.Starring: Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckinsale. Directed by: Michael Bay.</fullReview>

They are both falling in love with the same girl (a nursery). I hardly ever see romantic movie but this one is not only a love story but an historical movie. I like the way that the director combine real facts with a complicated and beautiful relationship. The war scenes are impressive because there are a lot of action and explosions. it shows well the reality and the situation there in 1941. The special effects are great and the sceneries from Hawaii are just beautiful. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is amazing and develop the moving sight of the film. I think also that the main characters played very good. There is a negative point: for me the relationship between the 2 friends and the nursery is too slow.

		<fullReview>'Pearl Harbor' is a bloated, overblown, tediously extended, hilariously cheesy, laughably bombastic, unbelievably crass 'Titanic' wannabe. 'Titanic' worked because James Cameron knew how to strike a balance between an old-fashioned cornball romance and a devastating true-life disaster. The sinking of the ship was not just a technical achievement but was also emotionally draining. He had respect for his subject matter.This monstrosity, on the other hand, was directed by Michael Bay and is, much like the man himself, a clueless chump with no restraint, tact or understanding of such concepts as subtlety and taste. The movie's big set piece, a reenactment of the infamous attack, is full of headless, legless and armless corpses, drooling shots of exploding soldiers, lovingly composed shots of torpedoes heading towards their targets, and a succession of other explosions, bullet hits and plane crashes so detailed and slickly rendered that I couldn't help but get the feeling that Bay was revelling in his visual effects budget rather than attempting to portray the horror of that day. Another director may have given the impression that this sequence shows us the carnage head on so as not to spare us the reality of war, but as this is Bay, one of the most disgraceful directors ever to sully a cinema screen, he doesn't get the benefit of the doubt; he shoots this stuff in the same way he shoots Megan Fox's ass.The screenplay is equally crude: every line of dialogue is either a pompous pronouncement, a howling cliché, a hindsighted historical prediction, or what seems like the beginning of a momentous speech. On set the crew must have been chewing their sleeves in an attempt to hide their laughter as in front of the camera the actors were variously embarrassing (Kate Beckinsale), really embarrassing (Ben Affleck), surprisingly likable but still quite embarrassing (Josh Hartnett), or completely wasted on dire material (everyone else). It's not their fault. No one could make this dialogue work.Meanwhile Hans Zimmer's score blasts us into submission, coating every patriotic, heroic or romantic moment with music so glutinous that it's like being held down while someone pours a bucketful of golden syrup into your face. That's the approach of the entire film: Bay at his hackiest, overplaying every moment with every manipulative technique at his disposal, including slo-mo, muted sound slathered in the aforementioned bellowing music, and at least a billion million shots of people looking up at planes sweeping overhead.This is a level of bad you don't often see. It makes '1941' look like a straight-faced docudrama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's cut straight to the quick: four stars.Four stars because the (relatively) early CGI is not at all bad, if overstated. Live action is pretty realistically mixed with virtual, although the aerial shots do look a tad artificial. Anyway, four stars for that.Doesn't leave many stars for the rest though, does it? At three hours, this movie is at least 50% too long. It doesn't know where it's going - and it shows. If you just watched the first twenty minutes you could be forgiven in thinking it is a comedy, rather crudely done. The last half hour, the Doolittle raid sequence, is pure jingoistic make-believe. Then there's the middle bit: the raid on Pearl - and that doesn't start until nearly an hour and a half into the romantic comedy. Discombobulated is, I think, the appropriate designation.I valiantly resisted seeing this film for years after reading how tedious it is in many reviews, but succumbed (this is 2012) and sat through the TV performance right through to the end.I am uncomfortable with movies that are fiction dressed up with a strong historical theme. The blurring of fact and fiction is always an invitation to re-write history or, at least, be taken as fact by those who are unable to make the distinction. WW2 is recent enough to be well documented, and a movie such as Pearl Harbor does itself no favours by weaving a completely fictitious story into actual historical fact.The really interesting story from a factual point of view was the failure of the intelligence services in the Pearl Harbour attack: this would itself have made a great movie but was hardly touched upon. As with Bletchley Park, much of the wins and losses in war are enacted behind the scenes and in secrecy.And the music track - atrocious!Sorry, but this falls into the same box as Independence Day - a jingoistic yawn. A wasted opportunity.</fullReview>

The movie does not fare well when compared to some others for war story value, I admit; there are plenty of good and better love stories and stories about friendships that beat this movie hands down. So why did I like it and why did hundreds of users score it above average (granted as many did not)? As I stated, it's pretty good eye candy. The expression should not be limited to references of beautiful looking actresses, or actors, depending on who is doing the watching; it certainly applies here.Many of the actors in this movie have fans and I don't want to diss any of them; so I'll not say all that comes to mind. Besides, I'm a fan of a few of them. I'm a fan of five of them; I enjoyed the movie. It's a movie that is best watched at the cinema with friends who are fans of at least a couple of the actors, eating popcorn with extra butter flavor crap and gulping a gigantic Coke. If you should decide to see it or get an invitation to watch it at a friend's home, make sure they have a big mother*#&amp;%ing TV, otherwise it may not be worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As usual this film has been bombarded with abuse from 'Critics', as they do with basically all historical films. They give it such a harsh review due to it not falling under a complete historically correct film...but taken from Michael Bay himself ''You do realise were making a movie here''.In order to make an enjoyable movie, of which Pearl Harbor excel's in, you need a storyline along with what really happened. A lot of what happened is historically true. In terms of whether this is a great MOVIE, not documentary, it really is. Great special effects, fight scenes along with a compelling love story make Pearl Harbor a brilliant film.I ignore most critics reviews on historical or religious films as they tend to be biased towards what they believe in...trust me if your not one of them kind of people, you will love Pearl Harbor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More accurately: the Doolittle Raid (dvd)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know this sounds less commercial than "Pearl Harbor" but it's the truth: the climatic attack happens well before the end of the movie and after it, there is still more than one hour of movie. Thus, this last part turns the movie from classic to average because it's dull. Roosevelt looks like the penguin and his drama told with too much emphasis! The wonderful character we have met so far turn into wrecks: the soldier Betty saves actually operates in this top-secret mission; Worst: imagine that Rafe wait the death of his best friend to tell him he's a father! When you are called into a suicide mission and if you have heart, you tell the truth as soon as possible to motive your partner.So, for me, the movie ends with Pearl Harbor and i must say it's a good one so far. The 40's are recreated like a shiny world and the Japanese aren't seen as inferiors. The romance isn't extraordinary but is rather excellently served by the cast. The movie sounds right when you see the hundreds of Japanese planes fly silently over Hawai, without any reaction from Americans. They were totally taken by surprise, the same way they were hit on 9/11. As the movie was released just before the event, i wonder how the audience have felt then. Unlike "Transformers" of the same Bay, the attack is well shot in the sense that you understand what happens on the screen.In conclusion, as it's more a fiction, it would have been better to end the movie with Pearl Harbor and to resolve the plot at that day(and cut also the sequence of the dog rescued, worthless and stupid). Maybe it was too much for them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Do We Have to Turn Every Film into a Romance Film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor was a significant event in American history. One interesting enough without the addition of soap opera melodrama stuck in the middle of the film.I should have turned it off during the very cheesy champagne scene. Too bad the cork didn't penetrate Affleck's skull and kill him right then and there.I mean really, did we need the added melodrama of a "torn between two lovers" plot? How trite. "Rafe I really love her". Well duh, you boned her and now she is having your child, I hope that is the case. Wouldn't the attack on Pearl Harbor been enough drama to concentrate on? Too bad too, the CGI effects of the attack were actually quite palatable. Instead we have to endure blubbering females in a Naval hospital in the midst of the attack screaming "oh no what do I do?". What do you think you should do? Maybe attempt to save some lives? Then of course we have the ending where of course Dudley Do Right wins the good looking female after the dopey looking male that knocked up the good looking female dies in a Chinese field. How utterly convenient.Thankfully I didn't pay to see this rubbish in the theaters.</fullReview>

I get that there has to be a certain level of deviation from reality when making a movie about a historical event in order to make it more exciting, so I'm willing to overlook that part, but there are so many other things wrong with this. I don't know how many more times I can say this, but, STOP PUTTING BEN AFFLECK IN MOVIES FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! He's terrible and he ruins otherwise good movies (not that this qualifies, of course). Does there really have to be a ridiculous love story? Is it a requirment made by the suits in order to get funding for your movie? It adds nothing at all to the story. This is a movie about the Pearl Harbor attack (sort of), not some awkward love story between two insanely irritating characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This so-called excuse for film-making was designed for (1) Complete idiots-(2) Democratic Florida voters from the 2000 election (3) Global Warming is Bush's fault believers (4) Any-combination of all three.This movie would additionally impress those folks who spell the word farm EIEIO,live in a community where the entire population shares the same DNA, or think child molesters can and should be rehabilitated with treatment.I realize that most younger film-goers today are not bothered by issues such as historical accuracy. Most have no clue as to the causes of World War II, or if asked- could not provide a 10 second speech on the issues surrounding the attack of Pearl Harbor(let alone locate Hawaii on a map). A minor detail such as a member of the US Army Air Corps(Affleck)leaving to join a British Eagle Spitfire squadron in early 1941(how gravely unfortunate that the Battle of Britan was in the summer of 1940), only to return from the dead in December of 1941 to Hawaii is beyond imbecility.Later we are treated to 2/3rds (Danny and Rafe) of our loving sexual threesome generously donating blood in Coke bottles after skillfully shooting down several Japanese planes,and later spending an adventurous evening attempting to rescue the doomed trapped sailors on the capsized Oklahoma. Once freed from these chores,the audience is further subjected to more weepy, cheesy and pus infected lines of attempted acting between the now knocked-up nurse( Beckinsale) and her former jilted stiff-dick (Affleck).Our two top gun wannabees(who have now kissed and made-up) are then ordered stateside for the Doolittle mission of April 1942. This mission was entirely voluntary- but the two pals just go where they are ordered. Only later is the entire B-25 Doolitle Raiders crew asked to take the one-step forward in dramatic fashion.Of course the fact that a WWII fighter pilot flew single engine aircraft and never even touched a B-25 to fly in combat 5 months after the Pearl Harbor attack is beside the point.After successfully launching off the Hornet inspired by the leadership the excellently cast Alec Baldwin(the real Jimmy Doolittle would have vomited knowing such a left-wing,unpatriotic social hemorrhoid was portraying him),our dynamic duo crash land in China and get into a firefight with those annoying Japs. Too bad such an event never occurred, but what the heck! Why be so critical and judgmental?Although poor Danny(Harnett) sadly assumes room temperature in the hand-hand combat fantasy,good old Rafe gets home safely in time to hook-up with the slut nurse Evelyn and raise the bastard child who mirrors a retard on film. If Michael Bay had the time, I am sure he would have had Affleck leave the Army Air Corps and become a Naval Aviator in time to personally avenge Danny's death by destroying the Japanese carrier fleet at Midway which was only a month later. After all, this shell game worked during the Battle of Britan. Later he could have returned to pilot the Enola Gay for the Hiroshima mission in 1945 after leaving the Navy to once again join the Army Air Corps after a successful combat record after leading paratroopers in on D-Day, firebombing Dresden, Berlin, and probably attempting to assassinate Hitler in a P-51 Mustang strafing raid.Any fellow veteran who isn't insulted by this trash should get some mental health counseling ASAP at the nearest VA hospital. For the uninformed civilian population, open a history book. Of course, in our modern, diversity driven educational system, your feelings are more important then reality. I wonder if Hollywood ever thought of providing "grief counselors" to the survivors of Pearl Harbor. In the case of this nauseating bile of an attempted movie, I think it would have been appropriate to the surviving viewers of this ridiculous garbage of a film.For me, I'll place the movie Pearl Harbor alongside my other all-time favorite comedy- G.I. Jane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few nice flying scenes and that is it. The romantic thing was bunk. Our two heroes were very loosely based on two real men, Ken Taylor and George Welch. Two Air Corps fighter pilots who managed to get to their planes and take off. They did shoot down some Japanese planes but the incident is much better re-enacted in the movie TORA-TORA-TORA (a much better film in all regards). Both pilots survived the war.In one scene you see a Japanese Zero fly by with a camera mounted on it's fuselage. The Japanese planes were painted the wrong color. They were Navy gray but someone decided the green looked better on camera. Why not just remake the battle of Britain and made the Germans fly pink dive bombers.The bit with the mechanics climbing the control tower and shooting down a passing plane with small arms was STUPID and the bit where they run 2 Japanese planes into each other is off the BS meter.By the way, Jimmy Doolittle (played by Alec Baldwin) was bald. Doris Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr.) was an huge man. That is why he was a boxer. Miller did man a gun and shoot at shoot down 1 or 2 attacking Japanese planes for which he received the Navy Cross. I think the official record show 2 shot down and 1 damaged. He was killed later in the war. None of Doolittles Raiders were at Pearl Harbor during the attack and no fighter pilots were chosen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Pearl Harbour fails - and Michael Bay misses the mark...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is aesthetically a treat to be sure but it fails almost everywhere else. Michael Bay, Bruckheimer and Wallace thought they could get away with making a film that, quite honestly, would not be out of place had it been done in 1942 - the movie about 'Wake Island' has a tacked on romance and the movie 'Bataan' has the stereotypical interracial bunch - but nowadays moviegoers want something smarter and as true to history as possible while delivering a great story. Most people also know how to spot blatant propaganda and avoid it like the plague.I think the romance is not a problem, neither is the plot the problem. The problem is the execution which is lazy and little more than a video game writ large. Check out the movie Dark Blue World about WW2 Czech fighter pilots for comparison. EXACT same plot line but worlds apart in treatment and respect for the Czech heroes who fought with the Free Czech airforce in the UK and came home only to be branded traitors by the new Communist regime.Titanic had a truckload of crappy Hollywood dialogue but it made good. The reason I think is it was true to its source material. Michael Bay just tacks on the lovestory to a fictionalized story about real Pearl Harbor heroes - Taylor and Welch - and somehow sends them to participate in the Doolittle Raid (nevermind that fighter pilots don't fly bombers!) I think that yeah, expectation also has a lot to do with it. With the name Pearl Harbor you expect it to be a WAR MOVIE like Battle of Britain or A Bridge Too Far. Maybe some romantic interest but it shouldn't be the main theme - the main theme should be the WAR. For my part I was expecting a mix of John Toland and Walter Lord but I got something that's barely a cut about Ma Nouvelle France, that horrible Quebecquois movie about the fall of New France to the British which is YET ANOTHER Titanic ripoff. Sadly, too many people thought that just by tacking on a romance to a historic story and making it sappy they'd emulate the success of Titanic. No such luck.Titanic succeeds where the wannabees fail because it: a) appeals to a very broad spectrum of people (ie. higher ticket sales!) - the yuppies and lovers can gush over Di Caprio and Kate Winslet's Romeo-Julietesque love story, the boys can wait up for the Winslet nude drawing scene, the girls can swoon over Di Caprio, the geeks and rivet counters can errm count the rivets and enjoy the history brought to life.b) incorporates various elements of story into the plot almost flawlessly and with respect to historical reality - history here isn't just a backdrop it ACTIVELY AFFECTS THE STORY (this is where Pearl Harbor fails dismally).In Titanic the division between classes and decks becomes a physical divide that separates the lovers from each other and later, threatens to separate them from survival. The class restrictions provide the characters with motivations that go beyond mere mushyness - Kate's escape here is not just to be with the one who she loves but it is an escape from the restrictions of her class to be her own person and live a full life. Leo's role here as hero-saviour fits into classic mythic structure and it plays well, in spite of the corny dialogue. It becomes real to the viewer because the characters become real and the characters become real because the history, the scenario, the environment is real and true to the facts within the bounds of good drama. One loses one's self in this fiction instead of - as in Pearl Harbour's case - being reminded constantly that this is a blown up (pardon the pun) video game with a lovestory tacked on for the girl crowd.c) Titanic also succeeds because it taps into the female audience by presenting a VERY powerful and positive female archetype. Where most movies of this type (historical action) focus on male achievements and character growth (and the female is little more than a pretty plot-point) Titanic's Rose de Witt-Bukater IS the main character (along with, essentially, the ship itself) and Jack Dawson is her mythic savior-redeemer. This is something we rarely see in movies of this type - only perhaps Gone With The Wind's Scarlett O'Hara can provide something comparable. It empowers women and gives women what they want - the inspiration to strive for their dreams and a man who will help them achieve that.This is becoming a Titanic review more than a Pearl Harbor review but I point these out because Pearl Harbor very obviously seeks to emulate the aesthetics and scale of Titanic but gets the method to the multi-million dollar madness of Titanic completely wrong. It is a lazy film for lazy viewers who want their brains handed to them on a plate. Its beauty is ONLY skin deep and there is nothing more to be learned once the credits roll. Which is a pity when one considers that it purports to honour the heroes who died on a tragic Sunday morning in December, which led to millions more deaths and untold suffering in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the world's first atomic attack. An event like that deserves more than to be reduced to a glorified music video or video game for the attention deficient. It's just sad that most people can't see how this film pisses into the hallowed waters over the sunken hulk of the USS Arizona.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody seems to think that this movie is horrible. I'm guessing that most people say that because they either don't like Ben Affleck or they don't like the director Michael Bay. However I have to say that this movie was pretty good. This movie is exactly the same as Titanic and everybody loved that so there is no reason for everybody to have such a problem with this movie. Most people say that the love story was bad but it was pretty decent. Ben Afflect and Josh Hartnett plat two American pilots training for war then Affleck falls in Love with a nurse played by Kate Beckinsale the he volunteers to go to fight the war and is assumed to be dead, then Hartnett falls in love with her, after that Afflect comes to Hawaii and finds out what has happened. Then pearl harbor gets bombed by the Japs and after that both of them are a part of the Doolittle raid on Japan and their plane gets shot down Hartnett dies and Affleck lives. I admit the ending was not great but altogether the movie was pretty good and enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I hate reviews that are either a 1 or a 10, usually saying more about the biased reviewer than the movie itself. However, I've rarely ever seen a movie deserving the lowest amount of points possible. To further empower this statement: I've seen Mighty Peking Man, Kung Fu Zombie, Troll 2 and Manos Hand of Fate. I'd rather have an Uwe Boll marathon week than watch this piece of crap ever again.Besides the always terrible Ben Affleck who, in case the acting-job offers come to a sudden and much deserved halt, could always pick up a career as a poker-player or living statue, there's the single most terrible piece of history distortion. Ever. When Hitler tried to have history rewritten to make it seem the Germans were the inventors of... well... everything, Michael Bay and Randall Wallace would have been perfect for the job.The story: The US see their prime fleet sunk by the Japanese. (Quote of Danny: "I think WWII has just started". Yes Danny, if by "just" you mean the invasion of Poland a few years back.) However, the US, being a poor and technologically backward country, have lost all of their fighter planes in this attack, so how to fight back now? A cunning plan arises: they'll use the handful of regular planes that are left and leave for Tokyo with the intention of bombing it. Sadly, the Americans are unable to correctly calculate the amount of fuel needed and, as a result, never reach Japan. Instead they make a crash landing in China, where they are captured by the Japanese.So far, so bad, but read this and weep: The Japanese, who are in awe of such commitment and bravery (???) decide to lay down their arms and capitulate to the US.Yes, that sounds plausible. Or maybe Japan DID surrender because of the 200,000 innocent people killed by the two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, like the history books say. I'm not a religious man, but I do believe there's a place for Michael Bays after death. And it ain't pretty.</fullReview>

He flew with the eagle squadron, defended pearl harbor, went and saved sailors after the attack, then, a fighter pilot, somehow gets picked to fly bombers for the Doolittle raid and manages to train for it and fly in it just 4 months after the attack at Pearl Harbor. He could have won WWII alone.This is a case where they didn't want to pay enough actors to pull this thing off somewhat believably. If this had been done right, it would have been an epic with a lot of actors much like Midway or A Bridge too Far.

		<shortDescription>Very Inaccurate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it is a story about one of the most important events of the last 100 years, it is a movie full of inaccuracies. Yes, fighter pilots from the US were asked to help defend Britain. There were numerous instances of American pilots flying aircraft for other countries. They would not have to give up their citizenship, as previously stated by another commenter.Watch the attack on Pearl Harbor very closely. You can tell that 90% of the ships used for filming were non-period ships. At least use CGI ships that are accurate. It seems that the director was obsessed with explosions as you can see the same ships repeatedly blown up. In reality, not every ship was hit. The Japanese were focused on destroying major US warships. The US carriers were to be hit but since none were present at Pearl on Dec. 7, the Japanese targeted the next best thing, the battleships. The ship Cuba Gooding Jr fires at the plane from is the U.S.S West Virginia. In the movie, moored next to his ship is a modern looking destroyer. Since the West Virginia was moored outside of the U.S.S Tennessee, there would be, presumably if we were looking towards the bow of the ship, no ship to that side of the West Virginia. Also, when he does shoot down a plane, it crashes into another battleship. Where did that come from, since the ship just a second ago was a destroyer, which wasn't even supposed to be there.. Also, the P-40 Warhaks flown by the main characters are not correct. P-40s of the time had 2 machine guns on the nose of the plane and 4 in the wings. The P-40s in he movie had 6 guns in the wings, something that did not happen till later in the war.On the carrier taking the B-25s to Japan, when they take off, you can see catapult lines on the flight deck. They were not used till later in the war. Also, the fact that Rafe and Danny are fighter , not bomber, pilots has no relevance. True they are different, but they had 4 or 5 months to learn how to fly a bomber. You would think with the enormous budget allocated to this movie, they could have been more accurate. They also needed to get rid of the love story. With it, it's just Titanic with airplanes and bombs. The only good thing is they represent the spirit and courage of the men fighting that day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Pearl Harbor" a couple of years ago. And today I saw that writer Randall Wallace earned 2 000 000 (!?!?) dollars for the script. What? Eh? Is Hollywood like this? Can you go to California, make a pathetic script, almost totally untrue even if it shall be based on a true story, and make this fat pile of cash out of it? If I'd say Pearl Harbor before this film existed, you'd probably think about the Japanese air force's air raid at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. But now "Pearl Harbor" is a 3 hours long movie, starring Ben Affleck as the main character. If I was a war widow from WW2, I'd require to have Randall Wallace shot by firing squad. Not only because he wrote a romantic, awful film with the title "Pearl Harbor", also because he made 2 000 000 dollars out of it. Why didn't they just skip all romantic rubbish this film has? It could have been a 10/10 without it! If I would be president, senator or perhaps congressman in USA, I'd do everything in my power to forbid the title "Pearl Harbor" and rename it to "An untrue, pathetic love story during WW2". When I saw it, I thought It would be like an interesting history lesson on screen. I was wrong! Go to a library or look for real sources on the Internet if you want to learn something. And for all of you who wanna waste 3 hours of your precious time, looking at Ben Affleck's mediocre acting, I recommend this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>one of the worst movies of all time. this movie could have been good, it has an interesting story but Hollywood had to F*** it up. the movie is meant to be about the bombing of pearl harbor and the war and all that. but instead they made it about some stupid love story, the acting was good, but that was the only positive about the movie, it was also historically incorrect. anyone who thinks this movie is good is on drugs. Hollywood has hit rock bottom with this shocking movie, it had some great effects, which is also a positive about the movie, sorry there's more than one positives. It could've been a great movie the story of the war is great, i love learning about it, when i went to see this movie i thought it could've been great, but it was just TERRIBLE. words cant describe how badly i hated this movie. the first part of the movie was absolutely shocking, i was ready to kill someone. when the war started, it hardly provided us any info about how the war started and everything, the second half was better than the first, still s*** though.two words...S*** HOUSE (or one i don't no)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I forgot when was the last time this was shown here on the television. I know they showed it here a few times. I did watched in one of those times it was on the TV.Given I am once a History student, and WWII was part of the syllabus, Pearl Harbor is also part of it...though not much in detail in my History textbook actually... Anyhow, I still watched the movie anyway. Given this is about what led to America's participation in WWII, I just kept my comments to myself till the movie ended.And I realised after I saw the movie, what is really going on? Okay, I think the love story part might had played a little too much and spoiled the entire movie almost. Speaking from someone who once took History, this is not really what I had expected at all.This one is very, very average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Focuses on boring subplot rather than history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pearl Harbor" employs a feeble and woeful attempt to duplicate the success formula of "Titanic," relating a historic event through a fictional love story. It doesn't work this time.Instead of showing the events leading up to and including the "Day of Infamy," we are instead burdened with a tedious, dry, contrived, and totally irrelevant love triangle plot device. This painful and insulting attempt to cash in on the Rose &amp; Jack story from "Titanic" is a poor focus for the film, and fails for the following three reasons (there are more, but it would make this review too long).To begin with, the PH triangle characters do not serve as a link to the tragedy they witnessed, as Rose did. Her eyewitness account of the calamity provides an empathic link to the people who perished that horrible night in 1912. She makes them human and real, people we can care about. The three in PH provide no such connection nor insight, whatsoever. They appear to exist for nothing else than window dressing and schmaltz.Second, the obvious absence of any chemistry between them is at times tediously boring, at other times excruciatingly irritating. The dialog is trite and utterly beyond belief. Never does it touch you emotionally in the slightest.Finally, the story of the Japanese attack on Dec. 7, 1941 is best told as a documentary, because of the great amount of historic information it encompasses. Approaching it as a romantic drama focuses on the fictional story, rather than the actual history. It becomes a device to tweak tears and exploit them for box office dollar signs, rather than to give dignity to those that lost their lives that fateful day.The depiction of the actual attack itself was the one sequence deserving a complement in this movie. Perhaps it works because it was the only time the actual event was addressed. Special effects, stunts, action, and story were well coordinated and utilized to precision. Scenes of futile escape/rescue attempts are eloquent, even frightening.But then they boomerang right back to that pointless triangle, which either has you sleeping or yelling at the screen by this time. Tacked on to the story is an American retaliatory air-raid (which occurred much later), included for reasons only the writer and director know. A much better movie depicting the attack on Pearl Harbor is the docu-drama "Tora! Tora! Tora!" It clearly and concisely portrays the events leading up to and including the attack, told from the perspective of many witnesses, both American and Japanese. If you're interested in this event, rent that movie. Ignore the movie that offensively represents itself as "Pearl Harbor."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I agree with Team America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to hear what I think about Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ben Affleck and the rest of the movie, go watch this scene from Team America that explains it all. The expert critics who somehow gave this movie a perfect 10 or even a good score should especially watch it. For starters, Ben Affleck gives an awful acting performance in this movie. I give him credit for Goodwill Hunting, that was a great movie and he is where he is today because of that movie, but honestly it has been all downhill from that point. Armageddon (I don't care if you like that aerosmith song), dare devil, gigli, bounce, jersey girl, just to name a few of his classics. The love 'triangle' was not believable because the relationships for both Affleck and Beckett weren't given enough time to develop, and I didn't even feel sorry for the girl when Josh Beckett's character dies. Why was Cuba Gooding, Jr. barely in the film? This guy is an award winning actor and a much better one than Ben Affleck in my opinion. This is one of the most tragic and historical days in our nation's history and the focus of this film is on some cheesy love story. By the way, if you actually walked out of the movie theater that day in tears, than you are clearly an emotional wreck.</fullReview>

By far it is much better than any other drama ever made. It puts Robert Altman to shame! The acting, the emotions, the drama! YES! That's what I felt like screaming at the top of my lungs in the movie theater. YES! MICHAEL BAY HAS RECOGNIZED MY NEEDS AS A Film-goer TO BE BOMBARDED WITH HOLLYWOODIZED TWISTING OF HISTORICAL ACCURACY! Morphing a tragic incident into a romantic triangle wherein the entire fate of Pearl Harbor centers around how long Ben Affleck has gone without a shower and how much longer Kate Beckinsale can go without once more pouting her lips, displaying her "confused and intense" face. Her "sad and remorseful" face is one in which she pouts her lips two degrees to the right, rather than the left.To be honest, I'm lying. This movie is terrible. Michael Bay should be burned at a stake.

Much to my surprise, I was witness to over two and a half hours of love story with a war making a guest appearance. And what about Cuba?! His part was so abysmally small it was unbearable! Why put someone like Ben Affleck in front of a true actor such as Cuba? It boggles my mind. In my opinion, Cuba's performance along with William Fichtner's is the only reason to sit down to this flick. Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Not to mention false advertisement.

I am located in Pearl Harbor and can tell you that we are all very proud of the fact that we live where history was made. Previous post say the US attacked innocent women and children but I have to disagree. It has been proved the Japanese went after anything close to Pearl Harbor. The United States is a very professional branch and at that time we attacked only Japanese military targets. I do not feel at all dis-respected by this movie and am glad Mr. Bay recognized the importance of DEC. 7th 1941. I hope everybody enjoys this film and remembers every party that was involved in the attack of Pearl Harbor.</fullReview>

The attack scenes are worth the rental or viewing to see how the real thing went down.3000 people died at Pearl Harbor on Dec 7th 1941. They deserve more than this. Michael Bay missed the mark with this film.

		<fullReview>Maybe it's because I watched it with little or no expectation, but I thought this film was OK. Great visuals, cool effects and just plain nice to look at. You could've freeze-framed many scenes and used them as wall painting. I loved the aerial shots of the planes flying over the blue ocean through the smoke in-between the burning ships. Really cool. Sure it was a little long, the pacing could've been quicker and the script better, but it was still fun to watch. Maybe it would've worked better as a (big budget) television mini-series. The pacing and sub-plots made me feel like it was one. And the retelling of the events leading up to, during and after the Pearl Harbor attack seemed fairly accurate, except for the side story about the love triangle of course. Even the Doolittle Raid, which I had thought was Hollywood's creation added to quickly give the audience something to cheer about, was an actual event that happened. So, despite Michael Bay's direction, it's a pretty good film. I've seen worse. Between 1 and 10 I give it a 6.</fullReview>

No one man did or could EVER have fought in The Battle of Britain, Pearl Harbor and then flown a bomber in the Doolittle Raid. That is just so incredibly absurd I almost walked out right there.I gave it a 3 because it had some really cool scenes. But that's all it was - a few cool scenes with a bad plot and a bad love story wrapped around it. And it was not historically accurate past the most basic facts. The true personalities and concerns of the major players in the battles were NOT accurately represented.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With this budget, an astonishing lack of star power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, Industrial Light &amp; Magic certainly earned their fees on this one. The battle sequences are truly something to behold. But that still leaves almost 2 hours of movie to sit through. The framing story is OK, but simply doesn't match the rest of the film. There is, for the most part, no one on screen that demands attention. That has that special something, that charm, that charisma, that makes you unable to tear your eyes away from the screen. That thing I call star power. This lack is amazing in a film with this kind of budget. Affleck doesn't have it. Josh Hartnett has it even less so. Kate Beckinsale, while very pretty, and a good actress, doesn't have it either. Jon Voight was kind of an odd special case in this film, with his heavy make-up, he didn't look at all like Jon Voight. But he didn't look at all like Roosevelt, either. Now, Alec Baldwin, as much as it pains me to say it, does have it. But he wasn't in the film long enough to make up for the rest of the cast. The definitive Pearl Harbor movie is still "Tora, Tora, Tora." (And for the last part, "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo") I gave this one a 6 just due to the amazing visuals in the battle scenes, but if not for that, it would have been a 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stop with the Remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is so incredibly annoying that Hollywood finds it necessary to constantly remake its own work because it is a rule with few exceptions that the original is a better movie, in fact remakes are usually terrible.In the case of Pearl Harbor it is even worse as the movie is a remake of not one, not even two, but three other movies with bits of several others thrown in as well. To start with Love stories with the backdrop of war are a Hollywood staple and somewhat of a cliché. A guy falling in love with his best friends girl when the friend 'dies' is also a movie cliché. The first movie they have 'remade' is From Here to Eternity, one of the best films of the war-romance genre and this love story is nowhere near as well made or acted as its more famous predecessor. The second film they tried to remake was Tora, Tora, Tora an excellent movie about the planning and execution of the attack. The third film is Thirty Seconds over Tokyo about the Doolittle raids, which features everything from two friends, to one of the friends dying in China and the other returning home to his pregnant wife. Not only is it a pitiful attempt at remake three excellent films but some of the scenes, especially the FDR scenes are totally pointless(Don't get me wrong I like Jon Voight but he was poorly used in this movie).Some of the special effects are neat but that is about it, why can't Hollywood do more original stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor Bombed Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What direction would the movie called Pearl Harbor take? How about the Battle of Britain? No? How about a sappy contrived romance? No? Let's hurry up and do Pearl Harbor then go to the aftermath of Pearl Harbor before we venture to the Doolittle Raid. But first let's do the Battle of Britain. This movie ran all over the place. Add poor lighting (many scenes were so dark it made me wonder if lightbulbs were new inventions in the 1940s) speechifying (Roosevelt standing up) poor script with a "duh" romantic triangle and you have a bomb. Did anyone notice that the machine guns were replaced by painted broomsticks before the Doolittle Raid? Then, in the dark, one of the B-25's managed to shoot up a squad of Japanese soldiers without hitting their own men while traveling over 200mph--with broom sticks! The attack on Pearl Harbor was well done and some of the shots of the Japanese carriers were very accurate (yes the islands were on the left side of those carriers) except the one shot of a modern US carrier. Also, they portrayed actual Japanese aircraft for the most part instead of T-6 Texan trainers like every other WW2 movie uses for both German and Japanese aircraft. But that was spoiled after these two guys, after fighting the Japanese in the air, gave blood then mustered enough energy to dig thru thick steel on the USS Oklahoma. Watch Tora Tora Tora instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disgrace to war films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only saw this film once. It was on opening day back in 2001 when it first opened. I remember going with my entire family. We were all pretty excited about it.Let me just say, I have never been so freakin' bored out of my mind. I felt like with the success of Titanic, that Bay was trying to re-manipulate the idea of incorporating a teeny bopper love story into a major disaster in history. Although, Cameron did a hell of a lot better job in Titanic.Affleck is a great actor who always gets typecasts. He's always put in the wrong roles and this certainly is not helping him out. Josh Hartnett is also an underrated actor, but he is just so freakin' sloppy in this movie.The attack scene on Pearl harbor, the 45 minutes of the movie that actually make the movie title somewhat make sense (I think they should have stuck with the original title, Tennasse or whatever) is one of the most poorly filmed war scenes I have ever seen. Smudging lenses to cover up blood to make sure of a PG-13 rating. It's just hack film making that Michael Bay is making so popular these days.The bombing raids in the end, the crashing in china, this to me doesn't seem like "Pearl Habor". To me, this is history slapped together into one giant mess only to confuse teenagers more on history events. Worrying more about ticket sales rather than art and actually somewhat educating people. I remember my ex-girlfriend, God bless her mind, actually thought Pearl harbor was a war in Alaska with the French...yeah, anyway, enough said on that.If you want to see a film about Pearl Harbor that is much better. Please, do yourself a favor and watch Tora! Tora! Tora!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pearl Harbor" fails miserably in delivering what could have been an Oscar-caliber account of the notorious Japanese attack, full of razzle dazzle and brilliance in many technical and cinematic areas. Some exceptional special effects do not a movie make. What could have been something great turns out to be a miserably directed, acted, written, and executed misfire which can only be described as "just another worthless summer blockbuster". First of all, the dialogue between the "characters" (whose excessive presences are entirely unappreciated) is about as glossy, corny, and ridiculously clumsy as I have seen in film, as there is nothing eloquent or convincing in this drek of a screenplay. Secondly, a vast majority of the audience for this concept is not interested in a complicated, sappy love triangle reminiscent of a tedious "Titanic", and are probably not compelled by much of the deliverance of the film for that reason; the audience is interested in a spectacular recreation in the notorious historical event: Pearl Harbor! We don't need some Hollywood-style romance, some "buddy, don't steal my girl" hokum, and most appallingly, blatant historical inaccuracy in our historical entertainment. This is about as tasteless and nauseating as film experiences come, with some impressive special effects to wield its disastrous execution. Sloppy, baseless, and flat out offensive Hollywood misfire that would otherwise be a catastrophic dud without the accompaniment of some decent technical qualities (e.g. visual effects and music).

If you find this acceptable, then we definitely have to talk. I'm talking about civilization here! This film is about who gets the piece of ass (and when they both get it, it's no good either), and it's about getting even. Now those are very recognisable things in life, but the solutions to the problems are, in both cases, the easy way out. I would like a script to come up with somewhat more elegant ways in dealing with them. I think I will actually rent Tora! etc. I've grown to be curious.

		<fullReview>This movie is NOT a documentary, nor is it FROM HERE TO ETERNITY. The first hour is bogged down with a rather contrived love story that is almost unbearable. Nonetheless, the final 2/3 of PEARL HARBOR redeems the picture. The love triangle is ultimately resolved somewhat plausibly, with the final scenes actually being rather touching. While obvious liberties were taken with historical accounts for various reasons, the integrity of the film remains intact -- the attack scenes and the American response to Pearl Harbor is authentic in principle, as is the portrayal of FDR and his leadership. The cinematography, including the action scenes, are outstanding and believable, as one would expect for the budget of this picture. Finally, devoting the final hour of the film to the Doolittle raid is a rather satisfying resolution, as it allows the story to come something close to full circle. PEARL HARBOR was rapped in part because of the subpar acting, and there the critics have a point -- Ben Affleck still can't act his way out of a paper bag, but he is fairly well-cast as the stoic, confident fighter pilot. Alec Baldwin is a surprise as Jimmy Doolittle (a rather ironic casting given Baldwin's politics, but he is actually a highlight of the film). The supporting cast is adequate, not sensational, which makes the "slow" scenes a little tedious, but all told a film worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, as many have stated is more like three movies in one. I think they are interwoven beautifully. The characters are all great and believable. Their situations seem real enough. The characters that really stand out for me are Josh Hartnett's Danny Walker, Kate Beckinsale's Evelyn and the actor who played Red. I enjoyed Alec Baldwin as Doolittle, also. I waited 2 years before I saw this movie and it is the human relationships that really drew me into the movie. Another story it follows is the build up of the Japanese attack. I thought that was very well done. And then of course there is the attack which is pretty amazing and realistic. All together this movie has a little bit of everything. I have been watching it over and over and over and have not tired of it yet. A number of people talk about the inaccuracy of the historical content. Seeing this movie has interested me in looking further into the event and they took some liberties but all in all I think they portrayed it fairly straight. I'm not sure why so many people seem to hate this movie but if you haven't seen it look past all their negative comments and give it a try. I think you'll like it. I sure do!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thirty Seconds over Pearl Harbor and Tokyo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, "Pearl Harbor" is not a bowdlerization of the kind of WWI romance/action film that "Thirty Seconds over Tokyo" represents but instead is an homage to it. Both films begin in the east and describe their heroes efforts to learn to fly and work as a team in the air while watching their relationships and personalities develop. The stories then move west until reaching the Pacific where the action really begins. The characters in both survived incredible adventures and then emotionally reunite at the end. The situations are credible in both and the acting is fine and strong.There is a video-game quality to some of the action sequences in "Pearl Harbor" but the human suffering is not ignored or trivialized. (The same could be said for "Titanic", which is also a throwback to an earlier style of film-making that is much missed- I actually through "Pearl Harbor" superior to "Titanic", although I enjoyed both). Complaints that "Pearl Harbor" and "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo" are historically inaccurate in some details or fail to tell the whole story of the war are pointless. All films sacrifice historical accuracy for story-telling to some extent and no film could tell the entire story of WWII. "The Guns of Navarone" is hokum and it doesn't show the concentration camps but was it really necessary for it to do so? Of course not. And isn't it amusing to see one poster describe "Pearl Harbor's" depiction of the Japanese as `racist' and another as `politically correct'. You can't please all the people all the time but all of these films pleased me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to wonder how much of the criticism of this film is a personal attack on Affleck and not actual analysis of the film. I thought the romantic triangle and the relationship between Affleck's and Hartnett's characters were quite moving. The action sequences were exhilarating and the film had a look of authenticity to its period. I am not enough of an historian to know if every depiction is factual. Perhaps it wasn't politically correct to set a romance in such a sensitive setting in US history as Pearl Harbor, a la Titanic, but still the zeal of the critics seems overblown. I even thought the Japanese perspective was given fair consideration. On another note the later use of atomic weapons on Japan was justified, even Japanese generals later agreed, as it saved countless American lives that would've been lost had a conventional force tried to take the archipelago. I think it even saved many Japanese lives that would've lost resisting that invasion. On the film, my score: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Song is NOT the Worst Thing About This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the theme song from "Pearl Harbor" by the usually terrific Faith Hill is annoying sappy, it is by no means the WORST thing about this movie. That honor, unfortunately belongs to the embarrassingly trite main plot of friendship lost and reclaimed due to lover's triangle. That device was probably old hat by the time of "Wings" (1929). However, to cheapen one of the most fateful and sorry episodes in American military history, while at the same time whitewashing Roosevelt's treachery, does a disservice to those who died for political expediency. Worse, producer Jerry Bruckheimer has assembled a cast made up largely of nasty, partisan liberals to preach to us how terrible we were NOT to see the threat posed by the Axis powers. Today it is generally known (if not widespread knowledge) that Roosevelt goaded the Japanese into war. Recent evidence even indicates US forces likely struck first. However, since this is ENTERTAINMENT and, moreso, a "human drama," let's focus on the real shortcomings of "Pearl Harbor". First, most of the film takes place in other locations, the "sneak attack" taking place in the middle third of the picture. The performances are fairly good, with the exception of John Voight, who plays President Roosevelt. John Voight looks and sounds like, well John Voight. He is utterly unconvincing, never more so than, in a possible flashback to "Coming Home," Voight, as Roosevelt, stands up on polio-paralyzed legs in front of his war staff. According to all accounts, the incident never happened and, as portrayed, is cheap theatrics.Most of "Pearl Harbor" plays in a manner fitting the theme song, overproduced and bombastic. However, all of the technical credits (cinematography, costuming, set decoration, special effects) are terrific. However, you would do better to see "Tora! Tora! Tora!," "From Here to Eternity," even the miniseries "Pearl" if you want accuracy, believability and even good drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insensitive?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my second note here since after watching the movie for the second time around recently, I had to look up more information on the actual bombing...I really did like the movie and I thought it was well done all around, but after looking at photographs here on the net of the Arizona (among others from that day) and noting another reviewer's sarcasm about "What's next, '9-11, the Musical'," I do have to say I can relate. On the end of being entertaining and a movie of decent construction, I'd give it a thumbs up and say I was impressed...liked the story, cinematography, thought the acting was okay etc. ...but then on the historical side, if I knew more about it, it would bother me since inaccuracy has always been a pet peeve of mine. Additionally, I have to question if this kind of makes light of the whole of what happened in Pearl Harbor on that day of infamy, seemingly so long before us. It really seems secondary to the story here and all I am is disturbed by the horrific feeling that made America rally behind the war effort the way it did. Eventually we would not have had a choice I think, but to get involved.I do think they portrayed the actual bombing with a fervor and some of the gore of that which it was, but then we stepped immediately away from this into the next part of the movie and sidelined it in favor of the love triangle. Is this an insult? We all have to decide, but it is a fact of the film. It kind of causes me to believe they needed to target and market this as something other than a flick about Pearl Harbor, and more at the love story since the attack really was secondary--incendiary or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor Truly a lesson in hack filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the worst films made in a long time, a true lesson in hack filmmaking. It's a film that capitalizes on the realization that tugging at veteran's heartstrings and showing lots of young and perfect looking men and women will produce a blockbuster- but this movie is a hit only in money made, because it is a joke. The characters are so un-likeable that one can't help but cheer for Japan, and only wish they had finished the job to wipe out these useless and dullish characters. The direction is slow and dull, and even the action scene of the attack comes off as over-baked and tiresome. The sweeping musical score, which is indistingushable from a hundred other action/war flicks of recent times, only is there to try and make the viewer "feel" drama. Pearl Harbor fails on all accounts to an interesting film. Why not try a different approach? Why does perfect and hunky Ben Affleck have to be in love with a woman, why not make him a gay man? How about make Cuba Gooding Jr. into something other than his Jerry McGuire-sidekick role? Can Josh Hartness try to act and stop relying on his looks? Avoid if you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Opinion of Pearl Harbor, the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the movie. Yes, the writers and producers used a lot of dramatic licence in the creation of the film (fighter pilots never flew bombers off of an aircraft carrier, bomber pilots did) and more than 2 planes made it up to defend the harbor against the attack, but aside from a few minor things like that, it was a great film, and as far as recent WWII films go, it got the message of gore across, without having to plunge the viewer into the middle of it. The story was easy to follow, had a wonderful moral about friendship, and the price of it, and the actors used for the film were perfect for their parts. I watch very few movies that have an R or PG-13 rating, however, this film is one my kids will be allowed to see, because of it's high quality. Thank You :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>POSSIBLY THE WORST "FILM" IN THE LAST CENTURY...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie doesn't deserve my time or my thought (or anyone else's for that matter), yet I feel the need to save my fellow mankind from degrading trash like "Pearl Harbor," so I'm simply going to write a to-the-point review. First, the single positive element this film has going for it are the special effects. They were fantastic in the one scene of the film that they needed to be--the prolonged action scene. Yet I must ask...because this movie is about such an integral and vital part of history, yet is so appallingly horrendous in its acting, directing, and story, aren't these great special effects a complete waste? The film makes it abundantly clear that the makers of this movie care nothing about the significance of the events at Pearl Harbor, but solely about gaudy imagery and box-office dough. If this is the case, and boy is it ever, these special effects aren't in the picture to capture the emotions of a certain time and place, but rather to keep the ignorant drones that make up the majority of American society content in their seats. The special effects here serve offensive purposes and are utterly drowned in the midst of a plot (saying this movie has a plot is a massive compliment on my part) that is so terrible one can't even come to appreciate the effects. I can envision the makers of this film predicting that audiences would be bored after awhile, and the timing of the battle scene is precise in a way only Hollywood can be-- the effects aren't intended to be meaningful or historically accurate; they're just to try and keep us from storming out of the theater. Anyway, I'm not even going to go into the acting, story or directing...take my word for it, they were all awful. A handful of clever camera shots and wide, colorful cinematography were an agreeable viewing experience, yet in the end merely flaunted the film's high budget. The cute lil' threesome leads represent the future of terrible cornball cinema, and the Michael Bay/Bruckheimer combo was almost too much for my stomach to take. Please, if you have a brain, don't bother renting this movie. Maybe if you're writing a paper on the formula of bad films, then its ok, but otherwise, let this movie collect dust on the video store shelf. I especially don't recommend this movie if you know more-than-average about history, or if you're Japanese. The movie paints a lovely patriotic picture of the conniving Japanese, hell-bent on destruction on the first half...but then, later on, we get the famous "woke a sleeping giant quote"....oh, isn't it cute? The little Japanese, always filmed in robes sitting in a circle in some ancient outdoor meeting ground, have learned their lesson. Uh....I'm afraid things didn't actually happen like this people. Does anyone know what stereotypes are? This movie made America look like a wonderful combo of heroes and victims, and, although people think it captured history flawlessly, it neglected to mention that America went on to drop nuclear bombs on multiple Japanese cities, killing hundreds of times the amount of Americans killed during Pearl Harbor. The movie dedicated itself to showing the events leading up to Pearl Harbor (with the nauseating parallel plot of a 1940's love triangle), and then drops history with America as the hero's. I can't go on...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To paraphrase, "Those who have not seen good WWII movies, are doomed to remake them". And worse, others, who have even less knowledge of WWII, history or even good WWII movies, will come and watch them. I gave this my lowest score ever to a movie because it could have been an important film. It was not even an entertaining film, and certainly not a well made film. There are dozens of truly fine films on this very subject, most of them well written, acted, directed and some of them, truly memorable and even great, by most critical standards. If there is any positive statement that I could make about any aspect of "Pearl Harbor" it would be that perhaps it might introduce an element of history about which some very young or uneducated viewers might not have known. Hopefully, once introduced to the concept of WWII as actual history, it might engage some to learn more. There are many WWII films, made either during that time or contemporary that put this movie to shame, as if it shouldn't be ashamed of itself already for countless reasons, among which might be writing, directing, special effects, continuity, casting, acting and writhing PC, just to name a few. That is all that I have to say about "Pearl Harbor" (the movie).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Under Rated Movie of 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale, Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight, Cuba Gooding Jr., William Lee Scott, Ewn Bremner, Michael Shannon, Greg Zola, Colm Feore, James King, Mako, Catherine Kellner, Jennifer Garner, and Tom Sizemore as Earl.Two best friends named Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker, who have known each other since childhood, grow up to be pilots. Rafe, is offered to go to war, and he accepts. He tells his girlfriend, Evelyn, who is a war nurse, goodbye as he leaves. Now, Danny, along with his friends Billy, Red, and Anthony are transfered to Pearl Harbor for air training. The nurses also go along. Then, Danny finds out that Rafe has crashed his plane and tells Evelyn the bad news. Three Months Later, Danny starts to fall for Evelyn. He takes her to see Pearl Harbor at sunset from the air. Then they end up hiding in the parachute hangar, and so on. Then a couple of days later, Danny and Evelyn find out that Rafe is alive. Rafe comes to visit Evelyn, but finds out that his best pal has taken his girl. The next day, December 7, 1941, the Japanese attack, sinking the USS Arizona first. Rafe, Danny, Red, Anthony, Gooz, and Joe go to Earl's airfield and lay off some cover fire with the .50 Caliber. Rafe, Danny, and Joe go to the last planes that are "good to go", and Joe doesn't make it off the runway. Rafe and Danny fly into the air and play a game of chicken with the planes, making the Japanese accidentily crash. After the attack, Col. Doolittle, one of Rafe's previous superiors, offers Rafe, Danny, Red, Gooz, and Anthony to be a part of his group, The Doolittle Raid, which is to invade Japan. The most under rated movie of 2001. People hate this movie mostly because it is based on Pearl Harbor. I actually like the movie. I was surprised that this was PG-13 because of a lot of violence, and language.The acting was good. Ben Affleck was okay, but Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale gave solid performances, as did Cuba Gooding Jr., Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight, and Tom Sizemore. Most of the supporting cast was good also. There are also bits of humor scenes delivered by Michael Shannon and Tom Sizemore, like when Gooz says that women "cloud the mind" or when he says that he has a girlfriend and no one responds for 10 seconds.People might hate me, but I thought that this movie was really good. It is filled with Action, Dramatic moments, and some romantic scenes. I recommend Pearl Harbor by all means, but I also recommend other War movies even more.3 out of 4. My IMDB Rating: 7.2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent movie from beginning to end. A moving film that touched me deeply. Possible spoilers:Japan made a surprise attack on the US Navy base at Pearl Harbor back in 1941, which prompted the US to enter World War II. In this movie, we're shown the Japanese preparation for the attack, how the US did not put out a warning in time, the surprise attack, and the US response to it. Stories of love and friendship are intertwined.The scenes of Pearl Harbor being attacked were amazing. There was some character development prior to the attack. We saw relationships between different characters. Seeing some of the characters die was very sad, and it made me angry at the Japanese. When the surviving characters took up arms to fight back, I wished I was there to fight alongside them.The stories of love and friendship took nothing away from the movie. People fight and die in war. The people who died at Pearl Harbor all had their own stories. The attack on Pearl Harbor and the war had a great impact on all of those directly involved and their families and friends. The people and relationships shown in this movie, even if some were fictitious, gave us a glimpse of that.That this was a big-budget movie full of stars and released to great fanfare are of no importance. It showed a reenactment of something that many of us had only read about before, making it more real to us than any textbook ever could. It reminded us that people fight wars, and Americans were willing to give their lives for their country. It showed us exactly what it means to die for our country, when maybe we hadn't given it much thought before.One of the best movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Epic &amp; Romantic Film with Plenty of Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good film at 3 hours duration. Like any film of similar length that intends to keep audience attention, there are slow parts and fast parts. There's drama, and there's action. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines romantic as "marked by the imaginative or emotional appeal of what is heroic, adventurous, remote, mysterious, or idealized." That makes this a romantic film. Both drama and action are well spaced. The action is often fast with quick camera angle changes and short closeups, along with camera movement that adds to the live-action effect, giving a feeling of being there. The drama has plenty of conflicts which enhance the human element. The emotions soar and dive, and not all goes as one would like, much like life, but the human spirit survives to the end. This is a film for entertainment and I've made no effort to confirm or refute the historical accuracy of any part of it. As all historical films, we know the eventual outcome of it's subject before the screening. However, this film is only a slice of the whole story and the method of telling this slice, the choices in subplots, characters, character players, direction and camera work, make it well worth the time invested in the viewing. This is a very good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How USA entered into the 2nd World War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the film showed a sentimental story of love triangle I see it more as valuable for the scenes related to the attack of Japan in Pearl Harbor and the events previous to it than for the sentimental story of those young persons. Pearl Harbor was a criminal act where the Japanese used all strategic weapons including the surprise factor. This is well shown in the film as well as the way the Japanese prepared and accomplished this aggression. Another aspects touched were that US hesitated to enter into the war while the allies like UK were already fighting against German nazis, that some experts in US were even able to guess the aggression of Pearl Harbor but not considered possible, the way president Roosevelt reacted to the aggression and the way he compelled his army to respond. From this point of view the film is highly valuable while the sentimental story is perhaps much better than the one shown in "From here to eternity".</fullReview>

When I got to it, the attack was rather dull. It does have a lot of fancy CGI-enhanced shoot 'em up, blow 'em up sequences, but they really didn't add up to much, probably because there's no build up, either cinematic, dramatic, or historical, to the event.Wow....

But whats the point of fighting over it? I love Pearl Harbor its one of my favorite movies, but I'm not about to get myself into this battle field, because I don't care. Who cares if other people think it sucked, I could care less. All I need to know is that I enjoy watching it and I know it was a fantastic film.

		<shortDescription>Titanic II</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Contains minor spoilers***The movie tries too hard to be like "Titanic" and uses all the ingredients that are used in "Titanic" but "Pearl Harbor" fails...The biggest problem with this movie is that the film makers can't seem to decide what for a movie they wanted to make: A spectacular one or a realistic one, with as a result that the realistic/shocking scene's in the movie just don't work in the way they should.The actors only seems to have been cast because of their looks instead of their acting skills. Especially the nurses look unrealistic beautiful complete with make-up and hair style.And then the love story...well what can I say, the love story just doesn't work for me and is over the top at some points ***SPOILER***for instance when Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) finds out she is pregnant, that just seemed so over the top and out of place that I almost stopped watching the movie at that point***SPOILER*** You can say that the love story kind of ruins the movie at some points.The character are not interesting enough due to poor character development and I wondered lot's of times throughout the movie: "Why are we following this characters ??? What makes them so interesting to follow ???"In my opinion the movie should have focused more on the political aspects of Pearl Harbor and the leaders, like Roosevelt (Jon Voight) and the attack itself instead of Rafe and Danny (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and their friendship and problems.Another thing that bothered me is the Cuba Gooding Jr. character. The character is just pointless and it's only distracting and seem so out of place. The only reason I can think of why they had put them in the movie is because it's a political correct character to put in a movie.One more thing before I'll mention the things I liked about the movie. The movie makes an huge mistake to not stop after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The movie goes on and follows the Doolittle raid on Japan. This is absolutely pointless and I think that an alternate ending should had been made.The things I liked: First of all, I thought all the Roosevelt (Jon Voight) scene's were fantastic. Secondly Alec Baldwin played in my opinion a great role as Lt. Colonel James 'Jimmy' Doolittle.Some more things that I liked are: The camera work (although it was VERY over the top), the editing (the movie has a good quick pace), the music by Hans Zimmer and the attack on Pearl Harbor itself was made beautifully.I don't mean to bash the movie too hard, but it just isn't good enough. If you want to see a good spectacular/realistic war movie you should watch "Black Hawk Down" instead and if you want to see a good realistic war movie you should watch "Saving Private Ryan". Only watch this movie for the special effects and when you have nothing else to do, you might even like it (I know that some people just love this movie).5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Please note that I watched the Director's cut dvd)I didn't know what to think when I popped this into the old dvd player. To be honest I was worried. Everyone that I knew said that this movie "blew big time" and that I shouldn't see it. The funny thing was, no one person had the same reason for hating it! One said that it was inacurate, one said that it was long and boring and the other said that the love sucked! Yes, I will be honest, there were a few times when it got a little slow, but I still thought that it was a good movie! I know that many people hated the love story, but I think that it was needed. Yes it was overdone, but you can't make a movie just on a battle. Every movie needs some story and some characters to relate to. Now to get to the good stuff, the battle! I am not glorifying this attack. I just think that it was good for this movie to be made. This is an important part of ou history and we should learn about it. The battle scene was intense. I personally think that it was very realistic. I was on the edge of my seat for the rest of the movie. For the people who say that the scene was too long! That is what a battle is like! Battles can go on for hours! This made the movie that much more realistic. To me, a movie is good if it moves me. The battle moved me. I was shocked at dismayed to see how horrible the attack actually was. Textbooks are nothing compared to this! All in all, the acting was pretty good, the story was good and the action scenes were very well done! Another thing that I liked was the ominous "Jaws" tone about the Japanese. You knew that they would come, but you didn't know exactly when. Please don't listen to my friends or the people who hate the movie. Many of them are immature for the love scenes and have very low attention spands. This includes my friends. Their movies have to have constant explosions and be no longer than 100 minutes long. Yes, I like those movies too, but they are not the only ones that I watch. To sum it up. Go see this movie! I really think that you will like it. It shows a very important part of out history and it entertains us all in 3 hours. What more could you ask for. 9.5/10 Great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film - and give up the anti-Americanism!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that I loved this film, despite knowing that it's not entirely accurate and is centred round a love-triangle. Yes, it could have been better and it didn't need the love story, but give the film a break! It was well-made with superb special effects. I think one of the reasons people vote this film down is because they went to watch it expecting it to be bad and predictable, in other words, a remake of Titanic - typical romance involving a girl that two guys want. And I'm not dissing Titanic here either - I loved that film even more so than Pearl Harbor. I'm almost certain that if this film had been released as the first of its kind - modern epic of tragic historic event with love triangle and very attractive actors - it would have made just as much as Titanic did. What went wrong with Pearl Harbor was the way it was hyped about - most expensive movie ever made, etc etc. People thought 'oh yeah, been there done that' because they'd seen Titanic. And it did bear many similarities to Titanic but that does NOT make it a bad film. And I wish people would lay off the Americans. OK, so it's the biggest, richest and best (in my opinion) country in the world - so what? Any other country would act the same if it was them. I hasten to add here that I'm English and live in England, just to clarify that I'm not American and therefore not biased. Maybe some of the dialogue was cheesy but that was the DIALOGUE, not the pro-Americanism. Surely anyone - in any country - is going to act patriotic in the middle of being attacked by another country! It's a natural reaction. You can hardly imagine the characters standing there saying 'well, let's give them the benefit of the doubt - there's a reason for this' can you?! Maybe there is a reason but when you're in the middle of something like that surrounded by death and destruction, your instinct is to protect people and defend your country. So lay off the Americans everyone! The place rules - get used to it! In my opinion, Pearl Harbor was a cinematic masterpiece with a very touching love story. The people who went in there expecting it to be rubbish came out thinking it was rubbish, not wanting to admit their expectations had been wrong. It's NOT Titanic everyone - just go watch it and appreciate it for what it is, don't just compare it to every other epic that's ever been made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie immensly. The historical events are accurate, the characters are believable, the special affects are amazing. People say they don't like this movie because of the love scenes...I would like to ask those people "Do you think that they weren't going through love during war??" I believe that during WWII their was people in love...I think that throwing love in there was a great aspect. I liked how during the major fighting Refe and Danny put their differences aside because they realized that they could die at any moment and they didn't want to leave anything unsaid. So them being in a fight over the same woment didn't get in the way of the actual fighting. I think that they did a good job of portraying the pain of the bombing of pearl harbor.Another thing that I noticed people didn't like was Cuba Gooding Jr's part, and i would like to argue that it shows how hard it was for black people, even then in america. they wanted to show every aspect of that event and i think they accomplished their goal.I yawned through titanic, but cried through Pearl Harbor. Bravo Hollywood!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Reason Hollywood Keeps Churning Out This Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I was pleasantly surprised that the movie captivated my attention during the whole length. For those who are skeptical about it, it's primarily a love story, it's a great love story.I really enjoyed the movie, and recommend it to anyone that is looking for a great story."Are you kidding? First, when you say the whole length, do you mean the same 3 hellishly boring hours that I'm thinking of? Second, it's primarily a love story... sure, I'll give you that. But I p**s on the people who cut the trailer that went on television showing it primarily as being a film about the militaristic event of Pearl Harbor. And then there's the fact that they named the damn movie after an event that deserves not a SHARE of the limelight with a crappy love triangle of attractive yet completely unconvincingly cast actors and actress, but deserving of more respect and attention than was shown. Third, it is not a great story, any way you slice it. It is so methodical and cheesy, it deserved several exclamations of "did he just say that?", or "i wonder what's coming next." I really knew this movie was a complete shame when the awkward scene of the wives resulted in Gooding's wife and the whole "whites only" discussion. YAK! VOMIT! Just read the title. People with such bad taste as the person I quoted are the reason crap like this keeps infiltrating the theatres.</fullReview>

I never indulged myself on knowing the details of history.

		<shortDescription>God bless America and show mercy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm an Englishman and I happened to watch Pearl Harbour while visiting friends in Canada. During the film I saw 4 Japanese-looking people walk out (and I didn't notice them return) so make your own mind up about that. I have to say that this film is probably the worst I have ever seen. I would have been laughing throughout if I wasn't offended so much by the portrayal of the RAF as defeatists ("If all Americans are like you, God bless America"!!) and the low expectation of my intelligence. All 4 of us in the cinema were literally doubled-over laughing at the film's unbelievable attempt to draw a happy ending from the real-life events. Where do I start? The president's attempt to get to his feet to give a rousing speech, the predictable love triangle saga (my girlfriend whispered the final line to me 10 minutes before the end) and most astonishing of all; the portrayal of the retaliatory attack on Tokyo as being a success!! A dozen under-fuelled planes barely reach the mainland, yet alone Tokyo, and are gunned-down quite easily. How can this have struck fear into Japanese' hearts?! I caught myself literally mouth agape at such arrogance.The film is the ideal example of the worst of Hollywood, where x millions are spent on the twisting of real-life events for the affirmation that God indeed blesses America. eg. Independence Day (they must have been so proud to see the president take on the aliens) and U5471 (it was the ENGLISH who cracked the Enigma code. While we are happy to let the Americans take a lot of credit for the war; after all Europe needed them; to take liberties with the known facts is a disgrace to the people involved and just about sums up this film as well)The bottom line is that I heartily recommend this film! I thought I could overlook every potentially provocative suggestion as an artistic statement but this film changed all that.</fullReview>

But what i do know is that this movie really did suck. I'll go with tomaustin. it makes you root for the Japanese "IN THE HANGER!"I'll put it like my friend does. its just a really stupid love triangle with blood, bombs, and Josh Hartnett.Me being a teenager, i find it stupid that in a 3 hour movie, only about an hour, probably not even, dedicated to the actual event. Thats where this movie fails. If you are going to make a movie about Pearl Harbor, make the movie about Pearl Harbor, not a love triangle that didn't even happen! I do not even want to go into detail about Joshie's little death scene. I mean, how many people, after being in a plane crash, gets a piece of shrapnel in their necks, then gets shot, actually have 5 minutes to spare talking to people?? That sounds WAY to painful to even be talking. And then Ben Affleck hardly can act. When he was crying, oh god, i cringed!!After watching this piece of crap, i rented Tora! Tora! Tora!. boy, was i surprised. That movie actually did a really good job!! Pearl Harbor made Tora! Tora! Tora! Look like gold.So in short, if you want to watch a movie about Pearl Harbor, i highly recommend Tora! Tora! Tora!* out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right now this awful film is suffering the final ignimony it truly deserves. Having hit the shelves on DVD it didn't sell &amp; so is being knocked out at the same price but including another major release from the same studio. Even then, such an incentive can't shift "Pearl Harbor" off the shelves. And people scoffed at Kevin Costner &amp; "Water World"!!!!As far as the story is concerned, well we all know the plot, a staggering torrent threatens to overwhelm us .............no, not the effect of the Japanese air attack on the Naval station at Pearl, I'm talking about the cliches &amp; their effect on the audience. "If anyone has finished with their popcorn can I borrow the bag, I'm going to barf!".Oh, here we go, right in at the deep end. Childhood pals grow up in some Perfect Little America, Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett).Ben Affleck goes off to England to fight the Nazis... he's shot down (predictably) presumed dead (you know he isn't really)&amp; his best friend "comforts" his now emotionally stranded girlfriend (Kate Beckinsale). Yawn, yawn yawn....can't you tell what's going to happen next? Broderrick returns... Zzzz Zzzz Zzzz... the friends fall out &amp; everything that follows is played out to the tune of falling bombs, waving flags &amp; running to battle stations while showing your muscles &amp; good looks....Zzzzz Zzzz Zzzz.By the time the battle sequences started I was already beyond caring &amp; could hardly keep my eyes open, but the caffeine in the coke I was drinking helped. I perked up a little when the bombs started falling, but this soon faded. The CGI aircraft, bombs, ships &amp; explosions looked cheap &amp; nasty &amp; the little plot line that remained between the characters was continually tiresome, irritating &amp; pathetically predictable.In the end I couldn't wait to get out &amp; I regret having wasted time &amp; money on such tripe. I don't often find so little positive to say about a movie, but this one takes the prize, beaten only by the indescribably awful "Smokers". The one &amp; only bright spot in all this gloom is John Voight as President Roosevelt, but even this performance is overshadowed by the sheer boredom involved in getting so far &amp; all that follows.Why Hollywood continues down the same old ludicrously dreadful lines I'll never know. One explanation I have heard is that people there are so afraid of making a decision that when Hollwyood executives get married they take 15 years to decide where to go on honeymoon. No one wants to decide, because if things go wrong they'll get the blame. The result is stagnation &amp; this film reeks of it. Let's face it, if anyone has seen the equally 'by-the-numbers' tripe "Titanic" then you've seen this version of Pearl Harbor. For the Japanese air attack read the iceberg, for Pearl Harbor read the Titanic. It's just another bucket load of the same, old same-old wrapped up in a different cover.Don't go anywhere near this film, stick to the infinitely superior "Tora Tora Tora", which, despite it's age, is the definitive work on this piece of history.Hopefully Hollywood will learn from this mistake, but I doubt it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Historical inaccuracy is unnecessary in a story like this. There were true heros in abundance. Two US Army Air Force flyers did shoot down seven aircraft during the battle over Pearl Harbour and their names were Welch and Taylor. The former survived the war only to die as a test pilot for North American aircraft in the development of the F-100 Supersabre. They were true heros - the only ones to get to their aircraft on that Sunday morning and to successfully join the fray in the air. Yet their characters are trampled by the differently named heros of the film. On a second matter, it was good to see some representation of the Doolittle Raid, but other than Doolittle himself, there is no recognition for the truly brave men who participated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing less than a masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers Pearl Harbor is easily one of the most critically slammed movies of the decade. By being battered back and forth like a tennis ball by the critics, it has suffered a box office below expectations. However, I knew this would happen a year before it's release. "Why?" I hear you ask, well for the following reasons.· It was hailed as the next Titanic (a film critics had to praise only to stay in touch with the public). With the fact that they could have a second chance of slating a film, they couldn't resist. · It was directed by a former music video director. · It was produced and directed by a team known for 'dumbed down action films'. · It was released too soon after Titanic.They are just four measly reasons why it was slammed, and with a soppy synopsis like this, it just seemed like a Titanic rip-off.Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) are best friends who have grown up together in Tennessee and with World War II going on in Europe, they train to be fighter pilots. When Rafe falls in love with Navy nurse Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), things look good between them but Rafe is assigned to go to war in Britain, only to be shot down and presumed dead. Meanwhile, Danny and Evelyn have been assigned at Pearl Harbor in the Pacific. They soon fall in love together (not again!) but only for Rafe to return from the dead. Just as things heat up between the three, the Japanesse launch their horrfic surprise attack on Pearl Harbor!As you can guess, this is not brain surgery, it's just pure entertainment, nothing else. Directed by Michael Bay, this is cinema at it's best with outstanding battle scenes and geniune emotion. Is it as historically incorrect as critics and historians have said? Well, yes actually it is, but it doesn't matter because your not going to learn anything about history anyway apart from the fact that it was Japan who bombed Pearl Harbor. Was the incredibly boring Saving Private Ryan historically correct? Uh, no, so why did it win Oscars? Oh, of course, because Mr Spielberg directed it.Basically, Pearl Harbor has been criticised only for what it is, not for what it's like. It's an American flag-waving popcorn movie and critics hate these type of films, and seeing it's produced the critic's worst nightmare and the public's entertainer, Jerry Bruckheimer, that's not going to help the star ratings. This however, is going to be a 100% honest and unbiased film review.Michael Bay has made an excellent three hour long epic with true emotion, breath taking action sequences, tremendous performances, as well with a bit of clunky dialogue. Each shot Bay films is beautifully done with true meaning and wonderful cinematography. Honestly, Pearl Harbor has got to be the best cinematography I have ever seen and it's a disgrace why John Schwartzman wasn't even given an Oscar nomination. Maybe there is one sunset too many but does it really matter? Bay has put a lot of thought into his scenes and shots. For example, when the 'Pearl Harbor' title comes up, it appears in front of a sunset- the Japanesse flag. It's a very simple idea but it's a genious one too. Also, during the build up to the attack, there is a non-diegetic heartbeat sound. The audience notice this without realising it and it keeps the andrenalin and anticipation rushing. The script by Randall Wallace (Braveheart) isn't exactly the greatest ever written and some of the dialogue is awful, "We make refrigerators while our enemies make bombs", but the acting is done well enough for most of the cheezy lines to be unnoticed. Affleck has been wrongly headlined for the film as it's a film about three characters. However he has given his best performance yet and his partnership with Hartnett, especially in the climax, is superb. Beckinsale could have been better but Cuba Gooding Jnr in the role of Dorrie Miller is the film's biggest scene stealer. While the attack isn't as horrific as some people may have wanted it to be, the must realise that with a budget of over $135 million, the film makers needed a wide audience, which resulted in the film being a '12'. If it were a '15', then they would have lost money. By the way, anyone who says the film is offensive to the Japanesse are talking out of their bum holes because more than once, the film portrays them as soldiers of war. Fair enough, the Germans might get offended with references to 'dirty German bandits', but to be offended by that they would just acting childish because in those times, that is what the Americans would have called the Germans. The worst part about the film is the unforgivable amount of cliches. From a black man wanting respect becoming a hero, to a normal love story procedure (I can't explain because that would be a spoiler), cliches almost rule some of the scenes, but Bay has done it so well that you barely notice most of them. While people have criticised Bay's faster than normal editing pace, they are just being stubborn and unprofessional. When Bruce Willis is first introduced in Pulp Fiction, the camera is placed in front of him while someone is talking to him. You can't see the person talking which by film conventions, makes it bad direction. But it's not bad direction because that's just Tarantino's style, so why can't they accept that fast editing is Bay's style? These 40 to 60 year old film critics just can't seem to accept that film making styles have changed since the Hitchcock days.Complete with a beautiful Hans Zimmer score (I would have personally chosen Trevor Rabin), Pearl Harbor is nothing less than a masterpiece. Yes it's cliched, yes it's historically incorrect, yes the script is nothing special and yes it's gung ho, flag waving, American glorified nonsence, but it's a beautiful emotional film that grabs you from the start and never lets go while also making references to 1940's style film making and wonderful film making as well! 10/10.By Kevin Williams The Greatest Film Critic in Wales</fullReview>

Why did Titanic get such high praises and this movie bad reviews. Titanic was a love story based on a trajedy, and Pearl Harbor is the same. Don't hate on this flick, if you never seen it don't listen to the critics. Bruckheimer produces this, directed my Micheal Bay, two of my favorite's, and this is another classic under their belts. I found it to be very emotional, the bombing scene was a whole other movie within the movie. Probably the best special affects i have ever seen.

		<fullReview>A friend of mine and I watched this overly-long 3-hour flick two weeks ago on DVD. Though the film has extravagant special effects, the characters and plot fail to live up to the massive hype that this film received when it was released.Ben Affleck's character and the love story with Kate Beckinsale was nearly identical with his character in Armageddon. It's sad that he, the writers and producers of Pearl Harbor couldn't come up with something more original.After 2 hours of watching this film, I nearly fell asleep. If the editors had cut most of the whiney, sappy &amp; melodramatic tripe to have a 2-hour film, it would have been a much better, far more entertaining and much more exciting movie.My advice: if you want to see a good film about the attack on Pearl Harbor, watch the History Channel or rent the movie "Tora!

Last night I started watching it thinking I could cut it off if it got too sappy. I happily stayed up the whole 3 hours to get through the movie. So I have to give the film a high rating because it does hold your attention.As far as the comments I heard about the love triangle and the distraction from the main point of the movie, I thought it added a human element to the film. Remember that soldiers are people too with loved ones, families, brothers, sisters, girl firends, boy friends, kids, etc. Trying to portray this event in US history is tough enough and I believe Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay did a fine job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is fashionable to say, when critiqueing this movie, the attack on Pearl Harbor is great, but the rest of the movie is just awful. I want to state plainly and for what ever record there maybe that it is not the case. In fact it is all awful, every excruciatingly painful minute. I will briefly only comment on the attack as other awful aspects have been covered by other reviewers (Roger Ebert's wonderful line, "Pearl Harbor is a two hour movie crammed into three." should give one an idea about the rest of the film). In fact I will talk only about one scene in the battle. It is designed (this ugly scene) to drive us to tears, but all it should do is offend, offend and offend! The scene depicts several sailors treading water (we are looking at them from under wonderfully tinted soft sea green), the sailors are fighting valiantly to stay afloat. Behind them under the water, is an American flagg. And underneath the entire scene is one of the most annoying soundtracks ever created. In less than 5 seconds director Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckhimer have taken one of the most tragic events in U.S. history and turned it into a music video. And a boring, predictible, and unispired one at that.</fullReview>

He is actually able to transfer a script to the screen without giving himself away by too many special effects.Pearl Harbor has many special effects and many explosions like movies Bay made before, BUT the difference is, in this film he keeps back everything which is not necessary to show the attack by the Japanese which results into an unobtrusive and nice movie.Ben Affleck has some nice scenes (as he gets to know Kate Beckinsale), but is as wooden as ever. The surprise and pleasure of Pearl Harbor comes with Josh Hartnett in a wonderful performance. Watch out for him, he is great !The dialogue is so ridiculous and laughable that the actors, if they weren't as likable as Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale, would make complete fools of themselves. But it is charming to watch them with their stupid lines. And that makes the movie good.8 out of 10, I was surprised how good this movie really is !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad propaganda wrapped in a love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't want to make this a long comment about the missing historical accuracy, a lot of people did that before already. But what really made me upset was the exaggerated patriotic touch of that movie, like it is common these days for "American" movies, mixed with racism and prejudices (U-571).Already in the beginning is that scene, when the father of the little boy is accused to be a German and he is all offended and telling that he fought the Germans instead! That was so unnecessary. All the the morons, that never read a history book have a reason again to think, that Germans are bad people by genetical reasons, so they are still today.This is simplifying the historical truth in a way, that is a slap right in the face of every European. The reasons for WWI where quite complex and nobody could be really blamed for it. But WWII was definitely caused by the allies, who where more interested in a weak Germany than in a stable Europe.But it is easy to blame everything still on Germany after 60 years, because the USA is always right, the others are wrong.So for what was that comment about the Germans in the beginning? I don't see any moral superiority, if a movie is made on such a low level.But also the rest is pure propaganda for American patriotism. It twisted historical facts and unwanted truth is hidden. Also a behavior that is known well, not only from American movies.As I said before, I don't want to discuss the historical accuracy, since too many did that before.In Pearl Harbor it was not 2400 people that died. No! It was 2400 Americans! Does it make a difference which nationality they had? Every person dying because of war or violence is too much!When the Japanese planes were shot down, the movie was making it look like a video-game. "Got you, son a of a bitch!" If Japanese or not, there was a human being dying in that plane and the movie made it look as if it is something glorious to kill an enemy.The raid on Tokyo was a REVENGE for Pearl Harbor, not more and not less. Revenge is one of the lowest feelings a person can have. Is that moral superiority?Alec Baldwin says in the movie, that if there is no way to get away, that he would know what to do. He would choose the right target and make his plane itself a bomb. Something that is an interesting statement, since September 11th.And at the end it is said in the movie, that this war made America grow. That is quite true, but not to something so good as it wasclaimed in the final seconds of the movie. It made the USA growing to use the A-Bomb against Japan, even the war was over already, just for testing purposes. It made them killing hundreds of thousands of german civilians during the raids on big german cities during the last months of the war. The list could be endless...No, this movie is really bad propaganda and I feel put back right into the middle-ages and not at the beginning of the 21st century.I really wonder what would happen, if a german producer would do a similar german movie about WWII ...Shame on that movie. Nationalism and patriotism are the main reasons besides racism and religious fanaticism for all the bad things in our world. And that movie doesn't help to make it a better place at all.I wonder, when we will ever see an accurate movie from Hollywood, that is talking about humanity and one world and that every party is making wrong decisions once in a while, instead of the USA as the center-point of the Universe and it's not existing superiority. Even movies like Private Ryan and Schindler's List are not accurate on a lot of stuff.That movie really disappointed me and made me sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a great film, this is a Hollywood cash-cow. Meant not to be historically accurate, but rather, simple, bloated entertainment. It's not as terrible as Titanic, but not too far off. How far has Hollywood sank when they package movies obviously targeted for teenage girls in such lavish wrapping? How unfortunate that there are still a few poor souls, who survived that horrific ordeal, alive to witness this disgusting portrayal which is destined to become it's legacy in the eyes of this young generation. Hmmm, I should say something nice...okay, good special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it's out on DVD, and I finally saw this mess. It is a 2 hour movie bloated out to 3 hours because someone told the director that all epics must run 3 hours, whether or not they need to. If this movie didn't have such a serious subject, I would have been laughing out loud at its utter badness. I knew I was in for trouble when the movie names a Tennessee farmboy Rafe (yeah right) and the island of Hawaii contains not one native islander, especially before it was officially a state. The first third of the movie is totally out of place, directed more in tone with slapstick flicks like "1941" and "Biloxi Blues."The love triangle is so poorly handled, the writers of soap operas would be ashamed. The infamous raid sequence is technically excellent, but it is shot so poorly you barely tell what's what, and it's been disgracefully cleaned up to a PG-13 rating. Men are hit with huge caliber bullets designed to rip apart planes and they just fall down. I also rolled my eyes at the American moron yelling about World War II is starting, when it's been going on in the rest of the world for years. By the time the final act, Doolittle's Raid over Tokyo kicks in, you stopped caring. This movie is a travesty.Oh, and if you think that not liking this junk means I'm not patriotic, you can kiss the four stripes on my sleeve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the worst movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After months of hype, the most highly anticipated movie of the year has finally arrived, and guess what, its a BOMB. Not just a bomb but a giant stink bomb to be more precise. I don't think I've ever been so disappointed with a summer movie. Sure there have been much worse movies made, but never one with a trailer that actually put chills down my back. As I left the theatre I could not help but ask myself what I (or the public) had ever done to Jerry Bruckhiemer that made him feel it necessary to inflict such a god-awful piece of crap upon us. I've always liked Bruckhiemer movies, even the ones others didn't. I don't recall ever being let down by one of his films (I even liked Gone In 60 Seconds and Coyote Ugly), they were hokey fun and I excepted them as such. But with Pearl Harbor, Bruckhiemer and director Michael Bay (Who I also use to worship) have entered new ground: the historical war film. Well, new to them anyway. Unfortunately, they thought they were still making their standard action films and didn't realize that when making war films you have to worry about things like realism and historical accuracy. So Pearl Harbor ended up being just another drawn out, flag waving, Hollywoodized flick that glamorizes war to no end. The plot, if you can call it that, centers around two childhood friends (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) who fall in love with the same woman (Kate Beckinsale) during World War II. Yes, that's right it's a love story too. And just about the lamest, unromantic love story I've ever seen. Most of this problem comes care of Bay, who is absolutely amazing at shooting action sequences, but doesn't know jack s**t about creating attraction or chemistry between two characters. Every time Affleck and Beckinsale have a romantic moment it is followed immediately with slapstick humor. Whether Affleck's shooting a cork in his eye or falling 20 feet from the side of a boat, the filmmakers obviously thought that our attention span was so short, that we could only handle 2-3 lines of dialog before we got board and needed a laugh. Which brings us to the attack. After 90 minutes of imitation love story, we finally get a chance to see something blow up. And stuff does blow up, quite nicely too, but since you have been board for the last hour and a half and don't care about the characters, all the blowing up has very little impact. However, it is the most entertaining part of the film and the 40 minutes go by very quickly. If the film had ended here I would have given it 3 stars and considered it OK. But the filmmakers could not have ended with the Americans losing, no, that would have been a downer, and remember this is a feel-good war. So, it drags on for another hour showing Doolittle's pointless raid over Tokyo and turning it in to massive victory for the Americans. Never have I seen so much flag waving, this thing is even more pro-America than The Patriot. I mean, there's national pride and then there's propaganda. Oh, I forgot to mention how cheesy the whole movie is. It's overflowing with cheese. They use every trick in the book to make the audience feel like they are watching something important. A ship cook earns respect, a soldier is reunited with his lost dog and drowning soldiers stop swimming for their lives so they can cheer when a Japanese plane is shot down. But the cheesiest moment of all, perhaps in all of movie history, comes when Jon Voight (playing the wheelchair-bound FDR) is told that a raid on Tokyo can't be done, and rises up out of his chair to shout "IT CAN BE DONE!!!!!!!". I couldn't help but crack up in the theatre. I could probably think of more things wrong with Pearl Harbor but you are probably tired of reading this long review. Just do you self a favor and spend your money on somewhere else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very moving having watched it post 9/11</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that I did not get caught in the hype and watch this movie in the theater. It was Memorial day weekend, and I knew what Michael Bay movies can be like, overly patriotic and melodramatic to the point of cheeziness at times. I was a fan of the more historical though sometimes dry adaption known as Tora, Tora, Tora and was afraid of what kind of abuses might be committed against the memory of one the the most tragic events in United States history. Skip to 9/11/2001 our new date to live in infamy. The Historical event of Pearl Harbor is now sadly joined/surpassed by the Attacks in New York, Washington, and the Anthrax scare. Thousands of innocent Americans lay dead in a tomb that still smokes 80 days later and like our fellow Americans entombed at Pearl Harbor, many will probably never be recovered. Now the release of Pearl Harbor on DVD and VHS is upon us as well as the 60th anniversary of the Attack on Pearl Harbor. The few veterans who are alive from that day, have lived to see yet another surprise attack on America. Their story as told in books, documentaries, and even Pearl Harbor the Movie can now inspire new generations of Americans who have been connected together as one nation, a sleeping giant yet again awakened. This movie is very patriotic and I was moved in many parts. The battle scenes are intense. John Voight's portrayal of FDR is stunning. The whole movie including Dewey's raid, that many said was unnecessary, has new meaning, post 9/11, showing America's true spirit of refusing to give up under impossible odds and the possibility of death. This is the spirit of the brave men and women of the Armed Forces past and present, This is the spirit of the Firefighters, Police, and Civilians caught up in 9/11, This is spirit of all Americans. Remember Pearl Harbor, Remember September 11th so that their sacrifices will not have been in vain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is exceptionally impressive with fantastical special effects. It is made much better than famous Titanic and superior to it in every sense. The plot is complex, it encompass long period including the story of main characters, beginning of the World War II in Europe, thorough preparations of Japan to attack on the USA, the bombing of Pearl Harbor itself and American reaction. I wasn't feeling bored or tired through three hours of the movie. War sequences (especially battles in the air) are stunning. To my surprise, relationships between heroes didn't irritate me as in the case of Titanic. They were quite believable and by no means stupid. I became rather anxious about destinies of the heroes. The cast is good. No one is outstanding, but all of them are adequate and pleasant. Direction is masterful. The atmosphere of the movie is patriotic and life-asserting without being unreasonable. The authors don't accuse Japanese of cunning attack or anything, and show the history as it was. Of course, there is not a single word about Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It's only natural, for that nuclear attack was not a military but political action ? show-off, aiming to frighten Soviet Union. Creators of the film preferred not to allude to the shameful fact, and I absolutely agree with them. They made an excellent epic war movie which entertains and thrills the viewer (and doesn't lose good taste or good sense at the same time). Shortly, the film is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though Ben Affleck is a fine actor, Michael Bay is good director, and Randall Wallace is a great screenwriter, none of them should have been involved with a movie like this. Ben Affleck is better in comedies than he is in dramas so having him as one of the main characters didn't work for me. Michael Bay, as hard as he tries, just can't direct a war movie, and Randall Wallace's screenplay focuses more on romance than Pearl Harbor itself. Since he also wrote BRAVEHEART I was expecting a really heavy war movie, but what I got was a boring romance-drama that goes on for over three hours with a few war sequences. While this movie was successful at the box office, I don't think will have the same following as Randall Wallace's BRAVEHEART did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The blockbuster disaster movie dumbed down. -Yes, exactly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I liked especially was not the attack on Pearl Harbour but the Battle of Britain footage - confusing, as one would expect from Michael Bay, but it at least made aerial combat look three-dimensional, in a way I'd never seen it look before.But of course nobody involved in this film cared in the least little bit about the Battle of Britain. "We need it for the plot, we might as well show it..." - the attitude was obvious and it made the footage lifeless. Everything preceding the attack on Pearl Harbour was just killing time. Well, I'd heard as much in advance.Imagine my surprise when it turned out that the Pearl Harbour attack was just as lifeless, and had just as much the quality of killing time, as everything that had gone before. What's more, it seemed to last just as long. Why were we watching bodies and things then more bodies and more things being blown to bits, again and again - for well over half an hour? More than once I wondered what was going on. Not once does the camera pull far enough away from the digital pyrotechnics to show us how much damage the Japanese were doing, how they were doing it, what they were doing it to, etc.And that's the whole film in a nutshell. It tells us NOTHING. You could watch the movie from beginning to end and not realise, for instance, that Japan was ALREADY at war when the story opened. It had invaded China and declared war on Britain (and all British colonies and members of the British Commonwealth). The US could reasonably hope to stay neutral, perhaps, but "peace in the Pacific", which a few characters talked about, was past praying for.(There's a curious attitude to the Japanese here. Obviously, they are the villain, because they WERE the villain - but we're never told why. When we see actual Japanese people they look like brass monuments only recently granted the gifts of speech and movement, joyless in victory and they never saying anything that isn't in the form of a sententious proverb. I see this as a conciliatory gesture towards the modern Japanese, although not a very subtle one.)Such things as why Japan wanted a war at all, or what they wanted OUT of war (not the same thing), or how they planned the attack and what they meant to do next, or for that matter what ANY nation was doing, are given the briefest mention, if any. I know that this film isn't about military strategy, and it isn't about politics. Fair enough. But what IS it about? Surely not about how the war effects individuals. The Ben Affleck has an almighty military raid fall directly on his head and it makes the barest perceptible dent in his self-absorbed resentment; he is exactly the same after Pearl Harbour as before. So is everyone else, for that matter (excluding those who die). When we watch the raid, does the camera linger in one place long enough for us to get a glimpse of any kind of personal reaction? Never! Maybe once or twice in the hospital, but to compensate the cutting is even more frenetic there than it is outside. Unless you can weave it into a personal story or a political one, the attack on Pearl Harbour is completely devoid of drama. The Japanese come, they bomb, they leave.So the ENTIRE FILM becomes a kind of a music video montage - pretty shot after pretty shot, Hans Zimmer's score indulging in a kind of pompous mourning over the top of them all, paying no attention to whether the people on screen are kissing or chatting or arguing or killing one another. Even the conversations between characters are montages. Listen closely. The people in this film don't respond to one another, they navigate from one posture to the next.Ultimately the attack is over. Michael Bay makes one desperate attempt to turn his collage of cinematic calendar shots into an actual film, by tacking on a phoney "resolution". We see a raid on Tokyo (a raid that looks suspiciously like a pointless act of revenge, since nobody can clearly explain what it's meant to achieve). Bay wanted a triumph at the end, however contrived - had the war not ended with something as chilling as atomic bombs falling on populated cities, I believe Bay would have fast-forwarded to 1945. The raid is the occasion of some of the most mindless jingoism I've ever seen. The Russians mastered the art of producing propaganda that seemed to have an effect on its intended audience even though it made no sense; "Pearl Harbour" can't compete with that kind of thing, but the glowing eulogies at the end come dangerously close to collapsing into gibberish.SPOILER FOLLOWS...I must also register a protest about that display of competitive heroism on mainland China. No doubt the pilots were brave, but their actions struck me as being of dubious legality. First, they surrender; then, because they don't like the manner in which they're being made prisoners - admittedly with reason - they shoot their captors. They would themselves have been shot had their captors not believed them when they announced that they were laying down arms. The pilot's actions are difficult to admire, even if the scene was too ludicrous and choppy to have a moral viewpoint.he scene was too ludicrous and choppy to have a moral viewpoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with low expectations as to how much I would enjoy it. I'm not a war buff, or an American, and my knowledge of the factual events behind this story is pretty limited. Not to mention the fact that I am not normally a fan of Bruckheimer's overhyped action pics that are usually loaded with big budget effects and a low budget screenplay.Imagine my surprise when three plus hours flew by and I found myself walking out of the theatre having thoroughly enjoyed the movie.The character development, while not flawless, was well done. As a viewer, you grow to care, not only about the three leads, but about several supporting characters as well. Admittedly, I cared enough about Rafe, Danny and Evelyn to shed a few tears during the emotional climax scenes.The comparisons to Saving Private Ryan are inevitable. However it is impossible to fairly compare this movie to the Academy Award winning spectacle that was Saving Private Ryan. Pearl Harbour never pretended to be anything more than a big budget summer blockbuster film - this much is evident from any of the trailers that were being shown before its theatrical release. Saving Private Ryan was a film steeped in realism. It was a graphic recreation of the horrors of D-Day on the beaches and a piece of cinematic genius (even though it doesn't rank on my list of favourite films).To compare these 2 films is to compare apples and oranges. Perhaps a more adequate comparison would be to liken it to another tale of love and romance set against the backdrop of a historical tragedy - Titanic. While the film falls drastically short of the mark here too, it is far more similar to this film than to the aforementioned SPR. Anyone who went in to this movie expecting to see the events of the attack on Pearl Harbour with a Saving Private Ryan edge, was bound to be heartily disappointed.Taken on its own merits, Pearl Harbour stands up quite nicely. It adequately represents and recreates the events surrounding December 7, 1941 while giving the movie a greater range to allow it to appeal to a wider audience by adding the fictional story of friendship, love, betrayal and heartbreak. Granted it is flawed, and it is served with a large helping of Hollywood "cheese", but when was the last time a perfect picture made it to the big screen? They are few and far between. Check your history books at the door and go in expecting to be entertained by this 3 hour saga. To that end, Pearl Harbour succeeds. It is a thoroughly enjoyable summer blockbuster that should have something to appeal to everyone. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>From all the negative reviews about this film, I was expecting to be disappointed, although I am a history buff. The first half of the movie, as reported, was a love story, but a very interesting one in my humble opinion. Only one complaint though. Were there no plain nurses at Pearl Harbor? The special effects in the action scenes were very well done. I found myself bouncing around in my seat, trying to avoid the bullets. I also anticipated the movie ending after the Hawaii attack and found the sortee to Japan, an enjoyable bonus, rather than an unnecessary extension of the movie, as some others insisted. I also thought Jon Voigt did an excellent job as Roosevelt. This is a movie that I would quickly recommend. I really can't understand all the criticism.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is just about what I expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay are back from Armageddon fame to once again present to us another tremendous disaster story interspersed with some elaborate and manipulative romance. The film mainly follows the lives of two life long friends, Rafe and Danny, as they grow up obviously meant to be fighter pilots, and the struggles with their friendship brought on by World War II. At least half of the film is made up of this drawn out love story, while the other half covers the Japanese invasion and bombing of Pearl Harbor. This is the reason the movie is so damn long, too. If they had left out this dumbass romance, or at least not drawn it out so much, we would have had a war movie of normal length that would have been much better. The editing between the love story and the actual war coverage is surprisingly awkward and abrupt, initially leaving us with the feeling that we are watching two completely separate movies that were edited together.The actual bombing of Pearl Harbor is spectacularly done, I have to admit that. The Japanese were obviously made to look much more evil than they were, because this is told from the American point of view, but the special effects and the torpedoes and the entire battle scene at Pearl Harbor was amazing. Cuba Gooding Jr. has a tiny tiny role as the black man who is not allowed to do anything more than cook during his entire time in the Navy, and who ultimately is able to man a gun during the battle and make a difference. This is a noticeable digression in the same vein as the over-simplified African American presence seen in Mel Gibson's The Patriot. It makes you think that Pearl Harbor was made by a bunch of rich white guys who, at the last minute, decided that they better put a black guy in the movie so they wouldn't get in trouble with the NAACP. Nonetheless, Cuba pulled off his overly small role very well, despite the fact that he was only given enough screen time to shoot down one Japanese plane, and that plane almost flew right into him as it crashed.As with any Bruckheimer film, especially The Rock or Armageddon, with which he also collaborated with director Michael Bay, the entire humanistic portion of the film was shallow and predictable. We get three main cardboard characters, Rafe, Danny, and Evelyn, and a relationship between the three that is entirely predictable. Nonetheless, some people may pretend not to know that, so here is the obligatory warning ? SPOILERS AHEAD. Rafe supposedly gets killed in combat (he would never have survived a crash-landing into the water like that, but this is Bruckheimer, so we know he didn't really die), and of course, Danny moves in on his girl. Did anyone really think that Ben Affleck would be killed that early in the film? So Danny goes for Evelyn with the ridiculous support of all of Rafe's friends (this is another thing that would never have happened in real life), and then when everything seems to be going okay, Rafe comes back and everything gets mixed up again. Yawn. As the all-seeing audience, we know that Danny had no right to move in on his friend's girlfriend so soon after his theoretical death, so this is the point when we begin to suspect that Danny will be the one to ultimately be killed in combat, and in true Bruckheimer form, it will probably be in a heroic effort to save Rafe's life. And guess what. There are obvious references to the story structure of Titanic here as well as some scenes that are photographed and composed exactly like some of the battle scenes from Saving Private Ryan, but the film is obviously just trying to cash in on the success of those films. On a quality level, Pearl Harbor and Titanic are about the same, but neither even come close to the tremendous power of a real war film like Saving Private Ryan. I found myself several times thinking of Saving Private Ryan while I was watching Pearl Harbor, and the two movies are so different in their intentions (Saving Private Ryan showed us the war, while Pearl Harbor tried to make us cry by showing how a few people were affected by the war) that it almost seemed like I was watching a cartoon. This is why Pearl Harbor will never be considered a classic war film and will not be considered for an Oscar nod in any category.Bruckheimer and Bay make movies that are meant to please large audiences by entertaining them without making them think. This is why their movies are such box office hits but also such critical failures. There are always a lot of people who don't see how shallow these films are. For the most part, the action sequences are fast paced and actually pretty good, but they are NEVER realistic, which is probably one of the main reasons that a war film, made by these manipulative Hollywood bigshots, about such a closely scrutinized historical event just didn't come out right. The bombing of Pearl Harbor was obviously the best scene in the film, but was not realistic at all. It was, in fact, about as realistic as a fight scene in a Jet Li movie or a Jackie Chan movie. Fun to watch, but once you walk out of the theater and back into reality, you want to laugh. It's a shame that this scene in Pearl Harbor was padded with two and a half hours of fluff, because it could have been a significant part of a good war film. What a waste.</fullReview>

It also gives us an understanding of how it is like to be under a threat of a single nation.... The story that was written by Randall Wallace is amazing, knowing the fact that it is not an easy task, I think Randall Wallace has made a great success ever since he wrote the story of Braveheart. Other than that Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer made an excellent team in making this movie a huge success. I was surprised to see the user rating so low, I don't know why some people did not find it that good. Furthermore I like to say that, the movie had a great combination between Titanic and Top Gun, this resembles the ships sinking and the soldiers drowning. The Top Gun resemblence is revealed by the planes and the atmosphere of air battles.</fullReview>

I'm a emotional man and I think love and war matched perfectly in this "Pearl Perfect Harbor" From point of wiew the second best movie made so far in 2001, placed after the Norwegian film "Elling" with "Tomb Raider" placed in 3rd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things I found offensive about this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1. Producers exploiting actual tragic, historical event to make money2. This tragic event being used as backround scenery for a dumb, fabricated plot which serves to glorify vapid romantic lusts in the minds of our teens (when two of the lead characters started "making love" amid billowing parachutes, my 20 year-old son said, "what in the world??")3. Shocking apathy regarding the historical facts 4. Shocking, inaccurate stereotypes, such as the "ditzy", "easy" nurses6. Ben Affleck's fame. How did he get to be a leading man?I could go on, but I have wasted enough time on this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so I know that most little twelve year old kids would like to see big explosions and people dying but what really p****s me off is responsible adults approving of this this GARBAGE! In the add it says in one line "watch stuff blow up"! STUFF did not "blow up" American patriots died! Not stufF! Men with families, children, brothers, sisters, they died for their country, to describe them as "stuff blowing up" is the most offensive bull**** EVER! Also, in one scene the Japanese are calling this Japanese American Citizen to describe the conditions in pearl harbor this scene was probably added by those racist white supremisist to justify the fact that LOYAL JAPANESE AMERICANS WERE THROWN INTO PRISON CAMPS AND HAD THEIR RELIGIOUS FIGURES TAKEN away. I would conitnue on and on about the flaws of the movie IE the fact that the attack on tokyo wasn't a turning point in the war and the fact that only TWO people shot down Japanese planes during pearl harbor but I've gotta make my ramen. -Remorse P.S.

		<shortDescription>Too long.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an extremely long movie. I agree with some of the comments that this movie could definitely have been shortened. I really enjoyed the last two hours. The action scenes were terrific and intensive. I could imagine myself in these scenes of destruction, completely at the hands of God- whether you survived or not was mostly to do with luck. The first hour however was unneccesary. The film has to constantly switch between the romance story to the war story. The love story was very sentimental and corny. Surely, this could have been developed alot more quickly. But overall, I found the movie thought provoking and I left the cinema feeling as though I had learnt something about the war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good history lesson !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to write a short review from a Germans point of view. First of all I would like to say: " I like this movie !". The reason for that is very easy to explain. Pearl Harbour gives us in Europe informations on World War II in the US. That's why I choose the Headline "A good history lesson". Everything I learned in school in Germany is about what happened in Europe and how cruel it has been for all the people. We never learned something about the activities in the US. We know that the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour in a very perfidious way, but that was it. It was very easy to follow the story and the 2nd part of the story the relationship between Rafe, Danny and Evelyn the destinies linked to them entertains the people on the one side and shows them how cruel and uncertain this time must be for the people all over the world.All in all It was a fantastic movie which entertains me and taught me very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does exactly what it says on the tin!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now the film may not be a pearl, but its certainly not as bad as anyone you know may have said. Pearl Harbor does exactly what it promises and lives up to its potential as a blockbuster. The action is of course spectacular and the characters likeable, even if a few are somewhat under used, the script itself though is just adequate padding setting up the situations into which the characters are placed. It is as expected the script which makes the picture's edges look just a little frayed. The convoluted love story is a little over the top and unnecessarily complex but all the other situations are handled well enough. The cheesy lines are few and far between, which was unexpected, and there is surprisingly little jingoistic fervour which comes as a refreshing change to a non-American, even the Japanese are portrayed as human beings. It is in this area which the film rises above the potential pratfalls it faced, elevating it too good film status. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, it was a lot better than I was expecting and it is this that may be the key to the enjoyment of the film, don't expect too much and just enjoy a film that does exactly what it sets out to do. Entertain you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Episode One: Quite literally the Phantom Menace, except gathering storm clouds are replaced by charming if a little cliched war-located love strands. Beckinsale is striking whilst Affleck and Hartnett cope well as the male leads. Of course, it's the centre section which is the titular attack and it's well worth waiting for. Some might say that the love story set-up drags for the first hour, but a 60 minute extravaganza of destruction makes up for it. Forget Independence Day, this is real! The final segment of the film tells us about America's retaliatory efforts and paves the way for the obligatory bittersweet weepy ending complete with wailing soundtrack by Faith Hill.

		<shortDescription>Please don't believe the critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why there are so many bad reviews for this movie is absoloutely baffling. What I have just got back from watching was an incredibly tender, poignant and brilliantly acted film. I simply can't comprehend the critics. Were we watching completely different movies? Was the UK release dramatically different from the US? I doubt it very much. So why do people refuse to give this movie the respect it deserves?So what if a few liberties were taken with the actual facts of Pearl Harbor? That's the movie world for you. They're not out to educate people on the finer points of war; if you want that, take a History degree. The film was made to entertain, to inform to a certain point, and to commemorate those who died during this awful tragedy, and on those three levels it scores highly.Pearl Harbor may not rank up there with the classics, even though it would be a lie to say that it doesn't want to. It has it's flaws; the dialogue is incredibly corny throughout, Ewan Bremmner's pilot with a stutter is in bad taste, and the three main characters aren't really given enough material to develop on. But if you can look past that, and look into the beautiful love story unfolding with a war horror story, you'll see something truely magical. The three leads are all perfectly cast; Kate Beckinsale is both beautiful and believeable as the woman at the centre of the love triangle, with best friends Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett competing for her love.Likewise, Ben Affleck gives another great performance as the headstrong, loyal Rafe. He's got both the looks and the acting ability to propell him into A-list status that he's long deserved.But the real find here is Josh Hartnett. Heart-stoppingly beautiful, and an amazing actor, especially considering his age and past film history, he really captures the emotion as sensitive Danny. Pearl Harbor deserves much more praise than it's getting. If you think about all the hard work and effort that's gone into it, there's no excuse for not giving it a mark at least over six. It was never going to live up to the hype the media created for it, and there was bound to be a backlash as soon as it was released. But if people for once ignore the critics and skeptics, and go to see this with the same expectations you'd go to see a less-hyped film, I garuntee you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, if you are brain-dead, this is the summer movie for you! Just read all the other comments! It had love, drama, action, patriotism etc....Riiight...Please wake up, America, for once, and try not succumb to being spoon-fed the same old, no-brainer, trite Hollywood cheese.... There is so very much wrong with this "summer blockbuster" that it is difficult to find a place to begin. First, the love story, as lots of people pointed out, was so contrived it was almost embarassing. And how about our lovable stutterer that 'we can all laugh at'? Uh, I didn't find that funny at all, and I imagine one who has struggled with stuttering as a disability didn't either. How about FDR and his standing up from his wheelchair to illustrate the strength of the American people? Textbook Hollywood cheese....And Alec Baldwin as Doolittle? Are there any other fellow fans of SNL out there that had trouble sitting through Alec Baldwin play this goofy role with a straight face?! I felt like I was watching Frank Drebbin in the Naked Gun...However the most disturbing aspect of this entire film, by far, was the sad and skewed "USA is #1!!" message throughout....Notice the ominous music used when the evil Japanese are shown onscreen...Or maybe the fact that the whole point of Pearl Harbor was that it was an attack sustained by the USA, and the USA, well, was defeated in it....but no, no, we can't portray the USA as NOT being #1, so we will follow our boy heroes as they shoot down a couple of planes during the attack to end the bombing sequence. Wow, it's like we weren't REALLY defeated! I mean look, our lovable Rafe and Danny survived and got 'em back in the skies! ....and even better, we of course can't possibly end this film on a USA is NOT #1 note (i.e., finishing it at the end of the attack), so we have to add in the Dolittle Tokyo bombing--aka, USA as the underdogs, with only a few planes, fighting the big bad Japanese empire and succeeding in one small way....Why don't we get a BIT more honest here and show the REAL revenge for Pearl Harbor, with the massive destruction and loss of 100,000 lives (as opposed to 7,000) in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Why? Uh oh, because then the USA would be portrayed as being the REALLY bad guys, having desimated cities and killed 10 times the number of people. Remember, the USA is #1 and can do no wrong!And if the you didn't manage to pick up on some of this propaganda, or it was all too subtle for you, it is all pretty much summed up in the little narration about how great and strong America is, at the end of this movie....I felt like I was sitting through Independence Day all over again, where America saved the world from an alien invasion! Unbelievable!Please, pick up a book instead if watching this movie, and prove to Hollywood that, as a country, we demand a little more intelligence and depth from our "summer blockbusters" and will not put up with this empty formulaic filmmaking!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the oh so popular Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons, will comment on this movie= Worst Movie Ever! Please, PLEASE don't read any of the positive reviews and think that there is anything worth while in this movie. There has been no greater tragedy in American History then this abomination of a film that Super Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and MTV lackey Michael Bay brought us. The Rock, Top Gun and Armeggedon, all of which Mr. Bruckheimer was responsible for are fun, flashy films that have neat characters and very little plot. Good guys are put through tough times, they win, everyone is happy! Yay! Now lets take a look at Pearl Harbor. This movie breaks up like this: A sleazy 90 minute love triangle which has no value, and makes Titanic look like Shakespeare in Love. Next, we have a fairly inaccurate account of the Pearl Harbor bombing, fresh with some fiction thrown in to make our leads look heroic. The bombing sequence is very neatly shown on film, but its not a fun experience to watch tons of American men get slaughtered by the "Evil Japanese". (In reality, Admiral Yamamoto had sent word of the attack thirty minutes prior to the Japanese planes arrival over the base. The film never touches on the fact that the Japanese Samurai Code, which was still strictly enforced, does not allow you to attack a "sleeping foe", instead, it makes you at least wake them up and get their sword before you can fight them. It would have been a nice touch to try and paint both sides as human, as many of the Japanese Pilots later felt that they had dishonered their empire by killing sleeping sailors). Then, after we are forced to watch people being blown up (and its not like Thin Red Line or Saving Private Ryan, all its in the film for is to accentuate Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett's hero status), the third act of the film begins. We are now treated to a lead up of the April 19th Tokyo Raid by James Doolittle. We are forced to stay an hour too long in the movie as the heroes valiantly bomb Tokyo (which in reality did nothing for the war effort) and then fight it out over China. Then, just when you think you can leave, Kate Beckinsale gives a narration telling us that after the Doolittle Raid, we had struck fear into the Japanese and we would go on to win the war from that point. Last time I checked my history books, after Doolittle's raid, they sent their entire Carrier Fleet at us towards Midway, and we destroyed their Navy their! Plus, all those men who fought on Pelilieu and Okinawa and Burma and Gaudal, nope, they did nothing Mr. Bay and Bruckheimer. Its almost as if they realized that no one would understand what they had just seen, so they had to make sure we thought it was important.This film is truly terrible, in the fact that it fails at making a love story seem okay, it fails to shed any importance on Pearl Harbor, and it fails to even conclude itself well. I felt sick to my stomach knowing that this would be what teenagers and younger people have to learn about World War II from, and that undoubtedly, this film will be a money making juggernaut. Rent Tora! Tora! Tora!, Midway, and a Thin Red Line if you want to see some modern films on the Pacific. Or you can check out a little film called From Here to Eternity. Either way, don't see this film!PLEASE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really worried about going to see this movie because I was hearing some really bad things about but I decided to put aside three hours of my time and ventured off to see Pearl Harbor. And I am so glad that I did. I absolutely loved this movie. I thought the acting was great, the story superb, and the special effects were phenomenal. To me, it didn't feel like a three hour movie because I was enjoying it so much. I loved Ben Affleck, anyone who's a fan should definatly see it. Josh Hartnett proved himself to be a great actor since I've only seen him in 2 movies. Kate Beckinsale was wonderful too, and she looked absolutely beautiful. I really loved the way that they intertwined a love story into the film instead of just blowing things up. Although, that was great too. Anyways, great movie, 9 out of ten (lost a mark because I hated Alec Baldwin's character) go see it. Even if you don't like it, it's 3 hours of gawking at Ben and Josh, 2 really hot guys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film. It is a combination of a fictional love story and historical events and people. Dorie Miller (real sailor) is wonderfully portrayed by Cuba Gooding Jr. while Alec Baldwin does a decent job as Rafe's (Afleck) Commander (fictional character). The real impact of the film, I believe, is probably felt by those who were there during the attack. Living in Hawaii, I have been fortunate enough to meet some of these veterans and hear their stories at the Arizona Memorial. My only question after viewing this film is, "Why no dedication to the sailors, soldiers, and nurses who fought, died and survived this battle?" It would've probably been appreciated and seems like a simple token that should've been included. After all, Disney is cashing in on what happened to them and the horror that they saw. Final verdict three out of four stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grand miscalculation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be easier to overlook the historical errors, the poor dialog, the spotty acting, and the overly glossy direction of Michael Bay were it not for the most glaring flaw of all. That being the script that makes the whole thing revolve around a pointless love triangle. With so much going on, the last thing on earth you will care about while watching this are the three main characters and their love for one another! The script touches on many interesting aspects of the earliest days for the United States in WWII, and one wishes we'd learn more about some of them. How about an entire film about the Doolittle raid? That whole sequence is thrown together so hastily in the final half hour that you almost want to shout, "Okay, hold on! Who is Jimmy Doolittle? How did he put this thing together so quickly?" But even this sequence is polluted with elements of the love triangle. I'm sure Kate Beckinsale would have been allowed close enough to listen in to the radio chatter during the raid. Of course she would! More could have been learned about the Japanese and their motives for the attack. Especially with Mako playing their commander. He was always an engaging actor, and you'll want to see more of him. The film has a lot of decent actors (Voight, Seizemore, Baldwin) who you'd much rather see and listen too than Affleck and Hartnett. Come on Jerry Bruckheimer! You're a smart producer and clearly the man in charge on this set. Couldn't you see that the southern accent only made Affleck's acting seem worse? Wasn't there anyone there to doctor up some of the hilarious dialog in Randy Wallace's script? Or did they assume the semi-literate multiplex PG-13 audiences that pay to see Bay's films wouldn't care?Pearl Harbor made a little money, but was far from the hit they obviously intended. The success of Titanic a few years earlier had to lead the the story being constructed in such a manner. But what a miscalculation thinking the two tragedies had anything in common. Ben Affleck's career has since waned after even more poor films. Josh Hartnett's also stalled after this film. Bay continues to churn out PG-13 commercial slime that often does make money. But thankfully his efforts now don't try to re-write and gloss over actual history. Now he is free to make movies about cars that turn into robots and throw punches at each other. He's much more qualified for that kind of thing. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie and still watch it for its combat footage.kiwihazelnut (a nut she admits) says "Continuing with Doolittle's raid, it did NOT turn the tide for the Americans. It was not a military victory, and little in Tokyo was affected. It only served as propaganda to help the US citizens on the homefront (also, Doolittle's Raid was long after Pearl Harbor and not a revenge mission)." She is wrong on all counts.I assert it was a success, it was excellent revenge, energizing the fervor on the home front was key to winning hearts and minds, and the negative affect on Japan's morale was enormous. It would take the Battle of Midway to strategically change the course of the war, but from a US morale perspective the raid was vital. Bless you General Doolittle.muertos says "There was none of the stupid garbage with slick fighter jocks dogfighting Japanese Zeros."I say BS, there was dogfighting by a pair of pilots that day who did fight back, and the movie did represent the defeat very well with graphically burned, drowned and dead service members.And to answer SteveThomp from Australia, I don't know why Australians don't like patriotism but we damn sure do here in the USA.As for unbelievable Hollywood shots, Tora Tora Tora and Midway also had numerous video clips which were news reel shots from Hickham (copied from Tora) supposedly happening on Midway. This is where using real clips from the war can't keep up with the reality of the event. So how much better was Tora at being accurate?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, they're heroes....WE GET IT! But...Rafe?????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2 June 2001Before I start complaining, I will say I didn't think it was a waste of time or money. I was entertained, though not "moved," and staring at Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett for three hours was not at all difficult! Josh Hartnett was new to me, and I think he did a great job in this film. But, this movie had some serious writing flaws. First of all, they broke a major rule in writing, "Show, don't tell." If one more character broke into a speech about what heroes and all-around good guys these people were, I would have run screaming from the theater. I KNOW they're heroes, I want to see them BE heroes, I don't want a bunch of other characters TELLING me they are heroes. Good grief. Another flaw in writing was to give the main character the soap opera name of "Rafe." Now, if there really WAS a Rafe McCawley who was a fighter pilot in this war, then I will take this back. But, assuming it is just an attempt to make Ben Affleck's character more of a "larger than life" hero, it was a poor choice. It was distracting, melodramatic, and unbelievable. They should have just named him Ben. Or, if they want a good macho-yet-normal-type name, how about...Pete Mitchell? After all, they took enough other points of this story from "Top Gun." About 15 or 20 minutes into the movie, there is a scene that had me biting my tongue so I wouldn't yell out "MAAAVVERICK!!!" And Alec Baldwin played Doolittle as if he had studied for the part by watching Tom Skerritt in "Top Gun." Some of his "these guys are heroes" speeches were the hardest to sit through without snickering. I was really hoping he would have instead broken into his "I AM God" speech from "Malice." Another writing weak point was the development of Kate Beckinsale's character. I liked her Evelyn much better than her "Emma," but Evelyn was a cliché. You could hear the writers saying, "Okay, we have lots of pretty girls in this movie, but we need to show that Evelyn is a cut above the rest. Hmmmm...." and so they use all the usual tricks, making her speak in a more cultivated voice, not making her boy-crazy, and making her be the only one who knew how to take any initiative under crisis. Roger Ebert has already given a good critique of her cheesy speeches, so I'll leave that out. Cuba Gooding, Jr., had a good role but again, too many speeches on heroism, and not enough screen time in general. Much like "Armageddon," the special effects were wonderful but the writing wasn't given nearly enough effort or attention. The ending is predictably convenient, or conveniently predictable. Take your pick.To summarize, although the acting was decent enough, the writing was not. I felt detached emotionally from the whole film, and sat there looking around the theater at other women my age who were crying, and I was quite surprised and a bit disappointed. I think if the movie HAD been more realistic and based on historical fact, it would have moved me a lot more, just like the real stories of the Titanic disaster affect me much more than "Jack and Rose" did. Instead of reflecting on the tragedy of the real Pearl Harbor, I found myself wishing I was sitting between Crow and Tom Servo from "MST3K." We'd have a great time picking on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good in spots, but mostly bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's my take on this movie. First, it was just too long! The editor should hang his head in shame. Some of the acting was good, but a lot more was either mediocre or bad. Ben Affleck should study some movies like "Sergeant York" and "Glory" to learn how to use facial expressions to effect. Also, Alex Baldwin's portrayal of Jimmy Doolittle is just laughable. Read J.H.D.'s autobiography "I Could Never Be So Lucky Again" to get a true portrait of this remarkable American. The best acting in the movie is Cuba Gooding Jr.'s and Jon Voight's. While the scenes showing the Japanese preparations were probably pretty accurate, and the attack and it's aftermath were great, it should have ended there. The rest of the movie was totally BOGUS. I don't insist on 100% historical accuracy, but I hate it when a major part of the plot is historical fabrication. The USAAF would never transfer fighter pilots directly to a bomber squadron like the movie showed. Especially not for a mission where they were attempting something that had never been done. I also think that the whole love triangle subplot was just a device to get women to see it, and the movie would've been better without it. Now, I want to answer some of the other comments I've seen here. First, it is well documented that Admiral Yamamoto was opposed to war with the U.S. Here's a quotation from him I found on Wikipedia: "Should hostilities once break out between Japan and the United States, it is not enough that we take Guam and the Philippines, nor even Hawaii and San Francisco. We would have to march into Washington and sign the treaty in the White House. I wonder if our politicians (who speak so lightly of a Japanese-American war) have confidence as to the outcome and are prepared to make the necessary sacrifices." He KNEW Japan would never win. The "sleeping giant" line at the end of the movie is also a direct quotation. Also, the scene showing the Japanese pilot waving to the boys playing baseball to warn them away is one of the few things in the movie that IS 100% historically accurate. One more thing, in 1941 FDR's health hadn't deteriorated too badly, and he was still able to rise to his feet unassisted, which is something he would have insisted on doing in public. So, watch the first 2/3 of the movie and the very end, and it's not so bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>should be burned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the worst movies of all time. We are lead to believe that two fighter pilot buddies happen to reunite in Hawaii the night before Pearl Harbor. Before that they were on Long Island, New York together before one goes off to England to fight the Germans. Then, somehow, he gets transferred back to the USAAC from the RAF in the middle of World War Two to go to Hawaii to be ready for the Japanese attack. yeah, right. All of those ships the Japanese destroyed in the attack look suspiciously modern, too. I don't think the US Navy had Aegis class guided missile destroyers in 1941. Yet, those are what the movie shows getting sunk. Then, the final coupe de grace, and if this is giving away the ending, it doesn't really matter since the movie doesn't really matter(as a piece of film, it should be burned/ as a piece of cinematographic art is should be placed in a trash can and as a reflection of history it doesn't even shine a dim light of truth) the fighter pilot from England and Long Island leads the first bomber raid on Tokyo. This would've been bad war propaganda in 1942 and is even worse as "history" in 2002. Every actor in this film should have their credits changed to "anonymous" and the directors, producers, and writers banned for producing banal tripe. It sucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than it is given credit for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having heard the negative publicity that this film had received, I set out to watch Pearl Harbor in order to experience the special effects - I was expecting little more in the way of entertainment. The film was a very pleasant surprise - much, much better than I had expected. Sure the Pearl Harbour battle scene, which lasts the best part of an hour, is absolutely incredible and worthy of recognition by the Academy or the Golden Globes for sound, or effects, or cinematography or whatever! Home Cinema absolutely essential mind you. I would strongly recommend that viewers watch the 45 minute documentary "Making of Pearl Harbour" on the second disc as this opens one's eyes to the fantastic achievement that the making of this movie represents.In spite of the fact that the film lasts over 3 hours it never seemed to drag and was a very enjoyable experience. Certainly the two main characters (played by Affleck and Hartnett) are a bit like Batman and Robin as they strive to defeat the entire Japanese Empire with a little help from a few friends but, as you will find from the documentary, their actions were someone's actions - it's just that a lot of people's heroics have been rolled into two characters. The love story sub-plot involving our two heroes plus Beckinsale is somewhat unlikely (but not impossible) but adds to the film by allowing watchers to become more emotionally involved with the plight of the characters.In my view the movie's emphasis on viewing the lead up to, attack on, and aftermath of Pearl Harbor through the characters leads to a more satisfying cinematic experience overall than, say, Tora! Tora! Tora! which is an historically more accurate but, due to its more documentary nature, less emotionally involving.In conclusion, I would recommend this film. If you set out to accept the movie at face value as the lives and tribulations of a number of characters set against a back drop of Pearl Harbour you will not be disappointed. And as I say the battle scenes are phenomenal!! PS: Jon Voight as the president is very, very convincing and deserves special mention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is the so-called epic by Michael Bay following the true events that occurred on December 7th, 1941 in Hawaii. Instead of being an amazing epic film, this just fails on almost every level. Capt. Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Capt. Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) have been friends since boyhood and are both in the US Airforce. Rafe has a girl(Kate Beckinsale) and is a fine pilot. Danny is his best friend but the two are separated when Rafe is shipped off to Germany. They don't hear from Rafe but from the War Department saying he has been killed in action. Without having any sympathy for a plot or for Kate Beckinsale, Danny moves rite in and puts the moves on her. The whole group is in Hawaii having the time of their lives when Rafe returns from Germany saying that he survived the crash. Then fights break out and somehow Danny and Rafe drive off the base and into the mountains. Next day, bombs are blowing up everywhere and soldiers are being slaughtered on the decks of their ships. Japanese have launched their offensive and an hour-long battle occurs which just gets boring after awhile. Somehow Rafe and Danny are able to get planes off the ground and drive away the bombers alone.From here, what little story there is goes into the Pacific but I won't waste the unbelievable story. The only excitement in this is about the first twenty minutes of Pearl Harbor. Affleck and Hartnett equally suck as their southern farm boy soldier characters. Cuba Gooding Jr. is totally wasted in a supporting actor job. The film is way too long, extending 2 hours and 40 mins. the acting is bad and it seemed every line Alec Baldwin said was suppose to be defiant and stunning. Guess what. They weren't!There is about an 1 1/2 hour of dialog and boring crap of Hartnett and Beckinsale making out and Affleck breaking down into tears over and over again. The visual effects are good and the Japanese actors aren't bad, but if you want to see a good Pearl Harbor film, I recommend Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970)Pearl Harbor. Starring: Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale, Tom Sizemore, Alec Baldwin, Cuba Gooding Jr., and Jon Voight.1 1/2 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be short and honest. I watched this film only for it's war scenes. With no doubt this scenes were excellent. But oh! To see these scenes I had to suffer watching all the crap around. Love theme, romance theme, blah, blah... If I have wanted to see some soap, I would have gone to see something else, not a historical war movie! To make things worse, filmmakers showed me all hollywoodish clichés. For example when I saw the acrobatic orgies of the two pilots at the beginning, I said for myself "we will see this again" - and guess what...And now the promised little spoiler: Everything is OK, the dog survived!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this wasn't meant to be based on the horrid attack on Pearl Harbor, I'd give it a substandard rating. But, it was, and it totally ruined the attack for me. Granted that I wasn't around in 1941, and neither were my parents, I still know the gist of what happened. This movie was absolutely horrible. Yes, I will admit that I cried a little the first time I saw it, it was still horrible. It does not realistically portray the events. It's a sappy love story in the midst of a great war. LAME! What are the possibilities that while the war is going on, a love triangle forms, and they don't seem to care, or even notice, what is going on around them? It's unrealistic, crappy, cliché, and just... bad. I would not recommend it to anyone. There are so many better movies out there that actually follow the war at least a little bit. Don't waste your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was on in the evening of New Year's Day, so as a way to kill 4:00hrs of your life it fulfills its function. Dr. Zhivago (1965) was on at the same time, and I kept switching to it to get more believable dialogue. And Dr. Zhivago is one painfully long, Harlequin Romance of a movie.They try to follow so many characters in this movie, and switch between them so often, it is hard to get any continuity, or develop any sympathetic feelings for the characters. Despite this being set during a major historical event, this approach left me not really caring what would happen to the characters. There is little required anticipation, as what will next happen to the characters is basically the most formulaic and dramatic thing you can think of:** SPOILERS - plot and dialogue ** Geez, I wonder if the pretty nurse who ISN'T Kate Beckinsale will die during the attack? Sounds predictable and dramatic, yep that's what happens in the movie. Geez, I wonder if the Kate Beckinsale pretty nurse will get between the two leading men? Of course. Geez, wouldn't it be ridiculously predictable and dramatic if pretty nurse Kate was pregnant, and wouldn't it be even more dramatic if these fighter pilots became bomber pilots, and then went on Doolittle's raid on Tokyo (not one of the other Japanese cities) and then the unborn child's father is killed but the other leading man in the end being with pretty nurse Kate? Oh, and what if the daddy-to-be doesn't even KNOW she's pregnant? Now you're getting the hang of it!I can't exactly remember the dialogue, but I believe there are lines such as: "My heart aches for you", "Whenever I see a sunset I'll think of you", etc. and any memorable lines Roosevelt ever delivered relating to the historical incidents are in the movie too of course. As a rule, a few minutes of chatter are interspersed between the "dramatic speech" or "dramatic scene" by someone as there appears to be some need to have a really, really dramatic or CGI-filled or heart-rending scene every 5 minutes or so throughout the entire movie. It's like watching a musical in that regard, which I honestly don't like either. Add camera angle changes every 5 seconds, going off-focus and you have yourself one expensive, 3hour music video.This film was manufactured to be what it is -- like a toaster oven, a dishwasher or a wheelbarrow. So long as there is adequate profit made by the corporations involved, such films will continue to be written, produced and edited. Because films like this are made by committee, and nobody takes ownership and so long as they're getting paid nobody gives a dang.I give this 1/10, because I can't rate it 0/10 using the drop-down menu.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this movie hit cinema screens I have to admit I bought into the bright trailers and expensive camera angles. However when I visited the cinema to view Ben Afleck and co I realized the extent to what this film is pure mucus. The plot weaves between poor acting and even worst story lines. I can say confidently a goose could of better handled the seemingly limitless budget this film had. Camera's on bombs, CGI sequences all clouded the fact that the realism of the events was minimal. In all the big explosions it is only regretful that Ben Afleck didn't get singed. His performance was ridged as ever but some of the blame must be shifted to the embarrassingly awful love story. The leading female had fell in love so many times that by the films conclusion you didn't care who she stayed with, it was either pretty boy one or two, both equaling each other in stupid acts of heroism. The horror of war was over shadowed by the demonstration of cash. Films such as Saving Private Ryan pay tribute to the devastating effects of war, however in Pearl Habour all that seemed to happen is a few people fell in love. Salmon Salmon Salmon. I only wish the big directors in Hollywood would consider what they are doing rather than just chucking bundles of cash around the studio. Of all the war movies I have ever witnessed I think this is the only one that makes me wish I was being bombed. Perhaps this is a declaration of American pride in blowing up the Japanese who were by all accounts already out of the war, the bombing of Pearl Habour is grossly over sized as a massive attack on American soil. Get real. The odds appear to be stacked against the American's throughout the whole film which is frankly a bag of beetles. My advise to anyone who plans on watching Pearl Habour is to take a bath in gravy...it'd be more fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I saw it once...and will probably never see it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Warning: Spoilers**When I saw the first trailer for Pearl Harbor back in late 2000, I thought that it looked damn cool, and it would be one of the movies that I planned to see in the summer of 2001. But, for some reason (I forget exactly why), I never saw it when it was out in theatres. I also never bothered to rent it when it came out on Video/DVD. I guess this is due in part to many of my friends saying it was a bad movie, although a few did say they liked it. I swore that one of these days I would see Pearl Harbor, and decide for myself whether it deserved all of its negative/positive reviews. Now, three years after it was released I caught it on cable TV while flipping through the channels. And what did I think of it? Pearl Harbor sacrifices strong character development for special effects, and becomes a movie that is at best average.Let me start off by talking about the high points of the movie, the battle scenes. The computer animated fighter planes were well done, and seeing waves of Japanese Zero fighters flying over Pearl Harbor was just plain cool. The attack on Pearl Harbor, as depicted by the movie, is chock full of explosions, guns ablazing, and well-choreographed dogfights. It's the only sequence in the movie that held my attention for any length of time, but I would expect no less from a director like Michael Bay. His resume of movies makes him well suited to vividly rendering tremendous scenes of carnage. Yet, at the same time as I thought how cool the special effects were, I realized that this was a weakness too.The battle scenes in this movie, specifically the Pearl Harbor attack, are not something that should make us say "Yo! That's so cool how the Arizona blew up!" These battle scenes should make us focus on how horrible the attack was, and it hindsight, the attack on Pearl Harbor in this movie looked more like a scene from Independence Day, but replaces the alien and jet fighters with World War II era craft. The American planes unrealistically fly only a few feet above the ground, while strafing the Japanese fighters. I couldn't help but feel that this was dishonoring the memory of those who died in the attack.The characters seemed more like a second thought in this movie, taking a back seat to the battle scenes. The dialogue was often very corny, and the acting itself was pretty stilted on the whole. I've lost count as to how many times Capt. Rafe McCawley (played by Ben Affleck) tells Nurse Evelyn Johnson (played by Kate Beckinsale) she's so beautiful. One would think she would get the point after the first five times. Their romance (and her eventual romance to Josh Harnett's character) looks too forced, as if they are supposed to fall in love simply to advance the plot and nothing else. This movie also, prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, attempts to sledgehammer the point that you are supposed to feel sorry for all the soldiers and civilians. They show tons of scenes of giggling young women, happy-go-lucky men having a beer, and several cheap love scenes. What I don't think director Michael Bay realizes is that since we know about the tragedy to come, there is no need to take such a heavy-handed and redundant approach. Bay appears to think otherwise, and has to constantly reinforce the idea that "you must feel sorry for these people."Lastly, there are a couple scenes in Pearl Harbor that I have to talk about. The first is the scene during the attack when Capt. Danny Walker (Josh Harnett's character) radios that "I think World War II just started." When he said that my eyebrows were drawn together, and my hands clenched into a fist. World War II did not start at Pearl Harbor! Countries like Britain, France, and Canada were fighting the Nazis, and the Chinese were fighting the Japanese before Pearl Harbor happened.The second scene would be during the Jimmy Doolittle raid on a Japanese industrial area. One thing that I (and other critics) noticed was that there were very few Japanese civilians that could be seen in the area. And once the bombs dropped, we saw buildings being blown up, but no screaming Japanese civilians. This is probably because the filmmakers did not want to put too much of a damper on the movie, by making the audience realize that Americans bombed civilians too.I will admit that I did feel a LITTLE sadness when everybody thought Affleck's character died in Europe, and when Harnett's character died at the end. Other than that, Pearl Harbor the movie is entirely forgettable. My recommendation is that if you want to see a war movie with great drama (and no cheesy love story), coupled with great action scenes, go see Saving Private Ryan (1998). If you want to see a more historically accurate depiction of the Pearl Harbor attack that has little cheesy dialogue, and shows what happened on both sides, go see Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970). Tora! Tora! Tora! has special effects that still hold up even today despite its age, and in my opinion, is a much better film than this 21st century Pearl Harbor movie.I give Pearl Harbor movie a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is easily the most long winded, pompous, and self serving piece of crap I have ever had the misfortune to see. Hollywood has got a formula for movies like this, and it's so predictable and hackneyed, it makes you want to get up and scream the rest of the plot to other people watching with you. The bombing of Pearl Harbor was done terribly, and I think it was stupid to focus on a couple of yahoos who did nothing more than shoot down the tiniest fraction of a fraction of a massive attacking air fleet. The Japanese were also done terribly in this film, being portrayed as intensely remorseful and afraid of what they did to America. Only one man of import in Japan thought this: Yamamoto. And guess what: he mostly ignored these thoughts. The rest of Japan was ecstatic, becoming doubtful only after around Midway. The Doolittle raid was blown way out of proportion: It was NOTHING. In fact, it was almost laughable to see these men risk their lives and important military hardware to strike fear in the heart of...you guessed it, no one. In the end, Hollywood needs to stop making movies about Pearl Harbor. It's been done to death, and never done very well, mostly because it's depressing and there's nothing uplifting about it, which is what WWII movies invariably have to be. To solve that, Hollywood throws in a bunch of sappy love interests and "poor little soldier boy" stories. What the hell, they may as well have had every man who died in the movie say, "Two more weeks, and I'm retiring to Montana to be a farmer." It might have been more effective. Big thumbs down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatness sometimes falters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How far should sentiment go? 'Pearl Harbour' is the proof that it can go too far. Michael Bay's epic should have been great, it had all the right elements to propel into majesty of cinema but unfortunately it faltered. It is in short, too damn long! Full to the brim with unnecessary plot development that tried to make you care for the characters. It is a classic example of sentiment getting in the way, like 'Titanic' the film covers a moment in history that is so full of real life heroes who stories would have better been told instead of creating fictional one dimensional people. From the opening scene, I found my self wishing for access to the fast forward button. It took too long to build up the rivalry between, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett and also to introduce the love interest in Kate Beckinsale. There is no believability in their characters and I found this whole section of the plot pointless. At 3 hours long I found the film 2 hours too long. The first hour leading up to the attack I found pointless, the attack it's self was stunning and well executed. But the part of the film that for me ruined it, were the Doolittle raids on Tokyo. There was no need for this to even be in this film. If it had ended once the presidents had made his address after the sacking of Pearl Harbour then I think personally that this film would be worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important historical event, worthless movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It amazes me that Michael Bay could have so much money to make a movie about one of the most important days in American history and produce such a weak effort. I looked forward to this film, having a personal interest ingrained from stories my father related from his experiences that day. Fortunately, he survived the attack, too bad this movie survived. If you want to see a convoluted love story, its there, but as a historical piece it is sorely lacking. And for all those who were moved by the love triangle, I have this to say; if my best friend was MIA or killed in wartime, I certainly would not jump into bed with his girl. If you did not experience this emotion you were played. As to the historical, this movie was a joke. The depiction of the Doolittle raid had the planes, in formation, dropping their bombs on Tokyo when they actually flew individually, not wasting fuel to form up after takeoff. See "30 Seconds Over Tokyo" to see this event more true to life and as a good example of a Hollywood depiction of history.. In the attack scenes Bay had a large gap between the rows of Battleships off Ford Island and the Japanese planes flew between them. He may have thought this added intimacy but was ridiculously unnecessary. The ships were moored right next to each other, making this scene impossible. He could easily have shot realistic scenes of historically correct individual attacks that would have packed more dramatic punch. He used computer generated effects but dropped the ball on simple shots. And he wanted to make such heroes of Affleck and Hartnett that he insults our intelligence. Japan lost 29 airplanes during the attack and the director has them accounting for 7 or 8 of them, several during a laughable chase between buildings ending in a game of chicken. Maybe the scene where Tom Sizemore shots planes from the tower was used to make the chicken game only the 2nd worst air combat scene in this movie. If this were Star Wars or Independence Day it would be okay, they're fantasies; a skilled director would find a way to make a believable yet dramatic depiction of such an important piece of history. I guess it was easier for Bay to copy bad Sci-Fi, or Spielbergs underwater shootings(right after a unique shot of torpedoes passing under men in the water). I could go on forever, but I'll refrain. Basically this movie is a sappy love story with as bad a take on real history as any Custers' last stand film ever produced. Michael Bay had an opportunity to make a truly significant film and he gave us trash instead. The good news to filmmakers is that the attack on Pearl Harbor has yet to be made into a great film. Spielberg, are you listening?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I would like to say that I'm not going to talk about the truckload of historical errors in Pearl Harbor but instead talk about the movie for what it is.I've managed to avoid Pearl Harbor ever since it premiered, and it was never a movie I planned on watching, but when it aired on tv the other day my curiosity got the better of me. I have to admit that I had a really hard time hindering myself from switching channels. During some of the more unbareable moments of the movie (and there's lots of them!) I caught myself wishing that everyone who participated in this movie should be banned from acting ever again. Adding to the turkey-esque feeling of the movie is that fact that just about every cliché known to the movie industry is fired off at some point during the movie. Everything from the unlikely black guy hero (Cuba Gooding Jr.) to the amazingly sluggish and painfully sentimental love story to the run-off-the-mill war heroes (i.e. Affleck, Hartnett - which by all accounts manages to look handsome in uniform - but are about as interesting as a complicated tax return). Just about the only thing they got right was the prolonged battle sequence at the end which no doubt looked spectacular, but that alone is not enough by a longshot to save this movie from the abyss of cheesyness. It's simply nothing more than a bad script, bad acting and bad dialogue trying to look good by a budget that could feed a third world nation.I'm not the first one to say this, but if you want to see a good movie about the Pearl Harbor attack, watch "Tora! Tora! Tora!" and do yourself a favour: try real hard to avoid this garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Could a movie be any more idiotic than this? Michael Bay uses Hitler's tactics in his movie making: "Always go for the lowest common denominator". Of course making movies like that will always bring him huge profits, since most people are deeply stupid, but he will never get the respect of the eclectic ones.The direction is the usual intolerable Michael Bay direction. 90% closeups, slo-mo in every "important scene" and continuous fast cuts. Did I mention the close ups?The screenplay makes George Lucas seem like Paul Schrader. It is probably Michael Bay's impression that movies are being watched by a bunch of people who are occasionally looking at the screen, while eating pop-corn and talking to their friends at the same time. I am not going to go into details, but this script contains the line: "I'm gonna give Danny my whole heart, but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset, without thinking of you".Of course Michael Bay is PC, since this is a big production and he needs the money of the African-American population, so a black cook rises above the oppression and becomes a hero in a most pretentious scene.The usual anti-everything-not-American theme didn't bother me much, except for the triumphant(?!) ending. As I said, Bay goes for the idiots.The 'Titanic' "references" are great though. They emphasize how shamelessly talentless Michael Bay is. I liked that.Compared to this movie, 'Top Gun' looks like 'Citizen Kane'.0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was in the top 5 for the worst movies i've ever seen. Fortunately I viewed it on a borrowed DVD because had I viewed it at a movie theater, I would've walked out and demanded my money back. You'd of thought from the movie "Midway" that they would've learned to omit a love story. Can you imagine a movie like "Saving Private Ryan" if they inserted a love story? What a hero that Ben Afleck is single handedly taking on the Germans and Japanese. First he's a fighter pilot then switches to bombers. He was there for it all. The Battle of Britain, Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle Raid. Did he drop the bomb on Hiroshima too?I wasn't even impressed with the special effects. The attack looked like they were attacking the "Death Star" from Star Wars. So much was omitted like when there's a brief shot that was stuck in the storyline where Yamamoto says "I fear all we've done is awaken a sleeping giant" made no sense in this movie as to why he said it and why it was just stuck in as filler. If you want to watch a historically accurate movie about the attack on "Pearl Harbor" which had more realistic special effects, watch Tora, Tora, Tora and you'll even see at the end Yamamoto saying "I fear all we've done is awaken a sleeping giant....." and you'll know exactly why he said it.</fullReview>

Everybody at school said that the entire thing was about a love story, and I'm not into that stuff. I finally rented it on video when it came out, and I was shocked to find out that it was mostly action. The love scenes acually were not that bad, and the movie leading up to the attack on Pearl was not boring. After the attack, it was still exciting. I like how the movie ended. All of the actors gave their best preformances. I even cried a couple times during this movie (and I'm not much of a crying type of person). I've never cried at a movie before.

		<fullReview>As the music fades, and the screen blackens, one can hardly help but sigh. The movie was good; it was darn good. Everything about it. The acting, directing, music, and the incredible CG were wonderfully combined to form last summer's blockbuster Pearl Harbor. Upon reading reviews of this film, it is hard not to notice the terrible blasts it has been receiving from seemingly heartless movie critics and viewers. They complain and complain about it, when they fail to see what it truly is: a tale of "the end of innocence... and the dawn of America's greatest glory." What better way to show this, than with a love story, which is what Pearl Harbor is above all. It is a love story involving three characters, and how the unthinkable at Pearl Harbor shaped their lives, as well as the lives of Americans. Its purpose was not to perfectly document the events that occurred on that fateful day in December 1941, but rather to show in a way that only Hollywood can, the sights, feelings, and agony that there must have been on that day; and to show younger generations an era in which men and women were so willing to put their country above themselves. Pearl Harbor successfully captures the brutality of war, and the courage of the men and women who fought it. It is an epic tale of love and war, and a time when heroes would rise and fall; but America would prevail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was actually even worse than I had expected. The dialogue is trite and unoriginal, the characters very sketchy and the central romance is not credible. Kate Beckinsale is a very capable actress so its a shame to see her waste away in this film which is trying so hard to be like Titanic. It doesn't justify the amount of money spent on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was absolutely abysmal. I wish somebody told me when the half hour of action was about to take place, so I could have taken timed naps. Better yet, I wish I had just not wasted any time on this overblown, overhyped, overcasted, and overacted drivel. The plot of the surrounding characters was so formulaic I actually got the image of monkeys sitting at typewriters. All of the hype lead me to believe that this was going to be next in the line with Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now, and Saving Private Ryan. How wrong, how terribly terribly wrong! The action was pretty good, but it could not nearly justify spending two hours sitting through the pointless Titanicesque junk. I'm not sure which fell asleep first - me or my butt. Save yourself some time and just go rent Saving Private Ryan again - that had a great story, good acting, and superb effects. I always wonder why Matt Damon wasn't in this movie besides Ben Affleck - I guess he knows which war movies to make and which to skip.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't deny this film was overhyped and ridiculously compared to Titanic. They were both love stories with a historical disaster as a backdrop but the similarities end there. Pearl Harbor's story was less straightfoward and the characters weren't as well-developed as Titanic's. You don't see the love developing and growing in Pearl Harbor. However, the acting was decent enough to make you care about the characters. No one was miscast. Although Ben Affleck's Tennesee accent was overdone, he was able to convey Rafe's emotions very well. Jon Voight and Alec Baldwin were exceptional, though I don't see why Doolittle knew they were gonna win the war through Rafe and Danny. Plus, the historical aspects were woven smoothly into the main plot. The humor was also well-done, especially the opening scene. The opening foreshadowed how funny the rest of the movie was gonna be.For those of you who say the Japanese were depicted poorly, they weren't supposed to be developed. They were only supposed to be there for the sake of being there. For those of you who criticize the PG-13 rating, fear not. The DVD is gonna have all the rated-R stuff that Disney made Bay cut out. So when you turn on your VCR/DVD player to play this, kick your feet up one more notch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"War", as someone once trilled "What is it good for?" Well huge summer blockbuster, apparently. At least, that's what scourge of the arthouse crowd and best bud of the muiltplex mob, Jerry Brunkheimer, was betting when he decided to plough $135 million of Disney's money into Pearl Harbor. A risky proposition when you realise that it's not only a story about the invincible American military being caught with its pants down-climaxing in an ending that everybody knows-but has a cast, that while not by any means likely to turn down Lily Savage's Blankety Blank in a hurry, are certainly no guarantee of financial success. The question, then, is have Brunkheimer and his buddy Michael Bay (Armageddon) pulled it off? The answer is that, as usual, the Brunkheimer brand has delivered an almost dead-cert hit. Whilst a bit on the anoexic side in the dramatic weight department, it's a natural born blockbuster that ratchets the action bar up dozens of notches and represents the final coming of the age of CGI. Quite simply, you have never seen anything like it. Story-wise we're somewhere between Rolf Harris' Two Little Boys and Tora! Tora! Tora!, with best pals flying aces Affleck and Hartnett rowing over the affections of Kate Beckinsale, after she accidentally f***s the latter when the former is supposed to have been shot over Europe. Not Bay's determination to shoot everything by what appears to be a permanent sunset (and a pleasing sense of humour from Affeck vanishes far too quickly.) Bay's pre-war America looks like it emerged from a beer ad-little boys soapbox Sopwiths, while real-life biplanes zoom over amber waves of grains; trains rumble into stations in slo-mo amid billiowing clouds of steam; lovers curl in each others arms and say stuff like, "Do you think the war will ever reach us?" (for $135 million it'd better, baby!) But it is the bombing itself that always what this movie was going to live and die on, and here Bay really delivers, from an astonishing first 'bomb's eye view' shot that sees the camera follow a falling munition through the decks of the USS Arizona. Then comes perfectly timed detonation, using fantastically detailed long shots of hundreds of Japanease Zeroes buzzing around the exploding fleet. It's an amazing, visceral experience. ILM's CGI is, for the first time, indistinguishable from reailty. Torpedoes hiss under the thrashes feet of drowning soliders, men are blown through upturned ship's propellers towards the camera, and fighting plough into each other . It's an astounding, nerve-shredding experience that leaves the mealy-mouthed whining about flatpacked characterisation bobbing in the wreakage. And amongst the cliches, there's even a dog in the middle of the carnage.TEN OUT OF TEN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In garish detail and stunning investigative probing, PEARL HARBOR digs deep below the surface of the gasoline embargoes and jingoistic fomenting and reveals exactly what this WWII conflict was all about - the love triangle between three young American Models.You see, Ben loves Kate. And Kate loves Ben. But Ben's best friend, Josh, also likes Kate. And there's a war with Germany or something happening. Ben is a hot pilot, and reports to somewhere overseas that is Not America for hot dogfights that make his biceps thrum with the need to hold Kate.Ben is shot down and reported Missing In Action back in the United States, a land where every waking hour is spent looking to get laid (if you were a nurse like Kate) or looking to get laid (if you were a flyboy like Josh). So when Ben is reported missing, Kate cannot face the next five long days wondering if she will ever get laid again, so she falls in love with Josh.Now Josh loves Kate. And Kate loves Josh. But Ben comes back. And he hits Josh for falling in love with Kate. Then they have a beer. And then the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor. The end.Don't even want to go into the real politics behind that Day of Infamy, December 7, 1941, when the Japanese launched a surprise attack that wasn't really a surprise on the American Pacific Fleet anchored at Pearl Harbor, on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. God knows, director Michael Bay doesn't.Remember, if it weren't for those young models in love, none of this woulda happened. Written with emotive overkill by Randall Wallace (BRAVEHEART, 1996, THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK, 1998), HARBOR reminds us of TITANIC (1997), where the insufferable love story sucked all the oxygen out of the movie until James Cameron redeemed himself with that magnificent CGI boat-tipping.Discounting the three-way pap between Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale, PEARL HARBOR's redeeming war scenes are cinematography gone insane. Spielberg never took to the air in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998) - he still holds the crown for best ground skirmishes - it takes Michael Bay's sweeping cranes to now claim the crown for best air battles: Affleck gets to fly a Spitfire, the coolest fighter plane ever, in rampaging dogfights that put us so square in his hot pilot's combat seat that we can feel the sweat puddling on the backs of our patriotic thighs.The scenes of the stealth Japanese planes flying low over American farmers and people out enjoying the world, thinking the war was in some other country, look surreal enough now - imagine how it must have looked in 1941. The thunderous grumble of amassed Zero engines splitting the rural morning, each plane loaded with one bomb each, tilting low over fields and schools, under American radar, Bay's characteristic American Blond Kids in slow motion below them.The Pearl Harbor attack is launched with a tracking shot of a bomb loosed from a Japanese plane down to the USS Arizona, silently falling, then exploding and actually undulating the ship like a steel snake spasming. From there, the incredible realism of old school battle is more exhilarating than walking in on Kate Beckinsale sandwiched between Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett.Bay and cinematographer John Schwartzman have such a knack for creating iconic images that even whilst we cringe at the melodramatic slomo and hero framing of certain scenes, they wring a tear as well with their beautifully evocative composition. The art overshadows the story.Cuba Gooding Jr. fires a big deck gun. Tom Sizemore runs around his airfield and swears. Jon Voight shucks off his Republican idiocy to play Democratic president, FDR with great empathy. Obvious that Bay believes HARBOR to be his MIDWAY (that 1976 war epic with A-Listers piled on A-Listers: Heston, Fonda, Coburn, Mitchum, Mifune, Wagner...), as he populates his film with numerous "names" in smaller roles: Alec Baldwin, Jennifer Garner, Mako, Colm Feore, Dan Aykroyd, Ewen Bremner...Beckinsale - ever the female double standard bearer - asks boxer, Cuba Gooding Jr., "So why do you have to fight with your fists to get respect?" completely forgetting that her own boyfriend is gunning down strangers in planes to keep her respect, with his big Spitfire-shaped penis.Kate tells Josh as he's going off to war, "I love you and I'll be here waiting for you when you come back." Of course, that's provided you don't go MIA and my thigh twitch compels me to turn to the Next Best Thing...Cuba looked pretty hot on that big gun...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is not only a terrible movie because it's just so terribly done, but because it leaves you feeling sick. I actually felt woozy after watching this film, i am not kidding. The music is so over the top it makes you feel like you're drowning in syrup, the characters are so undeveloped and underused that you don't care about them, and so the spectacle of the film feels hollow. And as for all of the sailors on the battleships who were blown apart, shot apart, and drowned, this movie doesn't show them at all until the attack comes, so when we actually see them dying, we don't really feel much. And the special effects actually aren't as good as they should be. The whole movie is a massive Titanic wannabe about an event that took twice as many lives yet has almost no emotional connection once the actual attack comes. And all those historical inaccuracies. Be respectful to the victims for god sakes. After seeing this i had to watch Schindler's List to remind myself that it is possible to make great movies. So to sum it up Titanic-James Cameron-James Horner+Michael Bay+ Hans Zimmer + Randall Wallace- any amount of talent= Pearl Harbor. Its as bad as they say it is.</fullReview>

The plane were loaded in San Francisco, after training in Utah, and the fleet did not stop at Hawaii to have contact with nurses. The fleet did encounter some Jap fishing ships near their coast, which resulted in a longer flight over the Pacific Ocean. Several planes did did land or crash land in China, and some of the crew were captured. During the first part of the attack on Hawaii, the Generals were playing Sunday golf, as my Uncle was part of the group. On the Jap side the date was the 8th, not the 7th.

All wares are terrible, bad tactics causes lost in lives and suffering. American romanticizing of a terrible war.

		<fullReview>The first thing that comes to mind when I think about this film is the length. The film is over 3 hours long, well it definitely feels like it. Pearl Harbor for no apparent reason rambles on for about an hour too long, had it been shorter, it may have been more of a success.Michael Bay is a very good action director, he has produced some rollicking action thrillers in the past, one thought this would be of the same genre, but it isn't. Pearl Harbor is a romantic film with bits of action added in.I thought the first hour of the film was decent, a nice love story developing and the prospect of a big battle occurring. The love story developed into a very sour love triangle which I totally disliked, the battle scenes were spectacular but repetitive. By the end of the Japanese invasion the film had lost all of its gloss, it would have taken a miracle to resurrect the film from thereon. That miracle never happened and the film fizzled out quite disappointingly.There is so much over-acting in this film it is unbelievable. Ben Affleck is too eager to show his acting credentials and so fails miserably, Kate Beckinsale may have allowed the big film pressure to get to her otherwise she may have put up a less shy performance. Josh Hartnett's character may not have been ideal for him, he did act like a real sissy at times. The only real plusses in the acting department come from Jon Voight as the American president and Alec Baldwin (can't remember the character's name).The soundtrack to this film is probably the best part about it, Pearl Harbor has a beautiful score, I thoroughly enjoy listening to it even now.Overall the film is very average, with some spectacular but repetitive action sequences. Do watch Pearl Harbor when you can, but be sure that you have a good 4 hours to spare, because after toilet and snack breaks, that is exactly how long it will take.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you type in "pearl harbour" into your Internet search engine, the two likely results will be: 1 - an event during WWII when the Japanese attacked the US Navy - causing thousands of casualties.. or 2 - a pointless love storyI'm not a historian - so lets concentrate on number 2 for now. Let me start by saying I have only seen this film once at the cinema when it first came out so my memory may be a little hazy.. I was genuinely excited about seeing the film - and although glorifying war is not right, I was looking forward to some good special effects and action scenes. The first half an hour or so was very good, when the Japanese were attacking it was edge of seat stuff - great drama. But then something happened, maybe someone lost the script? Maybe the dog ate it..but the rest of the film was a complete mess.The cast is led the ever-terrible Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and the amazingly beautiful Kate Beckinsale. In a nutshell, Affleck and Hartnett (who play good friends in the film) compete in a tug of war over Kate Beckinsale (who wouldn't) - Ur, and thats it...nothing much else happened...its almost like it cant decide what it wants to be, either be a war drama or a love story, it starts off being one thing and turns into another.Add a soundtrack more cheesy than a pack of Edam - and you have one of the worst "blockbusters" of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's "harbour" actually</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry Bruckheimer's latest large film - tipping ships over sideways, elevating Ben Affleck to Big Chin Leading Man, and not being as rude to the Japanese as perhaps one might have expected. Apart from the end bit.December 7 1941 is a fairly important date in American history. The Japanese launched a surprise attack on the entire US fleet as it lay at anchor (read 'parked up') in Pearl Harbor, in the Hawaiian islands. As a result, President Roosevelt brought the USA into the war, and that was more or less that, according to people who aren't British. And that's 'harbour', anyway.Our story follows two friends, Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker, as they grow up obsessed with planes and flying, and then the war comes and they get drafted as cooks. No, wait? Rafe ? Affleck ? falls in love with a nurse ? Kate Beckinsale ? and then gets shot down over France and disappears and Danny ? Josh Hartnett ? falls in love with her himself, and they end up naked in Pearl Harbor together. Phew. This takes about 4 days of screen time and you're wishing the Japanese would hurry up, when guess what? Yeah, Rafe turns up, not burnt or anything ? he was, like, hiding with the French for a year or something! Amazing! The same guy wrote this wrote Braveheart, so if you swallowed Willy Wallace speaking French and knocking up the Queen of England, this is nothing.So the love story comes to a head, and then the bombs start falling and the budget just triples, man. The critics hated the slush and okay'd the bangs, and some folks reviewing the DVD on Amazon obviously liked both and gave it 5 stars. This, in my opinion, would presumably make something like Runaway Bride into a work of immeasurable genius. What do they think is a BAD film?What is wrong with this film? Almost everything. Casting, plot, pacing, length, breadth, spelling... It's full of really off-putting cameos. Examples include boffin-typecast Dan Ackroyd as the Navy 'Intelligence' man who thinks something's up because 40 billion tons of dangerous shipping has gone off the radar. Yeah, we know. Why didn't you? One of the one million Baldwin boys ? the old one ? strolls around in Indiana Jones's leather jacket preening his hair-do and fingering his cheque as some horrible psychotic pilot person, who resurfaces to lead us into the most startlingly irrelevant ending I have seen since the 1999 European Cup Final. Almost as meaningless is Cuba Gooding's cameo, as a frustrated boxing cook who beats up honkies from other boats. You can imagine my profound shock when he turns Real Sailor and shoots down some Japanese plane attacking His Ship. Bring back Jeff Chandler and back projection if this is progress.The last hour is frankly unbelievable. The bacon sandwich dropped from my numbed fingers as the film resolutely refused to end. You see, after the Japanese go back to their ships ? (Navy radar people: 'Oh, There they are!') there's what seems to be an entire other movie stuck on the end. We haven't finished with Rafe and Josh and Kate and that stuff yet ? and not enough foreign people of dubious religious conviction have been sent to meet their particular maker of choice, obviously. 183 minutes is an awfully long time to spend watching people who you don't care about sort their problems out. Even if they do have guns.The love story is a bit silly, something akin to the Titanic romance, except longer and with quiffs, and the action scenes are interesting from a technical point of view but do not disturb like Ryan or rouse like Braveheart. The film looks like they didn't really care ? one of those times when the hype gets you into your seat and the producer runs to the bank before you can figure it out and ask for your money back. The best thing I can say about the whole thing is that at least it gives you the opportunity to re-tell the one about the half-black, half-Japanese bloke who every December 7 would attack Pearl Bailey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a perfect example of why big-budget Hollywood movies are total garbage.You'd think that the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor -- which resulted in the death of 2200+ soldiers/civilians -- would make for compelling drama. Apparently, Bruckheimer, Bay and Wallace didn't think that was dramatic enough.Bruckheimer: "We really need to punch-up the drama. The surprise attack, the appalling loss of life, the chaos and disorder... it's just not dramatic enough."Wallace: "Hey, I know! Let's add an insipid, and totally irrelevant, love triangle into the mix!"Bruckheimer: "Perfect! Now the attack on Pearl Harbor will have the *oomph* it needs!"This movie is a gigantic slap in the face to all the soldiers (Japanese and American) and civilians who lost their lives in this attack.

Instead comes this monstrosity, one of the worst war movies, or movies of any kind, I've ever seen. Not only does it take enormous license with the events at Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Britain and Jimmy Doolittle's raid on Tokyo, but the plot centers on a hackneyed love-triangle plot that was worn out even in the 1940s.

		<shortDescription>Butchering History For Profit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is apparently nothing in the march of the history of these United States that some flunkie in Hollywood will not co-opt, manipulate and then corrupt. The 2001 edition of Pearl Harbor is a classic example of throwing huge money at a project in the hope that some of it will stick.There is really only one way to view this movie and that is to see it in the Director's Cut: some very explicit profanity and some very gruesome gore is included in that version, and when combined with the magnificent portrayals of the nurses, led by Kate Beckinsale, it makes this extraordinary failure bearable to watch. Having been required to see it four times, for reviewing purposes, constitutes 'cruel and unusual punishment.' The film churns the true history of the country as if it was raw milk being prepared for butter.The script is a fraud. From conversations with men and women who were actually there, at Pearl Harbor, on that hideous day in 1941, I can say that the portrayals of the pilots as being 'goody two shoes' kinds of guys were wholly inappropriate. There's hardly a cigarette to be seen in the course of Pearl Harbor, when in fact seventy-five to eighty percent of those people who were depicted in this sham, were smokers.The way the director and the costumers "tart up" the nurses is despicable. They were Navy nurses, not saints, and not Brooklynite bimbo girls. Jamie King is great as the goofy runaway kid, Betty, and Kate Beckinsale is the only reason to see this movie more than once.She does, in fact, carry the whole plot line of the movie. The rest of it is little more than Hollywood-style historical butchery, for profit. In the time leading up to the December 7th attack, which covers almost all of 1941, there is not one indication of how fervent and widespread was the popular opposition to the "interventionist" views of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his kitchen cabinet, who are not even portrayed. The America First Committee, which organized huge rallies against having the United States get embroiled in the war between Germany and Great Britain, featured members as diverse as Gore Vidal and John F. Kennedy. Public sentiment was overwhelmingly against getting involved in the European war's bloodshed, and there were many leaders in the military who questioned giving the British any war materiel: not because they liked Adolph Hitler or Benito Mussolini, but precisely because they were watching the rise of Japanese militarism with growing alarm. Painting Franklin Delano Roosevelt as some kind of a secular political saint, in this movie, is another brutal re-rendering of the true history.Pearl Harbor is lauded for its "representations" of the aerial attack on the Pacific fleet. They are technically brilliant. One survivor of Pearl Harbor, who was a mere stripling youth of 18 and 1/2 on his first posting for the Army, told me that after seeing the movie he felt "dirty." He said the way the violence was glamorized amounted to a kind of pornographic treatment.He said that the panic and confusion of that day was barely touched on in the movie, and he felt cheated by the whole experience. After four complete viewings of this movie, so do I.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't care if a movie is 3 hours long, or if every little historical detail is not 100% accurate. I know the film makers were not making this movie for the sake of "pretty actors prancing around in a bogus movie." I know for a fact that Michael Bay set out to make a great film. He dropped out of this movie twice before getting what he wanted. While this movie is also around to bring in money, it was also meant to be good. Michael Bay was at his best in the director's chair. The visuals were fantastic. The cinematography was comparable to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, where bright colors are not so apparent. The dialog was not cheesy. Even though some story-telling elements are basic, it's all worded differently by the actors who do a great job. Ben Affleck is one of my new favorite actors. Over the years he's matured as a real serious actor. Josh Hartnet has still got it too. Kate Beckinsale did a nice job too, and it's hard to believe that she was difficult to work with in this movie. Even though it was a small role, it was nice to see Dan Aykroyd. (Did I spell it right?) He had something of a serious presentation with the few lines he had, and made his extended cameo more noticable than it normally would be. Alec Baldwin was also a good touch to the movie. I only wish to see him more as a leading man than a suporting man. The special effects looked very real. I could not tell what was computer animation and what was real. This was especially effective during the big moment of the movie. The seemingly 40 minute battle sequence at Pearl Harbor was one of the most intense sequences in any movie. This scene alone is worth the whole movie. It has been a long time since I held tightly to the seat, pushed against the cushions, and had to catch my breath when the scene was over. Plus it wasn't glorified to a stupid level. The sequence didn't make it look like the Americans won. But it did show how they were able to take a stand as best they could during the horrible battle. They at least lost while giving the Japanese everything they got. Another great touch was how old WWII footage would be shown, and how the movie was filmed within it. And how it would fade from old film to new film in between scenes. This movie was critically panned simply because people got their hopes up WAY too high. A movie shouldn't fail because of this. It seems like people would like movies better if they weren't so ready for "the best thing in the world." PEARL HARBOR isn't the best, but it's one of the best of 2001.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have to say that Pearl Harbor is more a love story than a war movie. I noticed some have harped about the historical value of the movie but hey even the stars touted it as being a love story in all the pre-movie interviews. I suppose if you want to watch a War movie you might be disappointed...go rent Blackhawk Down. The atmosphere of this love story reminded me of the good old fashioned romance/war movies. I thought the acting was good and I did feel the chemistry in the love triangle. The parachute hanger scene alone is worth watching the movie for. I loved the actors, the acting, the love storyline, music, and special effects. Overall it is a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best written and acted movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay so when Pearl Harbor came out I wasn't all that excited to see Ben Affleck in yet another movie. But after almost 6 months after it was released into the movie theatre I broke down and decided to see this movie in a dollar theatre (which I might add that the place was packed with people). I fell in love with this movie. It seemed so real to the events that took place, though it was brilliantly censored to the actual happenings of Pearl Harbor. But it was so factual and so close to the way things were like back then. From the way the people acted, to what they were thinking, to the clothes they wore, to the actual events that took place. The only event the movie didn't really emphasize on was that WWII actually was what brought the U.S. and the rest of the world out of the Great Depression. But other than that, it hit the nail right on the head. It was indeed a sad movie, but thats the effect that war leaves on a country. Though Ben Affleck was supposed to be the big star of the movie...I feel that his friend Danny(Josh Harnett) did a much better job at acting than he did. He was more into it, and more realistic. When a ship exploded for example, instead of just running behind a car and squating like Ben Affleck did, he (Josh) seemed more jumping and panicked and kind of fell behind the car and couldn't seemed to find his foot grip. Now that to me seems more realistic. So bravo to all the actors and the producer and director who created such a wonderful movie. And the composer Hans Zimmer for created such an awesome sound track, and to Diane Warren for writing such a beautiful song "There You'll Be" and to Faith Hill for performing the song so beautifully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never realized in my 28 years of life what Pearl Harbor was all about until I seen this movie. My husband and I went to see it for the first time on Memorial Day, and it gave me a whole new perspective of what Memorial Day was all about. I came out of the theater with a whole new perspective for the land that God has so generously given us, and that we take for granted. I think it is sad that man alone takes it upon himself to fight for land that the good Lord has given us. I believe I came out of this movie as an anti-war person. I never really thought of war before this movie, but there was something about this movie that made it more real. I give this movie 4 stars, two thumbs up and what ever else to tell that it was the years best movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Historical Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Not anxious to die, sir, just anxious to matter' says Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck: Forces of Nature, Armageddon). Primarily Pearl Harbor is a love triangle between Rafe, his best friend Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett: Here on Earth, The Faculty), and an army nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale: Emma, Much Ado About Nothing) set in 1941. This love story takes a violent swing when on December 7, 1941 the Japanese staged a surprise attack on the naval base. The director, Michael Bay (Armageddon, The Rock) did a wonderful job of depicting that infamous day and also tying in a love story making it a wonderful War/Drama/Action movie. This movie is one of the best in a long time.To begin, this film will be how future generations learn about Pearl Harbor in their history class. It gives a fantastic view on what happened on that fateful day because of the wonderful job Bay did sharing his vision. Bay could not have done any thing more to the movie and he could not have done anything less. The script, by Randall Wallace (The Man in the Iron Mask), was enough to make anyone feel that they were there. Wallace did a wonderful job of tying in a non-fiction event with a fiction love story and making it easier to understand. Even though there were a few minor historical flip ups, such as two Japanese strategists being combined into one and having a hospital being at the center of an attack which did not happen, it did not take away from the historical significance.Another good part of the movie was many big name actors. Affleck, Cuba Gooding Jr. (Doris Miller), Jon Voight (President Franklin D. Roosevelt), and Alec Baldwin (General Doolittle) built the base of the film but did not overpower any of the lower caliber actors. Voight did a convincing job of portraying Roosevelt and made it believable that he was really there serving his country. There was a lot of tension and love that these actors had for their characters and the other characters around them. The actors acted as if they were there in 1941 and it was very easy to believe. The action and special effects of the battle scene are some of the best ever made. The shots that rang out and the planes flying by made it feel that you yourself were fighting the battle. The camera angles used and lighting put the audience into the action.From a technical standpoint the movie flowed very nicely and separated the love story from the war story. The sequence of events was very believable from the Japanese planning the attack, to Washington, and back at the base. The moods also flowed very nicely from the tense moments of the war to the sad moments of the love story. The music helped make this transition even better. With a love theme, `There You'll Be', sung by Faith Hill and the score composed by Hans Zimmer (Gladiator, The Prince of Egypt) the music makes the film wonderful and will move anyone to buy the CD, which they will be listening to for years to come. Finally, this is going to be the blockbuster movie of the summer and sweep the Academy Awards next year. This movie gets 4 out of 4 stars. There are things to be learned about the war and yet very entertaining for 3 hours, which does not get long in fact it ends too soon. `Pearl Harbor' has a PG-13 rating for sustained intense war sequences, images of wounded, brief sensuality, and some language. This is how it was and is a perfect way for anyone to learn about the day that started World War 2; Pearl Harbor</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting, dialogue and plot were so stupid and the historical accuracy so lacking that no one could ever have enjoyed this. You can't even get drunk and like this movie. The love-triangle, betrayed friend, "but we thought you were dead!" stuff is just so trite and mundane that the mind boggles. When the Japanese planes finally show up, you find yourself hoping that a big, fat bomb lands right in the middle of this triad of mediocre acting and puts a permanent load of shrapnel in Ben Affleck's career. Worst of all is the insulting of the intelligence of anyone who knows even a little bit about what actually happened that day. No nurses died at Pearl Harbor. Sorry. No women in service died that day at all, actually. We all know that women made a good, solid contribution to the war effort, but historical fact cannot be shoved aside for the sake of symbolism. The women who died at Pearl Harbor were all civilians and, embarrassingly, were all likely caused by US antiaircraft shells landing in the civilian areas of the island, according to the National Park Service. So there you go. This movie, I am afraid, is sub-dreadful. It is much sound and fury and next to no substance. And if you are a teacher, don't even THINK of using this in a history class, or I will find you.Grade: D-. Things to look for...parachute sex scene, fighter pilots easily retrain to fly bombers...huh?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is what the world really needs a Michael Bay, Jerry Bruckheimer, Randall Wallace film starting Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale that re-writes American history and World War Two.Pearl Harbour is meant to be a film about the famous attack by the Japanese Navy that forced the United States into get involved in World War Two in a military scene. However, what could have been an interesting and entertaining study of the military and intelligence failures/successes and the change of American attitudes fails because Randall Wallace (who wrote the awful Braveheart) turned the story into no more then a romantic film whilst Michael Bay tries to pay to his strengths which is bombastic action and Jerry Bruckheimer whilst is the master of dumb blockbusters. The film markers felt that they needed to turn an American tragedy into a success and a patriotic exercise.The casting was terrible. Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale all can't act and they end up as the leads. Kate Beckinsale's character, Evelyn, a Navy nurse, who ends up having a relationship with Rafe (Ben Affleck). However Rafe is called to serve in the Eagle Squadron in the Battle of Britain and asks Danny (Josh Hartnett) to take care of Evelyn for him. However when they both think Red had died they end up comfort each other and end up having a relationship together when stationed in Pearl Harbour. But Red comes back and you can imagine he is a little upset and falls up with both of them. But things get patched up when Japan attacks. I did not believe in the relationships that Evelyn has but if anything it should be Rafe and Danny have sex with each other.They are some subplots as well in the film. There is President Roosevelt (Jon Voight) who has to lead the country through the crisis and Voight is best performer in the film. Another element is the story of Doris Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who is the first black sailor to win the Navy Cross. However it felt like Cuba Gooding Jr. was no more then the token black guy. There is also some romantic elements involving Pilots and Nurses (the nurses are a right bunch of slags).The writing is awful. There is nothing but war movie clichés and terrible dialogue. The film has historical inaccuracies, but Wallace has never seen history as an important in historical films. He insults the memories of British and American pilots and portrays the Japanese as a blood thirsty and backwards people. The number of Americans who fought in the Battle of Britain was small and not servicemen picked by the air force. They were volunteers who opposed Fascism and not in the American Air Force. They were brave men, like the British, Canadians, French, Polish, Czechs etc... who all fought in the battle. The other major problems is they is no reason why the Japanese attacked America, no look at the run up to the war. There is only a brief mention that Japan was running out of oil but that's it. Also the film makes out that Red and Danny did most of the fighting for the air force, able to fly fighters and bombers and getting involved in the Doolittle raids which insults the real pilots who were involved. As well the film makes out that the Doolittle Raid was an important event, but it was really a foot-note, doing nothing for against the Japanese whilst only a propaganda tool for the Americans. I'm a believe that historical accuracy should be maintained all times in films and shouldn't take too much of an artistic license to real events. But Wallace doesn't understand that. The same critics and fans who praised Braveheart thinking history isn't important take a hypocritical view with Pearl Harbour. Americans feel insulting other countries history is okay, but when it comes to American history it's basically 'How dare they'. Roger Ebert is a good example.The visuals are impressive and some of the scenes during the bombing sequence are fun, but it isn't enough. The whole film is too long and drags. During the bombing sequence some moments are totally unbelievable and makes the film silly. It's the same with the end after the places clash in China, with American pilots with small arms easily kill Japanese soldiers, but only one of them dies. The final narration was sickening saying America never suffered a defeat, recovered and became all powerful: what about Vietnam? What about the efforts of Britain, the Commonwealth (i.e. Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand etc...), the Soviet Union and the Chinese? Bay was properly the worst choice of director because he is no more then an action director. He doesn't do deep story or romance or very much really. The film needed a director of gravitas like Spielberg or Scorsese to happen a lot of material. But most of the blame is reserved for Wallace.A new film about Pearl Harbour would have had so much potential but Americans can't accept a defeat. The military, diplomatic and intelligence all could have made an interesting film or book, but Wallace thought an fictional story was needed. No it isn't!Pearl Harbour tries to be a hybrid of Titanic and Saving Private Ryan, but fails on both. It is a really bad film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poorly excuse of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, every once in a while people have to make a romantic love story movie with a historic event as an excuse to make the story. Pearl Harbor is one of those movies. I bet all of the girls between 12 and 16 years old will drool with the sight of Josh Hartnett, and if you've got bad taste Ben Affleck (not that I like Hartnett that much, but if I had to choose... well, you know), in a love story movie.Well anyway, I'm one of those people who hate that people shameless take a historic event, turn it inside out and make a love story out of it and then are still claiming it's all about the event. O sure, Pearl Harbor shows what happened so many years ago, and perhaps it's even true that during World War II there were two men madly in love with the same woman at Pearl Harbor, but if you want to show what happened there in WWII, do you think it's really necessary to show the ups and downs of two fools, blinded by love? I don't think so.And then there's the disappointment of Ben Affleck. I didn't believe him one bit, even though I was such a foolish girl of 12 years old when I watched the movie. At one time I thought by myself: this movie can only be a bit more good, if Affleck dies. He's one of my least favorite actors, I hate watching him, I don't believe him, I don't like his looks, and I don't like the way he acts. Well, maybe that's personal, but in the end it's always personal how we think of movies, and his presence doesn't make anything good.I'll give some credits to Josh Hartnett, because I find it kind of cute how he's doing his best to give this movie something. Something worth the trouble of watching it. O, and it was kind of funny that when the whole cinema was silent, one girl started to cry so hard that it was umbering for her as well as the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll just say this and bring it to the table; Pearl Harbor ain't that bad.Have you clicked that "No" button yet? Great, I'll continue.Depicting history on the silver screen is no easy task; critics and historical purists wait in eager anticipation to pounce on a shading that's not quite right or a spent bullet casing that rolls left instead of right in the heat of a battle. To even consider doing a dramatization of the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor, in this era of endless information and minutiae, is a bold act in itself, and the filmmakers deserve a nod of credit right out of the chute just for attempting it. And, happily, they deserve still more credit, as "Pearl Harbor," directed by Michael Bay, goes on to successfully capture the pain, pathos, angst, frustration and fear born of that day that "Will live in infamy." Told through the lives of two lifelong friends, Captain Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Captain Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett), this is a movie of epic proportions presented on a personal level, which enables the audience to connect with the story on an emotional level and not just as an observer of a reenacted historical event. And when Nurse Lieutenant Evelyn Stewart (Kate Beckinsale) enters the story, it becomes even more involving, and as it builds in intimacy-- juxtaposed against these monumental events as they unfold-- it creates that empathy that really puts the viewer in the picture and gives that sense of total involvement. This is nothing new to storytelling, of course; writers and movie makers have long understood that when dealing with events that are complex and larger than life, they have to be concentrated and presented from a personal perspective to effect a truly appreciable impact, and as James Cameron proved with "Titanic," there's no better way to do it than with a love story.Without that intimacy between the characters, which is what provides the audience with a frame of reference and a specific element with which the viewer can identify, the impact of all that eventually happens would be significantly diminished. Like Cameron (and many others before him), Bay recognizes this, and the approach he takes is therefore very effective. By the time the attack comes, you know and care about the people involved, and it gives the tragedy of that day a personal, rather than just a national or historic perspective. And though all that follows is visually stunning, it's that personal focus-- that singular involvement that's been so carefully crafted-- that predominates the moment and makes all the difference as far as what you're feeling and experiencing as you watch these horrific and horrendous events play out.Bay is also successful in evoking a true sense of time and place with this film, and he does it not only with authentic settings and visuals, but by giving the film itself a sense of cinematic sensibility that makes it more reminiscent of films like "Bombardier," "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo" and "The Bridges At Toko-Ri," than the more recent "Saving Private Ryan" (though it does have "Ryan's" same level of realism). It's easy, in fact, to envision this film had it been made fifty or so years ago, with a cast that would've included Dana Andrews, Van Johnson and Gene Tierney as the principals, with Randolph Scott, Pat O'Brien and Eddie Albert in supporting roles.Heading up this cast, Affleck and Hartnett give strong, engaging performances, as does Kate Beckinsale, who successfully manages to take her character to a level beyond that of simply being the romantic interest of the story. She makes Evelyn believable by responding honestly to the complexities of her character's situation, which in turn adds to the overall credibility of the fictionalized part of the story. If there's an element in the story at all, in fact, that could be deemed questionable, it may be Rafe's reaction (some may argue, "over-reaction") to his personal situation; it is not, however, a reflection on Affleck's ability as an actor-- he gives a satisfying, credible performance-- but merely a subjective evaluation of his character's motivation.Giving memorable performances in supporting roles are Ewen Bremner as Lieutenant Red Winkle, and James King as Nurse Betty. Also Notable, are Alec Baldwin as Lieutenant colonel Jimmy Doolittle, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Petty Officer Dorie Miller, a Navy cook who rises to the occasion during the attack (though Gooding does bring a bit of melodrama to his portrayal), and especially Jon Voight, who is excellent in the role of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Tom Sizemore, however, as Sergeant Earl Sistern, falls into stereotype, and with the brim of his hat turned up comes across like an actor playing William Bendix playing a role in a war movie more than anything else. In his defense, though, he does seem to do the best he can with the material he is given, and it is a fairly small part with little time for development.The additional supporting cast includes William Lee Scott (Lieutenant Billy Thompson), Jennifer Garner (Nurse Sandra), Mako (Admiral Yamamoto), Colm Feore (Admiral Kimmel), Leland Orser (Major Jackson), Scott Wilson (General Marshall), Peter Firth (Bennion) and Sara Rue (Nurse Martha). One more qualified than I will have to comment on the historical "accuracy" of the film, but without question, "Pearl Harbor" succeeds in conveying the magnitude, scope and significance of the attack, and does it in a way that is emotionally involving and memorable. It depicts a moment in history that-- regardless of how dark and horrible-- must never be forgotten; and, even as Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List" and "Saving Private Ryan" did much to preserve their respective moments in history, so will this film help to insure that December 7, 1941, will forever be remembered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another puff piece from the master of puff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the choice between producing a popular film and a great film, producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Armageddon, Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop, ConAir) will always choose the popular film. He is nothing if not consistent. His films always make lots of money and seldom deliver much more than slick eye candy for the masses. Bruckheimer has a golden opportunity to depart from his blockbuster mentality with this film, but he goes with his business instincts rather than taking a chance with a filmmaker's approach. The result is another big budget crowd pleaser with a cotton candy plot and terrific battle scenes, aided by impressive digital effects.The script by Randall Wallace of `Braveheart' fame is the biggest problem. Wallace is clearly capable of writing an engaging script, but that obviously isn't what the boss wanted. It seems that Bruckheimer has Titanic envy and tries to use the same formula of wrapping a piece of history around a love story. Either that or he is trying to follow in the footsteps of `From Here to Eternity', the much acclaimed 1953 story that occurs as a prelude to the attack on Pearl Harbor. However, FHTE did not pretend to be a story ABOUT Pearl Harbor, and only included the attack as another disruptive event in an emotionally tumultuous story. While FHTE was a gripping and powerful story of love, hatred, lust and honor, PH is a trite and predictable love story that serves an interminable prelude to 30 minutes of terrific battle scenes. The inadvertent love triangle between best friends could have been predicted by a teenager (which seemed to be the target audience of this film, based on the PG rating and the sappy dialogue). And of course the resolution of the dilemma is just as neat and obvious.Director Michael Bay (Armageddon, The Rock) isn't known for his subtle and insightful direction of human stories. Bay is known for his explosions, and predictably the human story is bungled while the battle is extraordinary. Bay directs a period piece without much regard for understanding and reproducing the 1940's. It seems all he cares about is the military angle. The costume design and hair for the girls' is merely good while the military costumes are perfect. Mostly, the ?40's feel is missing. The music is all wrong. It should have been big band music instead of the standard blockbuster symphonic compositions which did not fit the period at all. Various details are overlooked, like the fact that well more than half of young adults of that era smoked. Not one character in the film smoked, nor was there a single cigarette to be found in the nightclub scene. Rent any film from the forties and fifties and notice how many people smoke. Everybody. Another thing that is incredible is the fact that Evelyn (Kate Beckingsale), who was having morning sickness on December 7 is not showing in mid April, more than four months later. Perhaps if she were 200 lbs I could believe that, but the lithe Evelyn would have shown more than a little pooch by then.Also missing are the colloquialisms of the day. Not a single `swell', `dame', `jeepers', `say' or `ain't' in the whole film. No Brooklyn or Chicago accents. Everyone speaks perfect twenty first century Funk and Wagnall's College English.The battle scene is a marvel of action filmmaking. It is highly realistic as a depiction of the battle, but there was a lot of cheating that didn't escape the notice of WWII buffs. It is pretty amazing that Bruckheimer got so much cooperation from the US government in being able to film in the Harbor. The government even loaned the production company numerous mothballed ships. Unfortunately, a lot of them were ships designed and built after WWII and they didn't bother to clean them up in post production. They built a complete digital world and left post WWII ships in the picture. That is just poor attention to detail in a film that is all about detail. Still, by any standard, this is fantastic action sequence that could not have been more realistic if one had actually been there.The acting is mixed. Beckingsale is excellent as Evelyn. She creates a very appealing romantic figure. Ben Affleck is too moody and sarcastic in the role. Josh Hartnett is much better, coming across as far more sincere and relating to his character better than Affleck. Affleck seems content to play Ben Affleck in uniform rather than trying to actually flesh out a character.Cuba Gooding Jr. gives an excellent performance in a minor role. Veterans Alec Baldwin and Jon Voight do a marvelous job as Colonel Doolitle and FDR.I rated this film a 6/10 on the strength of the visual effects. It would have been much better if it had been about Pearl Harbor instead of being a schmaltzy love triangle story that coincided with the attack. The entire event that is Pearl Harbor is shrouded in intriguing questions. Did Roosevelt know about the attack in advance and allow it to happen to get us into the war? Many historical facts indicate that was the case (it is thought to be more than just lucky that the aircraft carriers weren't in the harbor that day). What was really going on in the minds of the Japanese? Were the diplomatic efforts of the US designed to force the Japanese into attacking us as a matter of honor? As much as I dislike Oliver Stone, this film would have been substantial if it had been done in his docudrama style (without the historical rewrites of course).Instead we have another puff piece by the master of puff. Thanks Jerry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular war film with routine romantic drama...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If PEARL HARBOR had been made back in the '40s, you'd see a war film with a romantic triangle from stars like Tyrone Power, John Payne and Anne Baxter (ever see CRASH DIVE with Power and Dana Andrews both in love with Baxter?). What we have here is a good, old-fashioned romantic triangle yarn set against the spectacular bombing of Pearl Harbor.The action scenes are awesome with the relentless attack portrayed with searing realism. And the History Channel documentary on Pearl Harbor is chock full of details used in the screenplay, even including the bit about the cook who seized his opportunity to be a gunner. This is definitely a well-crafted film that shouldn't be panned as extensively as some of the reviewers here have chosen to do. The performances are first rate, sincere and earnest with Ben Affleck doing an outstanding job as Rafe, completely believable in his role as the pilot who is believed killed but returns to resume his romantic partnership with a nurse. Outstanding in supporting roles are Jon Voigt, strongly resembling FDR, and Alec Baldwin.A disappointment is the score, which I assumed would make full use of '40 swing tunes from that era but instead uses a bland love song that sounds like a leftover from 'Titanic' and never uses the music in a way that evokes the 1940s. Nor does it have any power in the dramatic moments.But above all, this is an enjoyable enough war film which relies heavily on the old-fashioned Hollywood triangle romances that came out of the '40s when patriotism was at an all-time high.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor was an excellent piece of love story with a very realistic view of war. Pearl Harbor has different genres for everyone: A love story for the ladies, special effects and action for the thrill seekers, historical events for the intellectuals, comedy for the laughter-seekers, and things blowing up for the macho men. Pearl Harbor will make you laugh, and make you cry, and also gives people a patriotic feeling of victory while revealing the horrors of war. The cast were also magnificent. Ben and Josh were absolutely gorgeous, and Kate was a brilliantly leading lady, her accent didn't even slip once!! Jerry Bruckheimer's movies are always so lively and interesting to watch. A great job by both the cast and the crew. Compared to Pearl Harbor, Titanic was just a sinking ship! I didn't even like Titanic, and Leo had little to offer compared to Ben and Josh!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Pearl Harbor again today, and left the cinema amazed like I did the first time I saw it. I don't normally see a movie twice at the cinema, usually wait for it until it comes out on video; but this movie is incredible. No doubt about it. The Re-enactment of the attack at Pearl is spectacular. But you all know that. Congratulations to Micheal Bay for doing an amazing job. Only Steven Spielberg I believe could match his brilliance. I also loved the cinematography and the filters used during the attack. Nicely done. May be a little too patriotic at times but I've seen worse. I've been reading reviews in papers from critics trashing Pearl, yet these people are the same ones who gave 'Titanic' five stars. Titanic is crap. You know that and I know that. &gt;Pearl surpasses it by a long shot. See the movie and you will be impressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a true story of a horrible tragedy is told there are great expectations hanging in the balance. Will the story be told accurately and factual? Will the individuals and their families who took part in the actual event feel honored in the way that they should or will they be displeased with the way it was told? In this such case a truly inspiring film about a historical event was told in such a way that the shock of the event was felt again. This movie will help innovate the way many people look at the attack on Pearl Harbor who never really grasped the intensity, the pain, and the losses that we suffered during that time, but will also help them come to realize how from such a tragedy came a new understanding of our place as Americans, a new maturity as a country, and finally a more noble and victorious outlook as a nation. This movie was undoubtedly the most moving movie I have ever seen. An outstanding on the edge of your seat story portrayed in a way that you have come to expect from Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer. Definitely one of the best must see movies of the year!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry fellow reviewers but I have to disagree with many of your reviews of this fine movie. Ignore all the bad criticism about this movie. If you see one movie this year, see Pearl Harbor (that is till Fellowship of the Ring comes out but that is another story) Pearl Harbor is full of what makes movies great. It has action, a wonderful love story, great special effects, a well written script, spectacular music, everything that should be in a movie. It is three hours long but when its over, you walk out of the theater wishing for more. I saw it opening day and I plan on seeing it again the second night. No price is too much to see this movie. So again those "smart" critics and listen to this common movie lover. Pearl Harbor IS the movie to see. A complete 10 out of 10 in every category. All hail Pearl Harbor, king of 2001.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Criticism to the critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sorry; I do not understand why everyone hates this movie so much. Unless every single one of you are veterans of the Pearl Harbour attacks I don't see how you can so openly criticise the historical content of the movie. It was made over 40 years after the attack happened. Isn't it obvious it's not going to be a bit-by-bit re-enactment of what happened back then? If forty years on someone made a film about September 11 or the London Bombings there'll probably be just as many historical inaccuracies as Pearl Harbour. And it's not like the producers tried not to make it as accurate as possible. They interviewed over 70 Pearl Harbour Veterans and tried to weave in every account they could. If the 'Rafe' and 'Danny' characters were real, they wouldn't be doing the Doolittle Raid, that is true because of the differences in flying (fighters and bombers), but a: they wouldn't be able to end the film without the Doolittle Raid, and b: surely you can't expect them to bring in two entirely new characters at that time in the film? I will admit, it does seem to be a little over the top with the love triangle but seriously, how many people watch documentaries compared to the amount that watch romance movies? It's a Jerry Bruckheimer film for goodness sake, of course there had to be something in it that attracted the people, not just the big explosions. But you have to see that they weren't only doing it for the romance. If you get completely immersed in the love affair off those three characters, you may get a glimpse at the emotional side of things. I wouldn't know for sure because I wasn't there but I know for sure I got caught up in the emotional side and I'm not that kind of person normally. The nurses had to be in it because of the stresses and stuff they went through when the casualties started coming in and with that many sailors and only that small amount of nurses of course there had to be some sort of romance. The nurses weren't just placed in the film because of the romance, they were also, and more importantly there for emotional circumstances.This film wasn't meant to be a documentary, it's meant to be an entertainment film. Duh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have some perspective (May contain spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>******Spoilers at the end only******(just to be safe)This is one of my all-time favorite movies. I have seen from these posted reviews that most people either sincerely love this movie or completely hate it. I am typically an analytical person and I don't "love" things without a reason. I love and respect Pearl Harbor as a movie because it is the first movie that made me cry. Repeatedly. In public when I first saw in theaters. And at home when I watch the DVD for the 10th time. History always has to be taken with a grain of salt. There are no absolute truths. And when making a movie it is 100% positive that there will be historical errors. This is a movie, first of all. It is a multi-million dollar venture to become a blockbuster hit. It is not meant to capture historic accuracy perfectly because the average American doesn't care about the history. It is sad to know that most culture and history is lost on people. But one way to make it up is to drawn them in with things that do attract them and be able to get to their emotions. People are attracted by sex and violence. I, along with many others, were drawn in by the story of Danny, Evelyn, and Rafe. through their eyes I was able to experience one of the horrors of American history. It may not have been exactly how it happened, but this movie gave me a glimpse into how it felt. Something I KNOW i will never TRULY experience, but something we who won't experience it should be grateful for. This movie showed me the power of love, which does not always have to be bashed by cynics. It showed me the pride that people can have. To me it was not 100% pro-American. I felt emotion for the Japanese fighter pilots as well. He, too, had a love waiting for him in Japan that he would lose. Love and loss are universal. I felt respect for out nursing profession and doctors and ordinary people who step up in extraordinary circumstances. I feel ashamed for the fact that 2 countries had to resort to this kind of destruction due to a lack of communication and cooperation. Most importantly, I felt pride in soldiers, all soldiers. We may not respect their battles, but we must respect their lives of sacrifice and bravery. Including a love story in this movie does not lower its standards. In one post someone talked about how a movie about 9/11 could be ruined with a love story if it is made into a movie. I tell that person that I would watch that movie and I would not be upset about it because Love is something that can never be lost even in the face of any great tragedy.I am not usually a fan of history, but everything about WWII interests me since I picked up the Diary of Anne Frank when I was in 4th grade. I have attempted to learn everything I can about the war, but I realize that people are interested in different things and probably WILL NEVER know the historical heroes of our past that fought bravely in this war. And I can't blame them for that. But this movie had the emotion to draw people in and maybe even for a little while give them a break from the cynical view of the world to believe in people again. To recognize mistakes but to also re-energize pride. I will never forget some of the images and quotes from this movie, such as "There is nothing stronger than the heart of a volunteer" and the quote something along the lines of "A smarter man would find a way not to fight a war" to the final scene with little Danny and Rafe flying away.Maybe tears are a superficial to love a movie but good old emotion can be a better teacher than cold hard facts.If you have actually read all of this, congratulations. I hardly ever post a message on here but I felt compelled to lay out my opinion on this subject and apologize that is particularly verbose. I respect everyone's opinions, and I only ask others to do the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why this film has got so many bad comments about it, i thought it was one of the best films I've seen. Whilst i was watching the film it automatically went into the same category as Titanic, and other films that are true events with a false story in them. I agree when people said that the movie was based on a tragic event and then they just added a stupid love story into it. But wasn't Titanic a tragic event as well, the two events may had not had the same effect on the country but still many peoples lives where lost. If you watch this film not concentrating too much on the historical facts and on the planes and guns and things that were used in the movie, then, it was a fantastic thing to watch. It was the same in Titanic, as both of these films had a love story in them, but wasn't that the idea of the film. if the film was just about the facts then i think it would have been called a documentary.SQUIRE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>December 7, 1941 - It Was A Sunday Morning...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two childhood best friends, Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett), grow up wanting to fly planes. When Rafe gets the chance to join the Royal Air Force during World War II, he takes it - leaving his new love, Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), a dedicated Navy nurse, and Danny, also a pilot, behind. Danny and Evelyn are transferred separately to the idyllic paradise of Hawaii, where they eventually meet through a connection to Rafe, who has been declared missing. But just as the love triangle begins to get complicated, Dec. 7, 1941 arrives, changing all of their lives forever.Director Michael Bay has never been a favorite of the critics. While only having 3 films under his belt his films have gone on to gross over $900 million and he has a reputation for putting out the best popcorn summer blockbuster films. From Armageddon to "Island",there is no doubting that Michael Bay knows how to do action and he doesn't fail to deliver here. Pearl Harbor features an amazing array of special effects. The attack on Pearl Harbor is the action centerpiece of this film and lasts approximately 45 minutes. There are planes firing, buildings blowing up, ships blowing up and the now infamous "bomb-cam" shot of a bomb being dropped from a plane and falling down and exploding. The action sequences never let up and the viewer feels as if he's smack in the middle of the attack. While Bay has become known for his action scenes he's never been really been known for his character driven scenes. This time around Bay tries to shift the focus away from the action and he manages to weave an effective yet not without it flaws love story between two fly boy friends and the nurse they both come to love.The performances in Pearl Harbor are top notch as Michael Bay brings back some familiar faces and couples them with some new rising talent. Back in 1998, Bay took a chance on a newcomer by the name of Ben Affleck by giving him the role of AJ Maclean in "Armageddon". Now 3 years Affleck is one of Hollywood's biggest stars. Once again Affleck turns in an excellent performance as Rafe, the best pilot the US has. Ben Affleck has worked his way up from small parts in Kevin Smith's movies to super stardom and I can see why, He is one talented actor and doesn't disappoint here. Josh Hartnett who first starred in "The Faculty" is quickly becoming one of Hollywood's newest heartthrobs. He has proved since then that he's one talented actor with his supporting turn in Sin City. Kate Beckinsale has the grace and beauty of a 1930's screen goddess as the caring nurse Evelyn. Cuba Gooding Jr.'s role sticks in mind as it is very memorably also watch for Alec Baldwin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish during my schooling years that movie makers had discovered this technique in telling history. Although Pearl Harbor follows a fictional love story, it tells a true to life story. I have visited Pearl Harbor and the Museum in Honolulu, but didn't think much about it at the time. Since seeing this movie, I can reflect back on the visit and it has brought a whole new meaning to my visit. If you own or rent the video version, you can view the documentary at the end of the movie. The documentary will bring a whole new meaning to the fictional movie. If you haven't taken the time to see the movie, the time is now! If you men out there think that this is just a love story, take the time to watch it, you'll wonder why you really didn't want to see it to start with. The special effects are great and Hans Zimmer has out done himself with the music. This is a movie to watch with your children, so you can explain America's past. (Although there is adult language, drinking, and one carefully handled sex scene). Comparing this movie to Titanic: Think about it, which will be more believable? A teenager capturing the heart of an older woman or the friendship of two men who grow up together and fall in love. Pearl Harbor is a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I spoke my mind about it in an earlier note and enjoyed reading other comments, obviously some in favour some against. Democratically speaking, everyone is undoubtably entitled to their opinion and it should be respected, but, one thing really struck me and made quite an impression on me... people love to hate...Point of fact moviegoers: the film never supported that it was a documentary. There were, no arguing there, boo boos {even a couple that were whoppers}. But, if people want text book history {which is often criminally distorted and misquoted} they should turn to exactly that... history text books.The Next Titanic? In all honesty other than great effects and a tear jerking, sinking Di Caprio I thought the film was absolute rubbish with nothing other than a very vague plot. Was Pearl Harbour {English spelling folks, I'm not illiterate}a love story? Oh, yes! Remember that anachronistic, medievil word people seem to think that they can do without in this hitech, hipowered era? Was the heroine unable to make up her mind?... Yeah, right, as if none of us has ever been in any dilemma of any sort in our lifetimes... Although those who chose to shred this point of the film to pieces might do well to look a little deeper into the actual human dilemma presented. By the way, some of us might also do well to ask any participant of any war what it is that war can do to people's minds and hearts... but why take into account the human factor, hey?... hitech era remember?Cliche? Without a doubt. I've been very happily married {to the same man I might add} for 15 years and life is full of cliches which touch us every time when they come from the heart... and our film heroes had plenty of heart. Predictable ending? I would say so. But, my God my eyes were still riveted to the screen. Why? Cause our heroes carried the whole thing off superbly. I still say there wasn't a dry eye in the cinema.Moviebuffs, why not just let your hair down and simply enjoy? Why does everything have to be turned into an intellectual issue? Which is more or less the case with the westernised world nowadays. I said it before, I have an I.Q. of 180 and if you think MY habits and/or preferences leave something to be desired from that intellectual point of view, you wouldn't belieeeeve some of the ones Einstein had.So, if intellect is the issue here... perhaps you would do well to do a doublecheck... and just sit back and enjoy a damn good film with actors who oudid themselves and were also veeeery easy on the eyes... unless everything bores you, anyway...Way to go Ben...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I critique a movie, I look at 4 basic categories. Character Development, did I understand the character's history and life, did I relate to the character, did I know everything I had to but not more than I needed to? Plot. Did I buy into the story? Did it resolve everything it started? Did it follow logical sequencing? Did it keep me interested? How was the ending? Set, Design, and Costume. Explains itself. And the most important category is the ever popular Entertainment Value. For the first time in my life, a movie scores a perfect 10 in all 4 categories! Pearl Harbor is quite possibly the best movie, I have ever saw. Character Development - Beautiful. I felt like I was in their lives. We new everything we had to know about each character. One Problem. How did Rafe go from struggling to read and write to writing and reading the eloquent letters to Evelyn? Don't get it. How ever the movie did a great job of giving us something at stake in every character's life. Set, Design, Costume - The battle of Pearl Harbor was one of the best war sequences of all time. They did a great job with costumes and sets. A lot had to do with filming on location in Pearl Harbor. Plot - Wonderful. It flowed so well that you don't realize it is so long. You can't cut anything out. Great Ending. The battle of Pearl Harbor wasn't the climax. Great Job. Entertainment Value - Once again, one of the best movies I ever saw. I don't understand what the fuss is about. This married, heterosexual male even cried at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is incredible, no matter what you have heard critics saying. Michael Bay's finest movie is set in 1941, when Pearl Harbor in Hawaii was attacked by Japan.The movie is divided into 3 parts, the lives of 2 pilots and a nurse, the Battle Of Pearl Harbor and the Dolittle Raiders bombing of Toyko.This movie is long, and does sometimes seem long, especially after the sadness of the aftermath of the battle. You can't help but wonder how people felt at the time. One thing you can really praise Michael Bay is his capturing of the moment in history that changes the lives of millions. Special Effects are amazing, I think the highlight was the famous bombing of the Arizona. Watching the bomb drop from the plane and fall towards the ship is nothing short of breathtaking!If you don't know who Hans Zimmer is, he is one of the finest music composers for film ever! He composed The Lion King, The Thin Red Line and many others. His soundtrack for this movie is amazing. It makes you really feel the emotion thats happening on the screen.It is out on video right now, so what are you waiting for! Pearl Harbor: 10/10</fullReview>

But be warned before picking up the DVD...the studios are gonna release a Director's cut R rated version (with more battle stuff, about 3 minutes...and cut down some of the love interest) in May...still, this is a MUST RENT on dvd...this is a VERY GOOD movie...but maybe those guys who need to be in Macho mode all the time and are afraid to cry, should stay away....cause this is a movie for a MAN who is SECURE within himself :)</fullReview>

Jon Voight was the best in the whole cast,playing President Roosevelt.I hope he'll get an Oscar for this one.

		<shortDescription>Much better romance storyline than Titanic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was the bomb!! The romance plot was much better than Titanic. Love triangles always make for better storylines. The cinematography was amazing!! The entire movie looked so realistic. If you're into action/war films, the attack on Pearl Harbor scenes will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat. The movie also tugs at your heart. Not just with the romance story between Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Hartnett's characters, but also with the feeling that all those innocent men lost their lives that day. You will find yourself welling up with tears over that more than with the love storyline. As history goes, we all know what really happened. However, the biggest surprise comes with how the love triangle story plays out. You will be shocked at the ending (some might not be, but I was.) I gave this movie a 10+ and I fully recommend you go see this film while it's still in the theaters. It's one of those films you have to see in a theater. It's a bit long to sit through, but you will be so glued to the movie that you won't even notice how long it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor is a great film. It mixes sweeping romance with the tragedies of war. All war films should aspire to this level.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is the best film I have ever seen. Michael Bay's direction is flawless, an almost guaranteed Best Director at the Academy Awards. Hans Zimmer's music scores are so beautiful and sad, making the battle scenes more intense, and the mournful scenes, sadder. Randall Wallace has written a screenplay better that his 1995 effort, BRAVEHEART. I've seen this film 8 times at the cinema so far, and it still makes me angry when people flat out say - 'it was crap'. No one in their right mind could say this movie sucked. Not liking a movie because of its running time really isn't a very valid reason. A longer movie means it can fit more in it. I would say that Pearl Harbor is a combination between ARMAGEDDON and TITANIC. This film is so watchable and entertaining, the love story really couldn't have been much better. It was the most entertaining way to start the first 80 mintutes of the film. Ben Affleck has outdone himself, giving an even better and more mature performance as Rafe McCawley. Josh Hartnett is going to be such a huge star after this film, as well as Kate Beckinsale. She put in a flawless performance. How beautiful is she? Don't listen to insane people who put this film down, if you haven't seen Pearl Harbor, please hurry and do so. If you have seen it, watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off - anyone who thinks that the movie portrayed America as so good and the Japanese as so bad is absolutely right. Some people are never going to understand the events that led to the US dropping the bomb on Japan and the fact that it had to be done b4 more AMERICANS DIED!!!!! These war hungry people (the Japanese) didn't even surrender after the first one - it took two bombs!!!!!!! Other than this the movie was utterly fantastic - if you're a patriot and have any love for our country you can't help but be teary eyed through a lot of the movie - not just because of the events but because of the love story too, which was no more contrived than Titanic (in fact it was better!). The visuals were stunning - the acting was good - I had no complaints. I felt fullfilled after this move was over. It was long but well worth it!! If you like movies, go see it. If you're an uptight bitty who is "offended" by the US defending itself, then stay home and collect your welfare check. This movie ruled!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a preview for Pearl Harbor several weeks back, and immediately I was interested. I saw the movie opening night and was in awe. It was one of those movies that after you watch it, you just sit back in your chair in awe. I've read a few reviews in complete disappointment. One said that the plot was too corny. The movie was terrific. Randall Wallace, writer of Braveheart, wrote this. The directing was great too. One of my favorite things about the movie is how powerful he makes scenes to the viewer. There are a few parts that especially stand out in my mind. One of the ships are sinking and there are men trapped inside. Water is feeling up the ship. On top, men are trying desperately to get the men out, but they can already tell its a lost effort. They get a hole in to the ship just as it is moments away from being completely pulled under by the ocean. One of the soldiers reaches his hands up through the hole. He is reaching for life, reaching for help, reaching for hope, reaching for nothing... One of the soldiers grabs his hand and holds it until all movement stops. At that point, the hands just stand still. Another part is where hundreds of soldiers are in the water treading for their lives. They stand defiantly against all hope and against Death whom seems to be standing more on their enemy's side then their own. While they are stranded, Japanese continuously shoot at them while they lay helpless in the water. The noteworthy part of this scene is where the American Flag falls into the water. There it is waving in the water filled with bullet holes, Yet it still waves showing that it may be a hole in America and a big loss, but America will still pull through. There are many amazing scenes just as the above two mentioned. The special effects were without doubt the best I have ever seen. The plot set aside from Pearl Harbor, was enough to make me cry. There was definitely adequate character depth. In all, the movie was the best movie I have ever seen and I have seen A LOT of movies. I urge you all to give it a chance and go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story for the times, a tragedy for a nation, this film is excellent for so many reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A date which will live in infamy. I certainly remembered it, and once our school got time out on the day to watch Tora Tora Tora piped through our tv system. When I saw the previews for Pearl Harbor, I was awestruck, yet I was also wary. I wondered if this could reach Tora Tora Tora's level of glory, or well-crafted cinematography and acting. What I saw today proved that today's cinema has just as much to offer. This movie was simply amazing. It shows the backgrounds of the characters which, even though it takes awhile, didn't make me bored. In fact, I did not realize the time that had passed. The scenes were realistic, the acting was emotional, but not overdone. The cinematography was original and flavorful, using techniques which brought the war truly home. And throughout, I had a sense of being there almost, feeling the air, smelling smoke. But then again I have an overactive imagination.My third cousin died in the battle that brought America into World War II. He was nineteen. When I saw the ships sinking in flames, the men screaming, it sent shivers down my body. Even if there is never a stone memorial to honor him(which there is), this movie will always be a national memorial to his sacrifice, to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Gloss Hollywood Eye Candy For The Brain Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At one point during the attack at Pearl Harbor, a character says, "I think World War II just started!"--ignoring the fact that no one used the term at the time. This is rather typical of the movie as a whole: obviously improbable, often flatly impossible, and flogging every cliché to the nth degree.Although it markets itself as a highly authentic depiction of the events leading up to and the attack on Pearl, PEARL HARBOR is essentially a three hour long and extremely improbable soaper about a love triangle between two friends and a navy nurse. This plot line, which occupies the first third of the film, asks us to believe the proverbial six impossible things before breakfast and predictably reaches a peak just in time for the Japanese attack. The second third of the film shows the attack itself.Although the attack at Peal Harbor is an exciting bit of film-making, it is really here that the film falls completely apart, asking us to believe that the two male leads not only manage to get their planes off the ground, perform all sorts of acrobatics, blow Japanese Zeros all over the sky, and then land safely to return to the woman they love. As if this is not absurd enough, the film then goes on to send both men off on the Doolittle Raid on Japan itself.By this point the men have been childhood friends, gone to flight school together, become pilots together, been through Pearl, and are now crash landing in China--and I began to wonder why they were bothering with the nurse; given that their primary interests seemed to be in each other they might as well have dropped their drawers and gotten in bed with each other too. Indeed, such a turn of events would have at least added a touch of curiosity value to this otherwise dreary bit of high-gloss cinematic nonsense.The DVD contains a History Channel documentary re Pearl Harbor that is very good, a "Making Of" documentary that is disgracefully and distastefully self-congratulatory, and a number of other extras, some of which you will need a computer to access. The picture quality and sound are excellent throughout. Sadly, the movie itself is not.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This contains 2 things, 1) A response to the review by oatwich (some true historical facts), and 2) My review of Pearl Harbor I, personally, think that oatwich's review was nuts. I do not recall the Japanese ever shooting at innocent people in the movie, considering the Nurses had military ranks, and that's what the Japanese were there for. The Doolittle Raid was not an attack on civilians. It was an attack on the military structures such as war industries, shipbuilding facilities, and power plants. In fact, Doolittle strongly reiterated that no hospitals, schools, or other civilian targets, were allowed, and got very angry when hearing that some of his men wanted to hit the Imperial Palace. Therefore, the movie portrayed those American bombers as heroes because they WERE heroes, according to the current president. So maybe the movie is not 100% accurate, but what movie is, unless it's a documentary? MOST of the movie IS historically accurate. I also do not see how one can say it was insulting to the Japanese. The movie crew was nervous on how Japan would take the movie, but they obviously liked it, considering Japan was the first or second country, where the movie made the most money. The movie was NOT disrespectful to the world war veterans, they loved the movie, got to advise in the way some of the scenes went, spent time with the cast and crew of the movie, and even cried at the "real feel" of it.Overall, I think oatwich needs to learn to speak for himself, instead of taking it upon himself to speak for all of Pearl City and Honolulu.Usually (even with movies that I like), I am sitting there, looking at the DVD player to see how much time is left until the movie ends, because I want to get up and do something. With this movie, I was looking to see how much time was left, because I could not WAIT to see how the movie ended! I think this is an awesome, well balanced love story and action movie (almost exactly half and half), if you are able to sit in one place for almost 3 hours, and like action and romance, I would definitely recommend this movie. :) Also, if you watch this on DVD, when you put the second disk in, make sure you don't look at the chapters, or you'll ruin the ending. :P(This is my favorite movie in case you couldn't tell, and I could rant on it forever, but I won't take up any more of your time here, so if you need to talk about the movie, e-mail me.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lest We Forget........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A magnificantly produced and directed film, highly recommended to see especially on DVD.It is a fact that in 1941 a attack was launched on the US base of Pearl Harbor, and this film correctly in my view portrays the surprise nature of that reality. Interwoven into the history of that attack is the story of the friendship and ultimate love and sacrifice between two boyhood friends. I find this picture compelling and brilliant and am mystified why so many "critics" thought otherwise. Done with more gusto, enthusiasm and style than Titanic all the characters come across as interesting human beings and giving, as appropriate, humourous or dramatic performances. And the violent scenes are spectacularly good though horrific.Where this film rates so highly in my respectful view is that it can stand alone as explaining the surprise nature of what is Pearl Harbor, independent from the love story and vice versa. Further, the crux of this movie in post September 11 retrospect is about the failure of intelligence, or perhaps the failure to heed intelligence reports. Well done to the film-makers, please ignore the critics, you have a 10 out of 10 from me!!! -rbrb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie with almost no expectations. I had heard much of the negative criticimm of the love story and the director's attempt to create a another Titanic. I think that criticism is a bunch of bull. Titanic had an unbelievable love story set to a historical event. The love story in that movie took away from the integrity of the film-to the point where the viewer HATED both charaters (I personally had no sympathy for Jack). In Pearl Harbor, you are dealing with the reality of war, and what happens when someone is presumed dead. I mean, you can put yourselves in the position of Rafe, Evelyn and Danny. It makes the film more poignant, and the war that much more dramatic. Plus there's not the class-system BS that Cameron tried to push on viewers in Titanic in this movie. The only negative to this movie is that, like Titanic, it could have been an hour shorter. I almost fell asleep the first hour, and it takes about an hour or so to pick up. But I feel that criticism is minor compared to all the negative stuff I've said about Titanic.</fullReview>

Bruckheimer also produced other movies like "Gone In 60 Seconds," "Top Gun," "Enemy Of The State," "Beverly Hills Cop 1 and 2," and other movies.

		<fullReview>I was a six year old boy when Pearl Harbor was attacked. The memories of that day,and the war years that followed, are indelibly implanted in mind and soul.The movie not only has caused me to relive those times but aroused my desire to educate younger generations who,thank God, did not have first hand experience.My wife and I have now seen the movie twice and will probably see again.This is first time have gone to see the same movie twice in one week since was a teenager.My passion for history was fulfilled by the accurate portrayal of the events leading up to the attack as well as being right on in every other important event throughout the movie. The love story has been criticized by many as "hokey". I thought it to be very real,moving, and so appropriate for the time,when there was such a sense of urgency with matters of love,and everything else.The story of Pearl Harbor and Americas entry into the war needs to be told in away so succeeding generations won't forget. Everyone in America,indeed throughout the world, has had their lives effected by the events of December 7th,1941.Hats off to the cast for a job well done.

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor - a must-see movie epic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the music fades, and the screen blackens, one can hardly help but sigh. The movie was good; it was darn good. Everything about it. The acting, directing, music, and the incredible CG were wonderfully combined to form this summer's blockbuster Pearl Harbor. Upon reading reviews of this newly released film, it is hard not to notice the terrible blasts it has been receiving from seemingly heartless movie critics and viewers. They complain and complain about it, when they fail to see what it truly is: a tale of "the end of innocence... and the dawn of America's greatest glory." What better way to show this, than with a love story, which is what Pearl Harbor is above all. It is a love story involving three characters, and how the unthinkable at Pearl Harbor shaped their lives, as well as the lives of Americans. Its purpose was not to perfectly document the events that occurred on that fateful day in December 1941, but rather to show in a way that only Hollywood can, the sights, feelings, and agony that there must have been on that day; and to show younger generations an era in which men and women were so willing to put their country above themselves. Pearl Harbor successfully captures the brutality of war, and the courage of the men and women who fought it. It is an epic tale of love and war, and a time when heroes would rise and fall; but America would prevail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT MOVIE OUT OF GREAT HISTORY!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A date in which we will live in infamy". Spoken by Roosevelt, these words were the words of war for America in 1941. Today, these words bring back memories, of when America became strong. This movie, "Pearl Harbor" brought back those memories for the veterans of that day, and also gave the citizens of the US a glimpse of that tragic day. Special effects gave this movie it's realness in every way, and the intentness became real to every viewer. Telling the Pearl Harbor attack, the way many saw it, and the love story between soldiers and nurses, and the life of flying of two best friends, this movie became a memorial to many. Brought tears, almost no laughter, and pains for all veterans. This movie touched me deep, as the memory of Pearl Harbor does. The plot was rich with life, and history. As a teen, I'm not fascinated by history, but I do love Pearl Harbor. The movie told every view, from nurses, to soldiers, to citizens. Sadness reached me at the end, as did many. This 3-hour movie (it needed to be!!!) shows life briefly before and after, but with great context about Pearl Harbor attack. Showing views from Japan and US, it tied in history very well. Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett worked very well side-by-side, along with Kate Beckinsale. The duo made out to be great working together. The romance story between them made in Hollywood, but Pearl Harbor made it history. I agree. This is a blockbuster, of history!!! Touched me deep, as I saw it yesterday, but forever will I remember this movie. THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one would be crazy not to like this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I like the actors in a movie and the movie itself it OK, but but not that great I won't go to the trouble to see it in the theater more than once. "Pearl Harbor" has been in theaters for only two days and most people have seen this film once so far. I've already seen it twice and I love it more and more! I first saw the film late Tues. night b/c of a special situation and even in my tired state at 4 AM I was dangerously close to writing the production company to tell them how AMAZING "Pearl Harbor" is.Some critics have said the only good part about the film is the actual bombing scenes of Pearl Harbor, but I believe the love story gives a face to the suffering for those, like myself, who are unrelated to the history. We have been removed from the pain and US History lectures aren't enough to comprehend the defeat, complexities, and final W.W.II victory started at Pearl Harbor. I believe The movie is a beautiful representation of the situations faced by all involved with a great cast, very real special effects (better than any other movie I've ever seen), and amazing camera shots that capture the emotions (e.g. blurred spots and slow motion to show confusion or devastation).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just came home after watching Pearl Harbor. The movie was great. The hour long scene of the bombing at Pearl Harbor was wonderful and was shot greatly. The directing of the film was excellent. Ben Affleck did a wonderful job in his role. Michael Bay also did a wonderful job.Almost everything was great. The only bad thing in the movie was that the Love Story was a bit too dragged. The first half of the film was basically about the love story. But the 60 minute bombing scene that came after that covered that small negative up. Most of the story was based on a true events that occurred during the war. This film is wonderful. I cant wait till it comes out on video. Go see it, u will not regret it. Even with that small little negative I give it 10 out 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The real history in this movie - is it so important?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people say, it is fictitious, not real history, but who can make a film nowadays about the Second World War, which is exactly the same, how it was then. But the most important thing here is, that if you like to watch real history, watch reality shows and documentary films, but not an artistic movie. This story about three main (created) characters makes this film interesting. It's entertainment, which is based on history. So you can learn something about history by sitting in front of TV- isn't it good? So if you are interested in history, you must watch this movie and if you like good lovestories, it is also for you. It's a good, interesting and lovely movie and I think, that many people agree with me. *Sorry, English is my foreign language, so there may be some writing mistakes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is a wonderful masterpiece in the art of movie making. This movie truly touched my heart and is the best movie so far sinceTitanic(1997). This movie has you on the verge of tears almost throughout the entire length of the film. They did a wonderful job of recreating the atmosphere of Pearl Harbor back in 1941. The quick romances that actually occurred between the men and the nurses in 1941 was beautifully portrayed. This was an actual factor in the tragedy of Pearl Harbor as many lives were lost and loved ones never to be found again. The movie was very accurate especially in the scene where a cook, Petty Officer Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr.) got on the guns to fight back at the Japanese Zeros. In history the real Dorie Miller did just that and was awarded the Silver Star. The characters in this movie recreate the sense of bravery and sacrifice that men and women actually portrayed during and after the attack on Pearl Harbor. On December 7, 1941 such bravery and sacrifice was indeed displayed and that is good to see in this movie. This is definitely a must see. This is a movie all of us will never forget!!I give this movie a 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite fallbacks, Pearl Harbor soars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dramatic climaxes. Love triangle. BIG explosions. Despite many harsh reviews Pearl Harbor did not sink, as many would have liked to see it do. Yes, you will have to sit on your butt for three, long hours but it is worth the time. And must I remind everyone of how many times the majority of us sat through Titanic? Ignoring the clichés and striking similarities between the two movies 'Pearl' tops Titanic on all levels. Enough said. The love triangle becomes a little monotonous, although what was M. Bay drinking when he did the casting? The only reason Ben received the lead was because his name was Ben Affleck, his role/character dangerously like that of his in Armageddon. No stunning performance there. And who decided to use Kate B. as the heroine of the movie? As the story progresses you wonder why these two men are fighting over her in the first place and by the end of the movie end up hating her and her character. Josh Hartnett, who by next year, should be up for at least one Oscar nod, captures the ONLY intelligently good role in the movie. The boy is seeping with talent that Hollywood is now, disappointingly, only discovering. Finally, there's that BIG 40 minute explosion scene, which I must admit wasn't too bad, although realistically, would never have looked like that. Despite some fallbacks, you'll get your money's worth. Some action, some romance, and, yeah, OK a numb butt. Ignore the critics- Pearl Harbor soars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt that the photography was very impressing, the color throughout and special effects especially when the attacking squadron flew between the our warships docked at Pearl Harbour.The story was very predictable, but I can handle a sappy romance as long as they are not too frequent.The acting was superb. Alec performed a great Jimmy Doolittle with his raspy dictatorial voice, although, I had the distinct honor of meeting Gen. Doolittle who was brought to my desk for introduction in the 80's and his voice was not such, lol.I felt that the movie brought out a personal side to this historical event; the surprise, helplessness and devastation; not just in the attack but with the three main characters' lives.I cried through the whole movie, so ladies, take your kleenex. The movie was so well made that every sad moment was followed by a comical moment. So, you are not left in the doldrums.There were about 1,000 attendees at the special advance viewing and at the end of the movie, we all clapped. This movie/story left you with a good feeling at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now to enjoy stuff like this, YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHEN TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY! The attack is incredible and has lots of fireworks and the Arizona was done in all its sickening detail. You see the 2 football-feild long ship go up like a 50 cent firecracker and you KNOW 1,117 men just went out into eternity (which is so much worse when you think that many weren't even saved!) The only event I can think of that was worse is what happened 14 months ago, 14 days before my 17th birthday in September, 2001. Now the film would be utterly beautiful if it could back up the FX with a good solid, based on history, PLOT. Unfortunately, Micheal was so mesmorized by the Sunsets that he forgot. The Battle over England was so realistic, I wish a whole film about 8th Air Force would come out that looked like that! Speaking of bombing raids, this film also covers the Doolittle Raid, and I can't find ANY inaccurracies in that part of the film, SO if you have a DVD of it you can just watch those parts (And they are worth the money in themselves).NOW, I love computer games and my favorite is World War 2 Fighters. I first saw this in a theater and seeing those P-40's take down enemy Zekes; well, it felt the same way as the game, (AND IF YOU'VE PLAYED WW2 FIGHTERS YOU KNOW THAT IS A GOOD THING!). So watch the first 5 minutes, fast foward 20 minutes, then another hour and 5 , and finally another hour to see the worthwhile stuff. I won't even start talking about the real plot. From reading others' comments, I think that's been covered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I put off seeing this movie because our actions towards Japan and Japanese-Americans were some of our lowest moments in history. Fortunately, this movie decided not to come anywhere near those events.This movie had to be made, just like Titanic had to be made. And just like Titanic, the Hollywood producers wouldn't have allowed them to be made due to their insane budgets unless the movie appealed to a large audience, and the best way to do that is to include a love story.Yes, the love stories were rushed and perhaps unnecessary, but that doesn't destroy the movie. I was surprised because I was on the brink of crying a few times.The action sequences were the best. This was a very toned down Michael Bay movie, if you can believe that, because although there were a lot of effects, they didn't seem so unrealistic or overdone. It was just right.I believe this may be the best war movie I've ever seen because it captured the emotions of the event so well, sort of the way Titanic captured the emotions, but not nearly as good...although perhaps better than the other war movies I've seen, and I've seen them all. It just killed me to see those Japanese planes keep bombing and bombing Pearl Harbor, and the U.S. military not being able to do anything about it. I kept wishing for the attacks to stop.The one thing I wished they did a better job of was showing us more of who these Japanese pilots were. I give this film a 10 because I went in expecting a 5 and was simply blown away (excuse the pun). I think if Michael Bay keeps the effects toned down, do some lower budget films, and keep the camera a little more steady, people may start to take him more seriously and maybe appreciate the talent he has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor, The Best of the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor, in my opinion, is one of the best movies I have seen. I have read may of the reviews by other members, and the derogatory comments they have made about the film, and yes, from their point of view, they are correct.What you have to understand before you can really appreciate a film like this is that although part of the plot is fiction, the rest is not. This means that the creators have to make the film fit into the framework of established historical fact. Not only the historic lines, but also the culture, the attitude of people in general, and the overall norms of that time.With this premise out of the way, I found the film to be very entertaining, romantic, and extremely authentic as far as props, attitudes, and historic content. It was a well spent three hours that I would do again.For me, it really answered many questions I had about the WWII era that in my personal research, I could not answer. In addition, being a hopeless romantic, I really loved the story, which was authentic for that time, as to how people acted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Perfect *possible spoiler*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard repeatedly that the love story was lacking before I saw that show, but that you should go just to see the 40 minute effects show. I couldn't agree less.I thought the entire movie (except for about 30 seconds at the end where they just got lazy with the story and a couple of other things I'll get into in a bit) was great. It was well balanced, and well shot. And the love story... the decision Evelyn had to make was heart wrenching. The interplay between the three main characters was wonderful. The battle scenes were riveting, hauntingly realistic without being gory. I started crying at about 8:30 and cried almost all the way through to 10:00, pausing only for the lame president scenes.That was a part of the movie I didn't think went over well, nothing against Jon Voight, I liked most of his stuff in this movie, but what seemed to be some sort of inspirational scene completely fell flat. The whole standing up thing was waaaay too hokey. I also didn't appreciate all the references to "Our Country" and "Us" in the version they released up here in Canada, I thought it was absolutely crude. They changed those words in other international releases, why not for us? We put up with enough Amerocentric crap as it is. I guess I have one other qualm about this movie, it seemed to me that the Cuba Gooding, Jr. bit of the movie was tacked on as an afterthought. It almost didn't fit. I hate to say it was just to expand the demographic, but that's what it seemed like.This movie did make me an instant Josh Hartnett fan, just add water and stir. That boy is gorgeous. I could go on and on. And on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The day of May 25th dawned. I was planning on attending opening night of Pearl Harbor with one of my good friends, Laura. We counted down the entire day, giggling and thinking with smiles that we would see Ben and Josh in uniform very soon. Well, we got to see them in uniform, but we got much more...Laura and I seated ourselves in the theater. We were pretty quiet, but talked about our friends, other movies, food, etc. to pass the time. I noticed by the fact that the theater was huge that this movie was going to be something. But I didn't pay much notice of it except for that observation. Then, the previews rolled, the lights dimmed, and the theater grew silent...then I watched...Several times while I was watching, I kept saying to myself "Are you really watching this? This is Pearl Harbor! The most talked about movie all year..." I remembered the bad reviews, e.g. Rotten Tomatoes, and wondered how they could beat on a movie that was so wonderful. It was completely lost on me. I said to myself "Were they even watching the movie?"As the movie ended, the lights came on, the credits rolled, and Faith Hill's unutterably beautiful song "There You'll Be" sounded from the speakers, I noticed the people were having a very difficult time getting up from their chairs, as I was. My hands were cupped around my chin, and I turned to Laura. She was wiping tears from her eyes. I finally got out of my seat quietly, as people began to exit the theater. Laura coughed, and said "So how about we shoot all those people that gave this bad reviews?" I heartily agreed, laughing.We stumbled up the stairs and outside, talking nonstop about how great the movie was. I took note that everyone walking out of the theater seemed to be having my difficulty walking, and I saw many wiping tears from their eyes and saying how awesome the movie was.Now, I'm no critic, but I have to say that this movie was probably the best I've seen in a long time. It ran the gamut from an epic-journey of grandeur, to a small-town tale of romance and heroism. The cast was stellar and refreshing. Ben Affleck shined in his role as Rafe, and delivered his lines wonderfully. Josh Hartnett was perfect for his role as well, as Danny Walker. He was both believeable and tremendously realistic. For Kate Beckinsale, this movie could be her big break. I was touched by her heroism and courage, and I felt my heart ache for her the entire time.Major kudos to Michael and Jerry, who were stars of this film without even being onscreen. They directed this movie very well, and the action scenes were phenomenal! Absolutely mind-blowing...astounding...I couldn't believe how good they were. They certainly did not disappoint.All in all...this is a masterpiece film. Critics trashed it...my friends trashed it...but I loved it. Ironic, I know. But for me, Laura, the audience, and the veterans...this is a movie to remember. :)</fullReview>

He did a great job on the love scenes and he did a great job in the death scene. He was just excellent! Rafe was good to, he also did a great job. The only part i didn't like about the whole movie, is that, at the end when Danny had died, they had Evelin and Rafe get back together. I thought it was OK for Danny and her to get together only because it was three months after they thought that Rafe had died but to show us that Rafe and her got together at the end it made me think that she was flip flopping. Plus she lied to Danny when he said that he thought that she loved Rafe more that she loved him, and she said i love YOU Danny. Well in the scene before that she said to Rafe that i will never be able to look at Danny and think the same about him the way that i did for you. But overall it was great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent retelling of the event that changed America!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an outstanding effort to take a tragic life-changing event and portray it in a realistic and heart-pounding manner. The film is also backed by a very supportive and entertaining storyline, which includes Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckinsale as the cast for a love triangle that makes the movie so it doesn't bore the audience. First of all, if all the entertainment business wanted to do with this movie was portray the attack on Pearl Harbor and only the attack on Pearl Harbor, the movie would only be approximately fifteen to twenty minutes in length, so there has to be some sort of storyline to back it up. Second of all, if all they wanted was an informative film that educates people about what happened sixty-four years ago on December 7, 1941, then they would be wasting their time with a pointless remake, as there already is a boring and disappointing movie out there like that entitled Tora! Tora! Tora! which was released in the year of 1971. No, they wanted something better. They wanted something that would attract a movie audience, not something that would attract a History Channel audience. In my opinion, this was accomplished successfully and wholesomely. Ben Affleck plays Captain Rafe McCawley whose only dream is to be a pilot. When a young woman named Evelyn Johnson (Beckinsale) deliberately passes him when she tests his sight even though he wasn't deserving of the deed, he immediately falls in love with her and the two become an item with no time wasted. However, a tragic event leads to emotions composed of envy and revenge. When December 7th comes upon them, people find that they must fight for their lives and their only chance of survival is through strength and hope. This is a wonderful and brilliant film that is supported by an outstanding cast, an excellent storyline, and a tragic ending that is guaranteed to leave you in tears.A well deserved 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film if you're looking for a 1940's style WWII film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's fashionable to bash Pearl Harbor, but in reality it's an amazing piece of film-making and tells a story that sorely needs to be told.So many people come to this film apparently expecting a modern, cynical take on the story - Quentin Tarentino's "Pulp Harbor," if you will. This is NOT and is not MEANT to be that type of film.Instead, the film reflects a 1940s sensibility, in which we see America attacked without warning, and what it takes to go from the nearly complete destruction of the Pacific Fleet to the first, largely symbolic attack on the Japanese mainland, the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo.Many people find the dialogue and story corny, yet watch most any World War II film made during that era and you'll find the same. Talk to many who were soldiers then and you'll find that people often did speak using the same speech patterns many people find to be trite and sappy today. That's what Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer were trying to achieve with this film, and they succeeded admirably.Watching this film gives you, if you hadn't already had one, the deepest possible empathy for those who survived the events of that day, the most horrific attack America had ever suffered prior to September 11, 2001.If what you're looking for is a modern, cynical take on the events of December 7, 1941, this is NOT the movie for you. But if you'd like some understanding of just what happened that Sunday morning, and a feel for how America rose to the challenge that faced her, you will enjoy Pearl Harbor.Or, watch the trailer. If you can't watch the Japanese Zeroes fly by the kids without getting a lump in your throat, if you are filled with dread at the knowledge of what is about to happen to the Arizona, this movie is for you.</fullReview>

I'm not a Hartnett fan for his looks (although he is very handsome) but for his incredible talent. I have seen this movie three times and cried every time. The great thing about this movie was that it did not seem like 3 hours because it just flowed together so beautifully. Simply put I would give Pearl Harbor: an A+++, a 10, two thumbs up. I think this movie and the cast deserve to win academy awards. Well that is my opinion thanks for reading.</fullReview>

I thought it was an awesome film and I will definitely buy it when the DVD hits stores! The only thing that I didn't like was the hype that led up to the film. I think that may have hurt it at the box offices which is too bad because it really is as good as Titanic but never should have been marketed that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do people hate this movie?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was an amazing movie, and I dont seee why people dont like it. Josh Hartnett and Ben Affleck are so talented in this movie, and the emotion in this movie is so true. The action sequences were incredible, but most people hat this movie because it was "mushy". Well, it's a love story, it's supposed to be romantic. I understand it almost had nothing to do with Pearl Harbor, but it was great all the same!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Within the first 10 minutes of watching, I could tell that this film was based on a forgotten, bad romantic movie from years one by. The film had a cast that could have been put to better use as the directing crew and writers clearly had far too much money and very little sense for what to do with it.When the protagonist finds out that his best friend has been having a relationship with his girlfriend, the moment, which could have been created beautifully just came across to be funny in a bad way.The only remotely good part of the film is when the large aircraft carrier is destroyed by a Japanese torpedo.If you are settling down for an evening with your partner and you want to watch a romantic film, do not make it this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first time I've given a "1" to a movie. To me, it's a terribly contrived, distorted, manipulation and convoluted representation of a terrible event, just to use special effects and make an exploitative commercial profit and who cares with facts and history.You will NOT see "Pearl Harbor" on sale at the main visitors' center/gift shop at Pearl Harbor. Nor will you see it on sale at the satellite shop on Ford Island.Instead, if they're not temporarily sold out, you will find the 1970-era classic "Tora! Tora! Tora!" It does a fantastic and credible job of telling the story behind the Japanese attack. And the special effects got an Academy award and they'll break your heart. A final thing: this movie had two directors and crews. An American director handled the U.S. side, and a Japanese director was responsible for presenting the Japanese side.In a single word, "Pearl Harbor" just "stinks."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, in my opinion, easily the worst movie ever made. It is three hours of pure horribleness. Bad acting, bad dialogue, a clumsy love triangle, blatant disregard for a monumental historical event, and Michael Bay all go together to make this monster turd the biggest and smelliest turd of them all. It is so bad that it isn't even funny- an overused saying for sure, but perfectly fitting in this situation. Now, had the movie not been called "Pearl Harbor", I'd probably have been kinder to it. Instead of just being very bad, however, the title clinches it for me as "the worst movie ever". Absolutely unwatchable garbage from start to finish, this "movie" is a disgrace to both cinema and America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor revisited by Hollywood.... and Michael Bay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is deceptive. I thought, as the title would have suggested, it would have been about Pearl Harbor and the vicious attack the Japanese did to us in 1941. It could have been if Tom Hanks and his staff would have written and produced the movie. (The ones who saw Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan or the Pacific would understand what I mean).But Michael Bay is not in that kind of movie. What he does is reuniting all the clichés he can get to plunge the audience in a bliss of emotions no matter if the story is completely accurate or absolutely not. He is using an heavy dose of explosions to keep us attracted and forget the multiple inaccuracies of the script.What we have here is a basic triangle romance with the war in the background. Sure we have 30 minutes focused on the attack but when you realize the movie is 3 hours long, it's pretty thin. Even more when most of the historical events are 'remodeled' to fit Michael Bay Love story. There were no Eagle squadron where US pilots join their British counterparts against the Nazis. That's pretty laughable when you realize that Ben Affleck character is in fact the only US pilot of the entire squadron so even Michael Bay is mistaking himself in its own stunt. It's also funny when Rafe is recovered by a French fishing boat while the Channel was technically blockaded by Nazi Navy but never mind.Same thing about the Doolittle Raid which was planned to give some hope and relief to the US people harshly knocked down by the flood of bad news coming from the Pacific front. In this movie, it's made as a revenge operation against the Japanese for Pearl Harbor with always the love triangle as main focus. (PS I find it quite unbelievable that fighter pilots can without extensive training fly a bomber in a finger clap) So technically speaking, this movie doesn't deserve more than a 4 out of 10. You don't play with history to fit your story. It's the opposite that should happen and Michael Bay doesn't seem to care at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Movies In One...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is probably one of the biggest targets for movie critics, everyone seems to enjoy picking this movie apart. I have seen Pearl Harbor several times and have enjoyed it, but it is obviously two movies blended together; a historical action/drama and a cheesy romance. The Pearl Harbor attack scenes ( Dec 7th, 1941 ) were amazing, some of the best war movie action sequences ever. John Voight was outstanding as President Roosevelt. But the romance part of the movie was nauseating, and seemed to be detached from the war story. A few cliché scenes didn't help either, and did the movie really need a character that stutters ( though I am a fan of Ewen Bremmer ). It was hard to take Dan Aykroyd seriously as a navy captain as he was a cast member from SNL. The Doolittle Raid was a great add to the movie ( 'We're going to Tokyo....and we're going to bomb it' got the adrenaline going! ), but after the raid was over, the movie seemed to go nowhere, like 'ok, what now?'.

He lacks the talent and sensitivity to tell stories. He is a one trick pony, whose one trick is neither interesting, nor original.There is nothing wrong with cheesy action movies and bad love stories. Many people enjoy them. But the subject matter, budget, and talent are all completely wasted on this disaster. Apparently Mr Bay could not find anything compelling about one of the most important events in American history, instead using the war as merely the backdrop for one of the worst love stories ever inflicted on an audience.Do yourself a favor, fast forward to the battle scenes and don't waste any more minutes of your life on the rest of this clichéd, uninteresting train wreck of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before he ruined Transformers, Michael Bay tried to re-write history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The visuals were amazing, but the film unfortunately sucked. We were all expecting this grand tale, also seen in Saving Private Ryan or Platoon. However, Michael Bay took one of the most significant moments in American History and one of the most significant moments of the Second World War and turned it into a three hour mess in which the morale of the story was "America-**** Yeah".My biggest problem with the film is the depiction of the events. When the Japanese attacked, they only attacked soldiers and did not target civilians while when the Americans attacked, they targeted civilians, and in the film it is the opposite. Also, I did not appreciate the Indiana Jones style stunts the pilots pull off, particularly during the attack on Pearl Harbor, I know the film was meant to reach a wider audience, including a younger audience but, WHY? Kids will learn about this stuff in school, I believe that in making the film more family friendly, they did not do the story justice. If you are going to represent a historical event, you must show all sides and not just the romanticized Hollywood version that kids will enjoy, if you want your kids to have a good time, take them to see a Disney film or a Superhero film, not a film depicting an important era in history.Though I did not find the acting was great, I did not feel that the actors had a great deal to work with from such a lack luster script as well as such hollowed out characters that were just walking clichés, Ben Affleck's character being the "cowboy" etc. And while giving these uninteresting characters the most screen time, the film takes focus away from the event it is meant to be portraying as well as actual real life characters such as Doris Miller or Roosevelt who had more of a right to have had their stories told.Overall, I am probably being too harsh to this film, but the saving graces are the technical aspects such as the explosions and the angles from the planes are actually quite good. The sad thing is, there is a good film in there somewhere but it was never realized and I hope if Hollywood ever visits this topic again, they will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War : a pretext for a love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rambo and Starship troopers' fans may have been quite upset as Pearl Harbor is a so-called war movie, focused on an impossible love story with war only in the background. Young and brilliant soldiers in love with the same beautiful nurse but separated by the fate of the war and intern betrayals: hard to make more stereotypical. Like many others, I was expected to watch a war movie -as the title may suggest- not a national drama left behind a romanticized plot. If I would have wanted to watch a good and silly romantic movie, I would have chosen Notting Hill. Pearl Harbor doesn't embody the perfect war movie (since it is told to have many historic inaccuracies) but it isn't a good love story neither, because everything happens too fast in this love triangle. Focusing on a love plot is not a problem in itself. It can maybe helps reaching a wider audience (girls don't generally go to see Rambo). But the problem remains in the fact that all the details in the movie sink into sentiment; the numerous sunsets, President Roosevelt's reactions, the social achievement of the black cooker... It seems like Michael Bay wanted us to cry every two seconds of the film. However, one could see above these failures because there are still few admirable things. Even if the war only begins at the middle of the film, it can't be totally denied that this is a war movie because the unique attack is remarkably realized. Despite the horror of the war and all its meanings linked to the notion, the public can't help but appreciating the shoots of all these bursts, fires ands smokes embellished by an awesome soundtrack. Not bloody but still realistic for the public, PH is maybe one of the first movies which represented war as something pleasant to see. To conclude,I don't think that the success of that movie is due to likelihood with reality nor the beauty of the shoots I just praised. I rather tend to think that Americans needed to see how exemplary their country and grand-parents were against these mad Japanese who attacked a peaceful and prosperous nation for blurred purposes. Each of the movie's characters (soldiers, medical staff, officers and cookers) embodies the best qualities of an American at war : absolute loyalty and sense of duty to their beloved homeland. So if (and only if) you like flag-waving movies, go to see Pearl Harbor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underwhelming 3 hours, drags a lot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pearl Harbor" is one of the most known films by director Michael Bay, a man who is know for works that mostly put visuals over everything and rarely convince through dialog, drama or suspense. His other works include "Transformers" and "Armageddon". "Pearl Harbor" scored four Academy Award nominations in the technical categories and won one of them. However, that is almost the only positive thing I can say about it. This film which runs for over 3 hours had just too many parts that added really nothing and just made it very boring to watch. The occasional parts of humor ("I lick you" instead of "I like you") did not work at all and even if (or maybe as) the script came from the writer of "Braveheart", the screenplay did not seem particularly refined.The first 30 minutes of the film are about the relationship between Affleck's and Beckinsale's characters. They fall in love, but he goes to war right afterward. We see lots of battle scenes next, especially with planes and it slowly moves towards the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. What I found strange though was how the scenes that involved the Japanese generals talking about the attack felt so unconnected to the action including Affleck and Hartnett as if it were two different films. Then there were also unrealistic scenes, like Cuba Gooding Jr. beating up a white man in a fight after he got beaten up completely before. A few words changed the outcome? Not gonna happen. By the way, Gooding Jr. already was an Academy Award winner when this was made and so was Affleck. He got his second not too long ago, again not for acting, but Hartnett, a big prospect almost 15 years ago, has become pretty irrelevant by now and is back to television work, even if that, with the great state TV is in these days, that isn't even a negative thing.But back to the movie. One of its biggest problems is that none of the characters were particularly likable, especially not Affleck's. Another criticism is that the acting simply isn't good. Those who give solid performances (like Alec Baldwin, Michael Shannon) only play minor parts or roles which they usually play, like in Baldwin's case an authority figure. So yeah, after 48 minutes, Affleck's character is already dead (seemingly) and I felt the speech that Hartnett's character gives at the funeral is something that did not come off as authentic, maybe because I never really felt the two had such a strong "best friend" connection.Also I have to say that I was not even wowed by the special effects and other technical aspects of the film. Maybe that came because the drama and relationship aspects weren't interesting. It's all style over substance, even if the Academy begs to differ. There was one scene when Japanaese planes fire at a car with the two protagonists in, but all of a sudden stop firing. I did not understand why as the car obviously was still driving, so somebody in there must have been alive. I guess there are more plot holes in this movie if you took a closer look for them. That is just one that I remembered. Also, with what the United States did to Japan later on, the film was slightly too patriotic for my taste.To end the review on a more positive note, I would like to say that I liked the song "There You'll Be" and I would not have minded it winning the Oscar. However, as a whole I cannot recommend watching this film. Looking at the fact that it ended up among the 10 most seen films from 2001 at the box office, far too many watched it already in proportion to its (lack of) quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talk about a bomb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** This review may contain spoilers *** Pearl Harbor doesn't seem to have been written by a professional screenwriter as much as it seems like a badly written assignment in a sixth grade creative writing class. The student gets an F and is made the stand in the corner.I am not exactly sure what history book this movie is derived from but if you can believe director Michael Bay and his movie, the events of December 7, 1941 were a premeditated attack on America to force a nurse to fall in love with the wrong guy. I never thought I'd see the day when a movie about That Day of Infamy would supply the Pearl Harbor invasion as a subplot but now I believe (and fear) that anything is possible.The movie stars Ben Affleck as Rafe an Army pilot and standard issue World War II movie hero who looks good in a uniform and is about as interesting as a five-pound sack of flour. He's not a man loaded with wit and his sentiments invite way too many bad laughs. Such formidable nuggets of banality come in the form of lines like "I'm not anxious to die sir, just anxious to matter" and "I almost died in that plane and her face lead me to the ground".Ug! The face belongs to Evelyn, played with drywall intensity by Kate Beckinsale. She can't decide if she loves Rafe or the equally dunder-headed Danny Walker (John Hartnett), Rafe's best friend. Evelyn is in love with Rafe but when he's reported dead she jumps ship and falls in love with Danny. Rafe comes back, none too happy that this union has taken place and Oh by the way the Japanese suddenly attack Pearl Harbor.Danny and Rafe put their differences aside and join Jimmy Doolittle's air corps that is going to launch a retaliatory strike on the Japanese. Unfortunately that means that we have the sit through nearly 90 minutes of discussions about who will get Evelyn, what the war means, what America is all about and who is not coming back.We are also subjected to that time-worn scene where the General addresses his troops on the airstrip by saying "Take a good look at the man next to you, its a good bet that in the next six weeks either you or he will be dead. Everyone brave enough to except this, step forward." Of course EVERYONE steps forward in unison. I'm not a military genius but it seems to me that you'd have to be REALLY brave not to step forward. I'd like just one scene where everyone steps forward and suddenly the guy on the end changes his mind and steps back.In the meantime, Franklin Roosevelt (Jon Voight) sits in the White House and tries to figure out what to do about this Pearl Harbor business. Voight plays FDR caked under 40 pounds of make-up (20 of it is chin). There isn't much wrong with Voight's performance as the great president except that he plays the role like . . . well like Jon Voight doing and impression of FDR.Even his dialogue is at the level of driftwood. He offers such priceless lines as "Do not tell me it can't be done!" and "I like sub commanders. They have no time for bulls**t, and neither do I". Apparently he was saving the good stuff for his fireside chats.Sitting down to watch the film I wondered why the Japanese didn't protest. Having seen the film I now know why: The Japanese have so little screen time in the film that they are mostly played as extras. When they are on screen it's all as a matter of planning and then some pseudo-remorse for what they've done. There is a priceless scene involving the Japanese Generals planning a sea attack with toy boats in a pond.Then comes the 40 minute climax, lauded as a grand spectacle of special effects as the American air force strike back. The battle is portrayed as a long series of games of chicken in which Ben Affleck shouts at his enemy before coming inches from a head on collision. On the ground Cuba Gooding Jr. goes against an order given by his racist superiors and boards a machine-gun turret and shoots down several enemy planes. Of all the clichés I thought this movie would avoid, the token black guy was one of them.The historical inaccuracies in Pearl Harbor are endless. There is not a single element that this movie gets right. Oh wait! There is one, the poster's tagline says "December 7th, 1941 . . .It was a Sunday". That one they got right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's only good if you're in it for the romance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I do agree with the fact that this story is mainly based on a love triangle with 2 best friends and a girl, I still believe that the director (Micheal Bay) did a decent job on capturing the Pearl Harbor event.The movie... has too many fillers in it. There's a lot of pointless scenes in the movie that should have been cut out, like a previous critic reviewer said "a 2 hour movie stretched into 3."If you look at Micheal Bay's movies, they are all typically long movies... Titanic, Avatar, etc. Plus, Micheal Bay movies are also typically based around LOVE STORIES. If you looked at the cover of the movie where it says "Pearl Harbor" then "directed by Micheal Bay" you can't complain about the romance in the movie, because that's practically a given on almost any Micheal Bay movie.Just like Titanic, it's a romance twisted around a real life event. The romance drama is actually very good and it keeps you locked into the movie. I really liked the situation of the love triangle and the fact that Rafe came back to find that his one and only love had fallen in love with his closest &amp; best friend Danny. HONESTLY, THE WHOLE STORY REVOLVING THE ROMANCE WAS GREAT.Where the movie lacks MAJORLY is the accuracy of the real life event of Pearl Harbor. Now the reason why this movie has a big fat ol' "F" of a rating on IMDb "5.8" is because when you call a movie "Pearl Harbor" IT SHOULD BE ABOUT PEARL HARBOR. There was a lot of foreshadowing throughout the movie that Pearl Harbor was the target for the Japanese. Why? I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE Micheal BAY DIDN'T TELL US. People who have no historical knowledge of Pearl Harbor will feel lost watching this movie. BESIDES THE FACT THAT PEOPLE DIED AND THE Japanese BOMBED PEARL HARBOR, WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON.Also, the film featured "Doris Miller" and his story of the black cook hero of Pearl Harbor. You don't know who Doris is? Well that sucks. Micheal Bay apparently didn't want to do a very good job at explaining who he was. He comes in a scene here, then a scene there, and all of a sudden he's shooting down an aircraft. Why this has any sort of importance, WE DON'T KNOW. Then he gets a medal, why? WE DON'T KNOW.Overall, one half of the movie I'm like "YES I LOVE IT" the other half I'm like "THIS IS TERRIBLE"So I'm giving this movie a 6.5 (I put 7 though)Not one of Micheal Bay's best movies.... BUT IT'S STILL WORTH WATCHING.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as "Tora! Tora! Tora!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor I thought was an OK movie, but not great movie by any means. The movie follows the lives of two best friends, Danny, played by Josh Hartnett (Virgin Suicides) and Rafe, played by Ben Affleck (Good Will Hunting). Coincidentally they both fall in love with the same girl, played by Kate Beckinsale. It soon turns out to be an almost soap-opera like love triangle which to me is too ridiculous. Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy) gives one of the most realistic portrayals and best performance as President Roosevelt. Also Alec Baldwin (The Shadow) gave a good performance as the head aviation commander. The movie also stars many other famous stars such as Cuba Gooding Jr., Dan Aykroyd, and Tom Seizmore. Pearl Harbor probably had to be one of the best movies on Pearl Harbor because of the realistic dogfights, the special effects, and the acting, especially Jon Voight's. Unfortunately the romance segments of the movie are stupid and pointless. If I were the director, I would try to keep the romance parts of the movie to a bare minimum. There are also, many fast camera movements during the attack on Pearl Harbor, which I liked. I am also surprised it got a PG-13 rating. The bombing of Pearl Harbor was pretty violent and bloody. Overall, I recommend this movie to everyone, but just skip the romance part of the movie. It goes without saying that everyone thinks "Tora! Tora! Tora!" is MUCH better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This World War II Epic was a fantastic mix of romance, drama, and disaster. Highly criticized for all of that, the movie is highly underrated.One thing that people say is, "This is just a copy of Titanic". Well if they haven't noticed, this isn't about one ship. This is about dozens of ships, planes, and people fighting against an invading enemy. Titanic was excellent, but this movie was nothing like it(besides the romance).Another thing that people complain about is its historical inaccuracy. Those people have to know that to make a historical moment into a drama film, you must adjust some things. Plus, if you add in everything that was important, as well as all historical moments, the length of the film can be higher than it already is.The last criticism is, that this movie was too long. Three hours and ten minutes is not long! If you are fine watching Titanic, you should be perfectly fine watching Pearl Harbor. There is absolutely no reason to complain about its length if it tells the story very well.The actors/actresses in the movie made it come alive! Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Hartnett are all fantastic actors. The supporting cast was also excellent and recognizable. Such as Cuba Gooding Jr.(Snow Dogs), Dan Aykroyd(Ghostbusters), and Alec Baldwin(Beetlejuice). Overall, the movie was highly underrated, and 10 out of 10 stars was not enough.</fullReview>

Relationship between Rafe and Evelyn and Danny and Evelyn should have been more described and better realized.Then the movie could worth something.Like this it all happen's too fast and all the character's look like some moron's. The movie wasn't directed badly as written badly which is quiet surprising since the screenplay was written by Randall Wallace.Where are the Japanies in this story.They look like nothing but a terrorist's.They had innocent's dying too but in this movie only American's have lost their loved ones.This is supposed to be something like Flag's Of Our Father's and Letter's From Iwo Jima,then it would be worth of something.Like this it's nothing but a wasted three hour epic story with some fun in it. All the acting talent was wasted in this movie.It's worth watching it just too see how epic movies can turn bad.It has some fun in it but there are better way's to waste three hour's of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, the movie is called "Pearl Harbour" not "Some guy screws his buddy's girlfriend". Sheesh! get on with the frickin' story. This movie is basically a really cheesy chick flick disguised as a war movie for the first 1/2 of the film.It's not just that this is a chick flick... it's not even a very good one. The characters do stupid things and react in shallow ways to the situation, and we're supposed to "feel" for their predicament. Sorry, dude. I'm not a 14 year-old girl.And don't get me started on how the 1940s women were carrying on like a bunch of bone-hungry sexually-liberated women of the 1990s. That was beyond nauseating.But once the actual story gets started, about 90 minutes in, this movie is pretty good. Very dramatic, very intense visuals, lots of heart. It does what every war movie should: paying tribute to the courage of the brave and noble, while trying to find meaning behind the actions of "the bad guys".If not for the whole romantic "subplot" which pretty much dominates most of the film, this would have been nearly a classic. As it stands, I was sitting there with my testicles retreating for cover from the barrage of estrogen-fueled "feelings" and wondering if Mrs. Bay was the one who really directed this thing.When I watch the DVD, I start it from the morning of the attack and it's a perfectly fine movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I am a huge fan of movies with great cgi content.....Yet, they only utilized that for what 13 minutes of the battle...This shouldn't be called pearl harbor..Because, it really isn't all about pearl harbor....It's the love story...BAAAHH....Well, I love romantic movies and there are only some that strike my fancy but that's another story. Pearl Harbor won an academy award only because that was a slow year for quality movies. The only thing that I loved about this movie is Hans Zimmer's musical scores...This movie is not historically correct and I have been a little 'Iffy' with Hollywood lately and their lack of originality. They can basically do anything and shoot anywhere and yet they still produce garbage. Why, waste all the money doing that? I guess I am such a hard-a** because I have been involved in the film industry for quite some time. I mainly produce short films for festivals but that is totally irrelevant...What I am trying to say is with the work that I do I give it my all. I am all about originality not repetiveness. Sure, Michael Bay is still one of the best directors in my opinion but it seemed like he was short handed this one. I didn't feel "The Bay Experience" so to say..If your intentions on renting this film as a nice historical breath of air war movie....I am sad to say no. Just no...If you want to see an over budget non-original piece of work. Then by all means go right ahead. It is just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll try to keep it short. I don't want to keep you up for long with my hymns about how distasteful and dumb this movie is. I'll try to keep it all in a nutshell.Let's start with the actors. One-face Affleck meets pretty-boy Hartnett. I kinda miss the part where these two show a believable performance as soldiers. They are kids on a playground! They don't deliver any drama or horror. They are what they are: Third class actors.The plot. Oh my god, the plot...not ending garbage about romance, friendship, loyalty and so on. And then, oh dear Lord, war comes to Hawaii. And you feel pretty comfortable watching the action on the screen. I don't want to feel happy when I watch a movie about a war! I wanna feel thrilled, disgusted, touched! This isn't BAD BOYS! Michael Bay is a great director for shallow, entertaining and funny action films. BAD BOYS II is marvelous. But this here? No way. This is an insult. Shame on everyone, who worked on this movie! They showed a big lack of sensibility or even sanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guess you could say I was unlucky to watch this horrible film when I was in Japan in the summer of 2002. I was on a navy base watching in the room with the people I was staying with.The only thing I was glad for was when I feel asleep and missed the second half of the film. The acting in general is bad. I mean Cuba Goodin Jr. does fine in this movie, it's just well, every one else kinda seemed, well pointless. The lines were really cheesy, and I've heard better lines come from bad b movies.Second the historical accuracy of this film, was really bad as well. It was sicken to watch this film, and the pain ended when I fell asleep.All in all, there are FAR better WWII movies out there to watch, so just ignore this piece of trash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch Pearl Harbor for fun not for history accuracy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello For All of You that have seen Pearl Harbor, I have one thing to say check all historical references at the door, the movie sucks from that point of view, I watch it for the planes, I have counted five times that both Rafe and Danny should have been shot down. A P-40 could never out fly a Zero. Plus both Ken Taylor and George Welch tangled with Vals instead of Zeros. The filming is also bad, For all you rail Buffs check out the tail end of an Amtrak Barney, AMD103 when Rafe goes to fly for the RAF, WideScreen is needed in this part of the film. What Evelin Says at the end of the film is also not true but, it did give the Japanese the excuse to go after Midway and for those who don't know what happened the Japanese lost four of their finest aircraft carriers. Another thing the Battle of Britain was over in 1940, the Eagle Squadron was flying with the RAF going over France. For action and watching planes this is a good movie for historic it is terrible. My advice, Watch Pearl Harbor, then turn around and watch Tora Tora tora, or the Pearl the 1978 Minisearies</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historical Error</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the movie is entertaining and the special effects are great the movie does contain many errors. The story line of the two P40 pilots who flew out of auxillary field and successfully attacked and downed some of the attacking Japaneses planes is accurate. This movie is entertainment, for learning about the attack on Pearl Harbor I would recommend Tora, Tora, Tora for more historical accuracy. In Pearl Harbor (the movie) an additional error not prevails identified is seen at the completion of the launch of the raid by the Doolittle Raiders. You can see up to about 15 of the Raiders. They were launching at extreme range and had no time to wait for anyone else to launch and join in formation, simply to get off the carrier and head for their individual targets. You would not have seen a scene like this by the original Doolittle Raiders launching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just a poorly made movie. Michael Bay annoys me as a director and always has. He's so enchanted with pretty pictures and rock video editing that he can't just tell a story. This man should not be allowed to direct anything more substantial than a commercial. The script of this movie is big, clumsy and - well - it fits Michael Bay movies, come to think of it. My hope was that with all the resources and (mostly) talent involved with this movie that you would have seen a contemporary tribute to the men who lost their lives, sort of a "Saving Private Ryan" for Pearl Harbor. But this is just sad. Pretty people shot by a director who likes pretty pictures in lieu of telling stories. Find another movie about this topic -- even "Tora! Tora! Tora!" would be better. This is just a waste. (I'm only giving it 2 points instead of 1 because I'm gaga for Kate Beckinsale.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I don't let the little blooper or errors in a movie bother me. But this Pearl Harbor movie was so full of such obvious crap, well they really spoiled the movie. I know the movie makers were lazy and figure movie watchers are stupid, but come on now, at least make a LITTLE effort to get things right. I'm glad I didn't waste any money going to a theater because "YUK", what a waste of time. Now if I can just remember the director and producer, I'll make a point of never watching one of their movies.Angled flight decks on carriers, modern cruisers in Pearl Harbor, license plates with later years,.. the list goes on and on. And these (among others) were noticed the first time (and only) time I watched the movie. I find the quality of the entire movie an insult to anyone with a brain. Since a there was considerable CGI there is no excuse for those kind of errors.</fullReview>

Tora! in gravity as the moon is from earth. In plain English, instead of a good WWII drama, I saw a shallow love story - made unbearable to watch by predictable, eeewy gooey dialogue, and absolutely zero chemistry between any of the players involved.In sum, this is a boring, poorly done love story with achingly predictable plot lines that will make you wince. And in the background is all this pesky war stuff; it made things all inconvenient and junk.Skip this movie and rent Tora! Tora!

		<fullReview>This movie would have been a whole lot better if the entire love story was cut. And if the action started right away. All though the special effects are good like all the explosions and battleship row is good. I would ave to say Cuba Gooding Jr. did the best and Ben affleck the worst. Plus they had a handful of goofs as well like: when Danny (josh harnett) and Gooz are taking off during Doolittle's raid the carrier has a yellow line but when it shows a close up you see a modern carrier with the catapult thing on the deck to launch the planes off. Also during Doolittle's raid after they drop their bombs on Tokyo and finally reach the Chinese coast it shows it flat but but then about 30 seconds later its rocky and mountains cover it. I rate this a 5/10 because the effects of the explosions and the battleship row scenes are good but other than that terrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very disappointed about the part when that guy was telling him that it was a death situation and if anyone wanted to step forward they should and everyone stepped forward at the same time... Now this is classic fake patriotism. And while they were in the plane they were taking about chicken chase.. And I was really disappointed when Ben Afflec started cheering as he fired air to air missiles. The girl obviously has issues, she is in love with two guys. Why the hell are they so close to the bombs in the planes, I don't get it. The gays has didn't do anything wrong you know. What the hell there's a weird kid in the movie when they fill up gas. THEY MISCALCULATED THE GAS? They survived the plane crash, VERY REALISTIC. Just a few coughs from Ben Afleck made it through. He used his mighty pistol to stop the machine gun fire from the Japanese then a plane comes at exactly the right time and kills everyone. Danny is just a little bit hurt. So that solves the problem with that girl and now Afleck is gonna marry her. Now that is true patriotism. Then suddenly they cut the movie and we see her looking slow mo as usual Hollywood bullshit.. she touches his clothes then a hug, then narrating, the end.I enjoyed watching the commercials more than the movie itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular Action That Disgraces History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh Michael Bay. How the world loves to bash your films for being devoid of plot, character development and anything which could be remotely described as intelligent. So why a 4 and not a 1? I'll explain that in a minute.First let me say that I love Michael Bay films for what they are. Mindless action movies that you can unplug your brain to. If I wanted to see great character development I'd pick something from the Michael Mann collection. If I wanted to see awesome martial arts, I'd make sure Yuen Wo Ping was the fight choreographer. If I wanted a great story... well you get the idea. When I want explosions devoid of plot, I turn to Michael Bay. This is why when I heard he was directing Pearl Harbor I immediately became sick to my stomach.Michael Bay, you have disgraced history, disgraced anyone who fought off the Japanese at Pearl Harbor, disgraced anyone who survived the incident and you did it all to make the explosions look prettier. To alter the incidents which took place at Pearl Harbor and expect people to respect you is asking for it big time. Would you do the same with a film about the World Trade Center Twin Towers? When it comes to making movies regarding events in history that involved a great loss of life, people demand that you stick to the facts.This is where Pearl Harbor fails miserably. Disregarding facts to increase the length of action sequences was a bad move. Things like playing chicken with P40s? Give me a break. Playing chicken and successfully taking out 4 Zeros in the process? Embellishments like increasing the death toll where it counts in order to further the emotional impact is also a big no no. I'm referring to on screen death of a Navy Nurse.The actors themselves seem out of place and miscast. Whereas Hartnett was excellent in Black Hawk Down as Sgt. Eversman he seemed like a lost 12 year old kid here who was more afraid of Afflecks accent and acting than the Japanese. Affleck...well...Affleck. Kate Beckinsale is a looker but she has no place in a film like this. In fact the whole love triangle has no place in a film like this. Hollywood needs to understand that good films fill seats and that relying on big names will only work for so long. Time to start casting the right people for the right role. Plot wise and with regards to accuracy, this movie is garbage. Typical Bay fanfare. Someone didn't do their homework as Mitchel Field was spelled with two Ls. Hartnett's line "I think World War II just started" when WWI was still referred to as "The Great War" in those times. Factual inaccuracies like this are inexcusable. More importantly, World War II did not begin with the bombing of Pearl Harbor. It was preempted when Japan invaded China in '37 and began in '39 when Germany invaded Poland. Why does Hollywood assume history always revolves around the United States?Now with all of that being said, you're probably wondering again why I gave this film 4 stars. In my opinion Michael Bay has succeeded in creating what are arguably some of the finest action sequences ever, despite the fact that they are horribly inaccurate. Because it's Pearl Harbor I have no tolerance for ignoring history. It's a shame really. If Bay had stuck to history, this movie would have won academy awards left and right. The action was amazing (aside from the occasional X-Wing handling capabilities which I didn't know MEs, P40s, Spitfires and Zeros possessed). Because of the fantastic direction regarding the action, I gave this film an extra 3 stars. But this doesn't excuse the horrible plot and blatant disregard for the facts (geez how many times have I said that). In the end, Pearl Harbor is a pitiful Hollywood trash film with explosive but unrealistic action sequences that pay no attention to history.Michael Bay, you make wonderfully entertaining popcorn action flicks, but for the sake of mankind please stay away from history.</fullReview>

Couldn't anyone at Disney do some research and get that right at least. Everything about this movie was horrible, the directing to the script writing. At least one would think the battles would be somewhat accurate. I mean in every war film the color of the Zero before 1943 is show as white. Couldn't some Hollywood hotshot watch the movie, Tora Tora Tora!!! How will countries like Japan take this movie seriously if Americans can't even get show historical accuracy.

		<shortDescription>It has some good moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When PEARL HARBOR was first released, I was, I admit, a silly teenage female. While watching the film, my thoughts were not focused on how historical it was, how well the plot developed, the emotions, or the acting skills. Instead, my thoughts went along the lines of: "Josh Hartnett! Ben Affleck! *SQUEE!*" I am pleased to say that this is no longer the case. I finally watched the film with a critical perspective, and must agree with many of the reviews. The romantic plot, to put it mildly, was not good. The actors were not very good, the script wasn't very good, and the dialogue was just awful and trite. I often found myself rolling my eyes and wondering when in the world they would get to the good action part.As for the Pearl Harbor bombing sequence, that was (in my opinion) an amazing scene. The background music fit the mood perfectly, the effects were beautiful, and it just seemed to overall capture the true tragedy of the events. Of course, this was all ruined by the appearance of our two 'heroes'. They killed the mood, and I could just hear all of the preteen and teenage females in the world sighing and staring at the actors.The after sequence of the attacks, in the hospital and the ships, was also quite well done, I thought. I found it very emotional and tragic. Of course, I did not feel this way when it was once again ruined by the appearance of the title characters, but lucky for me, they did not show up to much in either of these sequences.After that, the movie just went downhill. We had to witness more cliché 'plot twists', I suppose they meant for the pregnancy to be, and we had to see the actors attempt to act (and fail miserably.) But by far, the worst acting was shown at the end, when the character Danny dies. I had to bite my lip to keep from laughing. The whole thing was like a parody of a death scene, complete with touching speeches. I half expected Danny to whisper: "The light! I see the light!" He didn't say that, though he did mention being cold.Overall, I suppose I must give two grades.Acting: 1/5 Bombing sequence: 5/5.</fullReview>

In reality one plane just managed to get up into the air before it was shot down. No Japanese aircraft were lost to American planes during the raid! What the hell has the romance got to do with Pearl Habour? The worst thing about this film is that it is a recruiting film.

How would your expectation of the film have been different if it wasn't so titled?If you're gonna make up a story around a historical event, don't call it the historical event, call it the story. I mean, they didn't call Dr. Zhivago: "The Revolution" What do you think when you hear the title? I think - a love story about a progressive writer set against early 20th century Russian political struggle. People don't try to take the thing too seriously. It's just plain inappropriate. So what we have here is egotism and ignorance and greed. Putting a Japanese flag on an American ship for a movie? Have you no shame?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie severely disappointed me. I was expecting an epic romance, a wonderful war movie with maybe even a little bit of social commentary on current/impending wars going on at the time of the film's production. I missed seeing it in theatres, which was probably a mistake, since the movie had exceptional special effects and very good (if not gimmicky) cinematography. The production aspects of the film were probably the only thing the movie excelled at. The acting was appalling. Kate Beckinsale failed to make any clear choices for her character or her motivations, and the two men served as great eye candy but really nothing more. It all added up to a cheesy love story about love carrying on through all and conquering all, without believing, at any time, that anybody was really in love at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor could have been bigger then Titanic, so what happened??? There was a number of things that caused this movie to flop it the way it did. 1. The story about best friends falling for that same girl. 2. The films running time of 187 minutes. 3. Using some cheap CGI shots. 4. The attack on Pearl Harbor doesn't happen till 93 minutes into the film. 5. The love and passion. 6. The music. 7. The uneven filming and pace.I'm blaming Michael Bay for the films box office flop! It looks like he tried to copy Titanic's method of a love story, it just doesn't belong in a movie like this. Even though that the love story didn't go with the film. The film had great special effects, the attack on Pearl Harbor is one of the best ever filmed! But you can tell sometimes that they ran out of money because some of the effects are cheap CGI shots. (Notice this in the Battle of Britian dogfight).Maybe if this film had a better writer, if Michael Bay was thinking right not to have a crappy love story and if the movie was cut down to an easy 2 hours, (and there was a lot of stuff that he could have cut from the film). This could have been one of the biggest blockbusters in film history. I'll give the movie a 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

This film was made with the intent to follow in "Titanic's" profitable footsteps by combining romance with disaster, but the only difference is that the love story served "Titanic's" goal to convey the tragedy on an emotional level never before achieved on film whereas in "Pearl Harbor," it just gets in the way. The characters are wooden and the love story is as unbelievable as Ben Affleck is playing a soldier. The only decent performances were Jon Voight (as FDR) and Cuba Gooding Jr., but neither have large parts. There are very few good things that I can say about this film because, as a whole, it has no point and carries no message. Luckily, it is kind of nice to look at, the cinematography is good and the special effects are, at times, brilliant. That's enough for me to watch it maybe once a decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not the right subject for "Titanic type story telling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Question?what do you get with a combination of Jerry Bruckheiner,$150million budget and a screenplay based on one of the most important historical events in modern history,Ansewer,a complete mess.Micheal bay's reconstruction of the infamous attack by the Japanese air-force on the American pacific fleet based at Pearl harbor in December 1941 is 30 minute's worth of impressive film making which looks spectacular on screen ,Its just the other 130 minutes of "Pearl harbor" that is a complete load of rubbish. The film tries to pack to many subjects into one movie and in the end this is it's downfall.What you get is a war film,buddy movie,love story,biographical account of historical people and events,defeat and victory all mixed in to a 3 hour film that should of been only 2. The prolonged sickerly-sweet love triangle and the doolittle raid were totally unnecessary given the most crucial aspect of the film was the attack on Pearl itself,And if the director had had concentrated on that subject alone instead of going down the "Titanic" route of story telling (love story set against a sombre theme)it could of turned out so much better.The set pieces are effective and use the aid of modern digital technology to it's advantage,Bringing the aerial sequence's to life which are thoroughly eye catching.Though sum of these scenes are spoilled by the gung-ho American approach.Points being the young USAF pilot being inexperienced in the field of air combat but able to jump straight into a spitfire and take on the Luftwaffe and later Japanese zero's,But where supposed not to notice that. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the script and the wooden acting.Ben Affeck and Josh Harnett give it their best as Raffe and Danny but are not convincing enough in the period characters they are playing,Kate Beckinsale's character Everlyn gives you the impression that she would open her legs for any serviceman with a little bit of charming and Ewen Brenner's stuttering character is just annoying,As for Cuba Gooding jnr's take of Dorris Miller, that is the worst and not done to the right effect. That said there are some creditable performance's from Jon voight as FD Roosevelt and Alec Baldwin does a good job playing Lt col Doolittle.But these roles are lost among a weak scripted.The film tries and fail's in bits to tell the story of WHY and HOW the Japanese planned and then attacked Pearl harbor from a Japanese point of view,Unfortunately their isn't enough of an explanation of why,just they refuse(the US) to give us vital oil,and the how is a very quick bunch of scene's and not explained with enough focus on the actual event,the director's to anxious to get back to the love story and blowing ship's up.THEN THE MOVIE TAKE'S A ON AN UNNECESSARY THIRD ACT.After the humiliating defeat by the "Jap's" at Pearl harbor it's time for the Americans to kick some ass,This is achieved by the Doolittle raid on Tokyo which is historically accurate but the timing of it is not ,Or the film gives you that impression! The Doolittle raid tuck place around the middle of 1942 after which time the imperial Japanese had occupied much of south east Asia including American territory(the film fails to tell you this). And this is how the film ends with Raffe and Danny crashed landed in China after the Tokyo raid.(what about the US pilots captured over Tokyo,which also doesn't get a mention in the film).I do like the bit where during the Pearl harbor attack Danny say's the line "world war two as just started" to inform everyone as to why there being blown to bits,I wounder what the British,French,Canadian and Russian force's would of made of this belated observation by the young American. To sum all this up i would say the film is a embarrassment and insult to the veterans on both side's(OK the Japanese were no angels)but the American's never fought back at Pearl harbor the way it is shown in this film .If your looking for an account of the events in the pacific field of combat during 1941 try watching "Tora Tora tora".If your offeneded by the good ole American view of the war"(what defeats)"then i recommended you stair clear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Sleeping Giant Never Really Awakens.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How could one possibly describe Pearl Harbor in one sentence? For me, it's saying this: it's a completely difficult one to judge. I really cannot say whether it's a bad film or a good one ? it's neither. It was obviously made for big bucks at the box-office, but it is quite hard to tell if Bay was interested in creating a good movie or not.Pilots Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) have been best friends since childhood. Soon, Rafe finds out that he has to leave for England to fight with the RAF during pre-WWII for America. He soon says goodbye to Danny, and his loving girlfriend, Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale). When Rafe is supposedly shot down in France, Danny tells Evelyn. Soon, the two fall in love and turn to one another after the tragedy. But, months later, it turns out that Rafe is still alive and comes to visit Evelyn and Danny at their new base in Hawaii. Though the three are held in a tough situation, it gets even worse the next day when the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor, drawing America into World War II.I don't know whether I should begin stating the strengths or weaknesses ? so I'm going to do both. I'll start with the main relation to the title- the attack sequence. The special effects are stunning. The scene would have been an achievement in cinematic action scenes if it weren't for the film's bad reputation. Not including the beginning or aftermath, the attack lasts over half an hour. That means, as exhilarating as it is, it's very hard to watch soldiers and innocent people being shot and blown up. It is very depressing, and not very fun to watch.Michael Bay is best known for making loud action pictures ("The Rock", "Bad Boys"), and many label this as his worst film. I really do think that this is one of his harder works, but I would not call this a good movie either, and nor did I not enjoy it much. It seems like Bay would rather concentrate on the action and effects rather than the characters and their emotions (with a good screenplay).The script in the film seems completely rushed and written without much thought. "Pearl Harbor" has very weak comedy, tedious love exchanges between the characters, and a clichéd, predictable outcome. I think Bay has tried too hard to create a Hollywood, love-story action masterpiece, but since it comes off as both a 'guy movie' and a 'chick flick' with such strong manner, it probably won't appeal to either sex.The love sequence is probably the film's main weakness. Like the script, the love story has been recycled in many other films, mainly reminding us of "Titanic". "Titanic" had a fresh love story, great visuals, wonderful acting, and a terrific script. "Pearl Harbor" is missing over half of these qualities. "Pearl Harbor" was meant to portray America as a tough nation during WWII, but Bay belabors the point, and almost makes it Anti-Japanese (especially by giving us an unnecessary last 1/3 of the film showing a revenge attack).I admit, the acting is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. Affleck is pretty bad, yes, but he has done worse. Hartnett actually isn't too bad, but was better in Ridley Scott's "Black Hawk Down". The supporting performances are pretty poor, aside of familiar faces such as Cuba Gooding Jr., Jon Voight, Alec Baldwin and Tom Sizemore.Overall, I would say that "Pearl Harbor" is an epic cinematic disappointment. A movie that could have been so much more than it is. However, it is a prime example of today's movie-making ? how some films are made strictly for money, and not good criticism. I would say that I don't recommend "Pearl Harbor", but if you are a hardcore action movie fan, who can stand a long running length and a cheesy script, then go for it. Not really a bad film, just one that could have made itself so much more. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you want to watch a movie about pearl harbour, don't watch this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before we start lets say this movie isn't a success. It does have its ups, but unfortunately it crashes like Ben Affleck's spitfire in the movie in most other areas.The convoluted love triangle between Beckinsale, Hartnett and Affleck left me horrified that this was going to be yet another "Titanic". And yes, it was. As usual the film attempts to attract the female audience to the film with the romance, with the side effect of boring the whole theatre witless as this is played out with clichéd film-craft and wooden dialogue, not to mention some dire acting from Hartnett, who would have been more at home in a Pantomime than this idealised rubbish.Of course the battle scene is impressive, with excellent CGI and very good film-making displayed. It was clearly well thought out and executed and the inclusion of Cuba Gooding Jnr as the heroic black seaman, although it sounds corny, is surprisingly entertaining. Unfortunately this trips over too, as the two "heroes" dogfight with the Japos over the harbour. Yes, that is historically accurate, in case you missed it that was sarcasm. The film then deviates on some strange tangent about the Doolittle raid, which while interesting, really had little relevance to the Pearl Harbour raid, and served only to set up the inevitable "NOOOOOOOO Danny don't die" moment.In conclusion this movie is dire, watch Tora Tora Tora!, don't waste time and money on this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Propaganda with capital letters. That's the subliminal message of the movie. Show that the Americans will never be stop by anyone. Talk about Pearl Harbor means to talk about politics, and that's impossible to avoid. When Balck Hawk Down shows such that thin red line from the side of the madness and lost heroes, this shows that war is not just funny, but is a place to meet the perfect girl and to save your country without getting dirty. How many people like this movie? well, the percentage of lovers is almost the same as the percentage of loathers, so it's pretty equal. I don't like the politic plot of the movie, but the director's work is impossible to spank. Michael Bay stills one of the best action directors in the world, and his editorial work is award worthy. But the screenplay is not good, damn, is just not good, and that's all. Ben Affleck is not a war hero, in action movies he loses the expontaneous genius of Chasing Amy or Dogma, and Cuba Gooding Jr is impossible to make another believable work since Jerry Maguire. My verdict: Good action movie. Bad war movie. And their attempt was to make a war movie, not an action flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was quite simply only one thing wrong with this movie. The title. If this movie was called 'Attack on a base' or something it would've'e spared those of us with a sense of historical reverence associated with one of the only two times in the last century the United States was attacked on its own ground. The attack on Pearl Harbor, just like any significant military loss/victory or historical catastrophe (i.e. Napoleonic Wars, Holocaust, American Revolution), is served an insulting blow by having a cookie cutter Hollywood love triangle.Ben Afleck, you suck. Before this movie you were simply a bad actor whom I could overlook. But by taking this role you showed your ignorance and lack of talent.If you have no sense of history, and you like bad acting, then this movie is a gem and belongs right between 'you got served' and 'jingle all the way' in your DVD collection (you meat-head).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TITANIC's ugly step-sister....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the wild and unexpected success of the film many deemed "Cameron's folly," I was fully expecting an onslaught of romance films that take place during a historical tragedy.Thankfully, only one came to realization and after it tanked miserably, no one ever attempted to try to duplicate "Titanic's" success again."Pearl Harbor's" first failure is that when asked "why Pearl Harbor?", it replies with a "I dunno..." James Cameron's "Titanic" was a product of years of fascination with the great lost liner. He expressed his true love to the magnificent ship and the tragedy that occurred on that faithful April night. Yes, he added a love story, but that was for the people who treated the whole event as one big joke, he wanted us to get attached to the passengers, to feel the loss and horror when the ship sank.But Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay seemed to have simply glued a bunch of disasters onto a wall and started throwing darts at them, eventually landing on the tragedy of Pearl Harbor. That is why the film feels so cold and impersonal. There is no personal affiliation, no affection to all those who died and the love story was very forced and had no point. Pearl Harbor didn't happen that long ago, we are still quite aware of its scope. There are plenty of survivors left alive, there was no need adding a fictional love story that would help us relate to the event. "Pearl Harbor's" only point, only motivation was a hellbent goal to be the next "Titanic," which was ultimately its downfall.Now, I am all for tales of a tragic romance, but the one in "Pearl Harbor" was a pain to watch, mostly because it was such a shameless imitation of "Titanic's" subplot. We have a love triangle, leads from different ends of the spectrum, the classic "I'm flying!" sequence, a sex scene in an unexpected location (a parachute sewing room?!?!?!), a fight scene during the most inappropriate of times and a "promise me that..." speech during a weepy death scene. Did Bay and Bruckheimer think that no one would notice? Now, I know there are only so many ways one can go with fictional love story subplots in historical dramas, but one must admit, what we witnessed in "Pearl Harbor" was just ridiculous.Then, there's the acting. It's obvious that they were going for the same chemistry as Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio and, to a lesser extent, Billy Zane, but failed miserably even at that. True, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett have their DiCaprio-esquire charm, but the former, unlike Mr. DiCaprio, can't act and the latter just feels lost in a period drama. Kate Beckinsale is a superb British actress, in the same class as Kate Winslet, and tried her best with an awful, cliché ridden part she was given. But it seems that half-way through the movie she realized she basically playing Rose from "Titanic" and went on auto-pilot. The role didn't deserve anything special, so why should she give it? Then there is the fact that "Pearl Harbor" tries to hard to be politically correct, it absolutely kills what should have been an interesting subplot with the Japanese and their reason to bomb the harbor. We hear absolutely nothing about their passions, beliefs and motivations behind the attack. All we hear is some inane mumbling about a blocked off oil supply, followed by endless scenes of them moping around, claiming that they seriously don't want to attack Pearl Harbor, but have no choice. Is that what we really want from a historical film? A sugar coating and extreme diluting of actual historical events?But the film's biggest mistake was going where even Cameron didn't dare to go. In "Pearl Harbor," the fictional heroes got ALL THE PRAISE! It was *THEM*, who organized the makeshift emergency room, it was them who lead the others to the airplanes and organized the first attack. And when Doolittle pointed to Hartnett &amp; Affleck and said "we will win the war because of THEM," I nearly fainted. What was that? Did Cameron have Rose organize the evacuation of the Titanic? Did he have Jack try to steer the ship away from the iceberg? The answer is an obvious no, and for a very good reasons. It's no wonder that so many World War II veterans got offended and they had every right to.As for the attack itself, it is very short and anti-climatic. Ideally, the bombing should have taken place at the last half of the second act and for the majority of the third act. But as it currently stands, the attack on Pearl Harbor is a tiny subplot in the film's massive second act. Bruckheimer obviously didn't have the nerve to end the film on a melancholy, sad note like Cameron did with his "Titanic," so the audience were forced to watch the pointless re-enactment of the Doolittle raid, which took place MONTHS after the onslaught and conveniently features our heroes, where they, you guessed it, once again save the day making valiant sacrifices in the process. Yet another slap in the face to the brave men who actually went through that hell.Of course, there are some good points within "Pearl Harbor." The special effects, sets &amp; costumes are gorgeous and the splendid cinematography is second to none. All that warrants it at least four stars out of ten. However, in the end, it's still a failure, albeit a beautiful one. At the end of the day, "Pearl Harbor" is still "Titanic's" ugly step-sister and will go down in cinema history as a footnote proving that you can't step in the same water twice."Pearl Harbor": 4 out 10. An expensive, beautifully shot pale imitation of James Cameron's "Titanic" with none of the latter's soul and affection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Also, no US soldier would go to Britain to join the Royal Air Force. The US Army Air Force had a unit (the Flying Tigers) in Britain helping out the RAF, but no US soldier would actually leave his unit to join another country's military (regardless of allies). It would mean a total US military discharge AND rejecting US citizenship. Ben Affleck's character could not have done that, especially when he was not a British citizen.Formerly posted by "Jen" if i remember right. The Flying Tigers were in China and, yes there were American pilots in the UK. They were part of a squadron named the "Eagle Squadron" and allowed US pilots to fight in the war, when the United states was not actively involved in WWII.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Could Have Been Much More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor was a good movie... if you took out about an hour and made the plot more sensible. The attack scenes were well choreographed, and the cinematography was beautiful. Some of the acting was plausible, yet the plot after the attack went downhill. It should have went on for maybe another thirty minutes... then ended more stronger than it did. It was really pointless. The Love Story, that the writer added into the picture was too forced and added just to attract attention from a sensitive audience... the action was added to attract the hardcore audience... a mix, especially when it seemed "forced" didn't blend too well. The trailers definitely suckered people into watching this film. The trailers were amazing. It reminded me of Roland Emmerich's 1998 remake of "Godzilla." The film looked amazing, yet it didn't work once released and few people liked it. Don't get me wrong, I love Michael Bay and I think he is an amazing director. He just needed to add more plot (less time, of course) but make it better. All in all, an okay movie. Rent it for the action, not really for the romance.</fullReview>

The hit on Pearl Harbor was dreadful yet satisfying and I think Michael Bay is actually giving us a movie to look inside the sailors hearts and fear. I thought it was actually a really good movie but the only thing that brought it down was the love story and romance but ignore that and just look at its special effects that were amazing.

One more won't be amazing me in a slightest bit. Producer: "Okay, we're making a Pearl Harbor movie." Screenwriter: "Okay..." (proceeds to put the "Pearl Harbor", "Two Guys Loving The Same Girl" and "Patriotic War Imagery" modules in the screenplay writing machine, turns the crank a few times, and the machine e-mails the screenplay directly to the director)Part 2: How many clichés from recent war movies can you *possibly* fit in one movie? Epic dying moments, crankily humorous officers, etcetera etcetera... Not only is it a clichéd love story, it's *also* a clichéd var movie!Part 3: It doesn't end where it should, specifically, after Pearl Harbor. Okay, so there's an American guy who goes a-flyin' and drops some Zeros when they're attacking. I can take that. But if you're going to make a movie about the most humiliating defeat USA has seen in a war, why oh why did they have to specifically continue from there, showing some weird morale-raising military manoeuvers after the whole thing? "Hey, we got kicked around, but see, we lost a battle but not the war! Aren't we cool?" ... They should have just ended the movie at Admiral Yamamoto's worries about US retaliation, like in that other movie (where even that scene was done far better!).Part 4: I don't know - to me, it didn't *seem* like a WW2 movie. Especially the latter morale-raising part. Strip off the gear and make them a bit more modern, and presto, here we have a *modern* war/action movie. The whole thing seems like a modern action movie thinly disguised as a WW2 movie. Heck, it's a *run-of-the-mill* action movie disguised as a WW2 movie.In conclusion, it bugged me, and there are a lot better movies in the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Horrible, but the Love Story basically ruins whats Left of the Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is the kind of film that has it's ups and downs, and isn't really a good movie in the end. I admit that I did enjoy some of it, but after about half of the movie is over, there isn't much left to enjoy. Plot: Self explanatory. Well, at least half of it. Two childhood friends (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) are sent off to a Hawaii Navy base and take part in defending Pearl Harbor, and later are sent off to briefly fight in WWII. It sounds like it will be a good film, but the love story is literally a mess. Michael Bay's direction isn't so great either. The action scenes and special effects are ultimately impressive. Affleck gives a pretty good performance, and Hartnett gives an even better one. He was in another war movie that year, Black Hawk Down, my favorite film of 2001 and one of my favorite war movies ever. It was better than Pearl Harbor, far better. In the end, Pearl Harbor is basically just another movie that is average at best. 6/10 stars.</fullReview>

The interesting bits don't actually start till they arrive at Pearl Harbor. I hated Ben Afflecks performance, josh Harnett was way better, Affleck was too "look at me I'm so good" for my liking.Overall opinion, worth a look if you like a bit of action, and if your a teenage girl.</fullReview>

In fact everyone seems to be calling the film a failure saying it bombed at the box office. Yet according to this website the budget was $135 million and it made $450 million worldwide, which seems like a decent profit to me.Anyway When I watched it recently on TV I was Pleased to find that this was actually a good movie.I enjoyed the 3 hour experience more than Saving Private Ryan (although it was probably not as good critically). Pearl Harbor was well made, the acting from the three main leads though not spectacular, was certainly adequate, Ben Affleck was quite good as the square jawed all American Hero type, Josh Hartnett was not bad either as his quieter best friend and Kate Beckinsale proved an attractive and quite engaging female lead (this was actually the first time I had seen her in a movie). The special effects were superb and the battle sequences realistic. Also some of the smaller parts, most notably Alec Baldwin as Affleck's commanding Officer &amp; Jon Voight as President Roosevelt were very well acted indeed.I rated this film 6 or 7 out of 10, Ignore the bad reviews watch it and judge for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had really been looking forward to "Pearl Harbor" when I saw the previews. Once I saw the long string of bad reviews, I decided to hold off and watch it on video. Well, it earned those reviews. "Pearl Harbor" really tries to be three movies: 1) A historical account of the attach on Pearl Harbor; 2) A love story framed by that attack; 3) A story of the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo. I imagine that the producers were banking on audience having no interest in older films, because each of these themes was done much better in "Tora, Tora, Tora," "From Here to Eternity," and " Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo." If you're interested in the story of Pearl Harbor, a torrid romance framed by the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the Doolittle Raid, just rent these three films and you'll get a much better sense of the whole thing. Yes, I admit that some of the action scenes in the attack were good. But there's an awful lot of bad movie surrounding those scenes. It's a shame because I'm sure many Pearl Harbor survivors were hoping that their experience would get the same respectful treatment (and intensity), that Speilberg gave the guys from D-Day. That treatment is still to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>inaccurate? overly patriotic? still entertaining though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSI won't deny I've been avoiding this film. When I learnt about it's release three years ago, I was going through a very anti-American stage, and as a result the sight of this film had turned my stomach. Skip forward to 2004 and the terrestrial television premiere. Sitting there watching this film, I pondered how accurate it was (this is not a period of History I pretend to know a lot of details about, I'm more of a renaissance Europe fan myself) and I groaned occasionally at awful lines. Over all though, I actually quite liked it.In "Pearl Harbour", we're introduced to young Rafe and Danny (Affleck &amp; Hartnett), two friends who grew up together and are like brothers. The two army fly boys spend all their time flying and hanging out together. Then the Nazi's invade Poland, WW2 in Europe begins and Rafe travels to England to join the good fight. Add to this situation the female input of the delectable Kate Beckinsale as a nurse and Rafe's love, and a three way love triangle develops. As the film progresses, the three experience first the bombing of Pearl Harbour and the entry into the war of America and then America's retaliation on Tokyo.Like I'd said before, this film took a beating at the Box Office due to it's historical inaccuracy. I'll admit I'm not sure how inaccurate it is, although I'm sure it's not as bad as Gibson's farcical "The Patriot" or "U-571", but ultimately as long as you question every fact you see in the film, it doesn't matter.Aside from historical questions, the other criticism of this film is that it's just generally not very good. For this point I must confess, I really disagree. Whilst there are some really awful lines in this film, and it's so ridiculously over patriotic, for graphics, plot (or sub-plot if you want to put the War as the main story ahead of the romance) and the vast ammounts of intensity, I feel it delivers. So it'll never be as dark or powerful as other war films ("Saving Private Ryan" to name one), and compared with other love stories it also falls short, all in all it's not as bad as everyone says.If your looking for a film which combines the better parts of awful films (the boat &amp; graphics from "Titanic", the romance from "Armageddon"), then watch this film. If your going to be touchy and condemn anything with even the most remote historical inaccuracy, or your going to insult any film which isn't Oscar material, then yeah ok avoid this. For a blockbuster to relax to on a Monday night though, it does the job quite nicely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very desperate but enjoyable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard many people groan when Pearl Harbor is discussed. To many people in my school, this film was a total disaster. It was a film that was made as a love film. Indeed it was made as a sort of love film, relating it to Titanic because it utilizes a major disaster and puts in two lovers in that situation. This film was yet very beautiful in my idea. I don't see why it should be considered a horrible movie. It was kind of annoying when classmates said that this film was only about love. Love Love Love..... who cares? Wouldn't it be delightful to see something unique in a war movie for a change? War films were always about deaths and blood. It was gore as it is. I see in this film a new "type" of war movie. Indeed, the film overdid love a little "too" much. I actually do consider this a love film, as well, but I don't see why it isn't compatible as a war movie. The battle scenes are very intense and sensational. It was very enjoyable to see the screen follow a plane. When a plane does a somersault, so does the screen. It was very emotional and striking when I saw the Japanese planes bomb the ships. The director did the most fantastic job in bringing the battle to life. I was very satisfied at the effort given in these scenes. The love story is unique in itself as well. I never saw a love film with such a different style. I enjoyed at the ebullience of many of the actors and actresses. They performed beautifully. I thought Josh Hartnett was particularly good in playing the main character's friend. He seemed very fit as the character he played. Ben Affleck was very good as well. His character was very show-offy but I thought that all was good. Kate Beckinsale did a tremendous job in playing both friends' lover. She seemed VERY into her character and she did look like someone from the 1940s. I actually consider this a great war film and a tragic love film at the same time.</fullReview>

Two pilots and a girl, the old triangle good for anything love novel, is a too poor story for giving support to a real tragedy in the second world war. I believe in the American talent and hope to see a new film on this argument:a damned day experienced through the eyes of a navy commander that isn't in love, but is living the drama of his seamen. and above all,it's useless to amplify the acts of bravery. In war a man doesn't aim to exalt one's exploits, but he wants to save one's skin and, in the same time, to eliminate obstacles. A war film isn't a performance of fireworks, it's a succession of bad scenes of blood and horror.</fullReview>

The story is known, even your 12old year kid will know what the Japs did and so it couldn't have surprised at all, but still it did... The attack from the Japs belongs (just like the first 30 minutes of Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan") to the best what I ever saw in warmovies. Spectacular, frightening and with a rarely seen reality-factor. The speeches in the White House are good as well, the ones from the Japanese emperors as well but (and that's 2 hours) the lovestory sucked... It was boring, and it was a shame that they didn't opt to make a warmovie in historical style like "The longest day" as then it could perhaps have been the best warmovie ever but indeed we must see a dreadful lovestory...and why such a warevent is pointed out to two good pilots is beyond me, it's a slap in the face for all families who lost someone there. Typical example from how Hollywood can destroy good ideas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the top-10-of-2001 type film we were expecting, it's none-the-less a solid action flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PEARL HARBOUR (2001)THE GOOD:--For sheer bravura war action and combat sequences, this film is unmatched. It features what will be probably stand as one of the most amazing attack sequences in the history of celluloid. I am of course talking about the sequence in which the Japanese attack Pearl Harbour on the morning of December 7, 1941 (a date which will live in infamy). The effects, sound, cinematography and editing for this are all absolutely flawless, it's very hard to tell that this is even special effects really. There is a realistic tone running throughout, which is helped by the scenes of normal island morning activity interrupted by the roaring planes tearing toward Pearl Harbour and the man video-taping everything was a nice touch too. John Schwartzman, cinematographer, does an excellent job of capturing the horror and frantic atmosphere of the attack and there are some truly astounding shots (following the bomb to its target). The frantic situation at the hospital was also brilliantly conveyed, the blurry cinematography brought across the atmosphere realistically and the gore was put to great effect and was necessary. Probably the best moment in the film comes from Nurse Sandra (Jennifer Garner) screaming "I don't know what to do" after finding out one her best friend's is dead and there is still a huge bombard of injured persons waiting for her nursing and help. That, right there?WOW, that was definitely powerful. Rafe (Ben Affleck) holding the hand of a person as they drown on the Arizona was also a very dramatic, moving moment.--Contrary to popular belief, I thought this was a very well cast film. Affleck makes for a suitable, likeable hero and brings a charming quality to Rafe as well as a determination within his character to serve his country (not done in a cheesy way at all). Josh Hartnett proves he's not just a pretty face and puts on a charismatic performance. Kate Beckinsale does best during the aforementioned hospital horror sequences where her acting skills really come into play, though she has the right look for the part (she reminded me of the classic actresses of the 30's, 40's and 50's) and cries well. Cuba Gooding Jr. as Dorie was able to pull off some absolutely realistic expressions and performances (when Dorie finally got to fire a gun I really FORGOT that was acting) to cover up for the couple of times he was just a little laughable (saluting his dead captain). Jon Voight was absolutely excellent as President Roosevelt; he looked and acted the part with perfect clarity. The scene where Roosevelt stands up on his own two feet and abandons the wheelchair is one of the movie's best and further motivates that 'anything can be done' theme that was going on in that scene.--Though some of the first hour should've been cut, I did really enjoy the light-hearted feel to a lot of it. The scenes with Rafe trying to impress Evelyn (Beckinsale) were very funny and cute, especially when the cork flew onto his (already broken) nose. I enjoyed the humour and somewhat silliness of these scenes, it makes for some much-needed comic relief before all the war and violence begins. --Hans Zimmer?well, what can you say about him? He's done a marvellous job of scoring the movie, and perfectly captured the essence of the movie, both the romance and the terror of the war within one simple title piece. This adds to his list of great 2001 musical scores he's composed, along with "Hannibal" and "Black Hawk Down". THE BAD:--The romance is introduced well and has its moments, but when all things are considered, it's just so inferior to the actual important things in the film (Pearl Harbour). The actors chemistry is strong at the beginning but it sort of fades toward the later parts of the movie. Evelyn's pregnancy was out of the blue and made no sense (see next bullet point). Worst of all, the romance subplot allows for some of the worst one-liners in the history of film ("When I get cold, the one place I can go to be warm is to think of you" and "I'm going to give my whole heart to Danny, but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you").--I didn't really care about the historical errors in the movie. I'm not one to really look that closely into these things, they don't bother me all that much unless I'm really specific about the event/time/place the film is studying, which I wasn't here. Apparently the scene with President Roosevelt standing up never happened but I thought it was one of the best scenes in the movie. The problem I had with the film is its noticeable continuity flaws or just plain errors. Rafe has dyslexia but he can write 10 page letters to his beloved? Evelyn got pregnant possibly 3-4 months before either Rafe or the viewers know and there's no change in her body?--At 3 hours, the movie is a little overlong. This wasn't a major issue with me, I like long movies and I enjoyed this one. I just got the feeling that some things should've been cut down considerably. After a while the scenes with the Japanese commander guys talking about the war just got tedious. The entire Doolittle Raid I found rather unnecessary, it 'did little' (I crack myself up) in the movie's overall result, plus the film is called "Pearl Harbour" not "The Doolittle Raid". However not THAT much time (some critics have said ONE whole hour?no way?45 minutes at the absolute maximum) is spent on the latter and it's pretty entertaining stuff, but for the purposes of storytelling I think cutting it down might've been wise.RATING:7/10 - Perhaps not the great war epic it should've been, "Pearl Harbour" nonetheless stands as an entertaining and well-made film.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:Black Hawk Down (8/10) Braveheart (6/10) Dark Blue World (6/10) Enemy at the Gates (9/10) Titanic (10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cross Between Titanic and Armageddon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is like a cross between Titanic and Armageddon. In fact, Pearl Harbor and Titanic are quite similar. Both are big-budget romance films under the background of major disasters. Both include a romance triangle. But Pearl Harbour is not as good as Titanic. Listening to the characters talk on Pearl Harbour was like listening to the characters in a teen movie. The dialogue is filled with hack romance and patriotic cliches. Nearly every single scene in the movie tried to be uplifting, but uplifting scenes should be used sparingly, not littered throughout. It's a pity Michael Bay had to direct this film. Pearl Harbor has a weighty subject matter that would have been better handled by directors like Steven Spielberg, Roman Polanski, or even James Cameron.Two better movies are Schindler's List and The Pianist.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bay and Bruckheimer's tacky "Titanic", kept from the trash heap only by a few technical merits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Final Score: 5.3 (out of 10)Everything that was so galvanizing about James Cameron's `Titanic' seems to be an absolute mystery that went right over the heads of Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer. Based on that movie's monumental success, Bay and Bruckheimer have taken that template and assembled a movie that, in every phony moment of its running time, feels contrived with all the ingredients of a commercially successfully blockbuster. I've been giving Michael Bay the benefit of the doubt for years. Much to his taught direction, to this day `The Rock' remains a high water mark in the action genera. Yet, in every film since, Bay has insisted on lower the bar and wiggling under it. Each time the movies are hits and it gives him an allowance to go lazier and lazier and he expects the audience to tolerate it. Bay is a stylistically talented director in the visual department. `Pearl Harbor' looks great. In its action scenes, when Bay is back in his element, the movie works on a simple visceral level. Problem is, this isn't an `Armageddon'-style fanciful adventure. It's a historical event based on the bombing of Pearl Harbor that Bay and Bruckheimer turn it into a 3 hour teenage love triangle popcorn flick. There is something supremely tacky about the whole affair. Whereas Cameron's `Titanic' infused fictitious characters and a fictitious love story into a true event it was done in a way that showed Cameron's genuine respect for the event. Cameron wove, pretty smoothly, his composite characters through the existing plot giving us a front-row-seat tour of the events. `Harbor' shoves Ben Affleck, Kate Beckensale and Josh Hartnett to the front of the story. It's the dawn of World War 2 and Bay spends a full hour at the front end entirely on a love story that nobody but a 13 year old girl (with one eye on the screen and one eye moving from row to row in the theater talking with her friends) could possibly care about. While I give much of the blame to Bay for his reckless mis-direction, it's really Randall Wallace's script and story that sink this movie beyond the skill of any director. Wallace has been riding high off `Braveheart' for years despite churning out drivel like this and the equally trite `The Patriot' (also helmed by a visually skilled Roland Emmerich) ever since. Had the movie shaved off its first hour, it might have been decent. When it does finally arrive the recreation of the attack on the navel base is a spectacular sight to behold. It is exciting, visually arresting, even frightening and exhausting. Anyone that is honest has to admit that movies are a visual medium that are about more than just script and story. The movie's technical achievements are as good as they come and to be honest, composite most of my final score. But there is something truly insulting and condescending about the way this director thinks people need this romance element to get into the movie as if the attack sequence can't stand by itself. There is nothing about the first act that contributes to the drama. Ultimately, even the love triangle story is just a mechanism for the real moral of the movie: life loves Ben Affleck. Yes, if you're Ben Affleck you can get the girl and narrowly avert death time and again. Consequently, if you're Ben Affleck's best friend (Josh Hartnett) you will spend a lifetime in his shadow getting screwed over so that good things can happen for him. The movie turns into an odd, self-indulgent star vehicle for the guy. Did I mention that Cuba Gooding Jr. is also thrown somewhere in the mix as the token black chef who steps up and fights with everyone else. Wow, what a career side! Didn't this guy win an Oscar. `Pearl Harbor' is a tacky, pseudo-epic and a missed opportunity of monumental proportions. It contains the same kind of flag-waving and near-embarrassing phony Hollywood patriotism that Jerry Bruckheimer has been hypocritically using to get the asses in the seats since `Top Gun'. It makes a great case against all those that think patriotism and flag-waving came about as post-9/11 fad, that movies like this can be such monster hits despite being so utterly empty. Studio filmmaking at it's worst.</fullReview>

All the while they are in a love triangle with a girl whom Rafe fell in love with, and Danny got close to after Rafe was shot down.although a somewhat interesting concept, the film plays off poor because of the length and the characters. the movie also tried to be a drama, a romance, a war picture, an action picture and a light comedy. It doesn't work out right. I can understand why the movie needs the length it has, but it ends up being too long. the battle scenes are amazing though. good attempt, but it isn't great. **/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love Story, not History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is much more a fictional love story than historical fiction. Consequently, history and authenticity frequently suffer in order to bend the story around Pearl Harbor. Fortunately, the early reviews of this movie panned it and so I didn't pay to see it until it was on TV.It starts off with the two heros meeting with Lt.Col. Doolittle a couple of years before the war. Doolittle, a WWI veteran, returned to active duty in July 1940 where he was assigned to implementing war production. He did not command any squadron until he formed the B-25 raid on Tokyo so he could not been involved with the two heros. Secondly, when Doolittle formed his squadron he used already trained bomber pilots. The two heros were experienced fighter pilots and would never have been transferred to bombers.The movie further departs from what happened on the Tokyo raid. First, it states that Japanese patrol boats were sighted 400 yards away. That didn't happen and no enemy boat would ever have gotten that close to the American Fleet. In fact it was Japanese fishing boats spotted four miles away. The decision to launch the raid early did not come from Doolittle as shown in the movie but from an overly cautious Admiral Halsey. The movie shows the Doolittle planes flying in formation as they bombed Japan. In fact, each plane flew separately to different targets in Japan. The surprise was so great that unlike in the movie none of the planes were fired upon by Japanese anti-aircraft guns. One plane did encounter Japanese fighters but the fighters flew by. At that time the American insignia included a red meat ball in the center of a white star, similar to the meatball on Japanese planes and the Japanese who believed that it was impossible for American bombers to reach Japan probably thought they were Japanese planes.Further, no two planes landed close together as depicted in the movie. For viewers who want a more authentic version of the Doolittle raid, see "30 Seconds Over Tokyo" or watch the History Channel.If one wants to see a more accurate movie about Peal Harbor, see "Tora, Tora" which focuses solely on the Pearl Harbor Raid. Unfortunately the movie "Pearl Harbor" gives a shallow overview of the attack and what preceded it and it lacks accuracy. The special effects showing the attack are superior to that of Tora, Tora, but we have such inaccuracies of using air cooled anti-aircraft machine guns on the ships when the guns were water cooled. The two heros did not fly from Hickam Field as shown in the movie but from Ewa Field which was not under attack. No fighter ever got off of Hickam Field.Generally speaking authenticity went to hell in this movie and so did the movie with a silly love story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Wayne stamp of approval</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor begins with an over-the-top back from the dead love triangle being played out. Without too much delay, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor. Just when viewers are completely lulled into thinking that all of the melodrama is finished, and there will be nothing more to see other than top-notch special effects and cool WWII airplanes -- BAM! -- John Voight as President Roosevelt takes control! Using super patriotic will power, we see President Roosevelt dramatically overcome his polio just to win an argument. Talk about a display of dramatics. Oscar! Oscar! What a man! Nothing could be more exciting... except of course for other than when Alec Baldwin takes his turn at commanding the film. Baldwin employs a healthy dose of square-jawed over-the-top melodrama as he plays the part of Lt. Col. James Doolittle. Attentive viewers may notice the ghost of John Wayne nodding approvingly over Baldwin's shoulder as patriotic jingoism is spread as deep and thick as any GOP actor would ever dare deliver.I, for one, loved this movie. And if PEARL HARBOR is good enough for John Wayne, who are we to disagree?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor's biggest problem is that its love story and how it tries so hard to emulate that of titanic, infact, the entire film was promoted as "the next titanic" and for that, it never lived up to its hype and failed to strike acord with audiences.Now, not to say this is a bad film, far from bad. I mean, the attack on pearl harbor was an amazing display of action and drama, but it just dident hold water (no pun intended) with the almost photocopied chiche love story. As for historical facts, its got the BASICS, and i do strongly feel that alot of facts were misreprensented or dumbed down to make the story more entertaining, but that is the nature of hollywood. If you want a history lessen, go watch history channel. If you wana be entertained with a historical backdrop, then it makes do.If spielberg or cameron directed this film, it would have been much better, for both directors have an attention to detail and pashion for there films. Yet in the hands of a action director, this film ends up being alot of bang for your buck and forced drama.Overall, for a good action take of pearl harbor, check it out, but if your expecting an historical epic, well, it is, but a hollywood epic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie seemed to care more about the so called "special effects" i.e. following a dropped bomb all the way down to the target, rather than presenting an entertaining movie of any substance or reality. The history was changed blatantly on a number of occasions, and the acting was so wooden and the script so banal that I couldn't stop laughing at some of the more serious moments! Memorable was Ben Affleck's constant "I'm doing my doody..." - I have no idea what a doody really is nor do I think Ben Affleck knows - he was just reading from the script!It was a shame that this much hyped high price movie failed to deliver because the historical context really interests me. But with actors like Affleck, Hartnett and Beckinsale and a script from hell I guess I should have known what was coming.This was a monstrous waste of good celluloid.</fullReview>

The result is a mish-mash of historic facts, cinematic cliches and the worst of it: a corny story.The on-screen love triangle between the leading characters doesn't work, and I'm not really sure what makes it so unbelievable. the competition is hard between the mediocre acting, the lame dialogue or the forcing of it on the historical story.One point of bright light in this movie is the cinematography. Michael Bay certainly knows how to shoot sunsets and explosions. And there's plenty of both. Unfortunately for us, even the best scene in the movie, the actual attack on Pearl Harbor, is shot without any real flight, pun intended.And I'm not even gonna start about the rhythm of the movie.For wasting 3 hours of my life I'm never gonna get back, this movie receives a 5/10.</fullReview>

He can't watch Titanic and see the difference in this film and PH. The whole film can't be taken seriously mostly because Ben Affleck is so bad. The dialogue was also quite bad and at times even predictable. The 40 minute attack scene was spectacular, but they had to make the movie another unnecessary 40 minutes just to draw it out to an unbearable 3 hours. Don't watch this film if you know what's best for you. don't's vote: 5 out of 10 (and this is only because of the attack sequence, along with the fact Jennifer Garner had a small role in the film)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A three hour movie that could have been told in 90 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually enjoy watching Bruckheimer/Michael Bay films. They are, for the most part, action packed and well written. PEARL HARBOR suffers from what I now call the HEAT (Pacino and DeNiro, 1995) syndrome--a three hour movie that could have been told in an hour and a half. If you read my review for HEAT, I have the same gripes about that film as I do about PEARL HARBOR. There is just so much time wasted in this movie, by the time the action starts you really just don't care anymore.The whole first hour and a half of the movie is wasted on a love triangle between Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale. Why not give us more historical information instead of a horribly written love triangle? If I wouldn't have known better, I would have thought George Lucas wrote this movie. By the time the first planes are dropping bombs, I really could have cared less what happened to the main characters.Like HEAT, there were some good things about this movie. Cuba Gooding Jr was outstanding as the cook who was forced into the battle. This guy is one of the most underrated actors of all time. He is just brilliant. Jon Voight is equally brilliant, nailing down the role of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.The fact is, the first hour and a half is extremely boring. My best advice would be to start this on track 22 of the DVD and just watch it from there. This is not a good historical version of the Pearl Harbor story. If you're a history buff like I am, try TORA TORA TORA. You're not missing anything with this version of PEARL HARBOR.* * (out of 4)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is wrong with Hollywood? Spoilers possible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an era of different cultural contrasts as well as preaching of hatred towards races, the so-called 'protectors of peace' should be providing an example. Despite two horrific World Wars, mankind has still not learnt from his previous mistakes. World War 2's central catalyst was Adolf Hitler's self belief that the Germans were a superior race. It was his refusal to accept or respect the nature of other cultures that, in theory, led to his attempt to create a global German Empire. An attempt which caused the deaths of millions of men. In this age of knowledge and cultural understanding, man should have learnt to diminish the notion of the 'white man's burden', a term invented during the Scramble for Africa in the late 19th century. In order to create a world of cultural appreciation and respect, propaganda must stop in inferiorating the world by continuously illustrating the apparent 'greatness' of one nation. This is a concept that is clearly not understood by the producers of expensive Hollywood films.'Pearl Harbor' is a pathetic attempt to create sympathy towards the tragic event that began the war for control over the Pacific. Where do I begin? The story is simple. Affleck, a pilot based in Peal Harbor meets and falls in love with nurse Becksingale. He then joins the British RAF and has to leave Pearl Harbor. He asks his best friend Hartnett to watch over his girl. Affleck's plane is then shot down and he is assumed dead. After 3 months, Hartnett and Becksingale fall in love, and despite their gut emotions telling them that their relationship is morally wrong, they go ahead with it, yet to their disbelief Affleck's character returns. In the midst of all this emotional chaos, the Japanese attack and destroy Pearl Harbor. The film then goes on to deal with the love triangle as well as the United States' desperate attempt to regain a minor feeling of their supremacy and immense power over any other nation.'Pearl Harbor' has re-used the genre hybrid remarkably seen in 'Titanic'. The combination of a love story within a disaster was an outstanding formula in James Cameron's 'Titanic' that created one of the greatest love stories seen in cinema. 'Pearl Harbor' has jokingly taken the formula a step further by adding a love triangle to the equation; a move that appeared to be a very bad choice. Whether it was the poor acting or the terrible screenplay, the audience gain absolutely no emotional understanding or attachment to any of the characters. The love between Affleck and Becksingale does not grasp the viewer; their relationship is not poetic and attracts no warmth. Neither does the friendship between Affleck and Hartnett. Their best friend status is poorly reinforced and there is no sense of reality amongst it. This grows even worse when Hartnett falls for Becksingale, which makes him almost despised, especially when the film predictably hints Affleck's return by portraying an emotionless response to his apparent death. The weak bonds between the characters causes a lack of concern for them when disaster strikes. There is no grudge or sympathy.Contrary to the poor dimensionalization of the characters, the action is outstanding and maintains Michael Bay's well reputed ability to create perfect images of disaster scenes, i.e. Armageddon. The Japanese attack is amazingly shot, and detailed to perfection. The camera angles are beautifully positioned to provide a realistic sense of the attack. The horror and fear within all the characters is about the only emotional aspect they seem to show believably.With the poor start to this film leading on to an outstandingly impressive display of the Japanese attack, one would only assume it would get better. However, the viewer is terribly let down with a change in plot, that whether or not was historically accurate, was quite simply not necessary. It provides no balance for this story and almost seems pretty careless and stupid. I will restrict myself from detailing the events as I feel I would be wasting my time considering how out of context it was. For certain viewers, it may provide the need for a sense of self satisfaction, yet for the film to give itself some credit, the change in plot should have been avoided.The final insult of this picture is the closing message at the end celebrating the US's victory over Japan. To remind readers, the US's victory resulted in the use of mankind's deadliest invention, the atomic bomb, which was dropped on two different Japanese cities instantly burning hundreds of thousands of lives. This is an event that deserves to be dramatized just as much if not more than the attack on Pearl Harbor.All in all a poor film. Its attempt to become another 'Titanic' fails miserably. Despite the good action sequences, the plot is bad, the performances were not grasping, with the exception of Cuba Gooding Jnr's lovable character as the chef, and the overall quality of this film was not as high as expected from the director and producer in relation to their previous work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer do Pearl Harbor their way. Their story follows the lives of a few people, Titanic style, leading up to the main event. Like Titanic, this has visually and technically impressive production values, but unlike Titanic this is not all that great of a movie otherwise. While there is nothing wrong with any of the acting, the story, or most anything else tangible, there is something amiss in Bay's directing style. He is simply too slick for his own good, and while that is fine for something like The Rock, here it does not feel right at all. Everything is shiny and sumptuously lit, and everything feels too perfect, too Americana, like Norman Rockwell had painted it. The story is still plenty potent and there are great moments, but history would have been better served by a Saving Private Ryan approach than this sometime action-adventure romp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie reminds me of an old nursery rhyme: "There was a little girl, who had a little curl / right in the middle of her forehead. When she was good, she was very, very good. And when she was bad she was horrid." You can also sum up this story by saying in the main that the parts in the air are terrific, and the bits on the ground are rather bad.A good example or this is the romance segment between Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale's characters. When they're flying in the air, it is really touching and effective. When they get back on the ground, it all gets tacky and clichéd. Again with Ben Affleck in Britain. The scenes in the air are breathtaking; while the shenanigans on the ground are pretty awful.Exceptions are the guy with the stutter, who I thought was very good; and the draft examination sequence, which I thought worked rather well. Also, despite the strong criticism, I thought Alec Baldwin was terrific as Doolittle; and the famed raid on Tokyo was a good climactic coda. But again; while the characters are in the air or around the aircraft; it goes brilliantly. Once they crash onto the ground, the film literally drops away into schmaltz.I have to say that I still prefer TORA TORA TORA as the better dramatization of this story, especially Jason Robards and Martin Balsam's characters. (My Dad totally loves this version however.) The best way to sum up this film is to say that, while it's not the great masterpiece it's obvious trying to be, it isn't nearly as bad as the critics who savaged it reckoned.

		<shortDescription>Good effects... but nothing more that.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I for one love a good war film and when watching a film titled Pearl Harbor thats what I expected. However I was very disappointed. The first part of the film bored me to tears, as any film staring Ben Affleck usually does. The movie does have amazing special effects, which are very difficult to be unimpressed by. I would have thought that any film about an event as dramatic as Pearl Harbor would have focused more on event itself rather than some cheesy love triangle. The movie turned out to be one that I would only watch again for the special effects. The film needs to be remade using the special effects of this movie and the storyline, and historical accuracies of the 1970 film "Tora! Tora! Tora!", which has nothing to do with any romance, it just delivers a detailed account of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. And is far more gripping than "Pearl Harbor".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insulting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not claim to speak for WWII veterans, or survivors of the attack on Pearl Harbor, but I don't have to be one of them to be insulted by this so-called epic film directed by someone who is under the impression he is Cecil B. DeMille. I have never liked any film that Ben Affleck was in, with the exception of "Good Will Hunting" and that might have been because his screen time was cut down to minimum. His presence on the silver screen is the equivalent of nails on a chalkboard... the guy has "I am a narcissistic jerk" written on his forehead. Josh Hartnett acquits himself very nicely, as he usually does in most of his films. I think he understands, unlike Mr. Affleck, that in movie acting, sometimes less is more. Kate Beckinsale did a good job in her impression of a wooden plank. Perhaps Jerry Bruckheimer thought any Kate would do? Beckinsale tries her best to channel Kate Winslet's bread and butter "english rose" acting style but comes up short, way short. Don't even get me started on the films money sequence, the 45 minute long attack on Pearl Harbor. Almost 2,000 men went down on the Arizona, and countless others died on that morning. If you were going to make a film about it, why not give them some dignity, instead of a tired, sorry and clichéd love triangle story?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I admit it could have been better but i found it mostly enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: *** out of ****.Pearl Harbor had the makings for a great movie, but it failed along those lines. The movie was mostly enjoyable, but I think it was meant to better than that. Pearl Harbor succeeds in a few areas but falls short in others. I found it better than Titanic, I will probably be in the minority on that one.The acting is a mixed bag. I think Josh Hartnett is actually good here. Kate Beckinsale is also good here, she and Hartnett have some chemistry that make them believable as a couple. Ben Affleck is downright horrible, he has no chemistry with either Beckinsale or Hartnett. Alec Baldwin is actually the best as Colonel Jimmy Dolittle. Cuba Gooding was just put in this story for star power, he doesnt have enough screentime. Jon Voight is decent as Roosevelt.Michael Bay was the wrong choice for directing this movie. Bay is not an accomplished enough director do something like this, hes made entertaining action movies and thats what Pearl Harbor is, but Bay would never be able to make this into a "serious" movie. He uses a slow motion technique that is really unnecessary and kind of distracting.Pearl Harbor may have some problems in the acting and the director is totally wrong but its real problem lies in the script and editing. I feel that there are scenes between Beckinsale and Affleck that are unnecessary or too long, because these two have absolutely no chemistry together that it makes there scenes seem very uninteresting. Yes I will also admit the movie is about 20 minutes too long. Now we come to the script, which has some very bad dialogue. Some of this stuff is real sappy s***. Its obvious that the screenwriter has as much talent for writing a lovestory as George Lucas did 1 year later with Episode II. Pearl Harbor would have been more successful with a better script.The real strength of Pearl Harbor is in the technical categories. The Attack Scene is one of the most impressive battle scenes I have seen in my life. For 35 minutes you will take a journey back to Hawaii 1941. The movie also has beautiful sets, cinematography and costumes. The movie contains excellent sound too.Pearl Harbor is a bit of a disappointment but I still found enjoyable.</fullReview>

I've never seen a WWII epic that was as poorly done, the historical inaccuracies are too many to enumerate. As offensive as the inaccuracies are the "token" role undertaken by Cuba Gooding Jr, was worse. At least they managed to show Seaman Doris Miller's role in shooting down 2 planes in a mostly true to life fashion, the crud about his boxing was fabricated from whole cloth. It is based on this that I've rated this movie a 2 of 10 and it gets that because the effects were astounding, but not enough to merit anything higher.</fullReview>

If you're going to make a film based around true events, there must be some reality. Basically the film depends on it's, admittedly, excellent action and special effects sequences, but this is a increasing irritating trait of Hollywood, mistaking state of the art special effects for good movie making. Coupled with that, we have what can only be described as a ridiculous story line. It seems to me that some moviemakers need to go back to school and learn how to make good films.

		<shortDescription>Terrible Junk for the Trashbin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a regurgitated mess that not only trashes history in its jingoistic comic strip script, but it also displays none of the qualities found in even poorly-done films, let alone the classics like "Doctor Zhivago" and "Titanic". A total waste of time, and an insult to the men who were killed in the event.The love story wasn't terrible in itself (although not above the mediocre); its problem was that it was incredibly irrelevant to the story and seemingly mere padding. But no matter how boring the love story was, I don't think it comes close to being as awful as the battle scenes which, in spite of having the entire canon of modern effects at the film's disposal, seemed sensationalized while oozing a phony patriotic attitude as the silly carnage went on forever. The attack had NO pathos, no human feeling, no sense of loss. Just the usual spectacular bilge.What a dismal film -- and certainly the worst big film of 2001.The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves!-- Robert Blenheim</fullReview>

Sure, it's not totally 100% historically accurate, the story and the acting is a bit naff and the patriotism is over the top, but you cannot deny that, as an action flick, it's sure hard to beat! Having watched this numerous times on DVD and video, I STILL sit and marvel at the explosion of the USS Arizona, the Zeros chasing the P-40s along the ground, the thumping Hans Zimmer score, the hair-raising carrier take-offs at the end. In the end, it's meant to be a war/action/romance movie, and it succeeds at most of that. I won't openly sit and say "Hey, they didn't use those kind of planes" or "Those guys aren't wearing the right uniform" etc etc. I might afterward, but whenever I watch this, I don't care. I want to be entertained. If I want historical accuracy, then I'll stick on the DVD of Tora! Tora! Tora!**** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not the movie. I mean the number and variety of comments here. The question is why this third-rate flick merits all these weapons of mass destruction aimed at it by critics and viewers alike.The history has been done before, and better. The love stories with the historical event as backdrop have been done before, and better. The film pyrotechnics have been done before, and better. Hawaii has been done before, and better. And the acting, such as it is, represents a new nadir within the entire context of all these categories and more. Ben who? Oh, you mean the guy who would be a nobody but for hanging on to the bootstraps of Matt Damon. Everything else is just a blur of publicity hype and exploitation of sentiment generated by the 60th anniversary of the attack. What grieves me most is to see those of my own generation who remember the day with greater clarity than 9/11 get teary-eyed when anything at all -- even dreck like this -- reminds them of the actual event and the unparalleled suffering that it caused then and for the next four years. Anyone under the age of 65 cannot begin to fathom the true emotions swelling yet beneath the placid surface in our retirement communities. We are constantly looking for that bit of actual war footage showing even a glimpse of a familiar face gone forever. (And this says nothing of the equally great tragedy of Vietnam and the films it inspired.)Some memories should not be toyed with. My advice for those who enjoy war stories is to concentrate on those that take place in the future, as cautionary tales.</fullReview>

The eerieness of the impending attack is handled beautifully. Watching the perplexed looks on the faces of the locals as the Japanese planes fly in toward the harbor is enough to spook you. It's that same look we all had as we watched the second jet hit the WTC-- awe and disbelief. This movie is excellent in the attack sequences and pretty damn enjoyable during the rest. The love story is thin, but I've seen worse. And the director manages to capture that feeling of innocence that all the old-timers say existed before the attack.

So I rented it out again.Although i must agree with most people when saying the love story was indeed stupid and quite sickening but the rest of the movie was bearable and easy to watch.The only actual scenes I enjoy out of the whole movie is the actual bombing of Pearl Harbour. Very spot on with all the events leading up to it and incredible special effects and direction. The storyline is kept good but yes, like I said the love story that HAD to be put in there was overated and nonsense.

Yes, the film was three and a half hours. And yes, it was a soap opera, and a bad one at that. It made Days of our Lives seem less contrived, which was the films only achievement. The basic plot of this film is that Ben Affleck falls in love with Kate Beckinsdale. Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett (Who looks like Matt Damon but isn't.) are best friends. Ben Affleck crashes in his airplane, so Kate is wicked sad about it all. She turns to Josh for comfort.

I did not enjoy it very much because I thought it had too much romance in it. It was one of the most boring war movies of all time in my opinion. I expected it to be much better because of all the names that worked on the movie.

		<fullReview>A good film in terms of story content and the special effects were superb but with severe shortcomings in one area. Great effort was made in digitally erasing modern buildings surrounding Pearl Harbor and creating battleship row. But the effort fell short, if nonexistent with all other ships in the harbor and the aircraft carriers. They all were unmistakably of modern vintage and I was curious how modern supercarriers with the canted flight decks, enclosed bows, and lack of the large stack that was well pronounced in the Lexington and Yorktown class carriers could exist in 1941. I was not born until after the war but anyone with even the slightest knowledge of Naval ships, from old movies or photographs, would not have been fooled. A relative who served aboard 3 carriers during the war including the most famous of all, USS Enterprise CV6, for 26 months told me he was completely unimpressed.</fullReview>

I now own a copy on DVD and have seen it many times since.The main problem with this movie is that it tries too hard to be a "blockbuster" and tries to include all demographics.About half of the film is a war film, which in itself is brilliant. If this was the movie alone, it would be getting very good reviews. The 30 minute attack on Pearl Harbour is some of the best pieces of film ever made.The problem lies with the other half. While us guys are satisfied watching things blow up, the movie tries to offer a love story for the female audience. However, the whole love triangle plot is corny and unnecessary. This part of the movie really sinks it.Having said all that, it is still well worth putting up with the love story to watch a great war film. It's nothing like Saving Private Ryan, but it's still good.The casting of Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale was great; but Ben Affleck, well, need I say more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched this movie several times. For one, I feel that the love story portion of it could've been toned down or left out. The scene at the radar station was not totally correct (the actual radar station was actually a radar van). The guy at Ford Island who received the report from the radar van responded by saying "Don't worry about it", not the way it was shown in this movie. What happened to the USS Nevada?---it wasn't shown at all (the Nevada actually got underway but ended up beaching itself rather that be sunk and block the harbor entrance). Admiral Yamamoto was show on board the carrier "Akagi" in this movie, when in reality he was back on his flagship in Japanese home waters listening to reports coming in. Mitsuo Fuchida, who had the rank of Commander was referred to in the movie as "Colonel" (later in the attack sequence). Only 2 battleships were shown being attacked, but there were more than that present at Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941. A flight of Navy aircraft, as well as some Army Air Corps B-17s were coming in to land. Both groups of aircraft were shot at by trigger happy gunners. But this was not shown in the movie, either. During the Doolittle Raid, the B-25s split up--they all didn't attack the same target. The special effects were spectacular, but the overall historical accuracy could've been much better. Overall, I'd say "Tora, Tora, Tora" was a more historically accurate movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had spectacular special effects, and great battle scenes. But the plot was worse than something Madonna would write. They put a retarded love story in the midst of what's Important. PEARL HARBOR. To call this by that is pretty stupid, loosely based on Pearl Harbor is more like it. One more thing to point out is the acting. John Voight, Colm Feore, Cuba Gooding Jr., Alec Baldwin and Tom Seizemore. They were magnificent in this film. Kate Beckinsalt, Josh Hartnet, and Ben Affleck(The last two cant act period) were aful. The only thing that was tear-jerking about this attempted Drama was the Acting by the main (screen hogging If i may say) Lead cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Affleck, you are great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not since Boiler Room has Ben Affleck put in a comedic performance like the one in Pearl Harbor. The absurd accent, the obscene facial expressions, the "I'll attempt to survive the attack by moving to the next target" approach; Affleck is wonderful. I truly cannot wait until his movies with J-Lo are released, I will be amongst the first in line to see the new breed of American comedy. On to the feature...Pearl Harbor is, well we all know what it is truly about, though the film is more about a bunch of Japanease guys, who while rocking these sweet headbands like they are extras in Karate Kid, attempt to kill Cuba Gooding Jr, which is an admirable goal. Obviously they can't get to Cuba because he is a cook looking for respect. Why they made Cuba a cook when he wanted to join the Navy and fight I have no idea. I thought one of the beefs with our militia is that we put black dudes on the front line and used them as cannon fodder, I guess back in 1941 we attempted to protect them from any potential danger by making valuable commodities like Cuba Gooding jr. cooks. What were his credentials for becoming a cook? Did he have any training? They don't just make any old guy the cook, especially one who in theory could fight, if he wasn't such a huge wus. Once again, where was star of Wild and Crazy Kids, Omar Gooding? He is clearly the more talented of the Goodings, whie we are at it we might as well replace Affleck with Donnie Jeffcoat and Hartnett with Annett Chavez. I think that would have added a nice twist to the movie. Anyway, I watched the battle scene, which had some impressive effects paired with delightful homor by Gooding and Affleck. I also saw this part where Cuba boxes some guy and then goes to the hospital complaining how he's just a cook. If only they had a cameo by Fuzzy Zoeller complaining to Cuba Gooding while on line at the mess hall about the constant serving of fried chicken and cornbread, that would have been the perfect compliment to Affleck's brilliance. All in all I'd say don't see this movie, cause it sucks. However, if you have an utterly useless life or a few hours to spare, perhaps while you are on copious amounts of morphine, I'd throw it on for a good laugh or two.</fullReview>

It isn't the first time, that the attack on Pearl Harbor has been filmed, but there are much better alternatives than this film! It's a bad mix of a love-story and too much patriotism. The Japanese fighters are nothing than bad guys. The Americans are the best people of the world and doing everything righter than right. The U.S. President has been surprised of this attack.... At historical sight I've to say, that movie doesn't reflect, what really happened. And, at war, there are no heroes, only victims.</fullReview>

And the achievements of the fighting men is mocked so terribly by falsification and stupid nationalistic arrogance that it can only compare to propaganda from Stalinist Soviet.

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor had one of the best trailers I've ever seen. The John Voight voice over even gave it a verisimilitude of a real FDR Fireside Chat. The shots and staging were some of the best of any film to date. Bruckheimer and Bay seemed on their way to hitting a grand slam.Instead, they hit a single.If you mute the soundtrack and script, most will agree that Pearl Harbor is perfectly filmed. The costumes, settings (modern Navy frigates aside), and feel of the film were perfect. The script, however, is horrendous. Ben Affleck delivers the worst lines in movie history. Beckinsale and Hartnett LOOK great, but have equally deplorable dialogue. Why in God's name would you make Pearl Harbor into a love story? It reminded me of the Saturday Night Live skit where they combined Crystal Pepsi and gravy to make "Crystal Gravy." Some things just don't mix.No doubt, there are several well made scenes in the film. Voigt's FDR is actually reall good, but again, we have the perennial dialogue problem. The actual bombing is riveting, but then we return to the moronic love triangle that hangs over the film like a sword of Damocles. Alec Baldwin and Kim Coates provide throwaway characters -- perhaps the most shallow portrayal of Lt. Col. Doolittle possible.I'm at an impasse because the film could have truly been so much better. Bruckheimer had good actors, big budget, well-financed production, and talented writers. Yet combined, he created anti-syngeries: The best looking film with the worst story.I suppose it's impossible to expect every hit to be a grand slam. Bruckheimer did redeem himself with Black Hawk Down. As for Pearl Harbor, just catch it on HBO reruns. It's barely worth the rental on Video on Demand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was on only my third mission for Her Majesty's intelligence services that I was captured. My respected father had faced down Stazi interrogators in East Berlin years before in the same line of work, and I had no intention of betraying his honourable record.Yet, my confidence was soon proven to be misplaced. I had not expected the true variety of torture that my captors would employ to encourage me to talk. Scorpion venom, bamboo splinters, electric shocks... many unspeakable torments, but none of them could persuade me to betray my country. I would not talk, I would not utter a single word.After the first month, I was a wreck, a wretched shadow of a human being. After the second month, I had begun to pray for death.After six months, I had talked - I had told them everything I had ever known, a hundred times - and yet they still tormented me.Soon they stopped torturing me, but they kept me imprisoned. On a diet that allowed me little more than the luxury of slow starvation, I was in a state of continual exhaustion and weakness. I lost teeth. I was once allowed to see myself in the mirror and I knew then that I would never again be the man I had once been, not without the help of God and all his angels.Then, after three years a sparrow began to visit my cell. The few crumbs I could spare to feed the little animal encouraged him to be my friend, and soon his visits made my life a little less lacking in despair. Until, one morning my guard saw this, and shot the sparrow. My despair was profound beyond the telling.And it was only at this point that the experience became objectively worse than watching Pearl Harbour.</fullReview>

In a single package, you have bad acting, terrible writing and revisionist history. One verrrrry long package I might add. When is someone going to stop Ben Afleck from making movies? His work has been downhill since "Chasing Amy". Of course, his supporting cast is no better. Kate Beckinsdale, Josh Harnett and Afleck do nothing with the material they are given. Yes, the writing is dreadful, but their performances do nothing more than make that even more obvious than it already is to the viewer. What was up with that "love triangle"? Did they hire and eighth grader to write that portion of the screenplay? This movie should have been forty minutes long. Let us ooh and aah over the explosions. The parts where the actors speak will only induce sleep or, more likely, actual physical pain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Believe the terrible reviews. This movie sucks more than the latest vacuum cleaner technology and is not even half as much fun. It is also highly offensive cinematically, historically and racially.Cinematically this movie falls on its face from the first shot. Director Michael Bay seems to think we are more interested in the spectacle of the event rather than the people involved. Therefore we get lots of eye-candy but minimal character development. Therefore the actors can't do anything but look the part. Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett are awful in the leading roles, and Kate Beckinsale is nothing more than a one dimensional skirt. What is worse, we are supposed to get an adrenaline rush from watching innocent people die (i.e. the numerous explosions). Bay even has the cheek of showing Pearl Harbour as a US victory, when it was anything but. Racially, this movie uses all the Japanese stereotypes and then some, presenting us with a laughable set of villains. If this is the point, then this movie is even worse. I don't have a problem with films that promise you pure entertainment. I do have a problem with films that try and pass themselves off as profound and sensitive when they are really about making money and brainwashing teenagers into thinking this is how things really are. Its not entertaining, its not clever and its downright pretentious. Pearl Harbour is terrible. Enough said.</fullReview>

It was like they were in the 90's, but they were wearing old clothing. Most WW2 films have that dark, gloomy look to them. Not the case here. It was way too glamorous. Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are a couple of prima donnas. They wouldn't last 2 seconds in a battle, which made the movie very unbelievable. This is a chick flick all the way.

		<fullReview>SPOILER Out of ten I gave this a three. and thats only because the acting was good you spend three quarters of the film bored. Ok lets see basic storyline, Pilot goes off to Europe to fight for Britain but while he's away she cheats on him and not only that with his best friend. Ok maybe its because she thinks he's dead but is that really enough. and then he turns up alive just in time to find out she's pregnant with his friends baby and to be bombed by the Japanese, What a stroke of luck in the timing there. So then you have the bombing by the Japanese which is where the story gets quite exciting maybe because they actually pick up the pace a little, To be quite honest at this point you feel like your told the story by a Ninety year old with breathing difficulties.So then the Japanese are quite merrily bombing the crap out of the US Navy Port of Pearl Harbor. And guess what you got the Two friends fighting side by side. anyway I think you get the Gist. This is nothing but sentimental rubbish. If you actually enjoyed the storyline of Titanic you'd probably enjoy this.P.s. If you don't know your history here's a Hint The US Won in the end, but only after they were drawn in by this event. so this is reflected in the storyline with the usual Hollywood Aren't we great ending. After all the victors write the history books and the beaten crawl back ashamed and try to forget they lost.This could have worked if they had of cut out the sentimental storyline, had the Japanese attack earlier and extended the fight back part of the storylineSo in summation this is a film that will probably only be enjoyed by people who like soppy movies or people who like mindless boring crap that teaches you nothing and twists events to suit their end goal (I think you know a few of these people in powerful political positions). Once again I think was a case of bad writing rather than anything else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SLIGHT SPOILERS*I'll start with a brief summary: This film is awful.Perhaps the most annoying thing is that it has all the ingredients for a good film - the cast is strong enough, a big budget, great effects, powerful themes... but its all just gone horribly wrong.The acting and dialogue are very sub-standard; since the movie has a really capable cast then I'll put the blame for that on the cringe-inducing dialogue (Danny, shot and bleeding... "I'm... I'm not gunna make it, Rafe!!"; Yamamoto on being told of the resounding success of the Pearl Harbor attacks... "I fear all we have done is awaken a sleeping giant"). The historical innaccuracies are numerous and varied - Japanese 'Zero' fighters were NOT green, for a start.I could write so so much about how bad this film is, but I really don't have time. There are some great effects and one or two points in the film which are really powerful, but mostly it's just Hollwood being self-indulgant and kissing it's own (American) ass once again. Maybe in the next Michael Bay film we'll see how America won the battle of Waterloo, or how a bunch of brave GIs helped put out the Great Fire of London.The last 20 minutes where Affleck, having just crash-landed his B52 takes out an entire Japanese platoon using only a pistol is just absolutely abysmal...I guess it's worth watching but I'm truly worried that a lot of people will treat this rubbish as a history lesson - please, please don't!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes 'They Died With Their Boots On' look like a documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, let's divide this comment up into two sections: One: Positive comments Two: Negative commentsOne.....................okay, that's enough of that. Two, Get ready, this is a long one. But first, I'll say this in all fairness. It's an exciting film, and in some ways, does manage to portray the kind of intense, chaotic atmosphere that the attack must have engendered that morning. I love war movies and I've seen hundreds, good, bad, and ugly. This is a very ugly one. Only the special effects are any good. Period. This is only Jerry Bruckheimer's lame attempt to capitalize on the Titanic scenario of putting a heartwarming love story on a stage of a major historic event. But he did Cameron one better. Three lovers, but of course, one dies in a way that makes Jack Dawson's demise look wooden. Oh, I'm sorry. IT WAS WOODEN. This movie has no business masquerading as a portrayal of one of our history's most tragic and pivotal events. I personally know six PH survivors, including John Finn, the last surviving MOH recipient for December 7. He and most of his comrades simply shake their heads when they are asked about this film. It's a damned joke, a tragedy, and a downright INSULT to them and their dead comrades. A pathetic attempt to make the Arizona's 1177 dead into the 'focal point' of the film's patriotic theme is nothing more than a 'look what a great special effect this is' showcase. Now for the nitty gritty: 1.The RAF Eagle Squadron did not use active duty USAAC pilots. They accepted American volunteers with extensive or PAST Air Corps experience. The US could not risk the Germans saying that the US was actively sending American servicemen to fight in the Battle of Britain. 2.A PT12 Stearman, the crop duster in the beginning of the film, was a current and state-of-the art aircraft in the Air Corps inventory in the late '20s. Danny's dad would have had a Curtiss Jenny or a DeHavilland DH4. 3.Correct me if I'm wrong (I'm not) but the Battle of Britain ended on September 15, 1940. Even if Rafe was shot down on that day, (and what was he doing near the French coast?) and returned three months later, it would have been in no later than January 1941, not December 5. Granted, he might have been in the RAF until much later, but that's not what the film seems to suggest. 4.Where in hell was General Walter Short? 5.As noted by another comment, there were NO green Japanese Army A6Ms (Zeros) on the PH raid. Only the Nakajima Kates were green.6.USS Nevada's run for the sea. USS Utah sinks. USS Maryland sinks. USS California sinks...okay you get the idea. As this film says, only Arizona sinks, Oklahoma rolls over and Shaw explodes. End of raid. Nothing about Kaneohe Bay NAS or the B-17s coming in. 7.The 'heartrending' scenes of the attack are nothing more than a vehicle to get Rafe and Danny into a pair of P-40 Warhawks from a satellite field. By the way, with all that was happening, how in hell did Danny know that the Halewa Field nad not been hit? 8.No Warhawk pilot with more than 3.6 minutes of flying experience would EVER try to dogfight Zeros. Can't be done. All the Flying Tigers used the greater weight of the P40 to dive into Japanese formations, attack with one pass, and get out. They always had the advantage of altitude. Having three or four Zeros chasing you through the streets of PH at eye level would have one result: Two dead Americans. And what was that junk about 'let's play chicken?' What a load of dung! I'm sure that any surviving Air Corps fighter pilots must have walked, or stormed out of the theater at this point, thrown up or fell on the floor laughing hysterically. And getting men into the tower to shoot at the Zeros with Tommy guns. Nice touch. How'd they get the 100-round drum magazines? 9.The worst part, is that quaint bit about Doolittle saying, 'hey, let's get you into some bombers and go bomb Tokyo. Wanna come?' What a bigger load of dung. The crews of the 16 Doolittle Raiders were from a bomb group in Oregon and were all brought to Eglin in Florida for traning. NOT A FIGHTER PILOT IN SIGHT. A figher pilot going WILLINGLY to bombers is like an LeMans driver retireing to drive 18-wheelers to Cleveland. Didn't happen. Never. 10.Rafe and Danny, even BEFORE they left Pearl for the states, had the correct shoulder patch for the group that flew the raid. But how'd they get them? They were not in that bomb group. And I'm sure that the costume dept is patting themselves on the back for having the right patch. Duh. 11.I noticed that the USS Hornet went at one point from being WWII Yorktown class carrier to a modern one with an angled flight deck. USS Hornet had been painted in camoflage before the raid and DID NOT have the number '6' painted on the bow. 12.There was no last-minute frantic lightening of the bombers just before the raid. They simply loaded more gas onto them and had stripped them to a bare minimum long before they were placed on the ship. 13.Nice shooting, Danny. A bunch of mad Japanese soldiers with guns on you and you manage to pull your trusty .45 automatic and gun them all down. Nice shootin' Tex. 14.There are a ton more, but why bother? The film is an insult to the brave and traumatized men and women who were there that Sunday morning. Tora Tora Tora is a far better account, even if it does have a few flaws. I feel sorry for the people who take this to be an accurate and compelling portrayal of Pearl Harbor, but it's just a stupid, vapid love story with a predictable end, using a dark and painful episode of American history to make us think watching it is a patriotic act. It's not. I've seen patriotic films that work. Gettysburg is a good one. So is Longest Day or Band of Brothers, and Saving Private Ryan. This turkey is a joke. A cruel joke. 15.Nuff said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faux Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay production PEARL HARBOR is one of the great missed opportunities in the history of American movies. A year before the film's May 25, 2001 opening theater audiences were teased with a series of impressive trailers highlighting spectacular action sequences from the 135 million dollar production. Advance poster art for the film displayed handsome visages of the three main stars with vintage military aircraft flying in the background. Could it be that Michael Bay, the director of such mindless crash and burn spectaculars as THE ROCK and Armageddon , had acquired a gift for epic storytelling? James Cameron, another filmmaker noted more for technical know-how than with a gift for the pen had pulled it off a few years earlier with TITANIC , creating a hugely popular historical romance the likes of which had not been seen since DOCTOR ZHIVAGO and GONE WITH THE WIND. Alas, it was not to be. PEARL HARBOR emerged as an overblown , incredibly mediocre wartime romance. A box office sensation in its first 2 weeks of release , its numbers dwindled drastically as a result of lukewarm reviews and poor word-of mouth. The film seemed to gain a loyal following among the younger generations far removed from the events of December 7, 1941. But to World War 2 veterans and older members of the baby boom era, the picture was looked on as a travesty of history and a totally false depiction of the culture and its times. Randall Wallace's original screenplay had the quality of a sloppy first draft. The paint -by-numbers story of two childhood buddies who join the Airforce , fall in love with the same woman ( a gorgeous Army nurse, naturally! ) and go on to seemingly defend all of Pearl Harbor against the sudden Japanese attack is numbingly predictable. Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett portray the two boyhood friends with great earnestness but they are crushed under the weight of a poorly written scenario.The lovely and talented Kate Beckinsale , the object of the boys' affections, is also wasted in an essentially generic role. In fact the entire supporting cast is one huge blur, everyone playing "types" instead of flesh and blood people. The film's spectacular set piece, the attack by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor, is a tour De force of visual and sound effects (for which the movie deservedly won an Academy Award) but it can't save the second hand plot from sinking in its own commonplaceness. I wanted to like PEARL HARBOR. Making a movie , large or small can be an enormous task and it's amazing when a project is completed that fulfills even half of what the filmmakers intended. But the creators of PEARL HARBOR announced the importance of their brainchild early on , and the critics were armed on opening day.In this case the critics were right. PEARL HARBOR is the frivolous product of a costly, uninspired imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yuck! Okay, in more detail: The acting is atrocious. The story is cliched. The dialogue is unlikely in extremis. Only the special effects are worthwhile. They're nearly perfect -- although I don't think Michael Bay's preference for green Zeroes (for artistic purposes) justifies their overabundance (the Kate torpedo- and high-level-bombers were in an olive green mottle; the Val dive bombers and Zero fighters were almost exclusively in the Imperial Japanese Navy's blue-grey [almost a dove grey]). Can fighter jocks be retrained to fly twin engine medium bombers, on the whim of the CO? Would they want to be? I doubt the Army Air Force could have spared experienced fighter pilots in the spring of 1942, and besides, all 16 pilots and 16 co-pilots on the Doolittle raid are accounted for: none of them was a recently re-trained fighter pilot, and none of them had been at Pearl Harbor. And none of them were Welch or Taylor, the two American pilots who made it into the air on 7/12/41. The modern warships masquerading as pre-WWII warships look as out of place as an M-16 in the Civil War. Their bows are way too sharp, the biggest giveaway.With all that money to burn, this movie does a disservice to history, to war movies -- even to Romance.Avoid at all costs!</fullReview>

I was surprised that it came so early because I knew "Pearl Harbor" was an "epic" and had a long way to go. Apparently they couldn't bear to end the movie on a downbeat note so the flick goes on to show the Americans striking back at the Japanese. I can live with that amount of cheese. But the super helping of double cheese that is the love triangle choked me to death. It smothers "Pearl Harbor".It's a shame too because the battle scene is so good. I couldn't bear to watch this movie again because of that super fake love story. Now putting a love story in a war movie is not in and of itself a bad thing. But the makers of this flick have no concept of real human emotions. Everything they know about love comes from watching other movies. Bad movies too. Corny is putting it nicely. Making love in the parachute room? Come on man. Bleech. There are more examples of cheese but it's not worth going into. It was too much and too fake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PEARL HARBOR was really two movies; one part was a horribly written love triangle (that makes the love story in STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES look good) between Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale. The other part was a gritty, in-your-face action packed historical trip back to the early '40s that showed the attack of Pearl Harbor.Like so many movies I've seen recently (HEAT, ATTACK OF THE CLONES), this is a movie that could be started half way through the film and you wouldn't miss a thing. Actually, the whole first half of the film deals with the really boring love triangle mixed in with the foreshadowing that Japan will attack us. If you took out the whole love triangle thing, this would have been a superb movie.As of this point, I will pretend the love triangle (which was most likely thrown in for the DAWSON'S CREEK teenybopper audience) thing didn't exist. What we have here is a great, typical Bruckheimer film that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The action is superb. The performances by Cuba Gooding Jr. and Jon Voight as President Franklin D. Roosevelt were on the money.I would recommend this movie, just skip the love triangle scenes and it will be that much more enjoyable.I give PEARL HARBOR two stars. (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film's amazing battle sequences are murdered by its foolish love story, which seems more like a TV commercial. If we skip the first 80 minutes of the movie, its rating would be much higher.Aside from the cliched story, the studio has to use good-looking male leads to attract female audiences. Predictably, the guy who got second billing must die so that to solve the love triangle.The most unbelievable part of the film is a pilot could take off with a nurse without permission from superior officer. Moreover, he then proceeds to screw her in their military base freely. (What are those nets for? some set decoration!) The screenwriter must have learned something from THE DEER HUNTER, because he also let two childhood pals enlist in the same squadron for plot convenience. Obviously, the director and the writer don't know anything about military service. I suppose beautiful photography and realistic special effects are much enough for them.When fighting the Japanese in the sky, our two heroes keep yelling at each other through radio. They're certainly the most talkative pilots in film history. Perhaps they were playing computer games while filming, that's why they're so excited!There is, however, a very true moment: nurses are being shot at by Japanese planes while running in the street. Would they actually shoot at women? Yes, indeed. Anyone who knows a little about how Japanese soldiers did to Chinese women during the war would firmly believe it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>6 out of 10Pearl Harbor thinks its a glorious masterpiece that meditates the meaning of love, brotherhood, and the loss of innocence. Sorry, Mr. Bruckheimer, deep this movie isn't. What he and director Michael Bay have done, however, is craft an extremely entertaining action/romance which at least does partial justice to those who died in the Pearl Harbor attack. Yes, my enjoyment of this film is of the guilty variety. The writing is full of cliches, overblown speeches, and one-note stereotypes with a mediocre love story at the center of it all. But the performances are all charismatic and surprisingly fitting for a movie set in this time period and the battle scenes are spectacular and visually stunning. Pearl Harbor obviously wants to be Saving Private Ryan meets Titanic, and it's definitely second rate on both attempts, but being second rate to those films at least means it makes a decent timewaster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This re-telling of one of the pivotal moments of world history does partly deserve the epithet of 'Titanic with bombs', but it's still reasonably watchable. The soap opera is overdone and the much-vaunted special effects look at times (particularly with the destruction of the USS Arizona) just like special effects - never a good sign when they are supposed to look real. The performances are not bad, but not great either.If you want to see the story of 7th December, 1941, watch Tora! Tora! Tora!; if you want a human story with this as a backdrop, watch From Here To Eternity - this can't compete with either. On the positive side, it's better than U571 - but what isn't?</fullReview>

I feel badly for the veterans who have seen the movie and remembered their own experiences at Pearl Harbor. The movie takes their pain and courage and makes it a backdrop for a goofy melodrama. I guess the cutie pie actors do fine with what they are given, but their story becomes sappy and more implausible by the minute.

		<fullReview>Not that I loath Zimmer's score, I think it was masterful and beautiful, but for a story so similar to Titanic, wouldn't he have thought up some way to really compete with it? The song is nice but doesn't play orchestrally throughout the movie like Titanic, I suppose that's cause he didn't write it.I like this movie, but only the parts minus the love story.When I saw this, I wasn't expecting a Titanic ripoff. I was expecting something TRUE. I saw this very same thing (sort of) in a time travel episode of BOY MEETS WORLD. Cory goes off to the war, makes his best friend Shawn promise if he doesn't come back to marry Topanga, then he comes back from the dead so to speak, interrupting the wedding.For an actor of Cuba's status I was surprised his character wasn't developed more. All that time they spent showing the closeness between the three fictional characters they could have spent on REAL people in Pearl Harbor before the attack, much like Cameron did in Titanic. See my review on that for more insight.When my mom and stepfather got home from seeing this, I said, "Too bad it wasn't true," and my mom and stepfather were so misled by the love story they couldn't believe it was fiction. The same went for my sister and her husband, and even my brother who is an expert at war movies, ESPECIALLY WWII, was duped, and his girlfriend. What's hilarious is that I am the youngest out of all of them and I knew it was too soapy-Titanic-like to be true.I don't care for war movies, so I can't really recommend an alternative one to seeing this, but I can advise, SEE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK. IF HISTORY IS WHAT YOU WANT, JUST WATCH THE ATTACK-THE END. Or perhaps check out some documentaries, or if you are into anything about America's involvement in WWII, watch BAND OF BROTHERS, excellent miniseries from HBO.It's really a shame that they couldn't find ANYTHING AT ALL that would make the audience "care" for the real people in this event that they had to create FICTIONAL characters instead. Is this what historical filmmaking has been reduced to? Or were they just aching for a hit like Titanic?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not the history that's bad, it's the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It mystifies me that the complaints against this movie so often center around its lack of historical accuracy. I hate to tell you this, guys, but the movie mostly gets the history right. There's a minor detail wrong here and there, but if somebody who never heard of World War II saw this movie, he would walk away with a very clear picture of what happened at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. He would know that the Japanese planned the attack meticulously, that they struck without warning and achieved complete surprise, that the battleships were caught moored in the harbor, that the American carriers were not damaged, that the ARIZONA exploded and the OKLAHOMA capsized. He would even know that the Japanese admiral who planned the attack, Isoroku Yamamoto, had severe doubts about Japan's ability to win the war it was starting.Perfect historical accuracy was not achieved, but neither was it claimed. The movie never pretended to be anything but a fictional story set against a historical backdrop, and the historical backdrop is perfectly adequate - far better than average for Hollywood. It's the fictional story in the foreground that stinks.PEARL HARBOR's story is about a love triangle. That's not the problem either. The love triangle is a perfectly good plot device; some of the finest dramas ever made are built on it. But the device can't work by itself. It's a setup for the characters to make dramatic choices. In PEARL HARBOR, the characters in the triangle mostly don't make any choices, and even when they do, the choices are irrelevant. Forces outside the characters themselves set the triangle up; forces outside themselves then resolve it. The characters' own thoughts and feelings don't drive the story.The arbitrary setup and denouement aren't the only problems with the story, though they are the worst. The movie also presents stupidity as if it were a survival skill. From their boyhood to their adulthood, Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker fly like dummies. This isn't accidental; the movie deliberately paints them as dangerous to themselves and their comrades. In the real world, stupid military pilots die - quickly. World War II aerial warfare was one of the most unforgiving combat arenas in military history (for instance, you could very easily kill yourself without any help from the enemy). What would it have cost to show these fellows as being aces because they were smart? Not only would the movie have been truer to life, but it would have been more fun to watch.I can't help but sympathize with Cuba Gooding, Jr., who might as well have had "gotta get the black demographic" stamped on his forehead. He has nothing, nothing whatsoever, to do with the actual story; he doesn't interact with any of the main characters meaningfully, and had he been white he would have been written out of the script or, more likely, never written into it in the first place. I have to admire Gooding's professionalism, since he did a good job anyway, even though he must have known he was a token. I hope most of the black viewers had the good sense to feel insulted by the condescending assumption that no black person would have any interest in a story about white people.At least the bloated budget does achieve the things that bloated budgets can do. The high-dollar acting talent pays off. Ben Affleck's acting is superb; he does pain, resentment and embarrassment very well. He doesn't get a chance to be subtle, but screenwriter Randall Wallace clearly intended Rafe McCawley to be a man who wears his heart on his sleeve. Mako does a first-rate Admiral Yamamoto; his lined face and spare figure make him less than a perfect physical match for the real man, but he gets his spirit just right. The visual effects are reasonably good.PEARL HARBOR was made in an attempt to copy the success of TITANIC. Even the most rabid TITANIC-hater will have to admit, on seeing PEARL HARBOR, that James Cameron could have done a lot worse. He could have made a movie like this one.Rating: ** out of ****Recommendation: See it on cable on a slow night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A veritable encyclopedia of clichés...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, in one movie, every possible war movie cliché ever made! "Just get me into a darn plane!"I did like the scene when the Zeros fill the sky on their way to the attack. If you want to see something worth seeing, watch "Tora Tora Tora". It's much better, even if it is a bit dated....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More history rewriting in an effects driven film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh dear, more liberties taken with history in the name of American patriotism. The effects of the attack are amazing, and it's very high adrenaline, but the love story has nothing at all to do with the story and just detracts from what could have been a good film. Much like Saving Private Ryan, and many other American war movies, they tend to forget who else was in the war, timelines, important events and causes, etc, etc. If you've nothing else to do then this is pulp entertainment to wash over you. Otherwise, go see something more historically correct!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pretty awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting was uniformly bad. The historical inaccuracies were too numerous to itemize. The special effects were cheesy. But some of the nurses were very cute. I like Kate Beckinsale a lot, and maybe this movie was good for her career. But it doesn't look good on anyone else's filmography.Now, I admit that it's much more difficult to make a realistic WWII movie now than it was 50 or even 40 years ago. But it can be done. Saving Private Ryan is a good example, HBO's Band of Brothers is another. Filming a simulated attack on Pearl Harbor is more difficult than a simulated assault on an empty beach. But if you're going to spend $150 million on a movie, the result should be a film worth watching. This one rates as equal to a fairly mediocre network mini-series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's not perfect but worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor, I think, can be called as the hottest one for last summer vocation in Shanghai. 'cause it has many great and huge scenes of the war-fighting. They were made perfect, I consider, not worse than the ones in Saving Private Ryan, even better. But what should be mentioned here is that you'd better see this film in the cinema, or I'm afraid that you would not find the feelings of how strong the scenes are for your eyes and the music are for your ears. As we all know, the synopsis is that set during the time of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, two friends (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) are caught up in the events that draw the United States into World War II. One of them enlists with the U.S. Army Air Corps and the other flies for the British Royal Air Force, but they both find themselves in love with the same woman (Kate Beckinsale). I've seen this flick-show for three times. I dun think of it as one of the greatest movies in the world, but I still consider that it is worth seeing. Before watching it, I thought that it would surely talk much about the war. ( I just learnt it from the name of the movie.) But I was wrong! I found it talked more about love--the relationships among Rafe, Denny and Evelyn. I guess that the director wanna use the love story as the main clue to the whole movie story. But too much has made the movie neither the kind of love nor the kind of history. In the way of love, Pearl Harbor is not as good as Titanic and in the way of war, it is also not so good as Saving Private Ryan. So I think that's the reason why Pearl Harbor is not in the tops box in the States. Well, having said a lot about the main idea of the movie, let me change to talk something about the characters in this film. I like the three chief actors. Ben Affleck who acts as Rafe is very handsome. ^^ I like him. His handsome face, tall and straight figure with the uniform makes me feel the hot heart inside his body--brave! He is really like an officer, a soldier. During the wars, he showed the very wisdom and courage of a real soldier. Besides those, the friendship between he and Denny has touched me much. Rafe always tried to protect Denny from dangers, but in the end Denny cost his life to save Rafe's. I also desire this kinda friendship. Evelyn is the woman the both love at the same time. I think she loved both of them. 'cause they are too nice! It's hard for her to make a choice. If I were her, I would get the same trouble. In addition, the music through the movie is perfect I think. The main music in it makes me feel how vast, wide, calm the sky is. And I also got a little bit sadness in the song. Anyway, Pearl Harbor is worthy of being seen. There's no doubt about my words. Trust me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For months, I bashed this movie, insulting anyone who ever claimed to like the movie. This was all in good fun until one of my victims pointed out that I had not actually seen the movie, and was basing my criticisms on reviews I've read. So, I took their advice and saw it myself.Now I'm forced to apologize. I shouldn't have been insulting people for liking this movie. I should have been stabbing them.I can see what Michael Bay was thinking when he pitched this film. He watched TITANIC three or four times, and thought, "Hey! I can make that suck!" And in that respect, he succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams. The film is exactly like TITANIC, if you just remove the romantic chemistry and replace it with a whiny soap opera, take the gripping human struggle and replace it with over-blown action sequences, and take intriguing actors giving brave performances and replace them with Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckinsale. The reviews I read all condemned the sugary and unconvincing love story, and rightly so, but nearly all the articles commented on how impressive the Pearl Harbor sequence was. I have to argue. While the special effects were adequate, the scene failed to capture my attention. It dragged on for an unbearable forty minutes, and instead of being enthralled, I was bored. However, at the point when Affleck and Hartnett get into their planes and start shooting down attacking Japanese forces, I wasn't bored. I was angry. That simple action destroyed any credibility that the scene may have created. While TITANIC's heroes performed some heroic deeds, they never saved the day, and when it came down to it, they were just trying to get off the boat alive. The biggest insult in the film, however, would be Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s performance. It can best be described as "brave." You'd have to be brave to compromise your career in such a reckless fashion. His character has no purpose whatsoever. He escapes the kitchen, watches his favorite captain die, then mans the nearest machine gun and shoots down one plane. ONE PLANE. This may have meant something if there weren't about a thousand planes bombing the harbor. Good job, man. You're a true American hero. And what scathing PEARL HARBOR review would be complete without a mention of the complete lack of chemistry between the three leads? The groan-inducing dialogue? The embarassingly inept screenplay? The hideous performance by Jon Voight as FDR? The laughably bad makeup that is used to give him turkey neck? Oh, so many complaints, so little time.The movie is a gaudy monstrosity, so convinced of it's own importance yet completely oblivious of it's superficiality. One of the worst films of the decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well at first i was reluctant to see this film as it seemed like another boring film but i tagged along with my friends when going to the cinema.Well it got off to a good start and i was actually gaining interest in the film and by the end of it,it was exceptionally good. The effects are mind-blowingly realistic and excellent,the acting is superb and you're drawn into the film by this.The storyline is great and it really takes you back in time to 1941 on that fateful December 7th.Its the story about two young best friend pilots and one of them has to go to help the British in World War two while the other stays to help America in their arrival in the war.There is then an awkward love triangle going on between Danny,Rafe and Evelyn which tears Rafe's and Danny's friendship apart during the bombing of Pearl Harbor,However they make up for the 'Doolittle project which involves them flying to Japan and bombing it.A very dramatic and touching ending finishes the film off.The best bit is the two young fine actors-a la Josh Hartnett and Ben Affleck.Ben Affleck once again wowed the audience as he stepped into Rafe McCawley's shoes but Josh Hartnett!A stunning performance from the young actor has guaranteed his place in Hollywood's finest.Although he hadn't made the greatest debut in films such as 'The virgin suicides' and 'Here on earth',he's certainly made an impression now.The end isn't the greatest of films but personally it's an excellent, historically educational film that earns its place in Hollywood's best remember films.Its a must for all of you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why doesn't Ben Affleck do quality films anymore?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen "Pearl Harbor" once, free of charge, and even that encounter felt like an imposition. The film is an abomination; it relies on a trite, if sweeping, score and a wealth of explosions to give it the feel of an epic, but its tired dialogue and minimally detailed script keep it far from that pantheon. Also, it's packed with historical inaccuracies, so many that I felt an apology to all who were actually stationed at Pearl Harbor during the attack might well be due. As for the actors themselves, nearly every performance was a disappointment, particularly Ben Affleck's. From his work with directors like Gus Van Sant and Kevin Smith, we have seen that he is capable of bringing to the screen characters that are both complex and compelling, but that seems not to be his interest in "Pearl Harbor". There is a hint of chemistry with costar Josh Hartnett that might have been developed and made the film more compelling, but, as presented, it is execrable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was blown away at how bad this film was. However, I believe that Pearl Harbor is the future in Hollywood. Take a subject that people are familiar with, create some really good special effects that cost millions, pack it full of young stars that are not great actors and then pound out a script in a couple of minutes. What a disgrace to an actual historical event by making this over-simplified, moronic piece of garbage. Bruckheimer and Bey have no respect for film, just music videos for 12 year olds. You could get more of an education by hitting yourself in the head with a hammer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To recapitulate MacBeth, this film strikes me as being "full of sound and fury, signifying nothing". O Level English out of the way, after seeing it I got the impression that the producer had leant heavily upon the director's shoulder and said "Son - what I want is a 90's rock video version of World War Two. Lot's of slo-mo, smoke, gratuitous smooching. Oh, and some really big explosions." And the director went to his Big Book Of Movie Cliches for inspiration. Note that the title is a misnomer, most of the film doesn't concern Pearl Harbour. "Tora Tora Tora" is a lot more even-handed and accurate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie gets unfairly compared to "Titanic" because of this I delayed watching it. The movie stayed unwatched on my TiVo for weeks. Finally when I had enough time to commit to it I started watching with the idea I could stop it if the movie didn't hook me and maintain my interest. I was probably hooked in the first 5 minutes. To me the reality of Pearl Harbor is intensified when it involves people we know and like. On the negative side some of the "love story" dialog did get a bit mushy but I don't think the romance aspect got in the way of showing what happened on December 7th 1941. I don't always believe the critics, watch this one for yourself. I think this movie will grow in stature after a few years.</fullReview>

It's just another dumb, boring and overlong Hollywood action blockbuster.The filmmakers took basically the same plot as Cameron's "Titanic" and tried to make it look like "Saving Private Ryan": Starting with an uninteresting cheesy love story and showing off with lots of loud special effects, this junk just wouldn't end.

		<fullReview>Events in history, in my opinion, can never be captured into a movie, at least not with full effect. However, Pearl Harbor does a great job at it. Although the first little while in the movie can be a bit boring to some people, it caught my interest. And when the action finally starts, it never stops. Bombs fly, planes soar, and machine guns mow soldiers down. I didn't experience the attack on Pearl Harbor, nor did anyone in my family, but I can imagine it was something extremely close to this movie. I'm sure that nurses and doctors in hospitals were swamped with half-dying people, and I'm positive that any soldier rushed to a plane so he can take action in the war. I gave this movie an 8 because in my opinion the movie was a little too long. I've watched this movie once in it's entirety, and everytime I sit down to watch it again I think, "I don't want to watch this whole movie again." But other than that I have no problems at all with this movie, I think Pearl Harbor is a great film and deserves more credit than people give it.</fullReview>

Also, the real attack on Pearl Harbor took 15 minutes, which somehow translated into 45 minutes. The title of this movie was a total misnomer, because the actual attack only took 45 minutes of the film, which was the best part of the film. Overall, this had potential to be a great movie, but failed and proved that Hollywood can't seem to make a movie without cheesy romance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why everybody says this is a bad movie, I have no idea. I think it's very well done. I saw it once in the theater, thought it was good, I got the Vista Series DVD edition, watched it on that and thought it was great.The number one complaint I hear is that the main focus is the love story. What in the heck was wrong with it? It showed the America before the attack, innocent, carefree, but in the back of their minds, they knew there was a war out there, and they knew it could come to them. If they just had the movie be about the event, there would be no reason to care, it would have been impossible to establish how big the event was and have any characters for us to care about at all. When they revolved the event around a love triangle between 3 characters, they made it relatable. Pearl Harbor hit the ordinary events of their lives like a sledgehammer, making everything else in their lives seem insignificant, which is a whole lot more relatable to me since 9/11. Another complaint is including the story of the mission to bomb Tokyo. Well I was born in '83, and am not a big history buff, so that whole part of the story was fresh and exciting to me.As far as the actual historical events of Pearl Harbor, and the Doolittle bombing of Tokyo, they were breathtaking. The special effects were flawless. It showed the sheer terror and chaos of those events. I had to watch the "making of" documentary to separate what was real and what was the work of ILM.I will admit that the representation of the Japanese are the biggest flaws with this picture. Japan didn't attack us for the reason they gave in the film. They were not sad that they had to bomb the U.S., in fact they celebrated the attack. And the final flaw was the lack of the abundant amount of Japanese American citizens that were living in Hawaii at the time.Despite those flaws, I think that Pearl Harbor is a wonderful movie that I only put second to Lord of the Rings as the best film of 2001.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people who watch movies only watch them to criticize. If you did this with Pearl Harbor you would either hate it or not understand it; most hated it.As some other people have said, you need to look at this movie like you are from the era (1940's) because if you don't, one will see a cheesy romance movie. But, this is not the case if you go into it open-minded. You find find a very well done period movie. All of the romance (sweet-talk, kisses...) is actually normal for 1941.Many people hate this movie without seeing it only because of Josh Hartnett and Ben Affleck. This should not happen.Also, people didn't like the ending. I will say that the death of Danny Walker was over-dramatized. In fact, it was a normal "Hollywood ending". But look past that. Look in to everything else in that movie. Not what it IS but, what it MEANS. Despite of what the critics and other people have said, Randall Wallace did an amazing job making each line in the movie reflect the overall them of the movie, loss of innocence and patriotism.if you look deep into the plot past what other people tell you, you can find an amazing movie.</fullReview>

As a Naval veteran I generally cringe when I see Hollywood actors trying to act like sailors or soldiers. This movie was no different. The sailors, as usually is the case, acted like actors acting like sailors. I found it uplifting to realize that if THIS script can be made into a movie I can write a movie script. Some things I would have changed: forget the opening scene when the two buddies are kids. Pointless. Develop a love interest between Danny and Evelyn, have him volunteer for the Battle of Britain and REALLY get killed, leaving Evelyn and Rufe behind and Rufe in a position to pick up the pieces with her. Then when Rufe flies the Doolittle mission he can be guided by Danny's ghost, ala "A Guy Named Joe." Not great literature but more believable than the product delivered by PH. The American admirals were too young. FDR looked like Jon Voight with a lot of latex glued to his face.</fullReview>

They were also both filled with useless subplots that I could care less about.James Cameron's masterpiece "Titanic" (1997) was a 3 hour movie that was absolutely wonderful, from the story all the way to the special effects.Like "Titanic", we knew what the outcome of "Pearl Harbor" was before the film began. Like "Titanic", "Pearl Harbor" was about a love story in a time of tragedy. Like "Titanic", "Pearl Harbor" gives us a good 90 minutes of great special effects that are breathtaking. UNLIKE "Titanic", "Pearl Harbor" is a three hour movie that could have been started 90 minutes into the film and you wouldn't miss a thing. UNLIKE "Titanic", the romantic story in "Pearl Harbor" is HORRIBLY WRITTEN!! My goodness!! Talk about cheesy!!Like "Star Wars: Episode II" (2002), "Pearl Harbor" drags endlessly for an hour and a half until you hit the final battle. In "Star Wars: Episode II", the final battle makes up for the rest of the film being so bland. NOT "Pearl Harbor", though. There were three good things about "Pearl Harbor":1. Kate Beckinsale - HORRID fake American accent, but she's nice eye candy.2. Cuba Gooding Jr - another stellar performance!3. Jon Voight - WOW!!! This guy is an incredible actor, this time potraying President Franklin D. Roosevelt.All the goods don't make up for all the bads.

But alas I couldn't see the movie at the cinemas, so had to buy it on video a year later. ?5.99 and needless to say, it was a wise buy, it made me laugh, it had me on the edge of my seat and it had me cry. The cast all worked together well to make a piece of history interesting for the younger generation, &amp; to bring it to life again, make it real. The chemistry showed well and the actors all looked as if they were having fun. The effects were brilliant, and it is now the best movie in the world, I'm obsessed with it, I have now seen it 4 times and I still laugh, cry, and am shocked in the right places the only bad part about the film is the end credits, Because then, unfortunately, you know the film is over. However the song by Faith hill brings a nice touch to the Film and makes me cry as well (does anyone else think the songs for Danny?) Unfortunately there obviously can be no sequel as the bombing only happened once, but i would like to know how the characters faced life after pearl harbor, did Rafe and Evelyn marry? This is a great movie and I'd recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well it couldn't go wrong, could it?Michael Bay had 140 MILLION dollar, got some exotic locations, some famous actors and the newest of the newest digital magic one could wish for. A historical fact which speaks immediately to the imagination and also a great typical undefeated Titanic-kind of story.With this in mind, the movie would have been indestructible, one could almost compare it with the TITANIC! It wouldn't sink either.140 million dollars. I just can't understand it so I must say it again. 140 million dollars. You would suspect that someone with 140 MILLION dollars could make a good movie.Well, guess what: Michael Bay didn't. Why didn't he make a movie with 40 million and gave the rest to those who could really need it. Because now even more people have to suffer to watch this.I don't know what happened with Michael Bay. Maybe he started to feel the energy of Bruckheimer or got an overdose on drugs and suddenly thought he was `King of the world!' and decided to throw James Cameron and Steven Spielberg of the thrown.But at the end he is nothing more than a pathological filmmaker who should stay away from a camera.Love scenes that looks like they came out of a commercial of L'Oreal, and the lovely war scenes with a nice touch of gold-yellow shine.The attack we all waited for after a long time was shot beautifully but it just missed the rawness of a war-movie, like for example Saving Private Ryan or Platoon.And what about the script? How much did they pay the scriptwriters anyway? I hope they didn't got overpaid because this was just plain bad!The typical dialogues like (my heart beats) and the falling in love with Affleck's friend was overdone! And you just know who has to die, because it was in the first lesson of `How to write a script'! Or when an English officer talks to Affleck: `Not many guys here like the Americans, but if they all fight like you, I wouldn't want to be the enemy'.Things like this don't make you care about the effects when they are on the screen. One should learn from their mistakes and history, let's all hope that Michael Bay did the same thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* 1/2Starring: Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale, and Cuba Gooding, JR.Can anyone please answer my major question. Why the heck would you rather have a huge love story than an interesting war movie? I guess I have to ask Michael Bay. The movie is bad. Really bad. Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale ruined this movie. The only reason Josh Hartnett didn't is because every movie Affleck is in is a love story. And love stories and war movies can't mix. Cuba Gooding, Jr. was probably the best part in the movie, portraying Dorie Miller. Another saving grace is the action sequences. That, and Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s presence was good. The rest of the movie is horrible. And how come they make Jon Voight seem like the star in this although he had a 5 minute part. I bet if my Grandpa starred in this, he would've been uncredited. Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Pearl Harbor. What can I say? I was forced to watch this, and then forced to pretend to like it. It was my best friend's favorite movie in the entire world and if I told her I thought it sucked, she probably would've stopped speaking to me. Not to mention if I would've said I was glad Josh Hartnett died, she would've killed me for insulting the "all-mighty hotness guru" Josh. I sat down to watch this, thinking it had all the potential in the world to be good. But oh, was I wrong. The whole love triangle was totally pointless. And I have to say, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett couldn't act to save their own lives. Kate Beckinsale was just plain irritating and you wanted HER to die. And the "twist" was completely predictable. And you also knew one of them had to die...and by the end it's made abundantly clear. I hate Josh Hartnett, and I hate bad movies...and this was both, and I pretty much wanted to vomit. Also, my friend was sobbing at the end and she basically narrated the entire thing. She also couldn't believe I wasn't crying. I was trying to stop myself from laughing. The only reason she liked it was because she got to oogle at Josh. Every time a character died, I just wanted to scream,"YESSSS!" Mainly because they were all dumb and just, blah, you hated every single one of them. Then the whole parachute bunker love scene was cheesy and you were just thinking that Kate Beckinsale was a complete floosy and you were like, "Dude, your boyfriend just totally died and now you're doing the nasty with his best friend?!" Then, the worst line in this entire film,"You're gonna be a father." "No...you...are..." PSH! What claptrap! Their accents were really bad, too. Then the ending was just bad. BAD. That sums it all up. BAD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say, this was your average Michael Bay/ Bruckheimer film. Awful, awful awful. Sappy scenes used to their best advantage to manipulate the audience into feeling a certain way with no nuance whatsoever. An overwhelmingly simplistic plot with no characters that the viewer could care anything about. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 is because the actual beginning of the attack scene was pretty interesting, although the moment that Affleck and Hartnett went up in their planes during the attack the thing turned stupid again. If you want a great Pearl Harbor movie, watch TORA TORA TORA. I wish Bay would give directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good war movie, if understood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After repeated viewings of this movie, including the (quite superior) director's cut, I think I can finally give a good judgement on this movie. When people critisize this movie they most often complain about the corny love-story and the abundance of american patriotism (especially in the last part of the movie). But I think you're missing the point of the movie if you do that. Michael Bay wanted to recreate the emotions and experiences of Pearl Harbor. He chose as main theme, the loss of innocence, how the isolated USA suddenly realized they weren't invinsible and couldn't ignore the conflicts in the world. How he did this was by recreating the life-style of that era, of the 1940's. You have to understand that our ideas about love, sex, romance etc. are so different from people's thoughts in 1941. What to us sounds like cliché's, at that time, might very well be considered normal. The smooth-talking, the romantic goodbye-kisses etc.This makes Pearl Harbor an interesting movie, because the movie doesn't really project the society in wich it was made (like American Beauty or Fight Club and probably about 90% of all movies), it's like a time-capsule. Pearl Harbor recreates the era of the 1940's with all it's beliefs and ideas. That also makes this movie, nowadays, not very easy to appreciate (especially when the whole world has already seen the quite similair Titanic), people just don't accept the movie, because it doesn't fit our current state of mind. It maby is too soft, too unchallenging for our minds.And here lies the main critique you could pose to Michael Bay. Pearl Harbor isn't THAT facinating anymore in 2002, because the audience has already seen Saving Private Ryan, Titanic, even Tora!Tora!Tora!. Pearl Harbor isn't breaking any boundaries, as a movie (ignoring the FX), so people feel like they're watching a rehash of other War/Disaster movies. If it would have been released pre-Titanic, who knows, maby back then it would've won 10 oscars or whatever, because in my eyes it certainly isn't a worse movie than Titanic.Taking this all into consideration, you come up with a movie that is actually quite good. The slick directing of Bay might not appeal to you (it isn't my favorite style either), but it has it's strong points, especially during the battle-scenes. The cinematography is also beautiful, though not really inventive. Acting, writing, it's all pretty solid. But you HAVE to accept the film for what it is, because if you look at it with a pair of 21st century-glasses, it looks like the most repulsive kind of military propaganda ever, full of cliché's and repeated formulas. Seeing it as a flashback-piece, a look in the past, Pearl Harbor becomes a gripping, spectacular and facinating look at the attack and how it changed America at that time.overall, yeah, about an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pearl Harbor" was more a comic book than a serious movie. I ignored it when it was in the theaters; however, I finally broke down and wasted three hours to watch it on the Starz channel last night. This movie is so disjointed and wrong-headed it's hard to know where to start. First, the special effects were okay; you can do a lot with computer animation these days. The problem with the special effects was that they lent to the comic book atmosphere of the movie; all those planes crammed into such a small space. Then there was the plot itself. If you're going to do a movie about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, why do you start out with the Battle of Britain and the Eagle Squadron? In fact, how many movie goers actually know what the Eagle Squadron was? The Doolittle raid on Japan was as out of place as the Battle of Britain. A better opener would have been the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and then China proper. The story of the Chinese suffering under Japanese oppression would have been a far superior lead-in to the events that culminated with the Japanese launching their attack. Leaving the story at the aftermath of the attack would have been far superior to what the director cobbled together. The odd little bits, for example, the fiction of FDR (Jon Voight) pulling himself to a standing position, had no place in a real movie about Pearl Harbor. If they wanted detail they should have shown those radar operators having to walk to a pay phone to report what they had just detected on their system. From what I have read, that was authentic. The bomb's-eye-view of the plunge into the Arizona's forward magazine was plain stupid.If anyone wants to learn about the attack on Pearl Harbor they should book a flight to Honolulu and go to the Arizona Memorial. The National Park Service can give you more detail and authenticity in twenty minutes than this movie does in three hours. The plane ride to Honolulu is a bit pricier than admission to a movie theater, but you would learn more, would have some fun, and wouldn't feel as if you had been cheated.I took my daughter and her husband to see the real thing a couple of years ago. They were awe-struck. Then I took them a few miles south, down to Hickam Air Force Base, and showed them the pock-marked dormitories that still stand as a memorial to that day of infamy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't agree with the people who say this is one of the worst movies ever. But I certainly don't agree with those who praise it as an underrated gem either. It's in between for me - good special effects, decent acting, but a shallow storyline. "Pearl Harbor" is "Star Wars: Episode II" a year early. It's got stupid leads (though Affleck, at least, does decent, despite his stupid accent), an unbelieveable romance, and special effects to take your mind off the cheeziness of the goings-on. What this film has that Episode II doesn't is a good period feel. Not every scene has a computer animated background. I do agree that the movie pretty much sucks up to the Pearl Harbor attack, and is okay afterwards, but as a whole, this is decent. I'll give it a 6/10 (what I gave for Episode II), because it's enjoyable, though shallow.</fullReview>

Nevertheless, these virtues are not enough to overcome a love story that is lame even by the standards of WW-II propaganda pictures, which it tries to emulate. In its romantic subplot, boy gets girl; boy loses girl because she thinks boy has died a heroic death; girl then falls in love with boy's best friend. Has boy really died? What do you think? I could go on but you get it. Had I not recorded the movie on TiVo and been able to fast forward through some of its sappy excesses, I would never have been able to get through its turgid three-hour running time. I rated it 5 out of 10, and the only reason I gave it that much was because of the action scenes, which are (mostly, but not entirely) excellent and true to history.

		<fullReview>"Pearl Harbor" was done by the same guy who did "Armageddon," and it shows. Michael Bay's directorial style seems to be endless glossy dramatic scenes of great gestures and sweeping import, with every penny of set design and costume on the screen. The trouble is he forgot that without a story to tie all these scenes together what's left are a series of vignettes that belong more in a comic book.All the characters are little more than cardboard cutouts, with minimal charisma or individuality. They are as the sets behind them, exaggerated drapings of 40's Americana. (Which on another note Bay seems to have this thing for rampant jingoism and showing America as being a place where everyone wears overalls and lives in a wholesome small town.)One thing that I couldn't get over was how the action scenes kept showing things in such extreme close up you couldn't always see what was going on, and the fighter planes chase each other so ridiculously close that they're in danger of bumping into each other. I know Bay wanted to show both planes in the same shot, but a little reality was in order.The best part of the movie was Kate Beckinsale, who is strikingly beautiful in an unpretentious manner, the sort of girl you think you might meet someday in real life. Sadly she's not on screen enough, and when she is there is saddled with her limited character.And conversely the worst part of the movie (to the point of gagging) was left winger Alec Baldwin playing a true blue military hero. Yecch!"Pearl Harbor" is also a fictionalized account of the events, with several characters and sequences lifted from things that really happened and, er, "adapted." Several of the shots seemed to copy those in Tora! Tora! Tora!. I'd say drop "Pearl Harbor" and go ahead and watch that one. Even as a documentary Tora had better action and more heart to the story.</fullReview>

The battleship California made a run for the channel of the harbor was hit and then the capt. beached her, the battleship Pennsylvania survived the attack almost unscratched. And I've seen pictures of the destruction of the Arizona and this movie's version of it fell far short of that moment.Rule number 1: Never make a movie that is both a war story and a chick flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rent it for the battle, effects, and blunders....**SPOILERS**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>11 observations (Spoiler alert)....1.The Bay/Bruckheimer feel was to be expected of course. My own wishful thinking....If you're going to go three hours, drop the RAF beginning and the Tokyo raid ending. Cover the destruction of more dreadnoughts in real time, with enough lead-in for historical motivations, and there will still be plenty of film left for a love story. 2. If you are short on time...Fast-forwarding through all scenes that do not include a plane or ship does not detract from the likeability of already pleasant-faced characters and cuts running time to two hours.3.Alec Baldwin yelling "max power" conjures up images of Homer Simpson changing his name to same. Mr. Baldwin's natural smirk makes him a natural comedian; as far as Doolittles go he's got too much Doctor and not enough Jimmy. 4. My favorite "you are watching a Bay/Bruckheimer film" scene.. Baldwin and his flyers walking out of the hanger in slo-mo vee-formation with a couple of B-25's buzzing the field. Max power! 5. My favorite "instant transportation to another era" scene ...The shiny yellow/orange gas station near the end. If you're starting to doze off it might get you going again for the last half-hour, like a refreshing glass of lemonade/orange juice. 6. Least likely production memo...Bay: "I'd like to include actual footage of modern warships, digitally obscuring their modernity, in order to juxtapose the obsolescence of the battleships and Japanese illusions that the attack would cripple America's will to fight in the Pacific ." Bruckheimer: "Hey, we're already over $100 million, go nuts." 7. Most poignantly confusing moment: Japanese gunner frantically waving from the back of his plane while kids on baseball diamond interrupt play to stare skyward. Is he...a) gesturing for them to take cover, b) telling the planes behind him not to open fire on the field, or c) admonishing them for an inferior style of play? 8. Sexiest moment for the ladies without Ben or Josh in the picture...waist-down shot of Japanese pilot in stylish undies putting on cumberbund before the big dance. 9. Sexiest moment for the guys without Kate in the picture....Tom Sizemore pulling a 12-gauge out of his motorcycle and calmly opening fire on the attacking planes. 10. Proudest moment...Reviewing the U.S. Navy's great tradition of fast carriers during the launching of the well-anchored Doolittle raid. I'm not familiar with the production troubles this movie had, but did they use three carriers (two active, one museum) for this? 11. Rent it for the spectacle that it is. Enjoy spotting a million anomalies amongst the mayhem. "Pearl Harbor" is a worthy drinking game hall of fame inductee for movie mistake buffs.

		<fullReview>I can't believe that I wasted 3 hours of my life watching this terrible propagandarist rubbish. Not only was it about an hour and a half too long but it is the most shamefully over-patriotic film i have ever seen. The American producers obviously couldn't bare to show an American loss so an American attack on Japan is tacked onto the end,lengthening the film and forcing me to endure even more pain. The script is terrible, changing from love story to goofy comedy to supposed drama. The biggest chunk of the budget had obviously been spent on special fx (which were the only plus point of the film) which is why the script was lacking and wooden actors were hired. By the end of the film I could tell that one of the leading males was going to die but i was so mind-numbingly bored i couldn't have cared about which one became worm food. Yet seeing as Ben Affleck wouldn't stay dead earlier in the movie and had been jilted it became more obvious that the other guy would croak. And what was that bit with Cuba Gooding Jr all about? He had no importance in the storyline and seemed to be there so that the movie could be sold by the names of those in it, even if there is no point in them being there. Pearl Harbor was obviously trying to emulate Titanic yet only goes on to be a lesson to future film-makers; Big-budget effects and pointless cameos do not make a good movie.Pearl Harbor should be seen as in insult to those who lost their lives in the actual event.</fullReview>

Here we are trying to aim our frustrations at the Japanese and we're waring over a girlfriend.The battle was very well done. But not perfect. They really should have devoted more time to Pearl Harbor than what they ended up with. And I'm fairly certain the hunks didn't always get the girl.My problem though is with Disney. They're idea's are in the right place, but their heart is in the money. I've got nothing bad to say about the japanese, but why are we curbing history just to make them happy? It's all about the money. I can imagine the people who died at Pearl are rolling about their graves knowing that we are pandering to the Japs a movie about them that should show them in bad light but doesn't. What they did then was very cowardly. And just because they've kissed and made up doesn't change history. Disney I guess is in the buisness to either change history or forget history. And what is this hint about American suicide pilots?The dvd is poorly done. (this is on the 2 disc set, not the new rated R directors cut) It was I would assume rushed together. I can't figure out why they put 183 minutes over two dvds, when Titanic did 193 on one. It's utterly annoying. Sure I can imagine Das Boot being on two discs, but unless it's Superbit... I'd rather have it all on one.6/10 (which is all for the battle)Quality: 5/10 Entertainment: 6/10 Replayable: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall Very Well Done-Love Story Sucked!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie as a whole was very well done. Good action scenes that make you really take the time to think about that tragic day at Pearl Harbor. Good cast...Ben Affleck's accent could have used a little work and Josh's uni-brow could have used a pluck, but overall terrific job by the cast. Let's just face it though, the love story sucked big time!!*SPOILER* I was very dissapointed that the character of Evelyn was portrayed as well...a slut. Any woman that much in love would not sleep with the love of her life's best friend three months after he "died". The beginning was very well done, the movie had me until Rafe MCawley "died" and then Danny Walker, his best friend, took over as the leading man. Beckinsale and Hartnett had no chemistry and their romance was just an excuse for a conflict in the movie. They should have left it with Rafe and Evelyn together the whole time. Parts of the movie were very predictable, including the fake death of Rafe. The only other very troubling part in the movie was that at the end after Danny died, Evelyn just decided to go back to Rafe. This didn't make her look to good. From Rafe to Danny back to Rafe, it was too much switching-this made her look very unreliable. In the beginning I adored her character but by the end I disliked her. *End of Spolier*The scenes of the actual battle and of Doolitle's raid were very good. I couldn't have asked for a better portrayal of these battles. The script and love story could have used a lot of work on the other hand. I wish they could have portrayed more of Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character, Dori Miller, instead of the fake characters.Overall it is a good movie to watch and I would recommend it! I still love watching it and it never gets boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a bad movie! Ben Affleck was definitely not sober when he signed on to this jigoistic flick. A story which is paper thin (love triangle)interupts the real story(the invasion on pearl harbor)on many occasions. I fast forwarded most of the second half because it was of no impact on the stroy of pearl harbor. The worst part is the cardboard cutout characterizations and the groan worthy dialogue. Horrible movie. Dont waste even a coupon for a free movie on Pearl Harbour. I made the mistake of thinking it might actually be watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's see...flying by to knock the hats off of superiors, being called in for a "reprimand" that turns out to be some kind of commendation, and then forcing yourself to go on after the death of your best friend...I liked this movie better when it was called "Top Gun."There's even a guy who gets killed named "Gooz." Hmm.(Bruckheimer originality score: 0.1 / 10)I also found it highly offensive that the major African-American character in the movie (played by Cuba Gooding, Jr.) had important historical significance, but had much less screen time than individual scenes of the contrived fictional love story: an actual decorated hero at Pearl Harbor gained slightly more screen time than Beckinsale and Hartnett romping around on parachutes. Way to fight insulting and trivialized portrayals of non-whites, guys.(Diversity score: -5 / 10)It's accurate to compare this film to "Titanic," another movie that uses breathtaking special effects and oversentimentality in an effort to hide its stock characters and uninspired plot. Also like "Titanic," it reduces a significant historical tragedy down to a romantic period piece between a handful of uninteresting fictional characters we've seen on screen a million times.The bottom line: When the second shot in a movie is directly lifted from a Spielberg film, you know you're in for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe that hollywood would produce a movie this bad! The battle scenes were a bit boring and unrealistic. I'm sure that the real thing was far more realistic and much more terrifying. They basically dumbed down the historical revelance in the movie to put a couple of people in the movie who were stuck in a trivial love triangle. The Vets of WWII living or dead, would be disappointed by this terrible movie. And as a teenager, I feel belittled by Hollywood by making this a pop culture film to appease the "stupid" children of generation X. We're not that stupid. I'm sorry, I'm just extremely angry that somebody would produce such drivel that isn't emphasized on what happened on that VERY important day in WORLD history. What about the intelligence? We need more. What about the ships? What about the Japanese? We need more information. And the "Waking a sleeping giant" quote wasn't from Tojo, it was from Churchill! All they did was put two men and a woman in it as a basis for a very real thing for people who lived through this period in history, and it disgraced the Vets of all previous wars on how hollywood thinks how stupid the American public really is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried, oh god, I tried.Actually, both my friend and I tried. We'd mentally prepared ourselves in advance, with tried and true extras, because we knew this was going to suck, and badly ? hell, the advance comments from the good citizens of the US of A (including this site - thanks, people) had given us enough warning ? but nothing, nothing had truly readied us for this onslaught...?nothing, be it opiate (legal or otherwise) or perhaps the effect of slamming one's head against the wall repeatedly until the spilt blood obscures one's vision, can truly prepare, lull, deaden, or drug you enough to the required point of idiocy needed to endure this wretchedly sad, deathly dull, overly grandiose, expensively cheapened and obscenely stupid defiling of history.I'm sorry, but words fail me. There are only so many permutations of words once can bring to this cinematically wasted three hours to describe a single word: the word being, quite simply, "STUPID". (Note the capitals.)Put it this way: I felt dirty. I felt embarrassed that people, complete strangers all of them, saw me exit the theatre. I felt ashamed that I'd had a friend come with me, even for moral support, who could then prove I had seen it. And he felt ashamed he'd agreed to come along.So I'll concentrate on the good bits, and cut this rant short. And the good bits are: · The CGI may be a bit deadening, but it does break the monotony.· It redefines history probably further than the producers intended, in that clearly the Japanese had never harboured any of the ill-feeling or expansionist policies that historians claim would eventually bring it into direct conflict to the United States.(Seriously. Think about it: this film clearly shows that the strike was obviously purely directed at a couple of US pilots (well, two in particular) and a handful of nurses (OK, one in particular) in a vain attempt to end the insanity of a completely unnecessarily contrived and over-long love triangle between three self-obsessed morons whose self obsession threatened to rupture any form of conceivable and viable continuity in American intelligence. After all, the Luftwaffe had already tried and failed to take out Affleck's character, in the comically nonsensical Battle Of Britain bit. That other people were injured (2,403 dead, 188 destroyed planes and a crippled Pacific Fleet) in what would be eventually be described as the event that brought the United States into the Second World War can, in view of the revisionism on offer here, be described as unfortunate collateral damage. The Japanese shame for the tragic events of December 7 can therefore only be that they simply and unforgivably failed to execute their targets properly, and compounded their error by mistakenly shooting up a fair amount of American property and unrelated people. It was, in effect, a badly executed drive-by.) · The SFX planes are pretty cool and realistic looking.· Somehow the Japanese don't look so bad. You end up cheering them on: "They're in the hangar! The hangar! To your left! Strafe the hangar!" · Oh yeah, and there's that pretty fabulous bomb's-eye-view shot.· The DVD set has lots of extras. (Actually, that may not be a good thing.) But look. Please. Don't take my word, or the others on this site. Go and see this film. Do NOT listen or read any more about this film. Just go and see it. All of it.Hell, I lost three hours of my life that I'll never reclaim, so why don't you?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was not just a sappy love story which used a handful of battle scenes to promote itself as a war movie, it was also an insult to those who actually fought in the battle and a wasted opportunity to teach their grandchildren about a turning point in our history. 80% of the film involves a predictable love triangle set as a period piece, the remaining 20% consists of a dumbed-down history lesson and implausible action sequences. Some have commented that the battle scenes were good, I totally disagree. The dogfights look like something from a science fiction film and a number of ridiculous inaccuracies ruin the film for anyone who knows a thing about the battle or the weapons of the era. For example they have our Hero (Ben Afflek) dodging and outrunning swarms of zeros in a P-40 Warhawk. Although the Warhawk was used effectively against Zeroes in Burma it could neither outturn nor outrun the Zero. The resulting dogfight looks more like Star Wars than real air combat.</fullReview>

And then all off the sudden in this love-drama the Japanese starts to bomb Pearl Harbor and everything. The whole love-story just feels silly and when they start to bomb the island the movie gets even sillier. When people died I didn't feel anything at all for them, although you think you should.

		<shortDescription>Compared to Dark Blue World, Pearl Harbor loses on all fronts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen Pearl Harbor and Dark Blue World, and I have to say while the story of both films is similar, the quality isn't.Pearl Harbor must be one of the worst war films ever. It could have slipped through as cheap, forgettable action movie if it concentrated on the action scenes, like the 40 minutes of the attack on Pearl Harbor, but unfortunately, it doesn't.This film has one of the biggest budgets in the history of cinema, and all we get are a lousy 40 minutes of action scenes, which are ridden by historical errors any person who has the slightest interest in history can't possibly ignore? Instead, Pearl Harbor tries to tell us the love story of a girl and two men, and it tells it over two tedious hours long.But a love story needs more than a girl and two boys. It needs a believable plot, good actors, and a reasonable background. Which means, everything Pearl Harbor lacks.I won't even go into detail about the diseases that many Hollywood productions plague, Pearl Harbor being no exception, like blind patriotism, horrible dialogues, and historical falsification.On the other hand, mankind has films like Dark Blue World, which has great albeit unknown actors, interesting characters, great flight scenes which put Pearl Harbor to shame, a captivating love story, and many great characteristics more although the film had a fraction of the budget of Pearl Harbor. Dark Blue World surpasses Pearl Harbor just in every aspect, whether it's actors, story, flight scenes or historical correctness.If you want a really good war movie which leave you with the impression that you just have watched a good film, go and watch films like Dark Blue World or Das Boot.If you want to see a war movie and the feeling that you are wasting time and money on it, go and watch Pearl Harbor.Rating: 1/10</fullReview>

But, since my friend was a pop-frenzy teen who generally looked for only hot guys in a movie to classify it as good, I decided to see this wondrous film.When I came out of the theater, I was extremely disappointed. This movie was awful. The only actual good scenes were battle scenes that even then were kind of boring. I found myself yawning more than often and surprised that Cuba Gooding Jr. was in it (not one of my favorite actors but, still). Also, I thought that it was extremely...weird how so many older people on TV. said it was fantastic. This movie, I guess, is recommended to young teens who only want to see a woman lose faith and betray Ben Affleck and also see Josh Hartnett take his shirt off.

		<fullReview>*Pearl Harbor**slight spoilers*This movie, by far, is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Big stars can't save it. How on earth can people like this movie? The character development is horrible. Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale)is a nurse who falls for Rafe (Ben Affleck), a pilot. Rafe's best friend Danny(Josh Hartnett), is also a pilot. After Rafe goes off and "dies" Danny and Evelyn are heartbroken. But what the heck, about two weeks later Danny has Evelyn knocked up and he thinks he's in love. This sounds like it might not take that long but it's stretched out with plenty of bad dialogue and corny jokes. Than Rafe returns (his plane crashed into the ocean, he survives), he isn't very happy and decides he doesn't like Danny anymore, but loves Evelyn. Lots more boring dialogue and than 30 minutes of a great battle scene take place (this is all they showed us in the teasers, false advertising at it's worst). We had to wait through about 2 hours of Evelyn loves me, Evelyn loves me not to get to JUST 30 minutes! Than we wait through more corny dialogue, "I'm giving my heart to Danny, but I'll never look at another sunset without thinking of you", and than we get a bit more action scenes. Not enough.Don't get me started on the acting. It's just plain bad. There are so many familiar faces in the movie... but the acting is still bad.Avoid this movie at all costs. Go rent From Here To Eternity, it's great in every way that Pearl Harbor isn't.*2/10* (it gets an extra point for the attack scene)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok. Let's be honest here. Neither director Michael Bay nor uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer have ever been labeled as subtle. Nor have they ever been known for script. They are known for concept. They are known for action. They are known for special effects. And that, ultimately, is what PEARL HARBOR delivers. I will agree that the film takes a while to get started, and ultimately we in the audience have to suffer through as many bad lines as bullets fired by Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding, Jr.). But the film is nowhere near as bad as the critics made it out. It is not the root of all evil. There is far worse dreck out there occupying space on a video store shelf. The fact is that once the movie does get going and the and the Japanese attack, the films visuals simply soar. Some of the sequences are amazing. And this is where the heart of the film lies. Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer have created a visual spectacle at the expense of story and character (neither Ben Affleck nor Josh Hartnett are good enough actors to elevate what little material they have been given here).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw Michael Bay's (The Rock, Armageddon) name attached to this movie I could already guess exactly what level of mentality this film would be aimed at. Over 3000 people died on this terrible day, but the Japanese attack is shot in such a ghoulish like way it doesn't do a service to the brave men who died. The producers of this movie should have seen "Saving Private Ryan" to get an idea of how to portray a battle sequence that isn't just a Star Wars/summer blockbuster cliche.You will not learn anything new about the Pearl Harbor attack from this film unless you know NOTHING about it. The film doesn't even have the guts not to be politically correct...the truth is that the Japanese barbarically and unprovokingly attacked Pearl Harbor in the hopes that they could one day conquer the entire Pacific and perhaps more. The love story and characters were completely flat.Michael Bay is a master at action films. Unfortunately this subject matter deserved better than just that, but the studios have got to have the huge summer films and the record breaking weekends so he and a dumb-downed, politically correct story with no characters and lots of CGI effects was there best shot. Maybe someday we will get a serious movie about this subject.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to see a movie about the attack on Pearl Harbour, then go see "Tora! Tora! Tora!". If you want a stupid action movie pretending to be a war movie then give this one a try.With that kind of budget it should have been a great movie, to bad that it has proved countless of times that big budget means mediocricy in every aspect other than the audiovisual part. The reason is simple, a REAL war movie will have a much smaller audience and probably have stayed in the reds forever. Therefore they make a mess of a movie that is part romantic drama, part history lesson(not really), part action and above all an ultrapatriotic piece of technological terror. Doing that they have ensured a very large audience(particulary in the US), but the quality is bond to be so-so. This was also done with "Enemy at the Gates", a movie that was far superior to this one but still lacking simply because it tried to hard to get a big audience.As a war movie it's quite bad. One of the problem with this movie is that it's way to "arcade", particulary the scene where our two heroes decides to play chicken with the japanese Zero fighters. The creators decided to make things look cool instead of making it look realistic. This may work in an actionmovie, but it just look plain silly in a war movie. In effect it has little touch with reality.I hope that the next time they spend so much money on a war movie they make it a WAR MOVIE(a movie like "Das Boot" or "Talvisota"), not a mess describing how the good old US of A won the war. 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>because now I know just how bad Typical Hollywood Shlock can get.This is truly the WORST movie I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing. The story was just awful, full of transparent characters and the dialogue was laughable. At one point, Cuba Gooding's character is asked, after a boxing match, by Beckinsale's character, "Why do you need your fists to get respect?". What?? Nobody talked like that in 1942; nobody talks like that NOW! Only in paragons of affected melodrama like this can be found flimsy, feeble self-serving lines like that.The acting was likewise deplorable. I couldn't muster a modicum of concern for any of the characters. I swear, by the time the island was actually attacked (which seemed an eternity in itself), I was actually rooting for the Japanese.Which brings me to the direction. I don't know that I can fault the actors as much as Michael Bay, the director and chief architect of this crap. I hope he never gets another Hollywood job again; his work was THAT awful. Instead of actually using a STORY, he just tries to convey a sense of motion by using flashy imagery, perhaps hoping we won't notice the lack of cohesive story. Sorry, Mikey; didn't work.It's unfortunate that in this, and other cases, Hollywood knows exactly what sells. Put the aforementioned flashy imagery together with pretty people and lots of explosions and you've got yourself a hit. As long as the barely verbal, easily impressed public are wowed by this fetid, steaming pile of dung, Hollywood will keep churning out drivel that appeals to the lowest common denominator that make up the viewing public. God help us all.As I said, I'm happy I saw this movie, it makes me appreciate the intellectual superiority of The Three Stooges so much more.</fullReview>

I've no recollection of when was the last time I saw such an unbelievable special effects like in "Pearl Harbor". This film would have pretty much nothing without the amazing attack sequence. It's so incredible experience it's a reason enough to watch all the other parts of the film too. I know this is a worn-out cliché but we've never seen anything like it before. I mean this long and breathtaking sequence is absolutely thrilling even in the small television screen, you simply have to watch it with your mouth wide open. "Pearl Harbor" reminds me of James Cameron's "Titanic". Both of the films contain a romantic triangle drama that's built around an actual historical disaster. Of course "Titanic" is much better as a movie but as much as I would like to criticize "Pearl Harbor" and call it just another cheesy and empty Jerry Bruckheimer-trash I can't. It's certainly not a masterpiece and some of the scenes are way to saccharine for my taste but the movie itself works more than perfectly at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie tried to pick great moments from Top Gun, Saving Private Ryan and Titanic, fuse them together and call it original. It wasn't even overwhelming, but numbingly pathetic. The only good thing about this disaster was the 40 minutes of the actual attack. I still fail to realise how everything else in this movie was relevant to the historic event of Pear Harbour. Titanic managed very successfully to combine fiction with historic accuracy, but Pear Harbour fails miserably.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PEARL HARBOR is a action/romance tale in the tradition of FLYING TIGERS and other JOHN WAYNE films. JOSH HARNETT and BEN AFFLECK are army airmen taked with war duties and romance in this tale of love found lost found lost and shot down and found. The romance is believeable and the production balanced between fiction and history. The film gives enough history to help young audience members get the historical frame work right yet does not go into the docudrama style of 1969's TORA TORA TORA. PEARL HARBOR uses fiction characters set against a history backdrop and works as a film. The film is the familiar story of two men in love with the same woman and a war in which both fight. With nothing new under the sun in hollywood this film uses the retro fashion of 1940's war noir and films like FROM HERE TO ETERNITY. Unlike previous PEARL HARBOR films the film closes on the doolitle raid and ends on a upbeat note. PEARL HARBOR is a tale of a love traingle amidst the bullets and bombs of the blitz of 1940 and the war in the pacific. Currently a top video seller. Something men and women will both enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insult to the men and women who served and died that day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched the excellent, almost documentary-like take on the attack on Pearl Harbor "Tora! Tora! Tora!" and was compelled to view 2001's Pearl Harbor again just to compare the two and get a feel for just how awful this Michael Bay-ized version of history is. Simply put, it's complete garbage and is insulting to those who served at Pearl Harbor and throughout World War II. The audience that was the target for this movie must have been considered to be monumentally unintelligent. I am amused by a previous comment written by someone who calls this the best movie of the decade. Of course, in the span of one paragraph of effusive praise for this movie, this person misspells a half-dozen words, misspells every actors' names, and even incorrectly identifies this war as World War I. This seems representative of the type of audience the producers were going for. The only redeeming portions of movie are the battle scenes. The airplane battles above Great Britain give one the sense of being an observer in a plane right next to the battle. Much of the actual Pearl Harbor attack is well-done, too. But, as Roger Ebert noted, it becomes '40 minutes of redundant special effects'. "Tora! Tora! Tora!" was produced in 1970 (well before top-of-the-line special effects) and yet the battle scenes were more compelling. What's even more compelling is the story of the buildup and mistakes that led to the attack on Pearl Harbor, which "Pearl Harbor" overlooks almost entirely in favor of D-grade romance that would not even cut it in today's soap opera's. Without any 'character-driven' roles and almost a documentary-style feel, "Tora! Tora! Tora!" manages to be one of more compelling war movies of all time. If you really want a good accounting of that 'day of infamy', rent "Tora! Tora! Tora!". "Pearl Harbor" is just an unabashed waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch only the battle scene. Really. I'm not kidding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The majority of Pearl Harbor is a historically inaccurate, overblown, cliche-ridden piece of trash. Michael Bay should be banned from directing for all eternity; Randall Wallace should be tied up in a dungeon and forced to watch this movie over and over, listening to his own lines until he goes insane; and whoever greenlighted the script should get a CAT scan and a sanity hearing. The writing makes James Cameron's Titanic script look like a cinematic masterpiece. The love triangle which takes up the first two hours is trite, flat, predictable, and completely without chemistry. Approximately five minutes is devoted to the war which is supposedly the focus of the movie. All of the above is why I was quite surprised that the battle scene was as effective as it was. Unlike the rest of the movie, it is affecting and has a ring of truth to it (probably because nobody was talking). If you rent this, get the DVD so you can just skip right to the attack scene and avoid the rest. You'll save yourself two and a half hours of your life and a cast of characters, fictional and historical, who insult integrity, history, intelligence, and the otherwise talented cast of actors who portray them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pros: Cinematography, Costumes, Sound, Special effects.Cons: Historical innacuracies, Hammy acting, Sloppy directing, Unbelievable characters.Pearl Harbor represents everything bad a movie can get. It claims it was made for the veterans of pearl harbor but really it is a formulaic blockbuster whose purpose it seems was to beat Titanic at the box office. Ben Affleck thought this was the film that would make him a star after Armageddon failed to do so. The only star this film made was Josh Hartnett. The Girls including Kate Benkinsale were basically downgraded to giggling schoolgirls and the guys I guess was how every military men in thier days concucted themselves. I mean, who in the H**l gets drunk, wakes up the morning of the attack, flies a plane and shoots down enemy japanese planes, gives blood after the ordeal, then gets picked for the doolittle raid. This is physically impossible. Cuba Gooding Jr gets relegated to a token black guy's role and Jon Voight portrayal as Franklin Roosevelt is downright corny. The story isn't even told in the Japanese point of view and why did they have to show the doolittle raid. History shows that it was nothing but a morale booster for america. In fact the pilots hit nothing but hospitals and schools. Hollywood doesn't trust the audience to figure out that we won the war instead of the japanese so they decide to end the movie on a good note. At least if you dedicate this peice of dreck to the veterans, the least you can do is show at least 1/20 of the death's of thousands of americans who died on this day. The love story seems like something that would come out of Jerry Springer.Premise: Group of friends experience disaster at Pearl Harbor.Pearl harbor was nominated for four Academy awards and won one.Grade: 1.2/10 (Bay's worst)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst. Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is not a good movie. Unless someone pays you for enduring three hours of it, you'd better stay away from it.What makes it bad? Well, first and foremost it is extremely predictable, not only in plot, but also in what the characters say. Watching the movie was a lot like watching, and listening to, cliches on parade, and poorly executed such. At the times when the plot is not predictable, it is strange, making far-fetched jumps in time and setting, never with a hint of irony. By the time of the Japanese attack I was so bored and bewildered that the blood and mayhem on screen seemed like a parody of an Eighties' zombie-movie. Not in technical respect, though, they are quite well executed. The similarity lies in the lack of emotion, which springs from the cliche-like build-up to the attack. The little girls watching the Japanese planes flying by was just too much.The acting is not quite as bad as the script, though it is hard to tell. The oh-so cute nurses and the mucho macho pilots do not allow for much character-development, and one is left wondering why Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character is in the movie.Still another reason for the movie's poor quality is that the directors and editors made far too much use of slow-motion, probably making the movie twice as long as it could have been, surely twice as long as it should be. Instead of adding to the drama the slow-motion sequences make the movie nauseating.This is, in other words, a bad movie, even for a blockbuster. Even 1 out of 10 is too generous.</fullReview>

The Japanese planes flying over the kids playing baseball, bombs dropping, DoLittle planes crashing, planes flying over Japan in the morning, etc... Special effects were hands down the best I have ever seen. Another great thing about this movie is the soundtrack. No matter how many times I hear it, it's always pleasant to listen to and it goes with the movie very well.I know there are many people who were disappointed when they first saw the movie. Believe me, I was hugely disappointed too. But I watched it again when it came out on DVD and saw the making of Pearl Harbor and the commentary. And I realized how powerful this movie was. Try not to view this as a love story, but rather a war movie. It's a movie about Pearl Harbor with love story added to attract more audience. The battle scenes were absolutely gorgeous. Who could've done it better than Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer?Those who hate this movie so much, please watch it again. Don't be a little baby and say this is the worst movie ever. Also, saying this movie is a disgrace to those 2400 Americans who died and watching this movie makes me wanna wish Japanese won is ridiculous. Think before you say something like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, flawed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel this had the potential to be one of the great films with the subject matter, but it falls way short.Firstly, the love triangle device is tragically flawed because Josh Harnett and Ben Affleck play the exact same character. The beginning is totally cliched and the love story is mostly the same as well. If they were well done, it might be passable, but neither is even close to that level. Both the male leads and Kate Beckinsale have very poor chemistry together, so the love story is a complete dud.It's a shame that the leads are so bad/hampered by directing/script because the supporting cast, especially Cuba Gooding, Jr and Jon Voight (as FDR) do a great job with their material. Both turn in the only likeable characters in the movie, and it's sad Gooding's role contains only a few minutes of screentime.Unlike other movies from the Bay/Bruckheimer duo (Armageddon), the actual "friends" (supporting characters) are the same and barely have any development (even though the movie is loooooooong). Of note is a nearly unrecognizable Jennifer Garner pre-Alias star turn here. Dan Aykroyd is miscasted and Alec Baldwin is only passable in his role. No one really cares what happens to them, or who gets the girl in the end. Most of the attempts at humor are surprisingly lame.The bombing of Pearl Harbor is generally really well done, technically, and the 40-minute scene or so is worth a rental on its own (just skip to that scene, then turn the movie off). The action scenes involving our heroes doesn't contain the necessary cliffhangers or intense action to carry the movie.The last hour or so is blatantly tacked on and should have been another movie. At this point, the sympathy the movie has tried to conjure up for the Japanese side of the story (which was well done earlier) disappears and suddenly they are evil stock villains again.So in summary, we have a movie that fails to be an action flick, fails to be a drama flick, fails to be a comedy, and fails to be romantic. The only thing left to rely on is to try to induce blind patriotism and hope that people think it's unpatriotic to call "Pearl Harbor" a bad movie.Too bad this one didn't have a better script/direction, or it could have been great. Instead, it's mostly bad with a few good things (Gooding, Voight). A waste of potential, for sure.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've read even 5 of the reviews here, you'll know by now that this film is NOT as historically accurate as scholars would like for it to have been. So, if you want historical accuracy and would like to know how the battle really happened, go rent "Tora! Tora! Tora!", which was done in 2 halves: the American view as directed by Richard Fleischer; and the Japanese view, put into the hands of Kinji Fukasaku and Toshio Masuda. However, if you don't care about historical accuracy and are looking for a romance set in a perilous time, then this movie is for you. You will be absorbed by the triangle of affections that takes place and the plot-twists that come about throughout the scenes. This Film Is Not For Everyone, so decide which category you belong in before you spend the money on it.Oh, and all you wives and girlfriends who think this would make a good Father's Day Present... think again. If your significant other is more interested in Facts than Fiction, buying him this movie won't make him smile. Buying him "Tora!Tora!Tora!" will.</fullReview>

Being a history student, films who completely ignore facts for explosions and a second rate love story insult my intelligence in ways that I cannot describe. My two main complaints about this piece of trash are Jon Voight and Alec Baldwin. Voight impersonates FDR well but how could a man who has starred in the terrific Midnight Cowboy and the shocking Deliverance lend his talents to a worthless piece of garbage like Pearl Harbor??? Baldwin has not made "great" films, but has certainly made many which were better than this. He is, in this movie, a walking, talking cliche! Every word that comes out of his mouth is riddled with patriotic hero crap that is only seen in movies such as this. Shame on director Michael Bay (who is about as shallow as a kiddie pool, read the Rolling Stone interview) for making war look like so much fun! How stupid can people actually get?

		<fullReview>Many of the comments already made I agree with. Same basic central plot as Titanic, a lot of historical inaccuracies, too long, some totally pointless political correctness, not very good acting from the two male leads, an absolutely awful script etc etc.What I can't understand about all the above is why? Is there a collective lack of imagination in Hollywood that someone there can't think of a more original central plot? The actual event is minutely documented in historical records, notes, books, eye witness reports, film and living survivors, so why and how could it ever become so innacurate? It's supposed to be about Pearl Harbor, so why try to soften the reality of this by tacking on a so called happier ending with the Doolittle raid. If the film kept going and included the rest of WWII, the allies won, so we would have an even happier ending there!! It's not acceptable to show people from the 1940s smoking, but its OK to show them killing each other? No-one calls the Japanese something naughty, we have comments like, 'the Japanese are just like us but with a different point of view'? Come on!! The acting is one of those variables which sometimes work and sometimes don't, but some of this will have been because of the script!! And whats with the soft focus scenes in the hospital?Calling it a script is being quite polite! How ever could the makers of this film plan to spend more on a movie than has ever been spent before, and be satisfied with this standard of writing? What is the point even, of thinking big budgets without a reasonable storyline and script? A reasonable storyline already existed, the true story of Pearl Harbor. But apparently this wasn't acceptable enough!! I'm not sure what some of the lucky and courageous survivors think, but I would imagine the real story would have been enough for them.One obvious truth which does appear with this movie is the use of modern technology. With the development of digital effects, CGI, is it?, means that absolutely anything can now be portrayed onscreen. This does should not mean, (but probably will mean ) that this is the reason some movies will now be made; cos' we can. Wrong reason!!! Hollywood please take note.One thing does bother me greatly, and this has already been shown by reading some of the other comments. This is that there will be a lot of ( probably young ) people who will think this film is a pretty accurate account of the Day of Infamy, and be completely mislead from the reality. It should not mean having to watch a documentary to get the true story, otherwise you might as well have made a totally fictional war movie.Also speaking as someone from England, ( who were part of the eventual allied forces ) America did not win most of WWII by themselves!! Why can't your film makers resist the temptation to make a comment in that vein? In Private Ryan, an absolutely brilliant film by the way, the only comment about the English forces at Normandy was an innacurate critisism of the leadership of General Montgomery. In Pearl Harbor it was the excruciating comment by an RAF Squadron leader to Rafe saying something like 'at first not being sure about the Yanks being involved but by God if there are anymore like you back home I pity the enemy if America ever gets into this scrap'! For God's sake Hollywood wake up, get real, and remember we were, and are, on the same side!! By the way, someone serving in the US forces at that time could not apply to join the RAF, the US govermment and his CO would not allow it. You would have to try and resign or leave first. So Rafe turning up at an RAF station in full uniform, with the full backing of the US and his CO, is what we here would politely call a load of cobblers!Final comments, could do better. 3 out of 10, only for the effects. Best thing was the sound which was truly good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I know. My tag line was very cheesy. However, I felt I should keep within the theme of this movie, which contained some of the worst dialogue I have ever heard. Everything about this movie is designed to make you feel something. The problem is that the movie tries so hard to jerk tears from your eyes, it ends up gouging them out instead. The first hour and half of the film is devoted to an excessivley slow moving rather boring romance. Actually, two romances. Ok, so they tried to copy the "Titanic" mold and frame the historical event within a romance, right? Yep. But it didn't work in "Titanic" either. There is almost no insight as to why the Japanese attack. We are subjected to a couple of one or two minute subtitled scenes that take place in Japan. I guess the filmmakers felt that was enough background on the event that forced the U.S. into WWII. The only redeeming factor in the movie, is the attack on Pearl Harbor itself. For about minutes or so, you watch in white-knuckled suspense, and you know what it was like to be there on that terrible day. There are some inaccuracies in these scenes, but overall, the effect is stunning. After the attack, it's back to the awful dialogue, and redeeming battle at the end of the movie, and an ending that desperately wants you to cry. If you have three hours of your life that are expendable, that by all means, watch this movie. Just remember, you will never get those three hours back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is not a good movie. In fact, it's not a movie at all - it's punishment. Any film critic telling you otherwise is like George W. Bush on Jeopardy - useless.Director Michael Bay is the same genius responsible for Armageddon. That opus concerns a group of wacky oil drillers sent to destroy an asteroid on a crash course with earth. So horrible, it makes you root for the asteroid.Bay is the crown (clown?) prince of audience manipulation. It takes discipline and skill to create characters and scenes that honestly demand the viewer's attention. Instead of making an effort, Bay cheats . . .- Slow motion shots of pilots strutting along. Gee, Mr. Bay how original. I haven't seen anything that spectacular since your last movie. Newsflash: screen heroes are not heroic just because they're moving at more frames per second.- When in need of comic relief, bring on the guy with the speech impediment. Are you kidding, Mr. Bay? You want me to point and laugh at a man with a stuttering problem? A character with a handicap can be funny. Well, duh. However, when the chuckles are at the inflicted's expense, it's more sad than humorous.- Mr. Bay, you are shameless. Can't generate suspense? Quick, put a doggie in a life or death situation. Can't elicit an emotional response through straightforward storytelling? Give us a scene with children.Michael Bay is a hack . . .Pearl Harbor is a long film. I'm not sure about the running time, but I think it is in the neighborhood of 9 hours. It's such a lengthy movie, the makers of Pearl Harbor lose track of plot points along the way.Early on, Ben Affleck's character has severe dyslexia. After 4 hours, this trait conveniently disappears. Why? While stationed in Europe, this flyboy becomes quite the poet. The letters he writes to Naval nurse girlfriend, Kate Beckinsale, are impressive. However, the long-winded sonnets are a contrived mechanism for forcing the bulk of the story upon unsuspecting filmgoers.Pearl Harbor is largely a love story - filled with unappealing people, uttering romantic drivel, doing stupid things. Since there is no investment in the live's of these characters prior to the fighting, it really doesn't matter what happens to them during the fighting.Oh yeah, the movie contains the Japanese attack on the titular naval base. Those moments are technically well made. Stuff goes boom. People run around and yell. The proceedings are slick and presented with ostensibly lofty production sensibilities. Still, the sneak attack is cold.It doesn't help that at times Bay shoots the action in a hazy, soft focus. Maybe he was trying to be artistic. It doesn't quite work as intended. Like I said, Bay is a hack.One last point: Why can't Hollywood have the courage to end a movie appropriately? The film is called Pearl Harbor. However, the Japanese aerial attack left thousands of Americans dead or wounded and the Pacific fleet in ruin . . . What a downer. The good guys have to win, right?Well, in this movie they do. The victory takes the form of the Lt. Col. James H. Doolittle-led retaliation strike against Tokyo. Everyone can leave the theater happy. All is well.Bad enough, right? Get this: the U.S. bombing raid took place only 131 days after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Pilots launched from the flight deck of the USS Hornet. Upon dropping their payloads on Japan, the twin-engine Mitchell bombers continued to mainland China - then occupied by Japan. From there, these men alluded the enemy and marched to Allied territory.In Pearl Harbor, all this is a means to wrap up the hackneyed love yarn. Who gets the girl - the intrepid Affleck or the daring Josh Hartnett? Who cares?Don't get guilted into enjoying this clunker. Pearl Harbor is junk . . . If you agree, does that mean you don't revere the past? No - it simply says that you have taste.This film is a three out of ten.</fullReview>

Imagine a couple of pilots finding a couple of fighters not yet destroyed by the bombing, taking off and shooting down a number of Japanese planes, landing and on the way home shooting at a few more from a convenient anti-aircraft gun emplacement on route, then going to the aid of trapped sailors on the Arizona sinking in the harbour. And so on. Biggles and John Wayne would be proud of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boys gets girl back...oh yeah, and the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this film the other day, and it was a little better than I thought it was going to be which really isn't saying much (this was only due to the bombing of Pearl Harbor scenes). I am a huge war movie fan and I usually flock to the theaters anytime an epic is released such as Saving Private Ryan, We Were Soldiers or Black Hawk Down. This movie, however, I boycotted due to the cast and the hours of romance that I heard were in it. I'm glad I didn't pay money to see it, yet it had a few good moments.First off, the movie has many historical flaws, but that is to be expected, and in my opinion, doesn't make for a bad war film (most of the time). The storyline follows Rafe (anyone know anyone named Rafe?) and his romance with the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale, who plays a Florence Nightengale type nurse who falls for Rafe who is an American pilot who fought for Britain before America formally got into the war. Basically, boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy loses girl, girl finds other guy, girl loses other guy, boy finds girl again...tried and true...a Hollywood formula that just won't quit. Honestly, the whole romance in a war film doesn't necessarily turn me off, just two freaking hours of it does. It was trying to be like Titanic way too much. The war scenes, when you finally get to them, are spectacular, with explosions worthy of a Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay title. Tom Sizemore, one of my favs, was great in this film, along with Jon Voight as FDR. Affleck, an actor who I go back and forth on, mainly b\c of his annoying cockiness on screen, did a pretty good job in this film, but could have been casted with a better actor. Kate Beckinsale was great, and man, what a hottie...definitely would give you a reason to return back home alive. And of course, there was Josh Hartnett, in my opinion, the most Overrated, undertalented actor over the past couple of years...his acting was horrible, and I did not sympathize nor like his character at all. It's a wonder where Hollywood is pulling all of these no-talents from...someone like Ryan Phillippe would have been a much better choice, an actor who is serious and charismatic. Overall, this movie is long and dragged out. It re-creates the Dec. 7th spectacularly, and features the Doolittle raid with equal splender, yet the movie as a whole is below average. If you buy it, skip over the romance parts and watch the last 30 minutes, the only redeemable quality of this film. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've seen better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert World War II is a popular setting for movies, and after watching Pearl Harbor I've definitely concluded that there have been better world war II movies than this one and those movies are: ALL AND EVERY ONE OF THEM!!! Seriously, it can't get worse than this! If I could describe this movie in three words those words would be unwatchable, unbelievable and unaffordable. To tell the truth I couldn't even watch all of it (to hard to digest) but I wouldn't doubt that Rafe and the other guys dropped the A-bombs over Japan! Now let's take a look at the plot: pilot falls in love with nurse;nurse thinks the pilot is dead; nurse discovers his boyfriend is alive and they lived happily ever after (or so I think)... What is that! I've seen better writing in "Cow and Chicken", not to mention that the dialogue has a number of cliches comparable to the number of mistakes the movie has (refer to the goofs list, I won't go further on that topic). The special effects are very well done, but that doesn't save the movie from being so lame, and as if that wasn't enough, one of the worst events in U.S history is so sweetened in this movie, that a 5-year old could watch it without crying. Also, I would like to say that there's alot of disrespect to the courageous men who lived the real thing. It is obvious that this film was done solely to get money and before I'm done, If you want to see Dan Akroyd in a fine WWII movie, watch "1941", It's far better than this waste of precious film. final words: Shame on you, Michael Bay!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I see films like this, it's just another reminder of the greedier side of Hollywood. Bruckheimer's not the sort of producer that goes after Oscar glory or critical acclaim, his only interest in life is box office receipts. Normally, he is actually quite good at finding hit films, but not today Josephine. I'm glad Pearl Harbor was a massive flop, it just goes to show that it takes more than money to make a financially successful film. Maybe he should watch Lord of the Rings a couple of times to find out why. Don't rent this movie at the video store, it's very boring to say the least. Nothing happen in the first hour of the movie, and when it does you couldn't careless about it. What's more, Cuba Gooding Jnr was wasted on this film, the producers didn't even think to give him a bigger role. Not my best review, but if the moviemakers didn't bother, why should I.</fullReview>

The acting was great and the directing by Michael Bay was fantastic as well. I think that the story line was well thought out, allowing the viewers to get to know the characters before the morning of December 7th. I also thoroughly enjoyed the fact that the movie didn't end after the attack on the 7th but rather continued and showed some of the US's attacks. Great movie and well worth the 3 plus hours! :-D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bay/Bruckheimer do it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Making a real WW2 event into James Cameron's 'Titanic' is something that only Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer can do.A few points directed to the geniuses Bay/Bruckheimer:1) Not all of us are children. Even the best visual effects cannot save an idiotic movie like this.2) Making a movie with cliches like "If you are willing to take those risks, take one step forward" make people wonder if you are idiots, or if you believe that the whole public are idiots.3) Movies are played all over the world. Presenting the American army as the savior of the planet IN EVERY MOVIE THAT YOU MAKE, is an insult to the rest of the nations of the world.4) Jerry Bruckheimer should stop wasting money on Michael Bay projects. Michael Bay should go to a film school and learn a few directing principals.OK, the movie contains the best battle scene of all time. But this was done by ILM (good job guys), after they received a huge check by Jerry. The plot and direction are the worst (as usual, since we're talking about a Michael Bay movie).The first hour is the funniest movie of all time. Seriously, there are soap operas that are more believable than this crap. People are having a drink and the next day they are engaged! How can this ever happen? And if it ever did, why did this happen? No real emotional exploration is even attempted, to explain this children's story.I was hoping that after his first films Michael Bay would have learned from his mistakes and would eventually come up with a movie that has some substance, or even some style. Not with this guy! Every important gesture or movement is emphasized with slow motion. Every time! Once more fast cuts are the order of the day, especially in the first part, which makes those stupidly fake emotional moments even harder to watch.Finally American patriotism. You can't escape a Michael Bay movie without a dose of US patriotism! He turned one of the most embarrassing moments of the US military into victory! Maybe Pearl Harbor should end with a slow motion close-up of the A-Bomb, with a "Now you'll see" caption. How uplifting could that be!Bay/Bruckheimer are obviously terribly rich, which means that they can buy all the acting talents and all the visual effects they need. But being people with no aesthetic sense at all, they can only create annoying garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misc thoughts on Pearl Harbor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we have another huge megablockbuster with big stars and dazzling special effects and little else. Since this movie is not worth the effort to write complete, coherent paragraphs, I am just going to list some of the thoughts that went through my head as I was watching it:- This movie is three hours long. It would be half that if it weren't almost entirely filmed in slow motion.- Kinda reminds me of Independence Day, only this was slightly more historically accurate.- Many, many shots were framed with foreground objects or otherwised overly composed. Occasionally, this adds a nice touch, but done continually, it becomes annoying.- Ben Affleck used to do Kevin Smith movies, what the hell happened? (Chasing Amy was filmed on a budget of just over six dollars and it kicks ass. This movie cost more than the GNP of Sweden and it is mediocre at best.)- Toward the end when they bomb the Japanese, you just see buildings blowing up, but not the peril of the inhabitants like in the Pearl Harbor attack scenes.- Most of the women were very thin like modern models. In 1941, the ideal of beauty was to have curves, not to be super-skinny like today.- Did the Japanese really do their military planning in an open courtyard?- This movie was very pro-war. Though WWII was probably a good war.- Certain scenes remind me of scenes in Top Gun, another Bruckhiemer movie.- At one point, Affleck's character gets one of those TV cop show speeches from his commanding officer: "You blew up the mayor's limo, burned down half of the east side, crashed two police cars, and destroyed a wedding cake. Good Job McNulty."All in all, this was another very big formulaic movie with lots of stuff in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotionally charged movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tried to put off this movie, to pass it in the video store, but it called to me. I'm glad I gave in. This movie, although a lengthy three hours, tugs its viewer through many emotional ranges varying from comedy to romance to tears of sorrow as well as joy. It's cast shines, especially Josh Hartnett and Ben Affleck.Ben Affleck, as Rafe, was commanding and confident. He possessed a mature worldliness as a member of the US armed forces and tender nobility as he fell in and out of love with Evelyn. Josh Hartnett played Danny with an innocent vulnerability. Danny was shy and brave simultaneously and charming as he fell in love with Evelyn.The scene in the parachute hanger, while chaste, was whimsical and romantic. The ending of the film is a series of highs and lows that tugs with force at the heart strings. This movie was difficult to watch due to recent events that affected our country since the attack sequence lasts over an hour, but it is well worth it. An action period film and a love story. A great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An affront to decency.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Utter garbage that re-enacts an act of war that left thousands of people dead, for no other reason than to have a backdrop to a pathetic, cliché-ridden romance. A string of repellent, poorly realised characters play out a sickly three-way love story that actually takes up more of the running time than the attack or its repercussions. To have the assault on Pearl Harbor cheapened by placing it against a tale of such stunning banality is unbelievable. Until you see the names of the director and producer.This is big budget, over-produced Hollywood rubbish, every shot filtered to excess and meticulously manufactured so as to render the actors redundant. When the characters are sad, they stand mournfully in the rain. When they're confused, they stand beside a storm-tossed shoreline. The film is chock-full of emotional cheap shots, and we viewers are treated with almost as little respect as the event itself.The talent on show here is negligible, both in front and behind the camera. The effects and stunts during the attack itself are spectacular, but by this time you're probably numbed by the whole sorry mess, and indifferent to the plight of the square-jawed, potato-faced heroes and their insipid love interest. This is a film that's nothing short of an affront to decency on a truly epic scale.</fullReview>

I start to get very angry when I think about this movie, so I will keep it short. This movie is a sham. We spend over an hour steeped in a mediocre love triangle just to get to Pearl Harbor. Yes, the special effects are great during the attack, but then we are subjected to the conclusion of the love story, and really, a more hackneyed love story I haven't seen on film in quite a long time. Cuba Gooding's role is too small, and he disappears into the background quickly. For all of the remarkable, heroic, real life stories that actually happened in that attack, to use almost two solid hours on a manufactured, mediocre love story is more than an insult to those fine men and women who actually served, it is a disgrace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor was NOT a terribly wonderful movie - I left the theater feeling that the film didn't achieve what it was going for. Had it not been paid for by my history class (since going to see it was a field trip), I probably would have felt it was a waste of money.Granted, the movie probably does have quite a few inaccuracies, as does any history-based film, BUT - I give the movie 2 thumbs up for introducing the idea the Americans in charge knew the attack was coming. I don't care what people's junior high textbooks said, FDR KNEW that we were going to be attacked at Pearl Harbor and LET IT HAPPEN (purely for the purposes of getting the country to unite and want to go to war). I'm very glad that this movie touched on that idea at least somewhat... The only real complaints is that the movie didn't use it's time well. After the first 40 minutes of bombing, your only concern is how much your butt is starting to hurt. And the "romance"/love triangle was only disturbing, distracting, and downright laughable.. certainly don't see this movie for that aspect.I say, if you're into rather lame action/war movies (and you have a LOT of time on your hands), go ahead and see it, it fits into its genre nicely. And I've definitely seen worse movies this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbour received some of the harshest criticism I can remember any film getting for a long time. Panned by almost every paper, magazine or internet site in the world, I was never going to be able to watch this film with an open mind. However, despite the cliche ridden script and some debatable acting, Pearl Harbour was a film I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. There were plenty of good action sequences and edge of your seat excitement. I go to the cinema to be entertained and I found this film an extremely entertaining experience. I think that maybe one of the reasons Pearl Harbor was so widely criticised was the subject matter. I am sure many people were unhappy to see various people make vast sums of money from a historically innacurate version of a tragic event in which many people lost their lives. It also glossed over many of the appalling events that took place after the Pearl Harbour bombing and seemed to look at the entire war from an American perspective. The film was also far too long. After the spectacular action sequence where we saw the Japanese fighters attacking the American ships, the makers of this film, for some reason, decided to drag it out for another hour. This was rather pointless and I was beginning to get restless towards the end. The acting was not great either, but it cannot have been easy for the Affleck et al with such a poor script so abundant with cliches. Despite these faults though, Pear Harbour was great fun, packed with top action sequences and likeable, if a little cheesey, main characters. I recommend it to anyone who has three hours to spare, and wants to watch an entertaining film without thinking too hard about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aside from some truly awesome visuals to recreate the actual attack on Pearl Harbor, this punishingly long movie ultimately fails. Instead of using any of the powerful true stories from the people who experienced the attack, a fictional, drippy love triangle story is formed (with no chemistry at any angle). Cuba Gooding Jr. is woefully underused. The script is filled with cliches and sappy dialogue, and the love scene between Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett is just plain laughable. The visuals, special effects, costumes, and supporting performances by Gooding, Alec Baldwin, and Jon Voight are all high points. The three leads are not horrible, but the script lets them down. It was a good summer movie, but ultimately will not be remembered.</fullReview>

I loved how well they portrayed Rafe's and Danny's brotherhood, despite everything, they still loved each other. I know it sounds fag, but it is just like a family, you love them despite everything.

		<fullReview>This movie takes an incredible premise and stomps the life out of it. This movie should have been called Love on the Beach. The trailer makes it like it's all about the attack. This is wrong. For the first hour and a half you will be treated to Ben Afleck trying very hard to be tough, Kate Beckinsdale trying even harder to be the strong woman, and Josh Hartnett trying to avoid becoming Freddie Prinze Jr. Then finally you are hit with THE GREATEST BATTLE THAT YOU WILL EVER SEE ON FILM. This scene shows that the past 1 1/2 hours that you p***ed away was not in vain. Every angle is explored as the Japanese wreak havoc on the US fleet. The CGI Zeros look incredibly real and you are treated to Cuba Gooding Jr. fighting to find a reason why he signed on to do this film. Getting behind a dual .50cal AA mount would be enough for me but I'm straying here. Anyways, Jon Voight turns in the best acting in the movie as FDR. Unfortunatly the B twins figured we wouldn't be interested in seeing how the Japanese went about planning the attack. Minimal attention is paid to them in the film. A suitably sappy score underlines this sorry excuse for a war film and I felt cheated as I walked out of the theater. Bottom Line: Buy it if you like the Pearl Harbor scene, otherwise just let your girlfriend rent it and tell her to call you in when the bombing starts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't decide if it was good or bad? I'll tell you!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are only three questions to ask in regards to movies: What type, quality of cinematography, and how many people paid to see it. Every thing else, i.e. acting, plot, story, f/x, music, etc., is subjective to anyones preferences. This was a Historical Romance set during 1941, with the attack on Pearl Harbor as the historical event the movie revolves around. The movie type tells you the purpose of the film. To tell a romantic story, to show how the romance was affected by war, and to give life to an important historical event. The quality of the cinematography is excellent, this is undisputed. And so many people have paid to see it that the mass appeal of Pearl Harbor is also undisputed. So, Pearl Harbor is an excellent movie! Every thing else is just opinion. Some people on this site want to quibble over accuracy of historical events in movies. Ask yourselves, what one story, or person, can tell all the facts accurately when the facts are not all known? If the films' directors use actual footage and actual eyewitness accounts, then the accuracy is good enough! Remember, everyone sees things differently, even the same things. Pearl Harbor is probably as close to reality as we are going to get. So enjoy it!</fullReview>

The dialogue is wooden and the film is essentially a confused and irritating attempt to turn the incompetent disaster that was Pearl Harbor into an American triumph because of a revenge mission added to the end of what is already an interminably long, long film. A love story takes up the first hour, the second is a special effects video of the bombing raid. The third is a typical piece of American feel good "impossible" mission carried out by the 2 central characters. Isn't the USA capable of watching a movie in which they don't win?In short, an exercise in how to turn defeat into victory while boring your audience to death. A film for sleepy drunks only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given the generally ghastly reviews, I was prepared to hate this film. But I rather liked it. It's more of a love story than a war story. The special effects are outstanding. And the mood and feel of 1941 has been well captured. Negatives? Good as the effects may be, there are too many of them. I was wondering which was shorter, WW2 or the movie. Jon Voigt stinks as FDR. There is far too much shouting and yelling and too many war movie cliches. It's a three hour film which easily could have been trimmed to two. But overall, it's not anything as bad as the reviews have suggested. (Had an interesting thought while watching... Wonder if it had been shown on flights to Hawaii.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is the story of two best friends, Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Harnett), and their lives as they go off to join the war.The build-up to this movie was huge as it splashed across our big screens. Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer teamed up to bring us this blockbuster of a movie for young and old to enjoy, an all-time classic for the family for years to come. Based on a love story, this one blew Titanic out the water on its release in 2001.Pearl Harbor has this incredible way of wrapping you up inside the film from the moment the music plays. The movie starts with Danny and Rafe as children, and you share their bond as best friends from the start, so it's no surprise you feel for them both as events play out in their lives taking them to different places in the war.Rafe comes across in the film as the "wannabe hero", the daredevil who thinks he's got the stuff to make the cut. You also get this feeling of Rafe as the father figure as he sets out to protect Danny in almost everything he does, even to risk his life for his friend. But Danny, well, he comes across as the guy who will go to war but do what is needed to keep himself alive. He's not the daredevil his friend is, though Danny would move heaven and hell for Rafe.Pearl Harbor is the film you will watch again and again. Every time you watch it, it will open up a new door for you, giving you some little detail you missed the time before. Trust me, I know. I saw this at the cinema 23 times, and even now when I watch it at home, there's always something I missed the time before. Pearl Harbor was criticized when it came out for not being accurately based on the events and the build-up to them. Even so, Pearl Harbor made the events in the film real. You find yourself too engrossed in the film to even care if the events are in order or not.It's amazing, it's fantastic, it's superb.Bay and Bruckheimer know exactly where to hit you, and they hit you hard. You cry, you smile, you grip onto the edge of your seat, watching bombs fall from planes. A roller coaster of emotions overwhelm you during the three hours of this film.The only downside to Pearl Harbor was the love triangle. There's no way you can do some of the love triangle scenes and have the audience think you're for real. It's a little difficult to approach this without totally giving it all away. But any filmgoer would find it predictable.But it's more difficult to believe that they gave Tom Seizmore an award for just shooting planes for 10 minutes.Pearl Harbor is the film that has basically taken Saving Private Ryan and Titanic, mixed them together with a touch of magic from Bruckheimer, and set it out to the big screens. It's got the cheesy romance from Titanic, and, on the other hand, it's got action-packed scenes of Private Ryan.But no film is real without the music, and they got it just right for this film, set with the same melody for almost all the songs. It's the music that sets your mood. It's the music that forces tears from your eyes or brings panic to your face. That includes the amazing end credit music "There You'll Be" by Faith Hill.I just can't brag about how good this film is anymore, so just take my words ? get the DVD, get some popcorn (but two bags, as by the end the time the Amazing Jap Zero scenes come on, you'll have jumped up and down in your seat so much that most of your popcorn will be on the floor), dim the lights, bring a loved one to hold the tissues for you, and prepare yourself for December 7th 1941.Join Ben Afflek, Kate Beckinsale, Josh Hartnett, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. for Pearl Harbor relived in modern film history.</fullReview>

I knew I was in big trouble right from the first scene. Generally, movies that deal with adult themes should never open with the protagonists' childhood. The problems with this train wreck of a movie are too numerous to list (and have been more eloquently described by other contributors to this site). So let me sum it all up in a sentence: Pearl Harbor the Movie is almost as monumental a tragedy as Pearl Harbor the Historical Event.Well, there's one piece of consolation: at least I saw it on Pay-Per-View. Financial loss: $3.95, Loss of waking hours: 3:00, Damage to my psyche: incalculable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see this for ages when I read about it in an aviation magazine, and when I saw it on the big screen I wasn't disappointed!OK, forgiving the storyline, which I knew was gonna be a bit contrived anyway, this is a fair bit of action-heroics that takes your breath away in places. We all know that CGI has come a long way, so it came as no surprise to me when I saw ships being blown apart, planes being shot down and people being tossed around like ragdolls by huge explosions. I know how it's done - I saw the 'Making of' docs!There were a few bits that grated me, but they were mainly historical innacuracies like the colour of the Japanese Zeros (they should have been light-grey, not GREEN!!!!), the Eagle Squadron should have had Hurricanes as opposed to Spitfires (in addition to a few more American pilots!), etc... There weren't that many that I knew of, anyway, but they could have got some of it 'spot on' for the 'nit-pickers' amongst us.Pearl Harbor isn't bad, but it doesn't come close to depicting the day's events that 'Tora! Tora! Tora!'. But then it's not meant to - it's meant to tell an action/love story in which the main characters are swept up in the events of the day and how it affects them and their lives. It's not meant to be a big anti-war statement, people!! We've got far too many of those in the form of 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'The Thin Red Line' where we see young men becoming shellshocked and so on. 'Pearl Harbor' cuts the mustard as pure entertainment - NUFF SAID!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great injustice to history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer for this movie, it made me cry. Twice. I never cried over a trailer in my life before. It was so beautifully constructed and poetic, capturing both the terrible and heroic essence together, complimented by a sweeping musical suite by Hans Zimmer. Wow.Then I saw the actual film. I couldn't even begin to express my disappointment then, but I will give it a try now. First, let's start with the concept of turning this monumental tragedy in American history into a slam-bang action spectacular. Already, this is the worst way to approach this subject matter. It trivializes this event and what it meant for those who died and still suffer to this day because of it, and no sense of historic consequences are even touched upon when it's all said and done. After all, this event, as tragic as it was, led the United States to become a Global Superpower. That alone deserves a little more screen time than just a simple throw-away line of voice-over narration at the film's conclusion, and it wasn't even clear then that this is what resulted.The movie's user-friendly premise of a love triangle between Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale falls flat on its face because it doesn't have any context within the attack on Pearl Harbor itself. It simply just exists to fill in between bites of popcorn. Unlike here, the love story concept worked in a historical setting like "Titanic" because there were clear story ramifications between the sinking of the ship and the future of the love affair. That's why we as the audience hung in there and were worried how it was all going to turn out. In "Pearl Harbor", the Japanese attack has no effect whatsoever on the love triangle. Yes, the characters take part in it, but they are not impacted by it, which is what successful movies do to involve their audiences. It's called "dramatic tension", and is the basis of all storytelling. Only after the attack is long gone does the relationship story come back into play. Well, at this point, so what? It merely helps us to alleviate the painful memory that only about two-and-a-half thousand sailors just died. But hey, who's gonna get the girl? That's what this movie called "Pearl Harbor" is really about, isn't it? Forget this war stuff, I've got my date here with me and I seem to remember paying to see three hours in the love lives of these three models... I mean characters. Oh, and what about the President Roosevelt caricature... I mean character? He looked like a puppet, a cardboard cut-out of one of our greatest presidents. Sadly, this version of FDR came off as having no real personality, he just kept spouting cliched lines of wooden patriotic rhetoric, and seemed like he kept saying "Our boys" every other line. Where's the human being in this man?And what about the Japanese in this movie? Where are they? Besides all being in the Navy on the attacking planes and ships, I didn't catch many Japanese people in Hawaii at all. Why the hell not? Were the filmmakers afraid that it wasn't politically correct to show them there? What a disservice to all those Japanese-Americans who were harrassed, violated and thrown into internment camps when the war broke out. Now, I bet there are some great stories to be told there. But certainly not here.Forget this movie. Watch it only to understand the err of its ways. But if you want to see a real war movie with captivating plotlines, historical context, and involving, well-written characters, check out "Glory" and "Saving Private Ryan." Now those are movies that can make us feel proud, and also walk away certain that war is really not all that youth-oriented and cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't believe the script!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Granted Michael Bay directed this flick, and Jerry Bruckheimer produced it. I chose to give them the benefit of the doubt. I just never expected to utter the words, "he didn't just say that did he?" on so many occasions. I simply did not expect it to be this bad. How anyone could read this script and say "it's a go", is beyond me. This is among the worst movies I've ever seen. As a matter of fact, did any shot last longer than 20 seconds? This flick was a direct slight to our men and women who lived through this attack. There was nothing here to cry over much less make you think of the magnitude of the destruction. The love affair, I swear daytime talk shows have had similar topics with more heart than this. If you thought it was touching in the film, you must not be able sit through an episode of Springer. I'll just stop and say, if you really want to see some heart breaking WWII stories, see BAND OF BROTHERS. It makes Pearl Harbor seem like an after school special. No I take that back. Pearl Harbor IS an after school special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, this movie had high and low qualities. I'll start with the good. It was a beautiful film visually. The cinematography is astounding. Every shot is pleasing to the eye and uses advanced conventions of photography. The special effects are the next thing down the line. It contained some of the best digital editing I have ever seen. If you rent the DVD of this movie and watch the "making of" section, you'll see what I mean. The acting was decent too. Now, the problems of the movie are that the script and plot suck. If they had completely left out the love triangle it would have worked well. They could have even kept the love story in, but not the triangle. It contrasted the point of the film. No one wants to see war and the jealousy of love in the same movie, well, unless you're married and she wants to see a love story and he wants to see some blood. Although, people are too hard on this movie. They either absolutely hate it, or think it's all right. Now, the love triangle was extraneous, but the movie still had many strong points. I suggest everyone sees this movie and keep in mind that it does have some amazing visual effects. See it as objective as possible and you might just appreciate some of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pearl Harbor" seems to elicit passionate opinions on both sides. Some think it's fantastic. Others think it's trash. I'll opt for the in-between.What they tried to do here is use the "Titanic" schtick. Take a historical event, whip up a love triangle, throw in a British actress named Kate and -- voila! -- instant success, right?Not really. But it's not as bad as some people say. The attack footage is amazing. It plops you right into the events as they unfold. But man, it takes a looong time to get there.If you rent the DVD and forward right to the fight scenes, you won't miss much. If you choose to sit through the entire movie, just know that it drags in spots, and it undermines its own credibility in scenes like the one where FDR rises from his wheelchair to prove a point. (That never happened.)What bogs down this movie is the amount of time spent setting up the event for which the entire film was made. "Pearl Harbor" didn't need to be three hours long. Maybe someday they'll do the opposite of "Apocalypse Now" and release a version that's 50 minutes shorter. Until then, keep that fast-forward finger limber. You might need it.</fullReview>

Hopefully he made a lot of money off of this.and, of course5) Josh Hartnett - the only actor that would ever agree to say "I think World War Two just started!". He even sucked in a real war movie - Black Hawk Down, which I thought was a masterpiece.0/10 zero/****Truly an insult to every person who experienced the REAL Pearl Harbor.

		<shortDescription>What's the deal with the women in these movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS I saw this movie on DVD (I thank the stars for that, since it gave me time to prepare for this movie, having heard the reviews and all) and have to say it was slightly, SLIGHTLY people!, better from what I was expecting. This of course is due to the so many times praised and unbelievable fighting scene. But that's it!!!!! The rest of the movie is completely lost. COMPLETELY. The whole movie, well let's face it, the whole chick flick(we've got everything here, the cute actor, the woman that has to choose, and of course the touching score), relies on the romantic triangle between the three actors. Kate Beckinsale is probably the only person that put everything she could into her role. The others just rode along. Ben Affleck, after Chasing Amy, deserves just an OK, and that Hartnett fellow is nothing thrilling, no new discovery as some claim. But this story is so immensely dumb and presented in such a way you get the feeling that the whole attack on Pearl Harbor was rigged so the "third wheel" (in this case the Hartnett boy) would be fairly and properly disposed of. Quite sad, actually. You will not find character development in this movie as it is too busy finding a way to get rid of Danny Walker.I should say that I was, and still am a huge fan of Bay's movie, because I find them very entertaining and filled with energy and style. I am talking about BAD BOYS(8/10) and THE ROCK(9/10), while ARMAGEDDON(4/10)should be seen by thirteen year old's and extremely patriotic Americans only. The way he presents movie is amazing. The camera movements and the way he uses light and slow motion is unbelievable, it was the only highlight of this movie.This movie goes in the 2nd category of Bay's movie as it lacks just about everything there is to make such a movie. Bay should definitely stick to making pure action movie or get a capable and propper writer to write the romantic crap. Because that's what you'll find here. Whoever found the romantic development plausible is either a person I feel really sorry for, because he clearly possesses the IQ of a raisin or in the other case is a teenage girl, either with a huge crush with one of the male actors, or without a boyfriend hence not being able to understand these things(sorry, but it's true).You'll recognize the female part of the commentators immediately; "Great romantic movie", "People were so unfair to this movie" and similar. They most likely cried at the end, every single one of them, and that's OK, but please, not because the Hartnett fellow died. I admit, I had a lump in my throat, you know the one you have when you are at the verge of crying, but I had it because I felt really sorry for Ben Affleck's character. He got the leftovers, so to speak, as the love of his life slept with another man (some special gal, huh, and with his best friend to be exact - it could happen, sure, but not on the first date and not so soon, that is, if she really was in love with Affleck's character, even though he was supposedly dead)got pregnant with him(Hartnett), told Affleck she would choose him(Hartnett) despite being "immensely" in love with Affleck, since he was the father of her unborn child, but since he(Hartnett) died, saving Affleck's life, well now, then she would of course "choose" Affleck. AAAAARRRRRRGGGGHHHH. Even now I feel really sorry for Affleck's character. It really makes me cry. Sure, he could forgive his best friend eventually, but the woman, come on, she's the biggest slut ever portrayed on the big screen. I can't help but think that she would never have chosen Affleck if Hartnett were to live, and she says that to Affleck too, but why does she end up with Affleck, surely not because Hartnett dies. If this is the case, well, then this woman is just looking out for herself, not caring about others. How would you feel if the love of your life told you she couldn't be with you because of another man, but when he would die, she'd "choose" you.She clearly doesn't know the meaning of being faithful to somebody.As was the case in Titanic, the woman is guilty for screwing up the future of her man. In Titanic Kate Winslet is so selfish she doesn't even think of asking Leonardo to climb on the BIG piece of wooden raft. In this movie the woman ends up with a man, whose life and his relationship she ruins in the process. Disgusting. Sad. I was appalled.I will not try to pretend to know the whole deal about Pearl Harbor and the stories surrounding it, but the way it is portrayed in this movie is offensive. A totally patriotic movie, elevating America to an even further ground(Independence Day anyone), showing others as negative and inferior. The line where an old Japanese man (just after they hit Pearl Harbor)says they have just awoken a giant, or something like that is a statement I will not even comment. I will however end this too long comment by, well commenting on the opening scene where the young Affleck and Hartnett are playing. Needless to say, they are shooting German bastards, or something like that. But when they say those lines, something like "Nobody messes with America." -"Land of the free" "Home of the brave". MAN, when they said that I of course knew what a crappy movie this was going to be, BUT MOST OF ALL I WANTED TO KICK THEIR REDNECK, YOACKLE ASSES, THEY WERE SO ANNOYING. Please Mr. Bay, no more of this. Once was enough. Stick to action movies. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour. One of the turning points of the Second World War. One of the most momentous moments in our history, and brought America-rightly or wrongly-to be the most powerful nation on earth. It should make for a momentous film: the surprise attack, the suffering, the repercussions. Yet that frightful director Michael Bay-is he the worst of all time-has made this event into a love story. The frankly drippy Ben Affleck and whathisname battle it out for the love of Kate Beckinsale, using all the romantic clichés known to mankind. Aren't the events that took place enough?Imagine what a talented director could have done with these events. Rather than one with a cynical attitude towards the public. One that is after our bucks and that's all.I was warned before the film that the makers had a heavy-handed attitude towards history. Fair enough, some parts of the events have been completely falsified for two main reasons. Because American Patriotism means big bucks and also to please the Japanese public. World history is the last colony of Western Culture that America has yet to control. Yet there is no need to be worried, because the way history has been changed in this film is laughable and could be read as satire!My personal opinion is that the makers thought that the public would not be happy just to see historical drama and needed to dumb down the events to make money. This is a serious oversight: many of the public are sick of being treated like children. We can think for ourselves and I think the tide is turning against dumb down movies. People are starting to see through Jingoism, SFX corny romances and want something that matters. Something real.Yes, the special effects are good. But so what? Are we children?You may ask why I bothered to right this review, if I hate the film and had no obligation to see it. Well, the answer to that is, down my cinema in the United Kingdom we have no choice. On every screen, we are dominated by this American tosh.3/10</fullReview>

First off, it's three hours long, and the first hour and a half breaks down about like this: 5 minutes showing the Japanese preparing the attack, 5 minutes showing the U.S. not preparing for the attack, 80 minutes of a generic love triangle. Ah yes, the love triangle. It's not exactly Jules and Jim; heck, it's not even Willie and Phil.Then comes the attack. It's impressively filmed. You might ask yourself, though, why in a three-hour movie where two hours are wasted on an insipid love story, the film makers only really come to life when they can trot out a half-hour of Impressive Film Making dedicated to showing a lot of people dying.Just another piece of crap from the guy who gave us the even bigger piece of crap, Top Gun.

		<fullReview>I watched this movie on video after avoiding it on the big screen because of all the hype that went with it. A big mistake! This is a great yarn. The action scenes are marvellous and breath catching. The romance in this movie is also quite touching. It can be enjoyed at various levels. If you want a war movie with a sense of history about it this is the one for you. If you want a love story in the midst of war then this is for you. The only annoying feature of this movie was the non-reaction of the medical corps officers to the heroine's pregnancy. I have my doubts that a unmarried serving nurse would have been allowed to continue in her profession in the 1940's once it was discovered she was pregnant. Perhaps I am wrong. But I did feel that she acted too much like a 2000's type of person in an era when her behaviour would have been frowned upon. Having said this I loved the story! I enjoyed the twists in the plot and have recommended it to all and sundry. The attack on Pearl Harbour was a tragedy for the U.S.A. and this movie should get a modern generation to reflect on that tragedy and to appreciate the dramatic recovery of the nation after such a morale shattering event.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is probably the most underrated film of 2001. I watched this movie on a bad TV and widescreen video (not a good combination) and I still loved it. I didn't know what to expect when I saw it. The trailer looked really good but because of all the bad reviews I expected it to suck. It didn't. Sure, some of it is a bit biased and some of the romance is corny, but what do you expect? Another Titanic? The special effects were at their best and the acting was good (not great, but good). The silent, slow motion scenes were also effective, as they are in any war movie.I don't care what other people say about Pearl Harbor. It has my praise. 9 out 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a good movie in here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can imagine what happened when it all got to the editing room. Instead of actually editing the film in to a fast paced war film; they decided to leave the other stuff in. I sat there fast-forwarding through the first hour or so until the Japan started to attack. That's when the movie became interesting. My view on it is that they tried to do too much. The Soap-Opera love story failed big-time and the beginning with 1923. If they would have cut out say half the movie then it would be much better. They should have just focused on the attack and the two main male characters. It should have ended with Roosevelt asking congress to declare war on the Axis.Also with a $135 million dollar budget; couldn't they hire someone to clean up the script. I mean the dialogue was just plain awful. Lots of funny lines that weren't supposed to be funny.Suppose they had an editor with some guts and made the film 100 minutes at the most. It wouldn't have been considered the flop that it was. It would be short, yes, but to the point. I can't understand anyone who didn't like the attack scenes. The attack stopped my MST3K-like remarks and actually had me interested in the film for a while. And that's where the movie is good. My suggestion is to get the DVD and go straight to the attack on Pearl Harbor; when the attack is done turn it off; the rest isn't worth watching.</fullReview>

There was a bit of a boring bit when the planes all came and the war stuff was very irrelevant to the story. I don't think it was a good idea introducing a war story into the film because it, like, totally took away from the love plot. Who won anyway?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dull movie with one shocking, tragic and incredible scene you have to see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The big problem isn't that it's a love story. The problem is it's a DULL love story. Despite the length of the running time spent on the love triangle, all three of the lead characters are handled far too sympathetically. Nobody is depicted as being particularly at fault. Everybody's nice. Where's the real conflict between these people? Affleck comes back from the dead to discover his best friend has been sleeping with his girlfriend. He should be incredibly angry at this. Instead, he just has a bit of a sulk and eventually has a little scuffle, after which they're the best of friends again. Hmm.The net result is that you're supposed to care about these folks, but they're so colorless that you literally couldn't care less, not even at the climax. Ultimately the historical characters, like FDR and Doolittle, are far more interesting and better played, and deserved more screen time. The Japanese are handled sympathetically, but perhaps to too great a degree, coming across as simplistic, troubled stooges instead of the dedicated, enthusiastic warriors they seem to have been. Look at Tora, Tora, Tora's depiction of the Imperial Japanese Navy, for instance. There's a big difference. And yet for all this, the attack, when it comes, is utterly shocking. The human suffering and awful destruction is presented with real skill and sympathy. It's the one emotionally involving part of the entire film, but it's lost in a sea of filler material. This is a vapid movie, and the horror and impact of this scene shows that up. The attack has nothing in common with the rest of the movie, and frankly looks like something spliced in from a much better film.To cap it all, the whole thing is disjointed. It doesn't feel like a coherent story at all, just a series of events that abruptly stops at the end credits. Positive points - the flying scenes are very good, the special effects are fantastic, the acting is in general good and in places excellent. But this still isn't a good film. If only the verve, skill and - crucially - the emotional punch that was applied to the attack sequence had been spread across the entire film, this'd be a sure fire classic. Instead, it's just a dull romance with a stunning sequence jammed in the middle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor was the best movie of its type I've ever seen (it's the best movie I've ever seen not counting Shrek)- and I wrote about people's deaths so if you haven't seen the movie, don't read this and go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Pearl Harbor so much. I've never cried so hard in my entire life. Everything about it hit the right spots. I've watched it four times and even knowing what was going to happen, I could hardly breathe.Each time I went up to switch the tapes, I could barely stand so it's lucky my VCR is close to the bed. The scenes with Danny (Josh Hartnett) and Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) make me smile uncontrollably and stupidly. Every time I watch it, I just want to again and again.I loved Titanic, but I think Pearl Harbor is much better. Titanic was much more focused on the love story and had less characters. There were very few, besides Rose and Jack, likable characters. But in Pearl Harbor, there were many characters who had nothing to do with the love story. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is considered as one of the lead actors, but he only talked to Evelyn once and never to Danny or Rafe. Many of the other characters, like Betty, Red, Anthony, Sandra, Martha, Billy, and Barbara, were also people that I really connected with and loved. When Betty died I cried just as hard as when Danny died. Watching Titanic, there was no one like that.The special effects were amazing. I don't really know anything about special effects, but I was completly taken back by them.Also, the music was incredible. I bought the soundtrack and just listening to it makes me cry. Most of the time when I sing "There You'll Be" I start crying so hard. A lot of this is making me sound like a big cry baby, but until very recently it has taken a lot to make me cry. after seeing Pearl Harbor, it's easier for me to cry, because if I get upset about something and think about Pearl Harbor, I cry because of both things.The people who say this movie is horrible aren't very compassionate. I don't get what is so unbelievable about the love story, either. I think it complimented the tragedy well, but it definatly didn't take away from it.I said not to read this if you haven't seen the movie, so I can't really say go see it, but you really should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that will live in infamy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Make no mistake about it, this film is one of the most execrable ever to issue forth from the Hollywood studio system. A complete absence of insight into the mechanics of war or the emotional effects on its participants (other than "it makes them sad") is made all the more obvious by the vapid visuals which give the whole enterprise the look of a holiday advert. Bay's Pearl Harbor, unlike the filthy trenches of Paths of Glory or the squalid, gut-strewn beaches of Saving Private Ryan, looks like a nice place to visit. Missing many opportunities to point an accusing finger at the American administration at the time, who launched the atomic arms race at Hiroshima as revenge and as the ultimate scientific experiment (Nagasaki was the control), and who allowed Japan to perform human vivisections on the Chinese in return for a share of the data. There were so many corruptions, degradations, lies and disgraces on both sides, but Bay feels $130,000,000 is better spent on viewing the petty squabbles between his two pretty boy leads, who so obviously want to screw each other but need to find a surrogate female through which they can achieve some kind of sexual union without compromising their ultra-hetero (i.e. over-compensating) image. To trivialise a national tragedy, without analysing its causes is not only a stupid waste of resources, but, in this day and age, bordering on evil. Historical revisionism is the tool of dictators, fascists and, on this evidence, Hollywood studios embrace those values enough to stump up the largest budget ever granted at the start of a project. If you want to do serious history, don't employ Randall Wallace. The Mummy Returns was an appalling film, but besides being a sad waste of money and time, it didn't matter. I dread to think what might have happened if this had been taken as factual in the same way that Schindler's List has been. Fortunately, this film tips so far over the edge into jingoistic fervour that it is impossible to take any truths away from it. Luckily, the Japanese, who are portrayed throughout as sour, humourless, heartless tacticians, have been able to laugh off the offensive nature of this film, and in Japan it is seen as a romance with a few explosions in it.</fullReview>

But the love story opened up further speculation that those two pilots couldn't have done that much in the war effort. I learned it was true that no pilot did that much. But as Ben said all of these things were done. So, by the same line of thought I could make a movie where the main character won a super bowl, the World Series, the Nobel Peace Prize, the heavy weight boxing title, and a gold medal in Curling because all of those things were done.

		<shortDescription>Great war story, poor love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pearl Harbor attack scenes were believable. A friend of the family who was a survivor on the West Virginia thought the depiction was accurate. (Sadly, he passed away less than a month after attending the recent 60th anniversary reunion.) At the same time, it was not graphic enough to upset sensitive viewers.I believed the portrayal of Evelyn Johnson, the nurse. She was clearly a competent, mature person, especially in comparison to her fellow nurses. Evelyn was equally hard to believe in her portrayal as a girlfriend. Both Rafe and Danny were "out of her league," and she would not have either fallen in love with them or allowed herself to get pregnant. The premarital sex appeared to be out of her character and more importantly out of step with the times.It was hard to believe that Rafe and Danny would be alive after their plane crashes. The fate of both Rafe and Danny was obvious long before the conclusion. Despite the criticism about the botched love story, it was a movie that I enjoyed very much. And enjoyment and the ability to get absorbed into it is the bottom line. Score it an 8 out of 10. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know this is a trite analogy and I apologize in advance, but this movie seriously ticked (or better explicit) me off and this is the best I can do right now.

I had to leave. It's that aggravating.Possibly the biggest insult from this movie is that the second tape of it on video is taken up mostly by a *documentary* that basically says, "Okay, you watched us totally exploit one of the most tragic events in history for a sappy love story. Now here's what REALLY happened!""Pearl Harbor" gets a big fat one; the first movie in a very long time to do so.

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and very exciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was brought up as a Summer movie. That is what I think hurt this movie. If this movie was made to get an R rating I think it would have been much better, but it was made for the wrong audience which hurt its' significance. If a more historical aspect was put into it, it might have been a better film. That said, it was still very entertaining. The love triangle subplot was a good plot to set up the attack on pearl harbor, but the historical information should have had a bigger role for the set up for the attack. The acting is really great in the film and has very entertaining characters which make us care about them. When the action starts it's incredible. ALl the explosions, all the pump up lines, make any guy excited when watching this film. The recreation of the attack is perfectly set up but the whole pump up lines that the characters say when there about to fight back ruin the dramatic affect of the film because it makes it too much fun to watch. In my opinion Michael Bay should not have directed this picture. A more experienced director like Ridley Scott or James Cameron should have made this because they would have done more justice to the attack and it might have garnered some big time awards. Overall it was a good job by Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer, who tired their best in making a big time epic but failed unfortunately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie, Despite Soap Opera Elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I question whether or not this movie should indeed have been titled `Pearl Harbor,' the movie by this name was nevertheless a splendid one. I question the title merely because dozens of historical romance novels have put equal or greater emphasis on the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, without using this title.A fine evening of entertainment on video, `Pearl Harbor' was no doubt a spectacular experience on the big screen. I regret now not having seen it at the theater. I would definitely recommend it. Little else can be said without revealing gradual plot lines. Therefore .SPOILERS WILL FOLLOW!Whether to try and wed war and romance has been a quandary Hollywood (and other world cinema capitols) have struggled with for decades. Only a few - usually those set in submarines, like `Run Silent, Run Deep' - manage to avoid romance all together, instead focusing on rivalries or friction between commanders and subalterns, etc.Inevitably, history and military buffs bemoan the insertion of any fictitious romantic plotline and characters into the script. Often these are plastic, irritating intermissions between the `good stuff,' such as in `In Harm's Way' and `Midway.' At other times they tend to mislead the casual watcher and cause much confusion as to fact and fiction (i.e., `Titanic.')Although I haven't gone back to double-check for historic accuracy, I don't think this will be a problem with `Pearl Harbor.' The main fictitious plot line surrounds pilots Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) and nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale). McCawley and Walker are obviously based loosely on real life Lieutenants George Welch and Ken Taylor, who drove over 100 miles an hour to reach a subordinate airfield, from which they managed to take off and make some havoc for the attackers.Of course, Hollywood being Hollywood, a bizarre soap opera love triangle develops and dominates the film when bombs are not falling. Rafe and Danny have been best friends since childhood, with the apparently slightly older Rafe always looking after Danny. This relationship is turned upside down when Rafe is presumed by all (including the military) to have been killed while volunteering in England. Danny, sharing his grief with Rafe's true love, Evelyn, eventually falls in love with her - only to see Rafe return, as if from the dead. Sound corny? Well, I guess it beats seeing McCloud slap around Police Woman in one of the other Pearl Harbor adaptations.In any case, the lovers of war movies and the historians (I count myself among both groups.) never get enough action footage or enough military strategy, amidst the kissing and betrayal. Still, about the only real negative I can say about the love theme is that it takes so long to develop. Still, by the time the Japanese finally get around to doing what the audience has waited for, most of us DO care about a few of these characters to some extent, including the boys' stuttering friend Red Winkle (Ewen Bremner) and his fiancé Betty Bayer (James King). Outside of the nurse-fly boy romance subplot is black USS Arizona cook Dorrie Miller (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), whom I believe is a real life character - or based closely on one. Miller, who had to box to earn respect in the white man's Navy, takes up an anti-aircraft gun on the stricken battleship and earns his own share of glory.This brings us to the other debate on war movies. Is war sensationalized, trivialized or glorified? I would say `Yes and no' in this case. One cannot help but be inspired by the gallant effort of the two friends and some of their fellow pilots (based closely on real life sequences) to get planes off the ground in the most deadly of circumstances. Col. Jimmy Doolittle (Alec Baldwin) is inspiring in his candor and determination to avenge Pearl Harbor. And, while I have seem more convincing Roosevelts, Jon Voight at least captures the individual determination to strike back that FDR possessed in the black hours and weeks that followed the attack. The nurses, too, find their `finest hour,' after weeks of giving shots and meeting soldiers and sailors on the beach. Amidst flying glass, screams of the dying and gushing blood, Evelyn and her crew show that men weren't the only heroes of the day.Yet I don't think war was glorified or sanitized here. In fact, the special affects, attention to historical detail and some new, brave looks at death and disaster may have given `Pearl Harbor' a leg up on many war films. As torpedoes and bomb hit, ships blow up and sink. Men burn; men bleed; men drown. Zeroes strafe the water for survivors; Zeroes strafe the hospital; Zeroes strafe the pilots racing to their waiting planes. I'm sure on the wide screen a fireman would be out of his seat more than once, as flaming plane fuselages and other debris fly right past the camera.Director Michael Bay does not shy away from the hellish aspect of war. The U.S. Navy was caught flat-footed and, even in times of preparation, men die gruesome deaths in battle. With `an entire navy at anchor,' in FDR's stunned words, the results are worse. We see men drown; we see men trapped inside sunken ships who will not get out; we see hideously burned patients in delirium as gallant clergymen try to give a last bit of comfort. Bay should be commended for balancing all of the components of the film and coming up with a cohesive and satisfying whole. My only complaint with the video is that the subtitles for the Japanese dialogue are MUCH too small to read on the small screen. (I had to put on my reading glasses and sit in front of the TV like I would my computer, to read them.) Still, that beats having Borris Badenov's voice come out of Admiral Yamamoto's mouth, as it did in `Midway!'True, the Battle of Pearl Harbor and the subsequent Doolittle Raid were dramatic enough that they needed no fictitious love triangle to sell the story. With Hollywood, though, one takes what one can get. What you GET from this film are some spectacular and very accurate battle scenes from angles never before attempted, some earthy, brave portrayals of the agony and hellishness of war, and strong performances by the main characters. I would call `Pearl Harbor' a real winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, this film is hard to review. Not that I can't do it, but I am a real history idiot. I went into this film barely knowing anything about what happened at Pearl Harbor. Yeah, I know I learned about all of it in History class in High School, but I never retained anything! The movie itself is extremely powerful. The camera work, scenery, acting, special effects, and everying were phenomenal. It is apparent a great deal of money was spent on this film. My big problem, however, is the same that I had with Titanic. They (Hollywood) takes a Dramatic tragedy, and turns it into a love story. Or, more so, they center the tragedy around this elaborate, soap opera style love story. The first hour, however, did a have good build up. The story moved well, and we really got a feel for our characters and the emotions they inevitably faced. The 2nd hour was mind-blowing and gut wrenching. To have the over abundance of reality splashed on the screen. Now, I have never been in a war, I'm not old enough to have been alive during Pearl Harbor; but what depth was spent making that horrific scene. Too much reality to take...War is simply evil. 9/11/01 is a perfect example of this. However, we are the sleeping giant, and We will not be defeated..Sorry, rant over...The end of the movie...to me was extremely rushed! It seemed like they wanted to (SPOILER) kill Danny off, and get Affleck and Beckinsale together. Well, if one did not predict the outcome of the film...well, it wasn't like they made it impossible to figure out.Now, I have been impressed with Josh Hartnett since he got onto screen with Halloween: H20. He should have been nominated for something for the role he played in this film. As far as I am concerned, he totally upstaged every other actor in this film. His All-American look really fit into this film, and his acting was at his best. I am looking forward to seeing Black Hawk Down.Overall, the film was phenomenal. Though flawed it getting the real point of the tragedy of Pearl Harbor out in the open. 3 hours and 23 minutes was a little too long to get this story told. The love triangle was predictable and complicated. Too complicated to be put in a movie with such a big plate to fill. Telling the story of Pearl Harbor, as will Titanic, should have focused more on the lives and times of the people of the day...more a big-budget docu-drama feel. Not a love story...8.5 out of 10</fullReview>

You wait an entire year for this new candy bar, reading all about it online, in magazines, in newspapers. You finally go to the store the day it comes out, you pay good money for it, and guess what, it tastes like sh**.That is my experience with Pearl Harbor. Never have I been so duped into wasting ten bucks. The Pearl Harbor trailers gleamed with stunning scenes of war and emotion and tumultuous music (by Hans Zimmer, a self-stolen score from The Thin Red Line), and it ended up being the sappiest love story ever told with a half-hour of mind-numbing, seemingly pointless, sensationalistic violence. Titanic seemed more historically accurate. Titanic had a better screenplay. And Titanic had better acting. And Titanic is absolutely hands down the most overrated movie of the 90's, a corporate boob of pop culture's incessant urge to see pretty people say stupid but pretty things.Pearl Harbor is the same, only ten times worse. The actors are like shiny dolls, not war heroes. The direction is choppy during the violence, to give us a sense of desparation and confusion, but instead it gives us a sense of boredom and disgust. Bodies falling everywhere may be historically accurate. But Pearl Harbor doesn't take the time to make us care about the main characters, let alone the falling bodies.This movie is an insult to veterans. This movie is an insult to African Americans, and Cuba Gooding Jr. should be ashamed for taking the sloppiest representation of a token black male in cinema history. This movie is an insult to film buffs, who have watched good war movies for decades. This movie is an insult to humanity. You'd spend your time better shoving the popcorn up your butt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I wasted enough time going to see this steaming pile of crap so I don't want to waste even more by writing a very long comment on it's awfulness. Don't bother reading any more of this if you want to see it and be ... um ... 'surprised' by it's moronic plot 'twists'.Anyway, on to a postmortem of a lumbering beast that is an insult to everybody who lost their lives in the raid.Who wrote the screenplay? This has some of the worst dialogue I've heard since Titanic. Why is it so damn long? Three hours of this bum numbing, spirit sapping, inertia inducing, brain scraping mush is almost criminal.And why does so much of it make so little sense? If a fighter plane crashes nose first into water at high speed surely the pilot would be so badly injured he would have a little trouble getting out? Oh, and if that wasn't stupid enough how about Affleck getting out of a bomber after it crash lands?How about the fact that our two dunce heroes seem to be the only two servicemen on the island capable of helping out that afternoon. Need some blood? Drain these guys. Need to cut some sailors out a capsized ship? Ask these flyboys. Need to shoot down part of a task force that has been training for weeks to pull off this raid? Ask these two hungover sots.And finally, of course, there's the small matter of Affleck not bothering to contact his girlfriend to let her know that he's actually alive. No, instead he just decided to ... um ... show up? This after a trip that probably took close to three weeks? (I'm not even going to go into his ridiculous refusal to spend the night with her before he left for England.)&gt;sigh&lt; This is the kind of movie that should be deemed criminally stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A missed opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To sum up Pearl Harbor, i will say that Titanic has been blended quite well with Armageddon. With this combination in mind, you can get a good idea how Pearl Harbor turned out. While trying to remain faithful to the history books and to attempt a stab at humanity over the loss of so many lives, producer Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay have again gone for the glossy hollywood approach as well as the tried and tested slow-motion money shots and the stupid sequence which always occurs in their films - the bit where the heroes walk in slow-motion towards the camera. Why does Bay do this all the time? Are we meant to be wowed by this? Me thinks not. Pearl Harbor misses out on bucketfuls of heart in place of empty-headed, hollow-looking action, and makes the fatal error of trying to make its audience care more about three sad losers trapped in a love triangle than the lives of thousands of people who DID live and die on that fateful day in history. Admittedly, the battle is effective, but once FDR has made his little speech, the film changes reels completely in a awkwardly tacked on final hour when the inevitable death scene occurs to make the women cry and the men groan. Cue another slow motion scene of mawkishness and the obligatory pop tune as the credits roll. In short, a typical hollywood blockbuster messing up the history books. When will they ever learn? 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first hour of this war epic is enough to make most intelligent people turn off in disgust. The script is hilariously bad, the characters are wooden and unbelievable while director Michael Bay's irritating habit of letting few scenes last longer than a second, intercutting every other scene with a crane shot gets on the nerves. Randall Wallace's dialogue seems to have been inspired by war comics where chracters shout: Aiieeee! when the die. The British come across is incompetent without the aid of good old Ben Affleck while the Japanese only ever say crucial dialogue such as: We have enough information...Everything is spelled out for the lowest common denominator which is a real shame as technically this is a fantastic movie. Great lighting and sets, costumes by Michael Kaplan and the hilarious habit that characters have of standing in front of design classics. Blood transfusions are even carried out with the aid of classic Coke bottles. However, once the attack begins about an hour in, things get really interesting.Take out the first hour and this could have been something really special instead of a desperate attempt to merge Top Gun with Titanic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't even sit through this entire film. It's overly long and extremely sappy. I don't know why Hollywood can't tell a historic tale these days without drowning it in a sugary predictable love story. Is that the only way that people will watch a film these days? Maybe it IS a teeny-bopper's world. Here's my advice: If you want to see the real story of Pearl Harbor, watch The History Channel. If you want to see a GOOD film about Pearl Harbor, sans the sappiness, rent 'Tora, Tora, Tora'. If you want to see a GOOD soap opera about Pearl Harbor, rent 'Pearl' (1978) with Angie Dickenson and Dennis Weaver. Leave this one on the shelf.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I apologize for not coming up with a better one line summary, but I think after watching the film, I think most will not only agree with the statement, but also think this statement is all the movie is worth. I'll name the good stuff first, the action sequences. They were pretty decent. The rest of the movie was nothing short of a disaster. The movie starts off quite boring, where you are just waiting for the action to start because of the poorly written dialogue and artificial 'emotional' moments. Then, when the action does pick up things that are too incredible to even fathom happen with regularity. Finally the movie ends by once again playing to our sympathy and also our patriotism. It does neither, instead insulting your intelligence and leaving a taste of disgust in your mouth for even trying to put such subject in this horrible film. I rented this on DVD and what I have described is just disc one. Don't even ask me about disc two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since there were 1161 comments before mine, I'm pretty sure they've covered most of the good, the bad, and the ugly of this movie. Especially, that it is most certainly "Titanic 2" in many respects. Historical &amp; technical problems abound. . .but there are some decent points. The much maligned love story is decent at times, and sometimes they do capture the 1940's atmosphere fairly well. The music is good, although I did get tired of those same three notes after the 473rd shot of people drowning or otherwise suffering (Titanic-style). My main gripe with this movie is its inaccurate portrayal of 1940's sex mores. I'm not sure if anyone else has mentioned this scene, but it's an early one where all the nurses are chatting and one says "Sure, I'm here to do my duty to my country. . .and about 20 guys." Call me crazy, but I can't see a woman in that era making that very 80's/90's/00's sexual proclamation. All right, maybe I could believe that a girl would say that. However, I do not believe that all the other nurses would giggle and laugh in agreement. At least some would be shocked and appalled. That, to me, was one of the many, many problems this "war film" carried with it. Overall, some passable acting and set work, so we'll go with 4.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard a lot of mixed reviews about this movie and rented it with more than a little trepidation. However, once we started watching it, I was totally drawn in. This movie has everything I love -- an interesting story and characters you really care about. I enjoyed the love story in the first part of the movie and then the attack came and focus shifted to the war. Then, at the end, the attention is once again put back on the love story. Of course, I was able to enjoy the movie because I didn't sit there and try to pick it apart because of "historical inaccuracies". If I want to see a documentary about Pearl Harbor, I'll look to the Discovery Channel. I was there to be *entertained* and this movie does that remarkably well. I would give it 8 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing the 2 main characters didn't do in this flick is fly the Enola Gay to Hiroshima. Not only did they end up being the only 2 pilots to get off the ground on Dec. 7th, 1941, but they also became "BOMBER" pilots in the Doolittle raid, which would have been an insult to a real fighter pilot because bomber pilots were generally not the "first line" airmen fighter jocks were. Not to mention that these 2 bozo's also found time to help rescue men on ships, when they would have been too busy preparing for expected further attacks by the Japanese. If you somehow got emotional from this film, and now "understand" why Pearl Harbor is important to history, I suggest you need to read more and watch less. American's won't ever forget Pearl Harbour because they considered the attack a sneaky way to start a war. But when America does it's own "pre-emptive Strike" to start an engagement, that's somehow completely acceptable.World War II America considered the Japanese inferior as a people, and inferior militarily. It was good old fashioned prejudice. That was why the attack worked out as well as it did for Japan. The U.S. didn't "know it's enemy" at all, because they kept lying to themselves about their supposed invulnerability. Just as the Japanese military lied to itself about their strengths in sustaining a long-term war. That's the one thing you won't see in this movie, nor any movie that comes out of Hollywood. I feel that this movie does more to insult the real men and women who fought and died @ Pearl Harbor. But truth doesn't sell many tickets, does it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was born quite a few years after December 7th, 1941, but had I survived the attack on Pearl Harbor and then watched this movie today, I would probably react with a mixture of disgust and despair. Then again, maybe I would have only been as bored as I was without the benefit of experience. "Pearl Harbor" is a movie that uses World War II as a backdrop for a love story of astonishing banality that contributes to one of the most witless experiences I've had.The movie is three hours long, but it would have seemed long at two. Hell, it would have seemed long at 45 minutes, which is the length of time at the center of the movie that is focused on the attack itself. "The day that will live in infamy" still evokes strong emotions from those who lived through it, but from the movie's perspective it did little but provide a set piece for an action movie. The special effects by Michael Bay are impressive, indeed; we see Japanese fighter planes divebombing the ships in harbor, flying between them at high speed, while those on the ground flee in fear or shoot from the decks. Most of this is pitched at the level of a video game, especially when the two heroes, Danny and Rafe, climb into their own planes and proceed to start shooting down every enemy plane they can. Unlike Spielberg's earlier "Saving Private Ryan" which had convincing footage of the landing at Normandy but also a moral context, "Pearl Harbor" is completely lacking in insight. Instead, the attack becomes nothing but appalling visions of slaughter for benefit of entertainment.The dialog in the movie is truly amazing, but not for it's good qualities. Take Evelyn's consolation to Rafe, whom she loves, as she explains her motives: "My heart belongs to Danny, but I'll never look at another sunset without thinking of you." Thanks a whole lot. Of course, that's after Jon Voight has woodenly tried to portray President Roosevelt standing up defiantly from his wheelchair after being told by his cabinet that a military assault on Japan is impractical, and stating, "Gentlemen, do not tell me what cannot be done!" As I understand it, history does record him saying something to this effect, but I doubt it came across as lamely as it does in this movie.The Japanese are given the "hindsight is 20-20" treatment: Admiral Yamamoto, who orchestrated the attack, muses anxiously that "I fear that all we have done is awaken a sleeping giant." They act as if seeming unlikely to have attacked, had they not been called upon to do so in service of the plot. It's as if the filmmakers were afraid of seeming callous if they depicted the Japanese as actually having Imperialism as a motive. The Japanese continue to make movies about Hiroshima and Nagasaki without sympathy for the American perspective and justifiably so: it was a defining moment for them, just as Pearl Harbor was a defining moment for Americans. I cannot recall a film about the Enola Gay in which Truman is heard to say "I fear all we have done is unleashed an apocalypse on an unsuspecting city."The movie pays token respect to African-Americans with its depiction of Dorie Miller, the black cook aboard one of the carriers who grabs the controls of an anti-aircraft gun during the attack and shoots down several enemy planes. Curiously, despite the location being Hawaii, I did not notice a single person of Polynesian descent during the entire movie.Nothing about the movie offers up any historical perspective on the events that take place. I attended the film with a friend who afterward defended it as a "popcorn movie". To describe this movie about the tragic loss of three thousand lives in the same terms as those used by critics in referring to "The Mummy Returns" is no less depressing for its accuracy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The historical facts are all wrong, and it ends up as a bad rip off of Titanic, Top gun and Legends of the Fall, and . Tora Tora was by far a better film despite the age.Only 1 American plane took off and only 1 Japanese plan crashed (due to an engine failure) not the seven that got shot down in one of the top gun scenes of the film.The film belittles the true storys which it drops in as more of an after thought (like the cooks story) and trys to re-write a lot of the facts in typical Hollywood style for the sake of American pride. What's worse is the bad romantic story (ripped off Legends of the fall it seems) that makes the film take so long to start. The actual pearl harbour section in minimal and the best bits can be seen in the trailer for the film.It seems they tried to do this Titanic style, only they failed to give most of it any believability. By the time they started dropping the bombs I was hard pushed to feel sympathetic. On top of it all, the changes they made ended up diminishing the impact of the disaster section of the movie.It'd be nice to see a movie start with Pearl Harbour and end with Hiroshima, and not try and make it "spunky" and cheap. It seems bad war films are popular with hollywood these days for some reason, all changing history and afraid to show the truth. It is rather unfortunate.</fullReview>

It has everything that would happen during World War 2. Love- The one you love dies. That happened. Heartfelt-For the people that died. It showed that. Remembrance-To all the people that put their life on the line to save our country. Many people say that it was dull and too much love, but I don't think that people actually got the message that the movie was supposed to be. It wasn't just all about the love story. I think this movie is right up there with Titanic. They both gave a message. Many people died because of other peoples actions.I mean the love story added everything. It brought the movie together. War means death and destruction. Many people lost the ones they love in the war. I cried, I smiled, and I laughed. I hope that I'm not the only one who got the message of Pearl Harbor.

		<fullReview>Make no mistake! This is a poor film. I will start by saying the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour is exciting if not accurate in any real historical context. Pearl Harbour doesn't work for the following reasons,1) Remember the Japanese Empire attacked at 7am. So how come kids were out playing softball, people were playing golf etc. It was like Sunday afternoon. Corny 2) Poor acting (very poor acting) I cringed in my seat during some of the acting in this movie!! Ben Affleck was terrible, Josh Hartnett was brutal and worse of all was Kate Beckinsale!! Where did these people learn to act!! They were so wooden. Was it with Keanu Reeves in the `"Pinocchio school of Acting". Corny as Hell!! 3) The Love Triangle (Less said about that the better) Corny corny corny!!! 4) The sentimentality of this movie!! Was it supposed to make us feel sorry for the Yanks and hate the Japanese!! It totally failed because it was not objective! It was not a balanced view of what really took place. It portrayed events in a one-sided biased manner aimed at American Film goers! Being Irish and not American (and well read on the events of December 3rd) I found the whole movie tiresome, inaccurate and boring! It was a film that was made by Americans, for Americans!This film is not a true depiction of what happened at Pearl Harbour! It is as inaccurate as was Braveheart was with the story of William Wallace. The true story of Pearl Harbour was compelling, moving and dramatic (as was the story of Wallace) so why do Hollywood always insist on changing the facts! And never for the better!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it's just my love of WW2 aircraft and uniforms but I found this movie to be not as bad as many people have said. Sure, it IS a terrible failure in it's attempt to be a love story as well as a historical recreation of Pearl Harbor, drafting in both Yamamoto and Roosevelt as supporting characters among other things. One is reminded of that dreadful TV Mini-series from the early 80's "The Winds of War" in its incompatible and grandiloquent narrative. The central love story though is actually not that bad and, like From Here to Eternity, it could have succeeded on its own merit of light-tragic drama with a minimum of expensive explosions and, at times, completely incredulous aerial combat sequences.Less is more and this film just goes for more more more, ultimately making it just another summer action blockbuster with little or no historical relevance aside from it's 40's look and feel. A shame too, because if Bruckheimer and Bay weren't looking between every line for a mindless adrenaline rush this could have been a poignant tribute to the WW2 fighter pilot and Navy Nurse. Instead we get huge helpings of noise and action thrown at us, some of which is very realistic and fitting, some of which is as cheesy as any Star Wars dogfight over the deathstar, making you cringe at its phoniness. When the dogfight and B-25 scenes are good they're very good. But when they slip into unreal comic-book heroics they go way over the top.On the ground floor this film is a slap in the face to every Pearl Harbor veteran wishing their story might have been told in the vein of Private Ryan or Yanks. But at times, as a romantic drama, it is very thoughtful and human, with some great buddy interaction between the flyboys and some down to earth sequences. Then it skews off into another movie with Roosevelt (Jon Voight has dreadful lines) and the Japanese Naval command, Admiral Kimmel, Doolittle, and so on. And of course this isn't helped by the insistence on embellished action. Even setting this story at Pearl Harbor was a big mistake. The writer should have realized it after the first draft and set it in a more low-key WW2 locale. The story of two pilots is not suited to Pearl Harbor where barely an American fighter got off the ground that day. And then the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo? If one of the men had been a sailor assigned to the Arizona and the other a pilot maybe there would have been more believability and logic to the storyline. The title reenactment of the attack on Pearl Harbor, at 35 minutes or so, is just an exploitive money sequence and has really nothing to do with the plot. It does not even remotely feel realistic and captures none of the imagery we have seen for years in documentary footage which should have been a reference point.Overall, visually sumptuous and mostly well acted, Pearl Harbor has many redeeming qualities undone by its many excesses. Not a great film by any stretch of the imagination but still, not as bad as the reviews.If nothing else watch it for the planes!</fullReview>

The cinematography was pretty good but the "top gun" like feel really destroyed this film. Do filmmakers really think the general public is that simple minded?

		<fullReview>There's no way that this is the huge turkey that everyone keeps saying it is. okay, jerry's gone mad on the budget, and michael bay cuts like edward scissorhands, but there is a good movie in their somewhere. I am sometimes choked by the American style cheese that seems to ooze out of the flick, but it seems to represent that era reasonably well(as far as i know).The scenes of stuff exploding are great. It does feel at times like armageddon and the rock however. Michael bay perhaps hasn't learned all that much in the way of varying his style. He might not replace Kubrick just yet, but he does alright considering the subject.Again, everyone is calling it a waste of money. I pay the same to see any movie so I don't really care what it cost to make. I would rather see more thoughtful films with realistic dialogue, but, as it stands, Pearl Harbor does what it sets out to do. The history might be a little warped, but then again, I'm sure Braveheart was even worse on that score.Worth watching. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave Pearl Harbor a 9/10, which is the least I could do. I mean, this movie was not Titanic, no matter how good the special effects. The romance, although cute, was not very endearing. The chemistry between Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett was non-exisistent. But overall, the film was quite good. The 45 minutes attack scene was tremendous! I mean, it was a very good depiction of that Sunday morning that drew America in to WWII. Pearl Harbor is my third favorite movie. I saw in when it first came out, and I loved it. I just got it on DVD.I love this movie, and I'm sure it will be watched over and over again. I recommend it to anyone who has not yet seen it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not sure why everyone is giving this film a hard time about the facts. Yes, it is about a factual event, but was not marketed to be documentary. Hence the fiction and the Hollywood sensationalism. I thought this was a good movie, although a bit long, but worth it. I would definately recommend it.If anyone is looking for the documentary, check out the History channel's add on at the end of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Some Would Have You Believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, it's not a great film, but it's a lot better than some would have you believe. Essentially, it's a 1940's style war film. This means patriotic verbal expressions and images, and a less than obsessive sense of historical accuracy. But (despite the marketing) that isn't the film's point. It's a romantic fantasy and a very good one at that. If you expect more from it, then you'll be disappointed in it. But I don't think this is a fault with the film. It's the fault of the expectations we bring to it, and a brow-beating marketing campaign. If you want to compare it to something, compare it to "From Here to Eternity." It's in that genre of films. While not a great film, it is certainly a good, entertaining one. And for a long movie (183 minutes), it flies by very quickly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never got round to seeing this one at the cinema but just bought the commemorative 3-dvd set. Had heard that the first hour would be boring. Sure enough, I put on the dvd started watching, gradually nodded off but suddenly woke up after 1hr 25 minutes, just when the attack was starting ! From then on till the end of the film I was pleasently surprised ! The attack on PH is perfect cinematographically and the following events right up till the end of the film fine. What is missing is a strong love story like there was in Titanic which complemented the impending disaster ! Here the love story seems less intense but I reserve my judgement on this matter having fallen asleep for an hour !! I 'll have to watch from the beginning again. But the aerial combats and bombing scenes are second to none as are the sound quality and beautiful music from the soundtrack. Apart from that I was pretty sure well before the end how the film would turn out and it happened exactly as had imagined = predicable end. But I do not want my comments to appear to negative as my overall impression of the film is quite positive. I just conclude it needs several viewings to take all in hence the purchase of the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of you scared of PEARL HARBOR because of the possible TITANIC and ARMAGEDDON syndrome - well, you have every right to be.The CGI effects in the movie are stunning and the Japanese are portrayed pretty fairly as a country that felt like they had no choice.For the most part, it does no harm to watch the movie. Seeing Ben Affleck in another movie like this, rehashing the same character from Armageddon, gets a bit tedious. Josh Harnett, as Affleck's bosom buddy, brings no real presence to the screen but dead pans his role well as a contrast. Kate Beckinsale, however, as the love interest, presents a relatively interesting character but has most of her screen time during the full half of the movie that is a tedious bore.The real star of the movie is the FX and the flying/dog fight/bombing scenes. I do not usually like straight up action in a movie that claims to be more, but that is the best quality of this film and saves if from a 2 or 3 rating to that of a 5 or so.If you have three hours to spare (I suggest renting the DVD Widescreen), then it will not hurt to sit down and take a look at this movie. The first 90 minutes will frustrate and bore you, but the last half is at least worth watching.If you find yourself yearning for a long war movie that is time well spent, I would suggest DAS BOOT or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.**This movie is reviewed as a film and NOT as to the importance of the events portrayed.6/10 - Watchable</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as it should have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Read my lips - too dang long! The story is weakened mainly because of the length. It would have been much more intense had it been shorter. The acting is for the most part good, although I thought Alex Baldwin was asleep at the wheel as Jimmy Doolittle. This is countered by strong performances from Kate Beckinsale, Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck and a truly outstanding job by Jon Voight as President Roosevelt. The ships used in the film were all wrong, with the aircraft carriers having angled flight decks, which were not developed until after the war (and then by the British). In addition, none of the Japanese carriers which took part in the Pearl Harbor raid had large portside island structures, which the ones in the film had. The ships shown at Pearl Harbor before the raid included modern US Navy Perry-class frigates. They should have used models for reality! But overall, the film tried to encompass too much of the war. It could have been a much more powerful film if they'd ended it as Roosevelt was declaring war. But they had to keep going and went way too far. The entire second half of the film occurred several months after the Pearl Harbor attack and therefore didn't belong in this film at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just read through a lot of comments made by users who have reviewed Pearl Harbor and nearly everyone has slated it for what?? A simple love story which is noticeable in most of Hollywood's movies these days (Titanic, Even Band of brothers in 'Bastogne' the interaction between Eugene and the french nurse!!) The movie was maybe a little biased on the USA part for the glory and singled handed defeating of the Japanese in 1942 when WW2 had already been going for 3 years between British, French and Russian armies. Ignoring this point we can see how far our movie industry has come in terms of special effects, especially the torpedoes making contact with the warships this was movie making at it's pinnacle!!Brilliant acting was yet again seen by performances from Ben Afflek, Josh Hartnett and the beautiful Kate Beckinsale. These actors basically made the film what it was and still is today a TRUE MASTERPIECE, which actually tells us a true story we can follow and relate to and not some fictional, made-up, hyped up garbage like (Star wars?!)We should be grateful for works like this, as they tell us our past and what we had to overcome to live in the world we live today!!! IMDB users be ashamed!!After a long deliberation i think the film deserves a Michael Bay 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A GREAT MOVIE - GIVE IT A CHANCE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the negative reviews Pearl Harbor received last summer I decided not to go and see it. However, I bought the DVD last week and sat down to watch it.I'm pleased I gave Pearl Harbor a chance. Its is a very good film that deserves to be watched and just enjoyed. I had heard that this film was very boring for the first 90 minutes - didn't seem to be to me - In fact the whole 3 hours seemed to pass very quickly.The love story was perfectly acceptable and the action scenes were superbly executed. One thing I have to give a huge thumbs up to was the musical score which really enforced the emotional impact.I'm not going to say any more about Pearl Harbor. If you haven't seen it then see it and don't be prejudiced by other peoples opinions - make up your own mind. Watch it and decide for yourself, you might find thats its a lot better than you thought it would be.Cheers</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great effects!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor IS a good movie. The only problem was, i was looking forward to a movie about WW 2; I was NOT looking for a love story set in D-Day. The effects was awesome, but the movie would have been better if it had focused on Rafe and Danny's fight in the war, not their love life.Affleck is a brilliant actor, and he shows depth for his portrayal of Rafe McCrawley. You just can't help but feel sorry for him for all the things he went through. You can't help but love him for being a loyal friend. Hartnett is a charismatic and talented young actor. He certainly gave a believable performance. You want to hate him (because he stole Rafe's girl), but you just can't (that's what i call charisma, baby!). Instead, you feel a trite sorry for him because you know he didn't plan on things to turn out this way. Beckinsale ,as Evelyn, gave a great performance. The girl in which both young men fell for. She was credible as a tortured soul, torn between two lovers. I also have to commend Alec Baldwin. When you watch him as he leads the men to battle, you feel inspired and heartened that there IS hope for vengeance... that America WILL win the war. Hmm... let me see, great acting, great script, great effects. The only thing that got me down was the misleading title. I said it before, and I'll say it again: I was looking forward to a war flick.... not a love story set in WWII! Anyway, when you think about it, it IS a war flick with a too much heart and sensitivity. I give this movie 9 out of 10.PS. Does Ben Affleck and Matt Damon have to do everything exactly the same?!?! When they're not acting together in the same films, their individual projects are somehow similar. Take Pearl Harbor and Saving Private Ryan for instance. Well, they ARE best friends after all.... hehehe. :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel sorry for whoever disrespected this movie. I may admit that the love plot that was entwined may have been a bit cheesy and/or badly played but it wasn't just something to interest the viewers. I believe that you people who decided to just rip this movie to shreads need to sit back and look at the bigger picture. Everything in this movie had a point to it, even the first hour and a half that you deemed irrelevent. It is a story, one of many, that can be told from this day. It's a story of a random few that were involved in Pearl Harbor. It may or may not be true who knows, but I garentee you this; there are more stories there than you think. This is a story of what a group of people went through during this time and leading up to and following. It's just a small far fetch of what a few people may have went through, and believe me, this is a glorified story at that. Most people who have went through this and lived or that have been effected by this tragedy may tell a much different and very much more tragic story of their experience. The scenes in this movie depict a viewer friendly, the hero wins type of approach. In reality not all of the heros lived. Maybe you should sit down with someone who has went through a war and watch this movie with them, and maybe then you will get a true feel for what this movie is all about and what it was made for. If they will tell, just ask them how many of the things in this movie were true, ask them how many friends they saw die, ask them how many lovers they saw widowed, and ask them what the movie didn't show, the things that the movie couldn't cover in your supposed 3 hour waste of time. This movie was great. My final opinion. Think about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>5/10 For the awesome bombing scenes and the detail to actual history. Ben Affleck hands in a reasonable performance as the dare-devil pilot who always manages to save the day (not Dec 7, 1941 unfortunutely). Superb FDR by Jon Voight - only wished more of his characterization made it into the film. Cuba Gooding, Jr and Alec Baldwin perfectly cast and also wished additional footage.Josh Hartnett is too pretty to be a man and it takes from his character. He is not believable as the dare-devil pilot wanna be. This may not be his fault as the overall writing is fair to average and the inside plot of the triangle love affair is somewhat sit-com and poorly presented. Kate Beckinsale also works with poor dialogue and does her best as the woman caught between two men.However, the overall film gets a special boost and is timely considering the other date that will live in infamy - September 11th. Pearl Harbor stimulates our patriotism in these troubled times and provides the needed justice we currently seek. I would rarely join a movie with current events but I urge everybody to experience this film with USA in their hearts and I think you will see what I mean.Thank-God no sequel exists for this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing so many bad reviews for this movie, I hesitated renting it. Fortunately, one of my 99 cents rental places got it, so I took the chance. Well, I must say I really enjoyed it. It was very similar (in style) to Titanic, but much better. Yes, the plot was a bit hackneyed and soapy, but that's the way many, many war movies have been made. So you just know what to expect and sit back and ride it. Usually, I don't like Bruckheimer so much ;he'll all special effects and nothing else. But, this time I really enjoyed it. BTW, I also enjoyed Armageddon as well, so maybe this tells us something. I didn't mind the length since the action was pretty constant. The (over) 30 minute sequence on the actually Dec. 7th event was fabulous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than you'd expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the popcorn movies of 2001, this one was probably one of the best. I have not watched any previous films that depict Pearl Harbour so I have no basis of comparison or bias. If you want a film that is supposed to be historically accurate, you probably will be disappointed. However, one usually goes to watch this type of movie for entertainment and not for historical significance. If that is the case, you'd be better off watching the Discovery Channel instead.This is probably Jerry Bruckheimer' best work. I usually don't like much of his movies since most of his work is ususally over the top with nothing but mindless explosions and one dimensional characters. If you are an action fan who has seen so much of this genre that big explosions are no longer enough to sustain your interest, but also need a good story and characters to make it worthwhile, then this movie is it. Surprisingly, this isn't the same drab that Bruckheimer has been mass producing the past 5 years. The characters are actually people that you care about, but I agree with the general consensus that the first hour was a little too long for character development. Also the nurse falling for the other guys's friend was just too typical and not very beleivable. The character development is not exactly original and probably has been done serveral times, but it works. However, if it is action you want, you won't be disappointed either. The attack on the harbour and the dog fight scenes are probably nothing I have seen in any other movie (however, i did have a little bit of Star Wars deja vu, especially when one of the protagonists was trying to shake off an enemy plane). The special effects and people falling off the ships are reminiscent of Titanic. However, the characters are not as appealing as Titanic, and where that movie was equally strong in characterization and action, Pearl Harbour would not be so good if not for the action in the latter half of the movie.Overall, if you aren't looking for any historical realism but enjoy an action movie with a love story thrown in, then you'll probably enjoy this trip back into time. The fact that it is also the 60th anniversary of the event might also make this movie a little more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>because I myself found "Pearl Harbor" to be quite entertaining. I'll admit that the first half of the movie is kind of slow and boring, but it gets better around the final twenty minutes leading up to the attack. The actual attack was easily the best part of the movie. It was amazingly shot and pulled off. The love story I feel although it seriously messed up the movie in some spots, was necessary for the overall impact of the film. The dialogue is kind of stupid too with lines like "I'm not anxious to die, just anxious to matter", but I won't hold that against the movie. I do agree with one previous comment about Michael Bay not being the right director for a movie about one of the biggest events of the 20th century. That should have been done by either Steven Spielberg or Michael Mann, preferably Michael Mann. I can't comment on the historical accuracy of the film since world history isn't one of my majors. The ending was kind of stupid too now that I think about it. One last thing, didn't Michael Bay do a film with a love story like the one in "Pearl Harbor" three years ago? I believe it was called "Armageddon". Overall despite some of the film's stupidity and some serious bashings by critics, "Pearl Harbor" is still a good film to watch and you'll probably see it at the Oscars next year.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"PEARL HARBOR has a perfect attact scene... but would have benefited from an R rating, and a shorter running time."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor was easily one of the most anticipated films of the summer.It disappointed most critics, as well as most viewers. And after finally getting to see the film, I can understand why. Before I get to the review, let me just say that I think this film had a little more impact on me because of the events of September 11 (And also that I watched it today, on the day the Pearl Harbor was attacked).The first hour of Pearl Harbor is terrible, and just so boring (Surprisingly, I think the only thing that kept me watching, was seeing the star of my favorite television show, "Alias," Jennifer Garner). I was laughing at the love story, and I don't think I was supposed to be. It is so underdeveloped, that I didn't care about the relationship between the two characters at all. I mean one second she's sticking needles up his ass, and the next there dancing together, and acting like newlyweds. Did I miss something? Also, the romance is just not romantic, which is also partly due to the fact that the characters aren't developed in the slightest bit. Who cares about a relationship, when you know close to nothing about the characters in love? Another problem with the first hour or so of the film, is that it seemed to attempt to add some comedy to the mix. And the comedy just wasn't funny. I thought that at times, the film seemed more like a parody of war films, than an actual war film.Throughout the horrid first part, I sat and prayed that the attack scene would come. And when it finally did, I was not disappointed. The scene was perfect. It actually had some emotion in it (Although I don't think I cared for the characters - the scene reminded me that this actually happened, that thousands of people died. And it also reminded me of the thousands who died on September 11. And that got me sad, and upset). I got into the film for the 40 minutes, and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time (However one part of the attack scene seemed to come straight out of Titanic, and that bothered me). I also loved Jon Voight's performance as President FDR - It was right on the money. Was it just me, or did the second part of the film seem like a completely different film - a much, much, much better film. However the ending goes downhill. I didn't feel they gave us enough of the war storyline. The fight scenes seem to end, because something happens to affect the love story, not because the war is over. I think it should have dropped most of the first hour, and used the extra time to expand on the war.As for the acting, I wasn't impressed. Don't get me wrong, the stars did fine, but nothing extraordinary. Josh Hartnett was my least favorite actor in the film. I didn't think he did the best he could for some reason. Something was missing from his performance. Ben Affleck did fine, but I also thought something was missing from his performance. I did, however, like Kate Beckinsale's performance. Alec Baldwin was annoying in his role. But that is thanks to the cheesy dialogue provided by the script. As I already mentioned Jon Voight was great, and stole the scenes he was in. Cuba Gooding Jr. was decent in his small role (I would have loved to learn more about his character). Now let me take a little time to criticize the laughably bad dialogue. My favorite line came from Ben Affleck, while writing a letter to Evelyn. He said something along the lines of: "It's cold here. But there's one place I know I can go to keep warm. That is to think of you." That line had me laughing the whole night. Does it get any worse than that. Alec Baldwin also had some unintentionally hysterical lines.Overall Pearl Harbor is a disappointment. It fails as a romance, and fails as a war film. However, the attack scene was fantastic! Like I said before, it was perfect. Had that scene not been so well made, this film would be crap on a stick. I also think the film would have benefited from an R rating, and a shorter running time. Cut out the love story, add some more of the war in the film, and we would have had a great, great war film. I know that I will not be recommending Pearl Harbor to many people.Pearl Harbor: 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible Spoilers?Yes that is my comment, but it is not a comment on Pear Harbor. It is a comment on the people who rip this movie to shreds. How sad it is that many people have forgot that real people with real lives, real loves, real hopes, and real dreams fought and gave their life for them. I know this is a forum for reviewing movies and not a forum of debate. However after watching Pearl Harbor on DVD on a Big Screen TV last night with a good sound system all I can say is? WOW! This has to be one of the great movies of recent memory, MUCH better in my opinion than Harry Potter could ever hope to be.So why is it so maligned by many of the posters here? Normally this might be considered attempting to start a debate but I feel that I am addressing real issues that have been brought up again and again by past posters in this forum.It's not historically accurate. HUH??? Please could someone point out one major historical inaccuracy. I consider myself to quite the history buff and can find no major inaccuracies in this movie. Omissions don't count as it is impossible to show every detail of an event on the big screen and not leave parts out. An omission is not an inaccuracy unless it changes the context of fact. Mr. Bay consulted closely with many people who were actually there and had their input and the input of many historians. My suggestion to those of you who believe this movie was inaccurate is, perhaps you should reexamine your knowledge of history from a more objective viewpoint.The love story was not important. The love story was the movie. This was not Pearl Harbor with the love story as a backdrop, this was a love story with Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle raid as a backdrop. War is about people. When you forget the people you forget the essence of what we fight and die for. Real people real lives, people loved people were separated people died and families and hearts were broken, that is war. War is not just one country fighting another country, for every person who dies in battle there is a story, a life and family. This movie was about those people. The love triangle was not believable. Another HUH??? This is a very believable situation. Often times a person who loses someone will turn to someone that is already close to both of them. I have seen this happen in real life. They both thought Rafe was dead. What is it more likely for Danny and Evelyn to do, forget each other or turn to each other?The special effects were poor. Once again HUH??? These were some of the best effects I have ever saw in a war movie. The producers went to extremes to make the effects look real, even so far as actually loading real B-25 bombers onto a real aircraft carrier and recreating the start of the Doolittle Raid. This had never been done since the real Doolittle raid nearly sixty years ago. Many of the shots include REAL aircraft and ships with CGI being used to only fill in the background. I believe some people have been watching special effects so long they don't know real when they see it.In closing I say I loved this movie, and to those who hate this move, please watch it again with a open mind expecting a story of people and not a story of war.There was four of us who watched this movie last night and afterwards there was not a dry eye in the room.My rating 9 out of 10 (I've never Gave a 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only real problem with this movie is it's title.If any other title were chosen,then it would undoubtedly be heralded and lauded over as a great piece of filmmaking.But since Pearl Harbor was to be its fait accompli,then many are offended and take it to task.Why,I don't know or care.It is after all,a movie.Not World at War.Or some submarine movie that can not submerge and take wind of its true potential.After reading some very naive comments and reviews over,I find many a film buff to be unable to appreciate what is trying to be accomplished by this movie.It is long,and sappy with love interest at times,but that is the nature of the beast.To entertain through romance and buddy interaction because war is hell and one never knows,what is around corner.And anyone in the military can testify to the power of the opposite sex for motivation to go to war and battle for cause. And least we forget that many a military GI had romanced and married during his stay,whether home or abroad.Pearl starts out nicely with eager relationship betwen 2 early gung-ho kids,just playing around a single prop airfield.Their enthusiasm is quite apparent,and for good reason.They will quickly go on to enlist and fight for country.The bond is set,and the competitive nature established.These buddies will be the focal point of story and plot. Ben Affleck,looking dapper and crisp in uniform,takes me back to another good actor with similiar qualities-Robert Taylor.Both men exuded confidence and a gung-ho spirit that was both manly and charming.Tough and yet tender enough to appeal to most every women.These are the kind of men we want as officers and leaders,who will compassionately and fairly go to battle,and do us proud with their sense of self.It is this sense of self that separates a worthy character and actor from just an ordinary GI or Mr.Joblo.It takes bravura and gusto,along with handsome charm to pull off. Affleck is almost perfect in role.Why some are offended by his performance is not my concern.There are some who would question Mother Teresa.Our world is undeniably fickle in its mentality,at times. The gals are also very pretty and wholesome,giving off their sweet and wild-eyed sexiness,to the applause of most enlisted men and any GI worth his salt for appreciation of.Pinup girls and painted portraits of such were commonplace during the war and for good reason.An incentive to go to war and kick butt,thereby returning home for some Mom,apple pie and Girls,girls,girls.So the love interest aspect of Pearl is not only warranted but quite apropriate.I think it a good thing to establish some romance before fighting for one's life.And if action is key to many a film nowadays ,then this film can float along on its merry laurels,with not so much as a hiccup to gather dust.The action is as fast and furious as humanly possible and state of the art in places,maybe a bit too overwhelming,for many eyes and ears.It was a bit too much for me personally,not giving in to action scenes very much.But its all in there,and done with great effect.As for the overall length and scope of drama,it succeeds on many levels and is sure to cause a stir among former veterans of war and Gen Xer's who aren't used to all that much honesty and true felt discipline,being a cold war bunch of slackers.So,i welcome good discerning debate as to the merits and pratfalls of this epic and grand display of emotion,action and above all loyalty. 4 out of 5 star or 8/10 for rather long but big attempt to expose war and romance with straight forward emotion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw Pearl Harbor on a field trip with my senior history class. I think it was one of the best times in high school I've ever had. None of us had ever really expected the Pearl Harbor attack to be as big as what was shown in the movie. We weren't very educated on it.I must say, I have heard this movie compared to Titanic, and Pearl Harbor by far surpasses it. It was an emotional roller coaster from the first shot to the last. The music was a great help in that.One of the best scenes in the entire movie was when they would show the nurses helping in the rescue efforts. It was great that it showed views from every angle, and as a woman, I appreciated that.In the end, I was sitting in the movie theater, with tears soaked into my shirt, and all over my face. I looked around, and everyone else was too. I myself put this in my top 5 movies of all time. Great job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie took the Titanic approach of throwing in a very cheesy love story into a film that should have had a historical obligation to do better. The movie goes to Japan after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The movie should have never done this and stopped after the Japanese attack, unless of course the movie would have gone all the way to us dropping the atom bomb on a Japanese family that had been developed throughout the movie. But the makers didn't have enough balls for this.Warning: The following discusses the end and may spoil the weak ending:A particular funny part at the end is a plane goes down after Ben's plane, and there is a soldier in the glass gun turret on the bottom of the plane shooting Japs to save Ben Affleck. The soldier shoots that gun until the plane crashes, crushing the soldier. I'm sure his last thoughts were, "Well, I know I will die if I am in this turret when the plane crashes, but how else can Ben get back to his girlfriend if I don't shoot all the Japs." I especially liked how Ben Affleck kills about 30 Japs with his pistol in the end, and how Josh Hartnett was killed as a weak attempt to make the love story work out. Good special effects though, as Micheal Bay will always deliver.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know where to begin to describe just how ludicrously insipid this monster of a movie is. And the dark misanthropy pervading my mind as I perplexed at the film's commercial success... I have one advice for true lovers of cinema: don't go. don't buy it. don't even rent it. Just borrow it from some aquaintance of yours, fastforward up to 1h30', and then turn it off 20'before the clumsiest ending Hollywood has ever spawned on the face of this earth. That makes 40' of nice, not breakthrough efx, which efx don't make up for a three-hour cascade of cliches, stupid dialogues, stiff and unconvincing acting, ridiculous if existent screenplay, irritating music and I myself could go on spitting at it for three hours...for free. For the best in war movies on the subject, see "Tora! Tora! Tora!". As for Pearl Harbour being the new "Gone with the Wind"- DAH! 7/10 for the efx. 3/10 for baldwin. -2 for the rest.

The vintage planes look nice - the P-40 fighters especially but such stupid s**t happens in them you'll be groaning through the flying sequences.Course it IS directed by a Brit and those who've not seen it (like me yesterday) might be tempted to think its being willfully idiotic - like a period "DUDE WHERES MY CAR?" but the seriousness given to the attack scenes undermines any comedy and on a small screen the "spectacular attack" looks like a computer game anyway. 1941's better for laughs AND action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The big problem with this very expensive movie is that it's characters are terribly wooden and the lacklustre script is not helping much either. The action scenes are all smart angles of bombs hitting targets and big budget explosions. And the revenge raid after the attack is pretty pointless too.War films tend to fall into two main brackets, the action adventure type that have of course little to do with the reality of war. Then the somber type that attempts to deliver the horrors that war brings. Pearl Harbor gets stuck unfortunately somewhere in between and it's not a good mix.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the movie itself is entertaining and as one who rates movies by "Would I want to own this on DVD to watch again and again" I would say yes.Though storyline is meant to entertain as it shows the lives of 3 characters and has its times of comedy as well as romance which I thought was entertaining. The event that the story comes involved with "The attack of Pearl Harbor" became candy coated so not to offend those who actually attacked us. It was a Special Effect show that was incredible to watch but did not have the emotion and the horror that was going on that day. As an American I am the one who became offended.I realize Disney wants to make money especially in foreign markets by not showing the horror that we had to endure as "Saving Private Ryan" did (even though Japan was the ones who attacked us) therefore I did not feel the same emotions of watching this film as I did "Saving Private Ryan.""Saving Private Ryan" raised the level of war films and "Pearl Harbor" fell short. Just as they have fallen short of their predicted 250 million US box office and I think the reason is what I previously wrote.I feel that if you have not seen this movie go see it for the entertainment value and dont expect an emotional film on the level of "Saving Private Ryan" or "Schindler's List" and you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PEARL HARBOR (2001) Rating: 8/10I was a little unsure of Pearl Harbor. I had eagerly awaited it myself, but when the bad reviews sailed in from American critics, I thought maybe the NZ premiere wouldn't please. But, I was wrong. I really enjoyed this film. The battle sequences are some of the best ever filmed, the acting is top-notch, the sound is booming and vibrating and the direction is focused and careful, Pearl Harbor is easily Michael Bay's best effort. The romantic triangle can at times be extremely corny, tedious and predictable, and the first hour is lacking in excitement. But, that all changes in the last 2 hours, which are incredibly tense and utterly brilliant. Pearl Harbor is a movie that forces you to stay in your seat for as long as the 3 hours take, and is a powerful and unique war experience. I really liked the comedy at the start, but slowly and surely, the comic side of the film turned to dramatic atmosphere. The film was able to change its genres surprisingly and unexpectedly, giving you the odd laugh and the expected tear. If I was ever to watch this movie again, I would probably fast-forward the first hour and get to the superb action scenes, but the first hour is needed to give the film its intelligence. So, even if this film is flawed and sometimes inaccurate, it's still nothing short of a must-see for war and romance lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not in any way to make light of the terrible, horrible tragedy that took place today, but since the attack at the Pentagon and the World Trade Center is being compared with the attack on Pearl Harbor, I shall briefly make my point by bringing it up:Imagine, several years down the road, someone making a movie about the terribly tragedy at the World Trade Center, turning it into a pointless action movie which glamourizes the deaths of thousands of people in some action scenes (using, of course, amazing special effects), and then sugar-coating it with a fictional love story that has nothing to do with the event and suggesting that it is a more important topic to cover for most of the film than the event which it is supposed to be honoring.Thus is the nature of "Pearl Harbor." It doesn't honor the tragedy of sixty years ago....it desensetises people to its horror and rapes its impact on the nation. This is a film spitting on the honor of our fighting boys, and it should have never been made.zero out of ****. Less than that, even. To give it zero stars, I am suggesting that it is worthy of being even considered or watched, and I refuse to rate this film on the level of a "movie". It is betraying to a nation. My heart and prayers go out to the loved ones of those killed in Washington and New York today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here it is, folks. A one hundred and fifty million dollar budget, an A-list cast, promise of some intense action scenes, supposedly going to be a great summer film, and in the end, turns out to be just another Michael Bay film: loud, stupid, boring, excessive hero and sunset shots, and a complete waste of audience time, crew's efforts, and money that could have been used to finance thirty "Memento"'s.The redundant storyline (of which even writer Randal Wallace wants erased from his resume) revolves around a love triangle with the Pearl Harbor bombing at the center, which seemed to have been inspired when Bay noticed "Saving Private Ryan" eclipsed the box office of his "Armageddon" domestically and decided to do the same movie, as well as duplicating his lack-luster love story that centered in "Armageddon".Now in order for romances to work, the audience must believe the characters have a reason to either be together or in love. Neither surface. The result is a waste of Kate Beckinsdale, who is reduced to staring blankly in every scene and seemingly to throw herself at everything that has a penis, be it Affleck, Hartnett, or that guy in the clinic. In fact, I even feel dirty as to how she stared at me from the screen.As for the bombing sequence itself, it fails to either excite or inform. The CG planes are completely fake looking and the ships they bomb aren't even supposed to be around until the eightes. At least Titanic spent a large amount of time trying to detail the period accurately. Even my friend from the Navy, described this film as being "boring."One thing "Saving Private Ryan" did well was depict violence in all it's shocking realism, and never trying to leave the audience with a happy feeling by the end. In "Pearl Harbor", the end result is merely a three hour film (of which I regret not using trying to mentally block out the fact I ever heard of this lousy film) that doesn't even show as much information (or any at all for that matter) or, let alone, do anything to actually credit the memory of the unfortunate lives lost at Pearl Harbor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about Pearl Harbor that is nice. Well, it did make me laugh all the way through it. I've seen some bad movies in my life, but then I was subjected to the hell that is this movie.I'm not saying that this movie didn't have anything good about it. It is immensely quotable, with lines such as "No, we have lost surprise," said by Admiral Yamamoto. Or the line said by Jimmy Doolittle "We're going to Tokyo, and we're gonna bomb it!" Other than that, there was nothing redeemable about the experience.First, being a history buff, the way they portrayed the attack was laughable. The subplots were sub par, and often times, I found myself wondering why this movie was called Pearl Harbor, when only a few minutes actually dealt with the raid. Then again, there were those shots of kids playing baseball, which just warmed my heart. Too bad that they were playing ball at seven in the morning on a Sunday. The eagle squadron in England was not comprised of volunteers in the US Army Air Corp., because anyone who wanted to fly with them had to relinquish his commission. Finally, the whole story about FDR standing up was atrocious. FDR was paralyzed from the waste down due to polio. There is no way, save perhaps a miracle from god, that he could achieve that feat. Then there was the flashback sequence at the beginning, which broke every rule of what not to do in as script. Can anyone say "Titanic"?In the end, I would recommend that this movie be shown to people by the defunct KGB as a torture device. Only people who like to make fun of movies or masochists should watch this on purpose."You ever seen Pearl Harbor at sunset?" "yes." "No, have you ever seen Pearl Harbor at sunset, in an airplane?" "Have you ever seen Pearl Harbor at sunset in an airplane...on weed?"</fullReview>

Beside really bad actors play and a foreseeable storyboard, the pathetic touch and the ridiculous patriotism becomes more and more annoying to the spectator. AND: Why the is this love story so boring? The whole movie seems to be constructed around the Japanese attack on P.H.. These 20 Minutes promise acceptable entertainment with nice effects. Thats it.

Ed Wood of course is famous for his insertion of stock footage at random points in his movies, and a good bit of Pearl Harbor appears to have been constructed from stock footage. Maybe its the computers that make it look that way.It's a bad sign when one finds it difficult to remember the characters' names or to remember which one is which.

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is quite possibly the biggest embarrassment in American movie history. It adds itself to a long list of historically braindead flops like The Patriot, Titanic and Heaven's Gate. Rather than educating us with the events leading up to the massive sneak attack on our Pacific fleet(god forbid the audience should be allowed to think), the script stupifies us with a trite love story and stupifyingly bad dialogue like:"If I had one more night to live, I'd spend it with you""I'm not anxious to die, I'm just anxious to matter!"(After being hit in the nose with a cork)"You're so lovely it hurts!""It's your nose that hurts!""I think it's my heart."It doesn't help that the actors are as bad as their dialogue. But who could blame them when they have to say stuff like the above quotes? Ben Affleck is especially awful as a fighter pilot who falls in love with the equally awful Kate Beckinsale (maybe I'm wrong, but she looked like she died standing up). However, both are outdone by Josh I can't remember his last name but he must die!Anyway, a bizarre love triangle ensues and the three somehow wind up at Pearl Harbor. A lot of stuff blows up with really cool CGI that reduces the thousands of dead at Pearl Harbor to worthless bits of digital code. The much hyped battle scene is loaded with cliches. A sinking ship with dozens hanging on for dear life (Titanic). Our two heroes get chased in planes by two enemy fighters (Independence Day). The camera follows a bomb as it falls down towards its target (Dr. Strangelove, of all things, look for another stolen scene when FDR somehow manages to get out of his wheel chair).This is where the film commits its biggest crime, it treats these deaths as an interlude to its god awful love story and goes on for a FULL HOUR after the Pearl Harbor sequence. I have to stop here, Pearl Harbor is an awful film loaded with continuity problems and plot holes, it would take forever to list them all. On a final note, this film's surprisingly mediocre box office seems to be a sign that U.S. audiences are getting wiser and will soon start demanding good movies again.</fullReview>

One of the problem of this movie is not showing historical fact, but showing some details with very poor historical knowledge, even some are very much wrong. For example, Japanese military personals are making the plan of attacking Pearl Harbor, well, which Military discuss such an Important plan in Open air place? Did they have no headquarter building? I don`t think so.and this movie does not explain why USA had cut the oil supply route to Japan, what was the situation in the Asia etc. it showed just like japanese were cold blooded,evil,,,etc. and, how exactly that charactor from Ben Affleck went to UK from New York!?I think if they make the movie based on historical event, should not show something which is actually wrong. Some people will believe those lie. another bad point is, main Actors. They were not acting well. Especially Josh whoever he is, his character had no depth. And love triangle was cheesy and crap. And later on the film, they bomb Tokyo... then movie gets very much like American. America must be always No.1, have to win always. It seems like some Americans can not be proud of who they are without the help of feeling/being American.they have not much self confidence, i guess.Walt Disney also did something very awful. For Japanese and German release, they did alter the dialog in the end, how USA lived through the hardest time and won the WW2 or something like that. Were they afraid of hurting the feeling of Post WW2 losing Countries?I don`t think so. It`s MONEY! For Example "Titanic" made 20 % of entire profit only in Japan, and Disney wanted to sell this movie for Japanese market as Romantic love Story, that`s why they have altered the dialog. It seems like Hollywood is losing creativity of making movies in these days because of running out of idea,too much Special Effects etc.Anyway, this movie is also way too long and have less plot. I would rate this movie 8 out of 10 ONLY for Attack scene special effects, as the entire Film, 0.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why am I laughing? Because this is the most ridiculous movie I have seen in ages. Yet again Hollywood contorts the events of the past to relieve the conscience of a modern audience. While America drips over the screen like warm, syrup drenched apple pie, the Japanese march around their evil empire with cold efficiency. I wouldn't have been surprised to see Darth Vader himself make a cameo.If you've seen Independence Day, think that with quadruple the special effects and a quarter (and that's generous) of the intellect. Even Bill Pullman's excruciating "We will not go quietly..." speech towers over Affleck and Hartnett's risible efforts like a Shakespearean Soliloquay delivered by Sir Lawrence Olivier himself.Of course, audiences will flock to it just as they did Titanic and Ryan's privates, rallied by those awful 'Movie Chart' shows that give praise to the most wretched hound of a movie - nothing will ever change. Total, utter, unashamed drivel. Coming next summer "How America won Vietnam". Don't laugh just yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK This is the reason why i hate movie critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What has the world come to when a movie critic is the only reason weather a movie is good or bad. This truly is a great movie, but due to Hollywoods beloved movie critics it gets dumped in the gutter. It is not a lie that the critics hate Jerry Bruckheimer claiming that he is nothing but explosions. Excuse me but this movie had the exact same theme as Titanic had 4 years ago. The only reason Titanic won those awards is because people fell in love with the actor. The acting was horrible in Titanic where as in Pearl Harbor it was next to best. Josh Harnett has proven himself as an actor in this film. It is truly sad that hatred for one man can bring a truly good film from fame to filth.Ohhh and in case if i forgot to mention it, this movie is good and i hope that all of the actors, producers and especially Jerry Bruckheimer realize that critics are next to trash and this movie is Oscar worthy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor. What can you really say about it? Well basically, since it is now only in a few movie theatres and at night, it costs about 9.00 to get in and since I first saw it two weeks ago, I have seen it seven times since. That's about 27 bucks or 21 hours, 14 minutes of Pearl Harbor.The critics, the users of IMDB who write reviews, do any of them matter? No. Even I don't matter. If you are reading this review and have not seen it, go see it. You may not like it. Sure- the plot is recycled war plot, but it is a beautiful movie. All these people complaining this movie is not arty enough or not moving in a metaphysical way...who cares? Do you really think the average joe-blow WANTS artsy-fartsy? I mean, MOST movies aren't arty. They are just too boring! And the others who complain that it has too much romance, look at the top of this page. Drama / Action / War / Romance. Only one of those is war and 2 are drama and ROMANCE. YES, romance! Surprise, surprise!If you don't like this movie, that's okay. But don;t see it based on critics alone, okay? See it. Decide for yourself. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a WASTE OF TIME!! Corny and STUPID - and bad History.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney sure blew it with this mess of a movie. Here I was hoping for another "Saving Private Ryan", but what I got was a brainless stupid plot, a corny insipid love story, and cliche after cliche followed by banal dialogue. What a BORE!As for History, it was almost as bad. Sure the battle scenes were good with their nice digital FX, but they were only about ten minutes of the movie, not "forty minutes" as Disney claimed.The rest of the History was a pro-Japanese whitewash. There was no mention of Japanese atrocities, war crimes, and aggression in Asia and especially in China. No mention by Disney of Japanese militarism and plans for expansion. This stupid movie didn't even tell us why the Americans cut off Japan's oil supply (their aggression), nor did the film mention that Japan and Nazi Germany were allies!!Obviously, Disney aimed this movie at teeny boppers (the corny love story) and whitewashed Japanese abominations and crimes to keep ticket sales up in Japan.I wouldn't even rent this on DVD again. It stunk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredibly corny, war-glamorizing, anti-historical film that I found surprisingly entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not want to like this film. Much of the dialogue is corny and sappy in a bad 1930s Broadway musical kind of way. The plot is barely focused on the historical details of the Pearl Harbor bombing, even though that is the title of the film. There is a sort of light-hearted jovial attitude to this whole war business, as if everyone is just out to have a good time. Whenever Alex Baldwin's character spoke, it made me feel like laughing. (I kept picturing him in that SNL skit about ten years ago where he played the boy scout leader.) And yet, I found myself enjoying this whole film and wanting to see what came next for almost the entire three hours. I did not ever get bored. I laughed (sometimes when other people were crying, but hey, that's why you get when you write lines so sappy that they get stuck in the audience's hair) and I cried (mostly during the battle scene). And that battle scene, wow, what a tremendous piece of work. Just non-stop gripping action for an hour. I guess my main comment on a film such as this is that I feel guilty for liking it because I believe that some of its images are so NOT the way life (or history) is. Everything is just too easy in this flick. But I guess if one accepts it as entertainment, then, eh, whatever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I don't understand is why does everybody hate this movie so much?The first time I saw this, I will admit I was not expecting not to like it simply because of it's reviews and I came out of the theater sobbing. Anybody who is not moved by this film, simply has a heart of stone. Because basically, the only reason I registered on here was to give Pearl Harbor a good review.The war sequences are absolutely INCREDIBLE and had me in tears alone. I believe it really captured the essence of what America's men actually went through.Although I am NOT a critic -- just an average movie lover, I went and saw Pearl Harbor 5 days after it's released; and obviously Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer did something right because I saw it 3 times after that and plan on seeing it again.</fullReview>

In this case one of the worst defeats ever delivered to an unsuspecting target.This movie is shallow and seems to actually enjoy being shallow. It takes no time to actually develop the people that we are supposed to actually care about.Heck I was more horrified when the ships were sunk and were suffering than I was when I saw the people in the water. There was no connection to them and to the sacrifice they were supposedly making.On the other hand, from a FX view and morbid curiosity stand point the actual explosion of the Az and the Okie turning turtle were stunning. Everything else was either trite, or treated the material as callous as WWII propaganda film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is basically "Titanic" recycled set during the time of the Pearl Harbor attack. It's from the director "Armeggedon" and "The Rock".So it's basically a "popcorn movie" which means very thin story/plot and special effects overkills.I will get into this movie as I'm sure others here have done enough reviews to cover this film. The story feels like a made for TV movie. It's running time is over 3 hours, so if you need to go the restroom,you did not miss much. The best part of the movie is the attack of Pearl Harbor. What I do not get is if "Saving Private Ryan"'s opening battle scene that last 20 minutes ,made it a "R" how could almost a hour of war make this movie "PG-13"?Wait for this at the cheap movie theater or the DVD and jump to the battle and avoid the rest of this movie!If you want to see "Titanic" recycled fine, you were warned it's a long 3 hours!! Otherwise wait for this movie on DVD or the cheap movie theater!!It's also good if you want to take a nap at the movie theater!!ZZZZZZ!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a terrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with low overall expectations, knowing that it was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer who I knew was somehow connected to "Armageddon", which I thought was an absolutely horrendous American patriotic bullcrap movie. I was hoping it would be pretty empty and bearable leaving me free to ignore it and enjoy the action scenes, which looked pretty impressive in the trailer.What I saw though, increased my distrust for any film connected to Hollywood more than after seeing "Armageddon" or "The Patriot". The glaringly formulaic scripting (and acting) of the love story left me gasping in amazement at how unpicky (and dare I say unintelligent) Americans have become when watching movies, knowing how much it's making, and especially after reading the numerous "This is the best, most touching movie I've ever seen!" reviews on this site. I simply cannot grasp how anyone could be touched by the predictable clichés deployed to give the film an "epic", deep outfit. It was just so silly, it reminded me of the stories you expect from cheap paperback novels and daytime tv soaps. I could have bared it if only a small percentage, say less than 75% of the film, were pure love-story. After all it's hollywood, and it's a blockbuster. But what shocked and angered me was how seriously it took itself, as if the director and scriptwriters really felt they were creating art. There were no unpredictable twists, the acting was cold with no chemistry between the actors, and music is employed ALL THE TIME in an attempt to control our emotions. Real movies don't need constant orchestral mood-changing music, they manage to convey feelings to the audience by using picture and dialogue.Now for the other parts of the movie. I found the Pearl Harbor bombing sequence pretty impressive as I am easily impressed by special effects and cool sound in movies. But again I cannot understand how people can avoid seeing and being annoyed by the glaring clichés in the story. Sure, the Japanese did kick some American butt, everyone knows that from history books, so the filmmakers couldn't really change the hard facts. Instead they showed that at least they were actually better than the Japanese, as is shown in the idiotic dogfighting and retaliation bombing sequence, or the "simple cook shows that pure patriotism can help shoot down some Japanese planes" scene."One on one the Americans would have prevailed because they are better", the movie seems to say, because that's the patriotic feeling Americans have and the movie works at that level to make its countrymen like it. Americans that can't tell the difference between a movie that makes them cry a little and feel good about their country, and a movie that has genuine artistic qualities.Some say this is simply entertainment, but it annoys me and insults my intelligence when a movie takes itself as seriously while being so glaringly made for the sole purpose of making money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overkill is the word for Pearl Harbor. Pity!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, Disney knows one thing very well, and that is trivialising and sentimentalising a story and presenting even the most tragic events as if it's another happy day for Lassie. This works in Lassie, or in Free Willy, when we see the relationship between a poor animal in danger and a poor, lonely, but gifted kid. However, this same Disney formula that worked with many films made Pearl Harbor a total flop. Its subject is one of the most tragic events in World War II and never understands what it is talking about. It tells us the story of a pilot with dyslexia and his best friend with an awful background narrative, puts in a love triangle which doesn't make one want to know what will happen next as we already may guess what's to happen from the 10th minute of the film. Besides, as it's Disney, we know that one has to die, and bravely so that the remaining friend gets the girl as he already deserved. The story that tells us about the real event is very poorly told as if it's not a $270m production but a high-school drama on very limited resources and which can't be bold enough to say the things it might actually want to say. So, we keep wondering why the President is first uninterested then becomes too involved in a Japanese attack on the Pacific, we don't understand whether the character played by Mr. Aykroyd is there to show the human side of events or how his incompetence caused the loss of many soldiers' lives in Pearl Harbor, we don't see why the colonel played by Mr. Baldwin is actually joking about shirts when nearly his entire fleet is bombed to dust and so on. Thus, the script sucks. Acting, though names are good and great, is second-rate, with the exception of Cuba Gooding, jr., who surely is cast to have some African-Americans watch the film. However, I'm not sure if he or anyone really undertstood what his part is about: A black cook fights for respect, and then gets caught in the battle and sees his captain die and tries to shoot some Japanese fighter planes and fails. This doesn't really make one want to go and hug African-Americans or weep for what a brave transformation this man experienced. That we see his boxing opponent while trying not to drown doesn't make anything any better, either, as it seems to say `See, this bulky guy wasn't good at the ring and isn't good at saving himself and his mates from death, either. Failure once,...' The romantic scenes are as if they are from a primary school skit, so I'm not bothering to talk on them. The scenes at the hospital when things go mad made me feel disoriented from the film with all those stupid games with light exposure, that thing didn't work on Traffic, doesn't work here, won't work anywhere else, directors should just stop doing this. Besides, dialogues were shabby, most characters were cartoonish, and although there were some Disney moments when one wanted to weep for the heroes' friendship, the whole bunch of characters failed to impress me. And, that's the worst part, really: You don't want to be absorbed in the story of characters that don't affect you. The love theme in Titanic was as bad if not worse than this one, but Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet made us watch the film with their brilliance. Here, however, it can't be done because Ben Affleck isn't actually a good leading actor, and Josh Hartnett is nowhere near a Ryan Phillippe or Leo DiCaprio so that we may feel the need to devote ourselves to his character's story. What we have here is a couple of farmboys who love the same nurse and who know to do one good number on air, risking their lives and the resources of the country. Had the leads been, say, Ryan Phillippe and Jonathan Brandis, instead of Affleck and Hartnett, things might be far different as their auras would make the film watchable and perhaps enable it to profit. In addition, I must admit I am surprised to see Kate Beckinsale who was brilliant in Shooting Fish to be this motionless, motiveless, looking either depressed or bored all through the film. To sum it up, although the battle scenes were spectacular (despite one feels the CGI effects every now and then) and the cast was full of well-known actors, the film is a case of overdosing of many a stories into one. This formula had worked in Braveheart that Randal Wallace had also written because Sir William Wallace and his alter-ego Mel Gibson were full of charisma, but it miserably fails this time as the film suffers from the overkill effect. It might have been a far better movie with an hour or more of it cut out. It would have been good if we knew the names of the other pilots rather than that of the nurses, if we followed the stories of the two friends who believe in fighting for their country and the good of humanity, and had the film centred on the attack and the Washington DC events; not on the lousy love story which made me look for a sick-bag at times. I felt really bad about this film as I had some hopes as it tells a strong historical story and I liked Ben Affleck as an actor. I must say, I'm gravely disappointed at the end. For those who might like this one, I very strongly recommunend to see Enemy at the Gates as it was the best war film with a romance sub-theme. Pearl Harbor's director and actors and producers should watch it and weep in shame after they see how the scenes of war that can touch the very heart of the audience can be filmed and what good acting is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best drama/action movies I've seen in a long time. The movie critics suck. I don't trust them anymore. Before I saw this movie I heard it really stunk from what the critics said. Months before when I saw the previews it looked like it was just going to be a plain good movie so I wanted to see it. Than I heard the critic reviews. I didn't want to see it anymore. I went to the theatre anyway and saw it. I came out of the theatre and said that this movie is worth three hours. The acting is great. The plot is great. Surprisingly the love story was needed. Without the love story the movie would of been a piece of trash. During the bombing scene the special effects is awesome. Rafe and Danny make great best friends. The good thing about the love story is that there is not a lot of argueing between Danny and Rafe. There may have been a few punches though. They got the right person to play the girl. Thank God the love story wasn't like Titanic. In Titanic the love story was absolutely pointless and had nothing to do with the sinking. Titanic was so overrated. Anyways, about Pearl Harbor, it was a great movie, realistic, etc. I can't wait to see it on DVD. I'll give Pearl Harbor 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it wasn't that bad. I was expecting an awful movie because of the comments found in this database. Before I walked in the cinema I was worried about the love story because I hate when movie makers insert stupid love stories into would-be good movies. I think the love story in the Titanic was more stupid than the one on Pearl Harbor. I hated the love story in the Titanic, I think it was very silly.I enjoyed Pear Harbor despite all the negative comments I have read before. I was ready to leave the cinema if the movie became unbearable but instead I found myself enjoying it. The action part, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, was fantastic and very real. As I said, the love story was bearable but I hated the scene when this couple make love at the air base. That was really an stupid setting for making love, specially totally naked. Definitely this movie won't be nominated for the Oscars. I think the director lost a great opportunity to make a better movie with all that money. I gave a score of 7 to this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>9 on a scale of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor was a visually stunning movie. Fantastic special effects, brilliant colors and wonderful to look at - as most movies set in Hawaii are. But, to imply these qualities are the sole - or even primary - reason to see the movie would be grossly misleading.First and foremost it is an education about what brought us into WWII and it is told in a way I have never seen and rarely heard. The educational aspect alone was worth the price of admission.Secondly, and most rewarding, it is the story about a woman and the two men in her life, their relationships, trials and, ultimately, their tragedies. This is a marvelous love story that has several chaotic twists - symbolic of the times. Even their hearts were at the mercy of events far beyond their control.Lastly, the movie was an awe-inspiring war movie. Bigger than life. Nothing can prepare you for how shocking (even to this day) it is to see American ships lined up like fish in a barrel and knowing that at any moment the lives of everyone there - and the lives of everyone around the world would be changed forever. The sudden and intense level of carnage was visually and emotionally played out on the screen in such a way as to permanently implant it on our minds - much as Saving Private Ryan did with the beach landing.I can only think of a couple criticisms of the movie and they are fairly minor. One criticism worth mentioning is that they could easily have shaved 30-40 minutes from the 3 hours and still maintained the level of intensity.Also, the Cuba Gooding character was one of the most extraneous add-ons I have ever seen in a movie. He had nothing to do with the other 90% of the movie we saw. His 10% was in its own world. I don't doubt that the reason it was there was to make sure the message of Pearl Harbor was that there were heroes - white AND black. But, either they should have tied it in better or left it out.Still, as I say, my criticisms are minor. The story was an epic tale in the scope of the Titanic. Better story, more action, superior acting and a visual masterpiece. Hard to beat. Glad I went.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pearl Harbor" tells the story of Rafe and Danny, two best friends who have grown to respect and love each other. Rafe has always treated Danny as sort of a younger brother, always looking out for his best interest. With America on the heels of World War II, the two enlist in the armed forces to fight for their country. Rafe meets a young and beautiful nurse, Evelyn, who he falls in love with. When Rafe chooses to go to England to fight the war in Europe, Danny vows to keep an eye on his best friend's love. But when an accident involving Rafe occurs, friendship and loyalty is put to the ultimate test. Soon, the characters find themselves locked at the turning point of the war: The battle at Pearl Harbor. Superficial? Yes, some elements of the film are indeed, not too flattering. Having seen any other kind of love story in the past, the so-called twists and surprises in the movie's plotline become all too predictable and quite frankly, unbearable to watch. With "Pearl Harbor", it's not a case of hindsight bias. Who lives, who dies, who ends up with who, etc. could be foretold by even the most clueless.Still, though, "Pearl Harbor" makes up for a lacking screenplay with its incredible battle scene, with reigns of deja vu ringing from "Titanic" and "Saving Private Ryan." While perhaps not as emotionally driven as the opening D-Day sequence in "Saving Private Ryan," the 40-minute Japanese dogfight scene will earn its position as one of the most memorable scenes from a war movie. Director Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer shifted their focus to the recreation of the drama, tension, and reality of Pearl Harbor, an aspect that journalists have become too critical about. With the two having collaborated on "Armageddon" and "The Rock," it is obvious that these two know exactly how to put together a film that would please an audience. "Pearl Harbor" is not a classic, not an epic, nor even an Academy Award contender. It is, instead, an exciting wartime film, fit for an ever-growing generation seeking that special cinematic pleasure. </fullReview>

First of all i do not think that love and war go together, and even if they should do i think that a triangle love story is getting a little to far. And why could not the movie just end after the Pearl Harbor attack? why did i have to see the doolittle attack? i mean...comon..the name of the movie is Pearl Harbor not "the Dolittle attack". One more thing thats bothering me is the American patriot theme which is always seen in movies now days (Patriot, airforce one, U-571 and a whole bunch of war movies) cant they just give me a break? i live in sweden and i am not interessted in americas patriot messages!

		<fullReview>The only reason I stuck it out through the entire film was my brother and I had the theater to ourselves. For three hours, we sat and watched one of the worst big budget films ever made. The story was even stupid by summer blockbuster standards (you want me to believe Ben Affleck fought the Germans, spent three months in occupied France, suddenly appears in Hawaii, fights the Japanese, bombs Tokyo. . .geez, why not have him piloting the Enola Gay at the end?). The writing was miserable. The whole thing was shot like they were looking for 15- to 30-second snippets for commercials. And Jon Voight. . . just when I thought he'd never bottomed out more than he did in Mission: Improbable, he comes up with the worst portrayal ever of a U.S. President. All those years I thought of FDR as dignified, now I'm stuck with this image of a bumbling, uneasy fool. If it's not the Gideons, it's the Japs, eh? Career advice for Bruckheimer and Bay: stick to what you know. I'll take the plot holes and ridiculous ideas in The Rock, Con-Air, Armageddon, etc., just so I can get big screen action. Leave the love stories to people who know how to tell them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every frame looks like the cover of a magazine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really didn't want to see Pearl Harbor but I really liked it. I think the reason was that it was less of a Saving Private Ryan style hardcore war movie (although it had aspirations as such) and more of a summer popcorn flick. I liken it to sci-fi war movies like Independence Day and Starship Troopers (especially the latter). What I liked about it was that it made me appreciate the artistic side of filmmaking. The time and the effort which has been lavished on this movie makes every single frame look suitable for the cover of a glossy magazine. Some of the images from this movie would hang proudly on a wall. Its a mega budget flick, which shows you how much advertising and music video making has influenced cinema in the last ten years. Michael Bay made his debut with Bad Boys, and set the style which has been utilised in most every Jerry Bruckheimer film since, but he was following in the footsteps of Tony Scott. The Last Boy Scout and True Romance (as well as his earlier collaborations with Bruckheimer) all introduced elements of different styles of filmmaking, which included not only ads and vids but also Hong Kong flavourings which have since become the norm. Films like Pearl Harbour make me think about cinema in this way and it gets me excited. I love different movies for different reasons and I love this as art. Beats the crap out of Titanic, probably because it's more manly. I also thought how much Josh Hartnett looks like Jan Michael Vincent from TV's Airwolf, who in turn looks like Charles Bronson. They all have thin eyes which make them look like their looking into the sun constantly. I also thought that Jon Voight was really good, I could not believe this was the same man who hammed it up in Anaconda.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am surprised and shocked how many uneducated people are out there. This film, I must say, was a refresher. Sure it was glamorized, but you can make out the efforts they made not to stray from a good story, and a good war. I must say I walked in expecting another rubbish flick like Titanic, but was extremely well satisfied by the wonder that laid before me for the best three hours of my life. This shouldn't by classified as a movie, but as a event.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War = Entertainment???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got out of Pearl Harbor and, after already reading negative critics, I have to say that it`s worse than I have expected. Maybe because I´m European and not that pro-American (do I have to be?), I´m looking in an not that naive way on American history. After reading the great (American!) book "Lies my teacher told me" by James W. Loewen I have an impression how poorly the Americans deal with their own history and with the history of other nations. Pearl Harbor is just another example because it leaves out important facts and simply does not tell the true story. This movie is not controversial - as in my opionion a war movie should be - it just confirms the view of the general American audience. I heard that director Michael Bay said in an interview that he tried to treat the Japanese fairly and to make the audience understand why they attacked. Well, how he showed the Japanese (threatening, emotionless except some scenes, but in general, they´re the BAD!) confirms once more the image that the standard American has - the Japs are evil! By the way - during the attack on Tokyo show at the end of the movie - the Americans killed about 10 times as much people than the Japanese killed at Pearl Harbor. These are just the relations - the film does not show the terror and fear the Japanese people felt. Pearl Harbor lets the audience feel that that attack was right and that the Americans had the right to kill! I think the only wise sentence of the movie is spoken out by the Japanese admiral who says "A brilliant man will find a way not to fight a war." - this is so right for both the Japanese and the Americans. After all, all the comedy and the jokes made the film seem so ridiculous. I just cannot imagine that in the horror of war, someone can behave in such a way. A war film cannot be entertaining. I recommend the book "Empire of the Sun" by James Graham Ballard, and the film based on the novel by Steven Spielberg. It shows how war in the Far East was for millions of Chinese, Japanese, English and American: it was a war without good or bad and without any heroes. It was merely a fight for survival.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the Critics- prepare to be impressed (and bring a hanky)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may be a Bruckheimer production and that single point made me cringe, but he produced and stayed away from the director (apparently). Yes, some historical facts are juxtaposed, but so what? Even the much "docu-drama-ballyhooed "Tora! Tora! Tora!" wasn't perfect and is rather drab and boring. This tale surrounds 3 people but they are the adhesive for linking a backdrop that quickly overtakes that subplot at the right moments. The 1st 45 minutes are worth admission price and that is BEFORE the attack. The Japanese sequences are more minimal than maybe I'd have liked and seem to be more of a lesser budget expenditure- but hey! This story is involving the attack vice the planning- for that, see "Tora!". That opening 45 minutes is about the bond between two friends and the warfare that draws one away from the other- it's great friendship stuff. The two kids through to adulthood is fun: getting a plane airborne as runts to doing daredevil maneuvers in fighter training school (which of course plays during the attack later on).This is THE film that shows what CGI should be all about: creating what isn't any more. "Jurassic Park" did it too- but can we really relate? Modern times that are extinct due to the on-slaught of human history should be recreated. Maybe then we can get the damned concept across: war is NOT good or divine or ultimately better. Someone once said (referring to the Viet Nam war peace talks) that so what if we sat forever at negotiating tables- it beat killing one another. Well, maybe next round of talks at the next conflict, people should see this movie and the opener of "Saving Private Ryan". Maybe then they'll get the clue- There are moments during the attack that are frightful, yet stunning for the ability to thoroughly convince that we are seeing the real thing. For a plane buff as myself- just the footage of A6M's ("Zeroes") flying by is majestic. Seeing the Arizona lifted out of the water as the lower-deck munitions go up in a singularly massive explosion is traumatizing to the point of exhaustive sadness. The attack on 7 December 1941 was a sneak attack, a cheap attack, and a very far eastern attack. It should not be accepted as though it were a product of it's day. But it shouldn't be forgotten- ever. The film reminds us that man and machine can bring horror and fascination. Humans that strive to entertain and enlighten as those who manufactured this film ARE of a breed different from that day. I don't see any of them doing this just for the paycheck though- it's a message and an entertainment movie. The performances are good and solid and yes, some may call this a "guy's" film but the women doing double, even triple duty as the mavens of life-saving deserve the honors shown here- they too fought the good fight and are all-too-often not recognized in war epics. I was glad to see that here. I wasn't however glad to see the technique utilized to show hospital horror- it DIDN'T work. It just didn't. I thought that the projection equipment was malfunctioning. How ridiculous- in the midst of presenting with the finest effects material ever achieved, the focus goes nutso and I began to wonder if that was LSD the counter kid placed on my popcorn. Dumb. Just dumb. However I didn't let that ruin the film- taking the story out to the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, the first retaliatory move by the US some 4 months later was good and awesome in it's light manner of saying that the U.S. was ready and going to demonstrate that we were ready to fight that good fight. Seeing the B-25's swooping down over Yokusuka's factories was simply breathtaking- it became believable that we'd actually filmed it all.This is a human film about the worst and best of humans- 3 times only are foul words said (and two of them were "SOB's")- and the worst was out of what is SURELY to be a nominated performance by John Voight as President Roosevelt. His is a great role- as are many. I must put in a plug for Mako as Yamamoto- his performance translates the reluctance to wake the sleeping dragon known as America of this sad military career man very well.Don't wait to see this on a small screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS!!!!After sitting at the theater for 3 hrs and 15 mins, I have been amazed and depressed at the end. Knowing that Josh Hartnett was going to died at the end before I ever seen the movie was a bit of a spoiler to me, but it didn't stopped the feelings I felt when he died. It was so sad...I was hysterically crying my eyes out!!! After the movie, I start to daydream. I was sitting in my car waiting as my dad drove home. I was thinking, "What if Rafe was the one who landed second and Danny was the one who were attacked by the Japanese soldiers? Then Rafe would be the one dead...and I started to find an ending to the movie if Rafe die." And then I retrace back to Danny.I guess the writers lets Danny died because his death would have a bigger ending and the audiences would cried even more than Rafe's death (basically). The whole relationship between Evelyn, Danny, and Rafe was just a big misunderstanding. If only Evelyn wasn't pregnant w/ Danny's baby then I would really think she would of gotten back together w/ Rafe. The whole drama at Pearl Harbor and the problems with the Japanese were really interesting. Watching this movie, I felt liked I wanted to be part of the war and if there were ever a war in our time, I would volunteer because watching this movie was so so sad plus it was very entertaining. Basically what I'm trying to say is that this is a absolute best movie I have ever watch!!! At the beginning I was kinda of bored at how the characters develop and the storyline grew. But when the Japanese invaded Pearl Harbor I was so into it that I was so feeling every emotion, tragic, and pain. And I thought that this movie was so much better than the Titanic's scene when the ship was sinking. "Pearl Harbor" created a strong powerful feelings/visual that I felt during the movie. When Danny died, I was so sad because I knew he was going to died, but I didn't knew how. If only if the Chinese came earlier then Danny would of kept his life. You could say that Danny save Rafe's life when he was landing and shot those Japanese, but.....if Rafe hadn't destroy his position when Danny's plane crash, I would think this movie would have another turn out. This movie brings out alot of joy, pain, and sadness. The ending was terrific. Danny's death was a perfect plan for how the movie was to end. I give this movie an A+ for every category. Better than Gladiator don't you think!!!??!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought it was stupid of the film producers to compare their film with Titanic all the time. Titanic is terrible, in my opinion. But after I have watched the movie, I found that two films are really comparable... they simply suck! However, if Titanic can get 40 marks, Pearl Harbor may well get only 10. The war scenes are good on average but they fail to carry the audience away for long. The latter part of the film is boring! The cheesy love story gets on my nerves... I would say the story between Jack and Rose sounds more convincing... Don't ever dream about getting any Oscars, but do prepare for getting some Golden Raspberry. An unbeatable epic? Hey, it's time to get up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Pearl Harbor was a terrific movie. The actors did a great job of bringing the love story and entire movie to life. Bruckheimer and Bay make an awesome team. The attack of Pearl Harbor was so tastefully done and wasn't too over the top, just right. Also, the creators have to be credited for giving a somewhat objective and not a "we resent you" attitude and look towards the Japanese. I was a big Titanic fan and didn't think any movie could come close to or beat it. However, I believe Pearl Harbor is a huge blockbuster, ranking right up there with Titanic. Hans Zimmer composed some beautiful music for the movie's soundtrack. Faith Hill's song reflects the attitude of the whole movie. To me, the difference between Pearl Harbor and Titanic, the difference that makes Pearl Harbor better to me, is the various movie genres it represents. There's action, (war), drama, powerful love story, and portrayal of an historical event. The love story doesn't get too intense and is just enough to make it a powerful love story. This movie can't be said to be a chick flick because of these various aspects. Titanic was a chick flick because the love story consumed the whole movie, even during the sinking. Regardless of what the critics say or what others may say about this</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant surprise, considering...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film with low expectations. Critics had slammed it, for one, and Bay tends to make rather hollywood'ish movies. That said, there *were* some crappy lines in the script, but I am forced to disagree with most of what I've read from critics about it being too long and tedious. Character development was more than sufficient, acting was good, and the story was fine (ala Cameron's "add a romance to a real-life tragedy" scenario theory).What made this movie work, though, was Bay's mind's eye. One thing that can't be disputed is the fact that he can make a damn good looking film. The movie is long, but didn't feel like it; it's quick-paced (mostly). And it's just plain beautiful. I gave an 8 out of 10. Armageddon was prettier but vastly stupid. This is a very well done film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As i say above, this is really only worth seeing for the attack itself which just about tops Titanic in the effects department. (In one small scene it just about tries to replecate it with the sinking of the US Arizona). I still have yet to find anything to top Saving Private Ryan or Thin Red Line on this score, but a very commendable effort.But the rest of the film severely lets it down. The love triangle is very clumsy and overcooked. Cuba Gooding Jr couldnt have played cornball any better if he'd tried. Although the score is a great piece of music you just know it was designed to try and crank up the emotional aspect and eek out a few more tears. Put simply, cut from its three hours to a leaner two hour all out actioner would have been wise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even before "Pearl Harbor" was released, I knew that it was more of a love story than a WWII Docu-drama, so I was not disappointed when I saw it. The film "Tora, Tora, Tora" still stands as the definitive telling of the historical tale, but "Pearl Harbor" managed to add more of the human side of the event. I'm not talking about the love triangle, but the people in general who were caught up in the attack, particularly in the hospital which had been so quiet (and empty) on December 6. The historical inaccuracies were minor and I'm not sure why the need was felt to take poetic license, but the fundamentals are correct. With a bit more thought and care this might have been a great film, but it is still worth a trip to the theater.</fullReview>

Just as in Pearl Harbor, the love story was as if it was added at the last minute. It was totally predictable &amp; boring. I didn't get into it at all. I felt nothing for the characters. The only emotion I felt was for the soldiers who lost their lives in that battle. I believe this movie did them a disservice.

		<shortDescription>Drop a Bomb on This!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the outset, I will readily admit I went into the screening of PEARL HARBOR with minimal expectations. Mister Bay's previous films were pure popcorn munching, "check-your-brain-at-the-door and watch things go BOOM" summer blockbusters that were not to be taken seriously (The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon, etc). Still, I was not prepared for the 3 hours of utter dreck I sat through. The film is nothing more than the worst "I'm going to war" cliches strung together with wince-worthy dialogue, shot with the sheen of a prettily produced television commercial for cotton, life insurance or oatmeal.Now, I'm perfectly willing to allow for a certain amount of hokey cornball dialogue in any gung-ho period war flick, but the onslaught of poor line readings of pure cheese was too much for my ears to bear. Affleck turns in a performance that makes use of a rather ridiculous hick accent (as does Hartnett) that is implausible at best. While Affleck has done some decent work (in Good Will Hunting, Boiler Room and Shakespeare in Love), perhaps those shoulders aren't quite wide enough to carry a big, noisy Hollywood offering just yet. Both Affleck and Hartnett seem to be little more than eye-candy for the teenage girls hoping for a TITANIC-like fix. Those pilots sure were pretty, but other than nice haircuts, they don't offer much else. Kate Beckinsdale does do a convincing American accent; if only she had been given lines to read that had been worth repeating.The "romance" storyline makes TITANIC's look like GONE WITH THE WIND. The highlight of silliness is when two of the characters run into an airplane hangar where scores of parachutes are hanging from the ceiling (had they been freshly dry cleaned?). As the couple lose themselves among the softly hit gauzy cotton parachutes, one chute has handily already been laid on the floor at the center of the room. As the duo fall all over each other, and the streaming parachutes sway gently back and forth, one begins to taste whatever was for lunch earlier that day. The viewer must wade through nearly an hour and a half of such horrible "romantic" muck to get to the actual bombing of Pearl Harbor. Please do not misunderstand me; I do like romantic films (like Bridges of Madison County, Doctor Zhivago, and so on), but most daytime soap operas pull off better storylines and chemistry than the triangle at the center of PEARL HARBOR.The bombing of Pearl Harbor is done reasonably well, but the impact and the horror of the event is minimal. Squeezing the film into a PG-13 rating must have required the removal of nearly all visible wounds. One character is apparently killed in a bomb blast, but there is no trace of blood, or even dirt on that person's body. Hospital scenes depicting the carnage of the wounded are shot with a blurred, out of focus style that may pass for "the POV of the nurses", but is really just the director trying to remove any unsightly gore that may upset people (and garner an "R" rating). At one point, many soldiers are seen trudging towards the hospital, presumably horribly wounded and suffering. In fact, they more closely resemble a bedraggled team returning from a rugby match, covered in mud and oil.Articles about this film has skewered the inaccuracies that abound through the film, so I will only mention one. FDR stands up! No canes, no crutches, no podium or table top for support, no handlers at his sides! It truly was the age of miracles! This was a shame, since the makeup for Jon Voight was rather convincing, but this scene shattered any credibility the performance (or film, for that matter) may have had. Actually, it may very well be the funniest film moment of 2001!In conclusion, I can only say this. PEARL HARBOR may be my most painful film-going experience over the last year and a half. You want war-torn romance, see CASABLANCA. You want gut wrenching war scenes, see SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. You want to spend your movie-going dollar wisely, don't see PEARL HARBOR.</fullReview>

Followed by some big loud noises and bright colours, followed by more people kissing.ACTING: The only good ones are the smaller parts like Jon Voight and Cuba Gooding Jr (who when used with the word "underused" would very well be the biggest understatement in history) though Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale (I can't remember how many people have asked who she is but it's a lot) Josh Harnett and Alec Baldwin (in one of the smaller roles) are all stinkers in this movie.DIRECTING: Michael Bay, nuff said.WRITING: It's written by the writer of Braveheart. So you'd expect something good. Well with material like this you'd have to be forgiven for thinking it was written by the writer of Armageddon or even those annoying 5 minute cartoons you see on ABC (Australian Broadcasting Channel)RATING: Well so far there have been 3 terrible movies this Summer.

		<fullReview>This film was organised all wrong. They could have done without the *whole* Tokyo attack, and probably large sections of the Pearl Harbour attack. The SFX were amazing, but after an hour of relentless action and destruction, it gets too much, and I could see people in the cinema fidgeting and getting restless. The Cuba Gooding Jnr character was interesting but utterly pointless, just a token black character. The love triangle had potential, but they made the fatal mistake of making Danny seem nicer than Rafe, and I ended up rooting for the wrong couple although it was painfully obvious what was going to happen. Evelyn and Rafe seemed to fall in love for no reason, whereas Danny and Evelyn had a basis to their relationship. Aside from anything else, Rafe was cocky and arrogant and fairly unlikeable next to Danny.From a British perspectice, I must admit that it was a lot fairer to the British soldiers and victims of the Blitz when compared to fiercely patriotic and propagana-ish films like U5771 or Saving Private Ryan. I must admit that I chuckled during the final sick-making "God Bless America and all who sail in her" speech which, ironically, was delivered by a British actress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people that I have talked to about this movie all thought it moved too slow, the plot was too predictable, etc. Well, I for one, enjoyed it immensely. We all know the ending - that Japan was going to bomb the hell out of us, so because the plot is obvious in that respect, there has to be something more to the movie, and there is in this case - a love story and the relationship between two best friends.I've also heard comments from people how its similiar to Titanic - well, no, not really. In Titanic, its JUST a storybook love story..an upperclass woman forbidingly falls in love with the poor boy and then, oh no, the ship's going to sink now and I better love you forever. blah. In Pearl Harbor, there's so much more to it. A sinking ship is vastly different from WAR. You can't even begin to compare the two. These guys are risking their lives for the good of our country, not running around on ocean liners. So I think it's a helluva lot better than Titanic...and I really don't know where people saw the relationship (I mean..... come on... war and ocean liners?!?!)The graphics and war violence in this movie are great, the acting is mediocre, but it's really a heartfelt movie and demonstrates how powerful war is and how it tears people apart.Trust me.

		<shortDescription>If you liked ARMAGEDDON . . . (count how many times I say "garbage!")</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on hype and curiosity, this was THE movie to see this year in my opinion. And then I saw it. Then I left feeling ripped. Ben Affleck has not been seen much since that mess of a movie over a year ago, REINDEER GAMES. The other lead actors have just been getting their feet wet. And smack in the middle of this three hour big booming extravaganza is a whopping 45-50 minutes of special and computer generated effects. Full of the same fluff that made ARMAGEDDON one of the big summer movies of 1998, PEARL HARBOR uses pretty much the same conflict in its love story (man versus man with woman in the mix) and its big major event (a catastrophe and Americans are going to get them back). The main difference should be Japan should be portrayed a bit more different than an asteroid. In most ways, the country is not. The movie to compare this to, TORA! TORA! TORA!, definitely had more punch than this soft, sorry movie. PEARL HARBOR is a sad effort in displaying what was regarded as the second biggest event in the 1900's according to my local paper. Everything was, as I feared, over done, over blown and completely redundant.Childhood friends Rafe and Danny grow up to be crazy fly boys for the Army Air Force. Rafe meets a nice nurse named Evelyn, yet instead of going to Pearl Harbor with his new woman, he volunteers to go to Britain and join the Allies in opposing the Nazi. Danny goes to Pearl Harbor as well and fate brings Evelyn and him together. Perfect timing for Japan is just about attack.Completely redundant doesn't begin to describe it now that I'm thinking about it more. More like garbage. Of a special saving grace to PEARL HARBOR, unlike TORA!, the movie update actually was able to show the capsizing of a battleship. Other than that nifty trick, everything shown on PEARL HARBOR was far more overblown than I thought possible. Two missiles from under water seemed to spark fire and explosion on top of the ship. The special effects are what people paid twelve dollars to see. They should have saved us a few bucks and hours of our lives recreating the entire Pearl Harbor attack and the United States' counter attack than adding the garbage they call a love story. They also should have saved some more time out of ours and Cuba Gooding 's life by leaving Dorie Miller 's story out of it. I enjoyed his moments more in TORA! than this garbage. When sailors are getting shot at and we follow the movements of a dog, we know where PEARL HARBOR, the movie, is going and nobody deserves to be subject to watching this garbage. If you want a good war movie, rent TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH, want an OK one, get PORK CHOP HILL, want ARMAGEDDON: PART 2, complete with a terrible love story (writing credit: same guy who did Brave Heart ?!?!?!)rent PEARL HARBOR.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film does not have the inspiration or perseverance like other war movies. **1/2 (out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PEARL HARBOR / (2001) **1/2 (out of four)"Pearl Harbor" does not have the inspiration or perseverance like other war movies. It owes more to "Titanic" than most war films, however. The film makes the mistake of incorporating the events of Dec. 7, 1941 into an obvious, familiar love triangle. That worked with "Titanic" because its love story was convincing and passionate. "Pearl Harbor" feels labored, strained, and we can predict every twist and turn a mile away."Pearl Harbor" is yet another victim of commercialization. It's the kind of movie that tries so hard to please everyone, it feels contrived. The filmmaker's were under strict orders to keep the material PG-13; obviously the producer's thought an R-rating would keep its target audience away from the big screen. That has not been the case for other recent war movies like "Saving Private Ryan," "The Thin Red Line," or even "Three Kings." Granted, with its hot young cast and customary love story, this film clearly aims for an under 25 crowd. It is very depressing to see studios sacrificing their cinematic art for the MPAA's often ridiculous standards.The filmmaker's changed the movie so that it would not offend other areas of the world. Although the alterations were very minor, it is a disgrace that the studio actually dubbed dialogue to please certain audiences. This action shows how gutless these filmmakers are. They also submit to the usual audience pleasers-in the first ten minutes, the film already displays sappy emotions, failed attempts at humor, easy to swallow dialogue, and music that determines the mood of the scenes. There is even one of those mournful goodbye scenes at the end where one character pleads "stay with me," as the dying character states his final request to "take good care of [name here]."The major subject of the film is an American love story centering on two childhood friends named Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett). They enter the Army Air Corps where Rafe falls in love with a nurse named Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale). Rafe is called to duty in another country. Soon after he leaves, the reports print he is dead, leaving the scene to Danny. A few months pass and before we know it, Danny and Evelyn are under the covers. What happens next comes to the surprise of nobody in the audience- (SPOILER) -Rafe is alive and comes back to America with visions of Evelyn in his mind. He is furious that his old best friend has fallen for his girl. This conflict really should have spent more time on the emotional struggle Evelyn experiences-but instead leads to predictable bar fights and shouting matches. Then those pesky Japanese go and drop bombs on Pearl Harbor, interrupting this bamboozling love triangle.The historic aspects of this movie are also quite cloudy. There is no sense of history or strategy. Did Japan attacked Pearl Harbor because America cut off its oil supply, and they were down to an 18 month reserve? Would war restore their fuel reserve? At the end of the movie, where Jimmy Doolittle's Tokyo raiders crash-land in China, Japanese patrols attack them. Why are there Japanese in China? There is a brief explanation that the Sino-Japanese war was already underway. As a critic, however, I am all for filmmakers taking creative liberties with a historic account. The events in this film do not have to take place exactly how they really happened.The casting of Ben Affleck was a mistake. He is not an actor who can inject instant chemistry into his characters. The film does not give him enough time to develop any charisma, so the casting directors should have gone with a more versatile actor. Josh Hartnett is fit for his role, however. He does a good job with the limited material. Beckinsale, beautiful and lush, is also quite the treat. Hartnett and Beckinsale blossom from an involving chemistry, making Affleck's miscasting even more obvious. Unfortunately, neither male lead convincingly portrays his character with enough charm or affection for us to believe they are childhood best friends.I really liked the segments of the film where the Japanese conspired about the attack on Pearl Harbor. The film depicts them to be the smartest characters here; unfortunately, it also paints them as depressing, mournful individuals. They are people too. They can smile when they drop a bomb and hit a bull's-eye. "Pearl Harbor" tires so desperately to make the Japanese look grim and evil, it never really gives them enough dimension. Equally as interesting is the American suspicions of the Japanese attack. But the movie does not focus on these interesting aspects, instead buries itself in an ignorance and pride.Most war movies are developed, vivid, and intuitive. "Pearl Harbor" proves to be immature and childish. It certainly has a lot of fun with the attack, but that supplies us with yet another problem. Movies glorify almost everything they touch-many, many war movies can pride themselves in making war look graphic and disturbing; we want no part of it. While "Pearl Harbor" doesn't make war look fun, and I do not think it glorifies war, this movie is not repulsive in its illusion of war. This movie focuses too much on developing a sense of commercial satisfaction. The film's centerpiece is 40 minutes of redundant special effects, not a horrific account of the attack on "Pearl Harbor." This is more of an action movie, not an account of a major US military battle."Pearl Harbor" is one of the most anticipated movies of the year, arousing incredible audience interest with a budget of over $150 million. A lot of people will go see this film; it will most certainly be one of the biggest hits of the year. This is a simple special effects extravaganza-made with the intentions of grossing millions and millions of dollars-which probably explains why there are so many things wrong with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At over three hours it's easy to see why the critics don't like it - they get bored - humdrum script, lousy acting for much of it, formulaic and predictable (and hey - they didn't pay for it!). For the rest of us, it's sort of good value for money if you like cheese, explosions, a nice love song, enough extras to repopulate China, and an indication that someone has spent an awful lot of dosh making a BIG movie to keep you awake long enough to work through one of those extra humungously big cartons of popcorn. Who cares if it's quality or not? Titanic won lots of Oscars and the critics didn't like that either. Pearl Harbor isn't up to Titanic standards, but it at least aims at that sort of scale. There's LOTS of big warships, LOTS of hunky naval officers, LOTS of beautifully made-up nurses-in-waiting, and OODLES of lovey-dovey triangular 'dilemma' stuff. Plus it's really easy to follow (quick synopsis - Japs bomb Pearl Harbour and bring Americans into World War II - geddit?) If you need to exercise your brain or artistic aspirations go and see Miss Saigon or read a book. Or you can always check out the Movie Gaffs websites to see some of the continuity errors and play spot-the-gaffe. (The bit where Ben Affleck makes his nose bleed with a champagne cork is cute - each time the camera cuts to his face the blood is there or has vanished or is back again!) If you want to go to the movees with a few friends who really aren't into films, go and see Pearl Harbor - they'll all think you're great for taking them to see a nice big blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor Rocks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the length and historical inaccuracies, this movie is extremely enjoyable well worth the price of admission. It's a definite DVD movie (I'd buy it on DVD). The Storyline was strong and the Graphics were incredible. It truly kept me on the edge of my seat the entire way through. It was well balanced and showed amazing Acting from John Voit, Cuba Gooding Jr, among others. The movie, in no way, tried to be a historical documentary on Pearl Harbor, thus the inaccuracies displayed can easily be overlooked. It was good clean fun worthy of the budget spent on it. I rank it a 4 out of my personal 5 point scale.Now some people compare this to Titanic, saying that "it's trying to be another Love Story set in historical times". I have to disagree. For one thing, there was no "cheese factor" in it, which Titanic overflowed with. The whole story didn't revolve around the romantic situations going on with the three main characters. And, quite possibly the most important...This one didn't make me fall asleep. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes a decent "Hero" movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible movie worth seeing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would recommend this movie to anyone. I think this movie is worth the price of admission. However, I would warn anyone who is about to see this movie that this is a bad movie. There is no question about it. This movie is contrived, bereft of inspiration and originality, laughably cliché, mawkish, under edited, and worst of all it is a testament to bad dialogue.You never for a moment believe the love story involving Rafe and Evelyn. Rafe (Ben Affleck) seems to fall in love with Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) because she is beautiful. Evelyn seems to fall in love with Rafe because he is pathetically persistent and has a cute butt. There is no intelligent and substantial foundation for a romance. Instead of writing in the substance needed for a romance the movie tries to induce romance using dramatic music, slow motion, all sorts of romantic clichés. The effect is that the love story becomes nauseatingly mawkish. You don't believe me? In one scene Evelyn tells Rafe, `I will never be able to look at another sunset without thinking of you.'The second love story between Evelyn and Danny (Josh Hartnett) was a lot better yet it got a lot less time. The reasons they have for falling in love are a little more complicated and interesting. Strangely the best love story, the only one that moved me was the one involving Betty (James King) and a stuttering sailor. That got the least time.The dialogue is phenomenally bad. Throughout the movie I kept wondering how a professional writer could possibly produce such unnatural, cliché-ridden dialogue. I suspect someone held a gun to Randall Wallace's head as he wrote the screenplay. Let me give you an example of a cliché. There is a scene in the movie where Evelyn runs to the train station at the last minute to find that Rafe is already on a train about to leave. The old lovers at the train station scene! Can you believe it? I couldn't. I started laughing. There were at least five points in the movie where the dialogue was so stunningly appalling it actually made me laugh out loud. Lawyers can be disbarred, doctors can lose their licenses, can't screenwriters be thrown out of the screenwriters guild? I am not exaggerating the dialogue in the screenplay is that bad.By now you are probably wondering why I would recommend a movie that has what I claim is probably one of the worst screenplays ever. I recommend this movie because the actual attack on Pearl Harbor is that good. You have to see it in a theater, just like you have to see the ship sink in `Titanic', or the battle scenes in `Saving Private Ryan.' The scenes allow you to see things so horrifying that you could never have imagined them. Before this movie I had read about the bombing of Pearl Harbor but I had never felt anything. ILM's brilliant work allowed me to experience what it's like to see people incinerated by bombs, to see sailors clinging to a sinking battleship, to see people being cut to pieces by strafing fighter planes. Now Pearl Harbor feels tragic to me and I have a new respect for the people who suffered through that atrocity.I recommend that anyone interested in this movie simply arrive about an hour late, just in time to see the bombing. After the bombing scene you should just run out of the theater as though it were being attacked by Japanese fighter planes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Bay's films always split people into two categories. They either like them, or hate them. One thing both parties can agree on is the fact that his films move. There is always a pan, a dolly, a zoom or some other camera trick that takes you farther than other films would. With Pearl Harbor, Bay takes you back to Dec. 7, 1941 and puts you there as the Japanese begin there attack. What leads up to the attack however, is a somewhat cliched first hour. We are introduced to Danny and Rafe, two Tennessee fly boys who have designs on the same nurse. We also are introduced to various other characters that enter into the grand scheme of things. Through this hour, we learn who they are, what they want from their lives and begin to make a connection with them. All of this may have been taken care in a little less time, but it's there on the screen, and like it or love it, it's not going anywhere. Once the attack on Pearl Harbor begins, the first hour fades into the background and you are thrust into the confusion, the horror and the insanity of the early morning attack. Planes dive in, strafing ships and people. Bombs scream through the sky and explode on their targets as the smoke gets thicker with each passing second. You witness the death of the Arizona, you watch as Dorie Miller mans a machine gun and opens fire on the attacking planes. You get caught up in the moment and you feel charged as the American forces retalliate against the Japanese. You then feel the pain and anguish as the wounded pour into the hospital and you see the fear in the faces of the nurses and doctors as they struggle to save their patients. True there may be some historical inaccuracies, and some facts may have been left out or combined into others. Overall, Pearl Harbor achieves what it's makers set out to do. They wanted to capture the essense of what it was like to be there on that day. In that regard, they have succeeded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor: What's up with it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been reading a lot of the current reviews, praising the film, while many bash it. I can understand and agree with some of the valid points that are brought up while nailing the film for numerous mishaps. I walked into the film with utterly low expectations after reading numerous reviews describing how weak the core of the film was and how awful this turkey really was. I found myself amazed after I walked out of the theater. It sounds like usual clichés you'd hear from anyone, but ever since that film began, m eyes were glued to the screen and for the next three hours straight. 3 hours have never gone faster in my life before. I had no back aches or body aches at all. This was the first film, as far back as I can remember that I saw in a theater without taking my eyes off the screen. I really loved this flick, and I was pleasantly surprised. I thought the film succeeded at all levels, yes yes, including the love story which was obviously Hollywood and cliched, but hey, it beats Titanic by a long shot! As I said before, the complaints brought up are valid. But all the documentaries I saw on Pearl Harbor looked exactly like the manner the film was made in, the veterans agree that the films accurate. Sure I'm sure the film's not accurate word-for-word, such as I don't believe that the Japanese sat down in one setting and planned the entire surprise attack out. But hey, you really want authenticity, see a documentary, and you will not find as many differences as you seeked out to do so. About the love story: Ok, remember Tora! Tora! Tora! It was interesting and all, but essentially, it was an empty hollow historical story. We need this love story and Hollywood characters to excel the story. But the love story does not bombard the premise of the film, unlike Titanic, which is the bombing. The relationship rather stays in the backdrop, not hogging the film time. The acting was fine; I liked the way numerous characters stepped in and out, like Cuba Gooding Jr's. If they had stayed longer, then the film would have become what many accuse it of. Story was fast moving, and timing was just fine. People say that the movie could have been cut an hour. Sure it would have been shorter, but there would have been no tension leading up to the attack, hence an entire part of the film would be missing. The movie is cliched, it is Hollywood, but what is everyone complaining about? Last time I checked, Titanic had cliched Hollywood written all over it, much worse than this, and everyone surprisingly loved it, including the critics, and it walked away with an entire 11 Oscars (Why that happened I'll never know). And I thought everyone likes Hollywood flicks! Films I thought were used by most as a tool of escapism, now all of a sudden, everybody's changing. You don't want Hollywood, then check out a great movie by the name of "Autumn Sonata" or Affliction. But if you want Hollywood, this is it! And there's nothing wrong with liking Hollywood type films! After all, all movies are made in Hollywood. But now everyone accuses this movie, for what reason? The critics make up false accusations like the film is "horribly historically inaccurate" or "a 2 hour movie made into a 3 hour movie" for one reason: they only hate this flick for the same reason they hated Gladiator: the public loves it. And for some reason, that gets to them, so they make up things like that mentioned above. Another reason people "say" they hate this film is because of the whole Bay/Bruckheimer production. I didn't like Armageddon or the Rock, but I didn't hold those against this for a simple reason anyone could notice: This isn't wither of those films. It's not a sequel, it's not a prequel and is not connected to either of those films in any way. Some people seem to have a hard time figuring that out, including the critics. Lately I've been disappointed by the numerous films that have been hailed by critics as a beautiful departure from our cookie-cutter movie era (I could list some examples, but I'd probably never stop). Don't get me wrong though. I agree with a lot of them. Thin Red Line is one of my favorite films, as are many underrated gems such as those from Paul Schrader, and many more. But I have had so many hopes crushed with praised films, so I find it relieving to see a film that would guarantee entertainment. But once again, I saw much more to this than just entertainment. This film is a great one, and though many may disagree, much better than the so-called "masterpieces", and a lot of films that have been hailed by the public and critics, such as Titanic. It's worth it. You want an "ultra-real non-phony Bay/Bruckheimer depiction of Pearl Harbor," see a random documentary, and you will, deny it or not, find similarities running parallel with that ad the film. But if you don't want a documentary and want a film that doesn't "have a cliched stupid romance," rent Tora! Tora! Tora! And in about 10 minutes you'll be gazing out the window. I, myself, being an avid film lover, was quite surprised at how this turned out to be. I understand the criticisms that the people who've seen the movie bring up, and can see why they thought that. But at least see the film if you plan to bash it.</fullReview>

Yes, it was very similar to Titanic in terms of scale, theme, and structure, but I felt that this was the superior film. The performances aren't subtle, but they evoke the era beautifully. When the inevitable assault begins, you know the kind of people that populated the 1940's because of the work that Affleck, Gooding, Baldwin, Hartnett, King, and Beckinsale have done. I'm sure that all of the flyboys and Navy nurses who served in Hawaii in 1941 were not as impossibly gorgeous as Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Hartnett -- but at some point, you gotta lighten up; it's only a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. I have anxiously awaited "Pearl Harbor" due to lack of interesting films released over the past couple of months. After the first 45 minutes, I was ready to walk out. A relentless string of close-ups on our 3 beautiful young stars made me dizzy. However, once the real action began, this became a film to appreciate. Director Michael Bay (Armageddon, The Rock) again proves a master at huge special effects. I felt sadness and sickness during the attack, as well as pride in the actions of the soldiers. I bought Jon Voigt as FDR and thought Alec Baldwin was fine as the hardass flight instructor. Veteran actor Mako had the necessary screen presence to pull off the portrayal of Admiral Yamamota, and I thought Dan Aykroyd provided nice work in his limited role. My tidbit on this one is to check out Toru Tanaka, Jr (son of the 60's and 70's professional wrestler)as the bouncer in the bar. Overall, breathtaking war scenes and 3rd rate love scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Listen to the Critics!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of Michael Bay or Jerry Bruckheimer (in fact, I usually laugh all the way through movies like Armageddon, The Rock, Independence Day, etc. at the sheer corniness of the dialogue and story.) I actively dislike most blow ?em up movies, and am generally a fan of dialogue driven movies. I went to see Pearl Harbor because of its awesome preview and to see the special effects. That's it. Going in, I had already heard how terrible the dialogue was and the weak plot, but Memorial Day got to me and I decided to risk my 5.50 at the matinee.Let me just say that I was VERY pleasantly surprised. (SPOILERS AHEAD!!) Maybe they caught me on a good day, but there was only one line of dialogue that I laughed out loud during, and it came from Ben Affleck during the bombing. `Just get me to a plane!' Or something like that. Like Ben's going to take on the Japanese army. But really, that was the only truly bad line that I spotted during the movie. Even lines that COULD have been corny, from some reason didn't strike me as such during this movie. Maybe it was the setup, the scenes, the directing?who knows? But the dialogue isn't as bad as everyone is saying (and trust me, I'm a stickler for dialogue) and is light years above the dialogue in Armageddon.People have complained about the weak plot in the love story. The central point of this film wasn't the love story. It was the bombing of Pearl Harbor, hence the title. Although, the title could have been (Ben and Josh save the day by shooting down 7 Japanese planes in) Pearl Harbor. Cheesy plot? Yes, absolutely, but for some reason it works. They needed something going on to build up to the bombing, nothing too deep or confusing, and they got it. They couldn't just start the movie with the bombing. We had to anticipate something, right? I actually liked the love story plot, even though it was reminiscent of a soap opera. (And I hated Titanic, by the way, so I'm not generally a fan of corny love stories.) As for the lack of historical information, well, most of us, if we were paying attention in high school, learned about the history behind World War II. Hollywood shouldn't have to spoon feed us information that we can get from any history book. If there wasn't enough for you, go to Barnes and Noble and buy a book. I'm sure there are plethoras about Pearl Harbor now. It was a movie, not a documentary, not a history lesson. We got information relative to the bombing, and that was all we needed, not a primer on World War II. If you need more, tune in to the History Channel. They've been running Pearl Harbor stories all week. I know some of the information was inaccurate, but it's a MOVIE! It wasn't supposed to be a documentary. People are complaining about leaving out the Nevada. The movie was 3 hours long as it was. They couldn't include everything. I think the desired effect was achieved. END OF SPOILERS!!The special effects are amazing. It was emotionally wrenching to watch the bombing of Pearl Harbor. If anything, I think this movie will provide a lot of people with some information that they didn't have before about Pearl Harbor. Education of the masses is always a good thing. As for the length, I thought the 3 hour running time of this movie flew by. All of the actors give wonderful performances, particularly Kate Beckinsale. I've never seen her in anything before this, but I'm a fan now. And Jon Voigt is great as FDR.I really have no complaints, except that Kate Beckinsale and Ben Affleck are both such good looking people that it's a little distracting at times. (Josh Hartnett's not bad, but I'm more of an Affleck fan.) Oh well. And that it's going to be months before I can own the DVD, which is sure to be packed with cool extras. Just don't listen to the critics on this one. I think that expectations outweighed being able to accurately judge what they really saw. You can't please all the people all the time, but I think Bay/Bruckheimer really did a great job with this movie. Sure, it's a little corny at times, but it's still an excellent movie. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Michael Bay,I saw Pearl Harbor this past Saturday and based on reviews and some word of mouth I was determined that your film would be a dog (very disappointing especially after some of the best trailers I have ever seen in the theatre). Well after sitting through the movie for 3 plus hrs I must say that it was not as bad as some people made it out to be. Sure the dialogue is a bit syruppy at times. Sure the romantic triangle seems a bit forced. Sure you do a disservice to Cuba Gooding and his character (a real life pearl harbor hero) by giving him a bit role (I'm assuming most of Cuba's lines will be in the Pearl Harbor DVD). And sure you bring smiles to the political correct fans by turning the Japanese into reluctant attackers (riiiiiight!!!). But Michael Bay, despite these flaws (there are several others) you created a film that kept me entertained for the duration with several scenes/lines (some intentionally funny - some accidentally funny) that I will spend the rest of the summer reciting to my friends along with 2 pretty intense battle/action sequences. And really, despite people howling about how there is no soul to your film or how the story stinks, this is really why everyone went to see the movie - to see the battle sequences - and these do not disappoint. So Michael I think your "sin" is not creating a storyline (much like in Titanic) that would make audiences feel better about going to watch a film about a huge disaster. As far as I'm concerned, you did pretty well and didnt feel the movie was half as bad as critics are making out. You and Bruckheimer keep making pictures that please the masses. PS: Whenever you make Pearl Harbor 2 I think you can handle the Japanese/political correctness issue in a much more subtle fashion than you did in this movie. Instead of making the Japanese commanders out to be reluctant attackers, follow a young Japanese pilot as he prepares for this mission (go watch Saving Private Ryan to see how Spielberg focuses in on a "sympathetic" German soldier). That would be a much easier way to build "sympathy" for the Japanese, rather than having Japanese commanders going around saying how war stinks, etc, etc</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie! If you're looking for high art or imaginative filmmaking, go see Momento. But if you just want great entertainment, you'll really enjoy this movie. If you liked Titanic, this is `must see' movie on the big screen. You may not think it's as good (I didn't, though my wife thought it was better than Titanic), but you'll still really enjoy it. It has all the same basic elements presented in a very compelling way, but the characters, story and setting are different so you won't feel like your just watching Titanic II. The females seemed to really buy into the love story, and for us guys, it was good enough to make you interested in the characters. Besides, the 40 minute attack sequence alone was worth the price of admission. It amazes me how out of touch some of these reviewers and so-called movie `geeks' are with mainstream moviegoers. Its almost like they need to trash anything `popular' just to prove (to themselves mostly) how important and cultured they are. Get a life guys!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Titanic, No Problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has obviously drawn a lot of comparisons to Titanic. It doesn't take Plato to see the similarities. But I hated Titanic and loved this movie. Is there a real Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker? No, but who cares. That's not say that there weren't a hundred Rafes and Dannys out there doing the same thing. And I thought the Japanese army was portrayed as the smartest people in the movie. As they saw it, there was nothing they could do to prevent war and this tactical strike was their best hope for victory. The most intelligent and best line of the movie was "A real genius would find a way to prevent war." I do not particularly like love stories, especially those that take away from the historically significant story. However, I really liked this love story because I thought it provided meat to the story, instead of just battles and statistics. Showing how war affects real lives. Admittedly, I could have lived without the love triangle, but it's not a perfect movie. It does a great job of showing the loss of innocence. Great movie and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie sucked ! Are we in such a cultural malaise that this is what passes for entertainment ? This movie was an hour and a half too long. Horrible acting, predictable story, embarrassing writing, etc. Didn't we all go through this with `Titanic'? Okay, the effects were great but not worth sitting through a story that had all the sophistication of an episode of `Sabrina'. I've sat through cricket games with more to offer. I know this movie is being marketed to fourteen year old girls who go over and over again, I know I'm old and cynical and weary, I know that the B.O.B.'s are holding us hostage culturally the way their parents did in the sixties, BUT COME ON !!

		<shortDescription>Awful! If this were a book, you'd read it in the bathroom and never tell a soul!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone probably has a different reason for hating this movie; and most likely, they're all correct. And yet, to be honest it also has some engaging aspects, and even a tiny number of good moments.First, the effects are good. Having seen literally hundreds of recreations of the Pearl Harbor attack over the past decades, what could they do that would dazzle or even inform the audience? Not much, I'm afraid. So the good effects don't really mean much. They are kind of wasted, because they are so humdrum. Although the flying bullets were scary.Second, the history is rudimentary. That's OK, but it does ignore a lot of real-life meaning. For example, the movie depicts Japanese Admiral Yamamoto, the inspiration and architect of the Pearl Harbor attack, commenting on the bombing success. In the movie, he (as played by way-cool actor Mako) is merely a head-shot, evidently in the open air. He says, "Perhaps we have merely awakened a sleeping giant." Ok, that's historically recorded. What isn't depicted in the movie is context within which he is said to have made that remark. According to historian and author John Toland, the pilots, officers, and crew of the Japnaese aircraft carriers were wildly celebrating their victory at Pearl Harbor. Amidst the drinking, whooping-it-up, and general Part-ay!!! vibe, the admiral refused to join in. His officers begged him to party with them, and he declined, saying, in effect, "I lived in the United States, and have toured her industries extensively. You have NO idea how vast her power is. As successful as this raid was, I'm telling you we've only awakened a sleeping giant. Rather than partying right now, I suggest we get back to Japan as fast as we can, and start building as many airplanes and training as many pilots as possible. We're going to need them." OK, so maybe that's close enough to the movie version, but in a 3-1/2 hour movie, don't you think a few seconds of character development time could have been devoted to the Japanese?Lastly, the soap opera vibe was hideous! Right from the first scene, the music score was loud, dramatic, syrupy sweet, with "dramatic-climax" violins and female choral voices. Throughout the movie, the tone was mawkish, overly sentimental, and annoyingly corny. Many of the scenes, and story threads, were so ham-fisted and clumsy, it was just plain BAD!If "Pearl Harbor" were a book, you'd read it in the bathroom, skip half it, hoot and laugh and the other half, and never reveal your dirty little secret to anyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine battle sequences, but otherwise poor and laughable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't waste any of your time with a long review the way this film wasted 3 hours of my time. Simply put, there's about a half-hour of exciting, well-staged battle sequences that I wish I could have seen by themselves (perhaps theatres should list what time the battle scenes begin, then we can arrive late and miss the rest of the movie), and the rest of the film is dramatically weak, horribly written, and non-acted by two male leads who make Keanu Reeves seem like James Woods!! Ben Affleck is far too bland to carry a major motion picture, Josh Hartnett doesn't seem to be able to convincingly capture ANY emotion as an actor (one wonders how ANY woman would find him interesting!), and the female lead is given such a one-dimensional script that it's impossible to evaluate her performance. At least a dozen times during the film, the audience hooted at lines that were intended seriously, and some jokers in the audience actually completed the lines for the actors before the actors did--that's how cliche-ridden this dog was! Jon Voight as FDR was impressive, but someone should have told the filmmakers that an actor of Voight's caliber does not need to have a wax-museum style make-up job. I was waiting for Cuba Gooding Jr., but his performance is little more than a cameo and the script gives his character no depth. Alec Baldwin is badly miscast--audience members were making rude noises during his scenes. I'm surprised Disney didn't re-edit or re-shoot some of the film after what must have been poor preview response. TITANIC may have been a crowd-pleaser, but it did achieve what it set out to and I felt that I had more than gotten my money's worth from James Cameron and crew. As for this bomb, I feel like asking Bay-Bruckheimer for a refund--the battle sequences were worth about $1.00, so I feel as though I've been ripped off for the other $4.00 (PLEASE, don't pay over matinee price to see this!). Thanks to Roger Ebert, for pointing out that the emperor has no clothes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people like Michael Bay, some don't. As far as I'm concerned, he does with Pearl Harbor what he has done with his two previous projects, "The Rock" and "Armageddon" to make them blockbusters - he gives us spectacular action sequences, interesting characters, and polishes each shot, each scene, to a fine finish. Yes, the movie has characters that are somewhat two dimensional and yes, the movie uses a tragic historical event as the backdrop for a cliche-ridden romance, but why is it that no one complained when James Cameron did that with the much inferior "Titanic?" Take a look at some of the classic war films - "Bridge Over the River Kwai," "From Here to Eternity" - you will find highly glossed Hollywood romances and big explosions, but if they were dissected with the unblinking cynicism that modern-day critics use, they would be attacked with as much fervor that "Pearl Harbor" has been. See this movie for what it is - a big, glossy, Hollywood epic that has been unjustly panned, and enjoy it for what it is, not what others say it should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lotta FX and a Love Triangle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this big action treatment of FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, TORA! TORA! TORA!, and THIRTY SECONDS OVER TOKYO, the historical plot gives way to technical FX and melodrama. I didn't complain when James Cameron did that with TITANIC because the characters and the plot were integrated into the main story of the great ship's disaster, but here history takes a back seat.The superficial character development of the romantic triangle doesn't justify the sluggish first 90 minutes of the movie. The characters played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are not in the same league with such great on-screen rivalries as those done by Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy, but I fault the director and writer for that, not the actors. I cringed at some of the trite dialogue delivered with sha-ZAM faked accents. Much of the 1940s atmosphere before the Pearl Harbor raid is slick but is as superficial as the characters.Then there are the unintentional laughs such as the mountains of Long Island, the US Capitol doubling as the Navy Department, and the classic Woody car clearly in view right after the sexual encounter scene. And isn't it convenient that we have two buddies, one for each major theater of the war? As far as the mawkish, repetitive music -- don't bother listening. We even have crucifixion imagery. I think there must be a kitchen sink in there someplace too.However, I have to say that ultimately I liked the film. It works best when it starts focusing on the Japanese preparations for war, and after we finally meet FDR and see the Pearl Harbor attack followed by the Doolittle raid. I think the director and writer could have trimmed the opening sequences from 90 to at most 45 minutes, and the film would have gotten off to a much better start.While I can't recommend the first act, the second and third acts are worth the effort. So sit back, relax, eat your popcorn slowly (get a big bag and take a good 90 minutes to savor the flavor), and wait for the real movie to begin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For shame, Bay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sat down to see this movie out of personal interest for WW2 history. I guess the warning lights should have started flashing when the director was Michael Bay, but I watched it anyway and wasted almost three hours of my life. Three themes are re-occurring in this movie: A desperate/embarrassing attempt at making a touching love story, a sickening amount of patriotic moments and (surprise!) tons of explosions to cover up the mess. The acting never convinces me and the whole "love drama in love in a war-torn world" is way too heavily emphasized. But most of the critique is aimed at Bay, who obviously finds it fitting to depict the very attack on the naval base (which, for some reason, is what people remember Pearl Harbor for), as a cowardly act of terror. Japan had declared war, the casualties we see are military personnel, and the revenge bombing of a city full of civilians is not as heroic and brave as Bay might think. Films about events of historic significance should be everything this plane crash (pun intended) is not. 1/10. And I'm being kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Excuse for a War Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor (2001): Dir: Michael Bay / Cast: Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, Josh Hartnett, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jon Voight: One of Hollywood's great big lies. It is not so much about the 1941 attack by Japanese forces as it is about the pathetic love triangle where two soldiers fight to get into the pants of a nurse. With that said the title is misleading. Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are the two war buddies and Kate Beckinsale plays the nurse and the big highlight is a love scene underneath a parachute. Remember, this is advertized as a war film. What a load of bullshit. There is an embarrassing needle injecting scene where Beckinsale passes Affleck even though his vision isn't the best. They have a corny romance before he goes off to war where he is reported dead but he makes a surprise return only to find her and Hartnett banging like porn stars. Stupid tearjerker ending for the suckers. An embarrassment for Michael Bay who previously made the idiotic Armageddon. Pitiful opening regarding a kid accidentally starting a plane. That should key viewers in to just how stupid this garbage truly is. Dreadful acting by Affleck, Hartnett and Beckinsale with Cuba Gooding Jr. deserving better. Jon Voight plays the stupidest United States President since Bill Pullman in Independence Day. With no broad Japanese roles the film becomes a racist $140 million hunk of sh*t. Score: 1 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I LOVE this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe how many people said they hated this movie. Sure, it may not be entirely historically accurate, but a story's first purpose is to entertain, or people won't watch it. I think this does a great job of entertaining, but you can't see that if you sit through it just trying to nitpick little details that don't detract from the story.A lot of people said the love triangle is clichéd and corny. Personally, although it isn't the most original idea to have two best friends fall for the same girl, I thought the love triangle added depth to the story. I didn't feel the characters were flat at all, and I liked Danny especially. When he died, I felt sad, and it made the tragedy of all the people that died in WWII real to me. All in all, the movie was amazing, but not for those who want a history lesson. But if you want to get the emotional impact of Pearl Harbor, which I think is the most important thing to come away with, then this is perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand why so many people hate this movie. This is a very good movie. My only negative opinion here is that there is too much romance. But, there is plenty of action and drama to keep me entertained. I read some commentaries by Bay and Affleck about the criticism. They say that's what life was back then and my grandparents agreed. Haters really need to keep their mouths shut if they never lived in the 40's.This movie is about the attacks on Pearl Harbor which made the U.S enter the war. The story is told between two friends who witnessed everything in Hawaii.The acting is wonderful. The cast is an all-star cast. This is definitely Ben Affleck's best movie.Pearl Harbor is an emotional, tear-jerking movie. Hans Zimmer's score is good at helping that. There are many memorable quotes that will stick around forever. All in all, I loved this film. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What exactly was the point of this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Put extremely attractive young men and women into the fashions of 1941 but with the moral attitudes of the 21st century, add special effects, completely throw out any basis in actual fact in order to get an emotional reaction from the audience (here the film succeeds for all the wrong reasons), add a few rousing speeches, and you have Pearl Harbor. The only good thing about this film are the special effects, and even then I prefer the more primitively done Tora,Tora,Tora from thirty years before because it actually tells the truth about what led up to the raid in painstaking detail, actually taking the time to show what is going on with both the Japanese and the Americans and the mistakes and misjudgments made on both sides. If you want steamy love scenes and nicely done explosions and graphics, watch this film. If you want to be entertained while learning something about history watch Tora, Tora, Tora. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action, but oh the rest!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You do see the money up on the screen - the attack on Pearl Harbour has some of the best CGI on screen, whatever the moaners say. It does not flinch from showing people dying - yes, Americans getting killed and getting their arses whipped! Extremely unusual on screen... The background as to why the actual Japanese attack is a little blurred - can't have any excuses for anyone wanting to attack USA, can we??? So the middle of the picture is pretty good - again don't listen to the moaners that Affleck and Hartnett don't play the real US airman who got in the air that day. After all the first officer on the Titanic blew his brains out on screen (sic?) and Matthew McConaughey rescued the Enigma codes in 'U571' for the US when in fact it was British sailors, and didn't Mel Gibson win the Vietnam War?!!! Yes, Hollywood has always played fast and loose with historical fact, so get over it. Mind I would have thought you might have seen a few more Yanks in the Eagle Squadron, and the Battle of Britain was over by 1941! But of the rest, the script is shoddy soap opera, the direction overblown, the acting with a couple of standouts poor, the plot derivative from other better movies (Kate Beckinsale on the beach in a two piece in Hawaii snogging!), and Ben Affleck's Clint Eastwood-like shoot out with the japs cringeworthy. Still one of the stars doesn't make it to the final shot which is unusual these days, although he comes home in a wooden box (Iraq, geddit!). And nowhere is there a hint that Roosevelt and Marshall may have sacrificed Pearl to get US into the war!</fullReview>

This film is maybe not completely historically correct, but for people who don't know much about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, this film is interesting! Michael Bay also made a very emotional film and also the battle scenes were excellent. But when Pearl Harbor got attacked, the action took a bit too long! But nevertheless, I really thought this was a good film. Nice, patriotic film that has a few silly scenes, but that has beautiful, sometimes lyrical cinematography, amazing special effects, very good music and good acting.</fullReview>

The part when the bomb hits the USS Arizon and literally blows it out of the water and in two, now that spectacular special effects. As for the flying portion of the film, when Affleck volunteers for duty with the Royal Air Force, I thought the action scenes were really good. This movie could have been a great chick flick if there wasn't so much violence. I gave this movie a 7. Mostly because I was in the service and saw how much was added to make it seem more realistic. The three main characters, Affleck, Hartnett, and Beckinsale were good. I just couldn't see Baldwin, a huge pacifist, playing a hero like Lt. Col. Doolittle.

Big booms and explosions all over the place.The music was worth a third of the movie, and a big applause for Hanz Zimmer for composing it.Randall Wallace wrote a great script, taking the attack of Pearl Harbor and making you really almost cry during it.I tip my hat to Michael Bay for excellent directing.Overall, I can see no possible way for anyone not to like this movie. It succeeded in almost every way.p.s. I'm pretty sure a LOT of people will disagree, but I don't care. This was probably the best film of 2001, and even if everyone says they didn't like it, it sure made a LOT of money.See it for yourself and see one of the best, dramatic, and epic films of the past few years.</fullReview>

If you want to know what really happened at Pearl Harbor and after, there are many good books and documentaries available! This is historical fiction... a beautiful story of close friends, young love, and our men and women in the military around a time when America got involved in the war. There are a lot of fine actors, a beautiful musical score, aerial combat scenes, and some very realistic scenes of that "horrible" day in history (they talked with many veterans that were there during the actual attack and tried to depict some of these stories).But it is a MOVIE... it is a movie that tugs at your heart; it will make you laugh, smile, cry, and maybe even get you reading about that day in history. So, if you want to see a movie about friendship, love, and heroism around the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, then make some popcorn and watch a good old fashioned movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After I first watched this movie, I loved it. However, I realized later that this film isn't very good. Here you have a movie about historical Pearl Harbor, however 3/4 of it is about a silly little love triangle. You're starting to get off track from the story. I think it was good to have a love story in there about waiting for her soldier to come back to her. When they added his friend in there it became about really stupid fights and to top it all off they added in the predicament of the girl being pregnant. This movie is entitled Pearl Harbor, so why don't you make it more about Pearl Harbor. Also, I don't know all the history about Pearl Harbor and the Dolittle Raid, but I've heard from some that a few parts of the history are way off. Perhaps they tried not to make it like Tora Tora Tora, but the love story that they had was a bad idea. But I will say that the special effects were awesome! If you have the 2-disk DVD, you should watch the special features because it's very interesting. Even though I hate the love story, it's actually not a bad movie. So I give it 7 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey, remember that uh war thingy, happened about 60 years ago? Yeah that's it, World War II. And you know that thing, you know that thing that got the U.S. involved in it? Yeah the attack on Pear Harbor. They should make a movie about that! Wait, they already did? It was called Tora, Tora, Tora? And it was really good? Well I'll be dipped.Oh well, I'll just get on to reviewing Pearl Harbor. This movie is four hours long, or at least it seems like it is. Don't let anyone tell you differently, this is a paint by numbers love story that happens to use the events of WWII as a backdrop. There's some ridiculous overwrought love triangle and then, BOOM, crap explodes! The darkest days of World War II, wow, I couldn't possibly come up with a better backdrop for a stupid little romance movie.After hours of sappy romance we, much like the sailors of the Pacific fleet, are struck by endless bombs and action scenes that all pursue the single minded purpose of blowing things the *bleep* up. It ends with the Doolittle air raid as a way of showing the light at the end of the tunnel, or something. In all honesty if the movie wanted to end on a more upbeat note they could have the nurse character comfort a dying man or something and finish it off with a scene of the Aircraft Carriers returning to the Harbor.If you can sit through three hours of boring melodrama the action sequences look decent but they get real old real fast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the way this movie really started. It caught my attention and I thought the music was very pretty (in a non-gay way) and I knew it was a love story because of the music. But anyways I thought the acting was okay, but again romance and war don't mix. Just like women and machinery don't mix.This movie had terrific action and I felt like I was in the middle of the battle. But I've found out how inaccurate this movie was and now It really ruined the movie. BUt I'm not saying to love this movie to death, all I'm saying is if you wanna be entertained....then watch this movie. But if they only had the Pearl Harbor attack and nothing else then it would have been a masterpiece in my opinion.But I give everyone who helped make this movie a lot of credit for trying to make history. They did their part, and thats all that matters. But I'm watching it right now and I'm being entertained by the attack sequence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that Pearl harbour was one of the most greatest films i have ever seen in my life. I am really surprised at some of the comments i have seen on here because not only did the film have an amazing story on the attack on Pearl Harbour, the love story kept me on my feet. Pearl Harbour was played by amazing characters such as Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck and Kate Beckingsale. They were so good that i had tears in my eyes at some points.........the scene at the end of the film between Rafe and Danny was brilliant, i'm not going to explain what happened because i don't want to ruin the film for anyone who has not seen it yet, but it was such a great scene and it was so sad This film was 10 out of 10, if your thinking about watching this film, you should because it will keep you on the edge of your seat all the time......... Josh Hartnett was excellent, he done his character justice if you ask me, every single part of the film he was in made me want to rewind it and watch it again which is exactly what i did it was that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>wow--millions of dollars spent, beautifully exposed film, to be sure, but what inhumanity-- the plot--the dialogue! I detest implausibility in a movie; it's insulting. this was an incredibly important moment in US history, and these people have cheapened it forever by misrepresenting it to us as this mish-mash. in this day and age, I'm sure many will walk away thinking they actually saw some history here.from the get-go: kids playing in a plane manage to start it up, open the throttle and get airborne, then touch down safely a few seconds later even though they can't reach the pedals or for that matter know how to fly....yeahhhh, rightthen the father of one of the kids gets bushwacked by a 10 year old with a 2x4...yeah, surehow do people sit through this kind of stuff?and so it goes....pilots play "chicken" directly over the control tower, and pilot steals a police boat for a romantic cruise, and well, I just can't go on, because almost every single doggone scene is implausible in some way or another.and of course, even though this SHOULD be a rah-rah America movie, we have your typical Hollywood liberal poison stirred into the mix:"adolf Hitler builds the German military machine and drags all of europe into war"bad old Germans! after the US came and saved France from the FIRST world war, France put such onerous demands for reparations on the Germans that Hitler was able to use their snubbing to motivate the Germans to rebuild... and as he violated the treaty and armed himself at a frenetic pace, France and england were too cowardly to make a stand before the situation reached critical mass....despite all of churchill's warnings."even while France falls to Hitler America refuses to join the fighting..."oh yeah.....WE'RE the bad guys, remember? we can all give thanks that very few french actually died, since they simply surrendered to the Germans rather than fight. gee, wonder how they'll perform when they have a Muslim majority? (or even a more sizable minority...)and so it goes....the Japanese put ships in a wading pool to lay out their plans? I think somebody watched Chinatown one too many timesskinny black guy boxes much bigger white guy--gee, wonder who'll win?ben affleck dies? YAAAYYY!!! SOMETHING GOOD HAPPENS!!! no, wait, this is too good to be true! he will survive--he's really lost at sea, ya see, and... and SURPRISE, SURPRISE!!! I'll just bet he will show up when the battle starts to save the day.....BRILLIANT!!! (so I know it's a spoiler, but I'm writing this while watching and doubt if I'll make it to when this really happens....but sadly, I KNOW it will.)the Japanese don't really want to go to war, after all! no mention of imperial conquest, their abuses of occupied populations, no the generals are very philosophic about the whole thing... okay, I've had enough!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"December 7, 1941 - A day that shall live in infamy"This movie isn't the first and only that has steered away from the truth and replaced it with fictional characters and plot line (Titanic is the best example). As far as doing so you can't go wrong if you plot your course right and make both reality and fiction come together.It's also the mixture of power and emotion brought to the screen that can make up for all the misplaced factual errors. Bay knows his stuff. He created a particular pace and time that had a great chemistry with it all in the final screening. The cheer vision is one that wasn't taking lightly. It surly wasn't dull and definitely was mistreated.I'm finding it hard to fathom the critical comments on this movie where as a movie such as Titanic was highly appreciated. I myself didn't like Titanic, it misguided all what I have said and it turned out to be a real mess.When it comes down to the acting, I'll come right out and say I think they all had great performances. We can't seem to pass the mixture of opinions when we talk about Ben Affleck's acting skills. I find him to have a natural talent for acting, not so much of a creative talent. That doesn't bother me in the least for this particular movie. Kate Beckansile is so gorgeous you can overlook her acting, Josh can be said the same way for the opposite sex. I'm not implying that their acting was out of line. I think their work was just fine.All in all I'm am disappointed for all who don't take this movie for what it delivers, instead trying to learn the actual history. If that's what you're into there are plenty of documentaries out their for you.****/**** stars Pearl Harbor (2001): Rated PG-13 for sustained war violence and disturbing images of wounded, brief sensuality and language</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the worst movie of all time, now I've seen the movies with the lowest ranks but they're just badly done, this on the other hand I reserve a special venom for. We'll start with a general look at the film, it's clichéd to hell, how could anyone get joy from watching a series of obvious scenes where you know exactly where the next one will lead, Anyone with any IQ should get bored with this stuff pretty quickly. The only saving grace are the explosions, though this doesn't stretch you much. OK so we accept its not a highbrow film, I'll sit through an Arnie film no problem, so how about the cast. Alec Baldwin (if anyone's seen Team America ? F.A.G), old Cuba I've not seen in a film where he's not overacted his token black actor heart out. And of course there's good old Ben, old Affers (F.A.G) can not act, sorry CAN NOT ACT, would somebody put him out of his and our G.Damn misery. So the big actors are all the American A1 guys who will get bums on seats but don't' have a morsel of class or integrity, which is a good thing as?. We now move onto the plot. Apparently Goebbels died in 1945, I think this is a lie, I think he was whisked out of the country by the American armed forces and given a job creating Hollywood movies (To date he must have had a hand in Devil's Own (The IRA are freedom fighters), U-571 (Americans find the Enigma Machine), Saving Private Ryan (2 Brits in the whole film), Master and Commander (Supposed to be Brits chasing Yanks), etc, etc, etc). My reason for this theory is Goebbels as the master of propaganda is the only one who could orchestrate what appears to be a conscious and concerted plan to re-write the history of the world to make America responsible for every great event in history (Watch out next month as Abe Lincoln invents the wheel and defeats Napoleon in a fist fight). So what has happened with the plot to suspect this old Nazi, well the raid on Japan at the end to start with. no, No, NO. This did not happen for several years and when it did it caused F all damage, sorry but after Peal Harbour the armed forces were shattered and had nowhere near the capability to do this, but the Yanks had to go 'kick ass'. But this still wasn't the worst part, not the bit that actually hurts. The Presidents speech, just before they fly off to "Bomb ALL of Japan", The Pres says something about how America's allies will now see what they are made of. Sorry but up until this point America had been happily sitting on the fence milking everyone and making a packet out of our need for arms and food as the Allies had been throwing millions of troops and slowly starving for nearly three years before they were FORCED by the Japs to join. Ugh. It is at the end of the day just a movie and if I truly thought that I would just turn it off or leave. But the point is a movie is no longer just entertainment, a movie like this alters our perception of events and for a large number of people forms our education, but if we continue not to object to these lies then they will become our truths.

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the reason why we have kids who know nothing about the TRUE history of this country. Besides obvious errors to the true events of December 7th to make the movie sell, the events shown are even more absurd. The whole movie twists history into a three ball of confusion. Pilots going from Bombers to Fighters back to Bombers in the space of year just didn't happen. No pilot ever served in the RAF and was at Pearl Harbor in the Army Air Corps. This is slam at the real members of the Eagles Sqd. (American volunteers in the RAF). A lot more should have been done to tell the real story of the some of the real people who were at Pearl Harbor, like the two pilots who did get up and fight the Japanese in the Air. More about the first Black Navy Cross winner could have made a much better story than trying to cram the Battle of Britian, Pearl harbor and Doolittle's Raid into this movie. Some of the film was redeeming. The action sequences were good (if a bit overblown). Trust me and see Tora Tora Tora or it's Japanese counterpart to get a better idea of what December 7th was all about.</fullReview>

It was a typical Hollywood movie, but in spite of the money and efforts it didn't work out very well. I was bored during the movie, and that's never a good thing... It'll probably be because there was nothing original in this movie, Even a standard story can make an original film, but sadly it wasn't the case. To long, to "over the top" American, to simple storyline, the effects were good; but to much of the same thing for to long, to many stereotypes are used, to many hero's (underdogs).All in all it wasn't a complete waste of time, but i wouldn't recommend watching it a second time...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Worst movie ever made? You guys haven't seen lots of movies then and comparing this one to Tora Tora Tora! is just one example of apples vs oranges argument which rarely is very productive. T3 is DOCUdrama and if you really take a good look at that one the acting is truly abysmal, especially on American side. One of my personal pet peeves against war movies of 60's and 70's is that they don't much care about costuming, 70's fashions in second world war really rubs in the eye and that throws the good IL' suspension of belief out of the window quicker than you can say terylene. Pearl Harbor is a throwback from the earlier time, war flicks of 40's and 50's, and if you really want to compare it to something, do it with those. &gt;From here to eternity is probably the first contender, and surely it is superior to Pearl, but Bay didn't have the kind of stellar cast as Zinneman did so what can you do. Affleck ain't Burt and Hartnett sure ain't even in the same hemisphere with Clift or Sinatra. Of course us nonamericans find Bays excuse to put American flag to every fifth scene quite hilarious and dialogue is beyond corny in some instances, however PH is entertaining spectacle in it's own right AND it's not supposed to be taken as fact.

Justifying Japan's brutal and aggressive campaign throughout Asia and the attack on Pearl Harbor? FDR standing in front of his advisors to make a point? Japanese fighters strafing people on taramcs and survivors floating in the water? Bombing the hospital? Dory Miller shooting down planes? The script also contains some of the worst 'romantic' dialog since "Attack of the Clones." Honestly, Ben-Lo should attempt another career path...seriously. I'm beginning to think the same about Beckinsale. She was terrific in "Cold Comfort Farm" but this and "Underworld" are near career-killers.

		<fullReview>the battle scenes and music. This had the potential to be good, but why oh why did they throw in the dumbest, sappest, cheesyiest love story ever in a movie that was supposed to be about the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Over half the movie was dedicated to the silly love triangle that was ripped off from some daytime soap opera. And Ben Affleck is terrible in this. But, maybe he seemed so bad because of the horrible dialogue he had to say like "not anxious to die, but anxious to matter." And Alec Baldwin had a bunch of cheesy lines too. And why was Cuba Gooding JR even in this. He didn't have much screen time and not much to do. So much could have been edited out to make this movie closer to 2 hours instead of 3. If they had done that, more people would have liked it.FINAL VERDICT: About 40 minutes of bombing is decent to watch but the rest is trash. Faith Hill's song at the end is the best part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Bay Revisits That Infamous Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Depicting history on the silver screen is no easy task; critics and historical purists wait in eager anticipation to pounce on a shading that's not quite right or a spent bullet casing that rolls left instead of right in the heat of a battle. To even consider doing a dramatization of the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor, in this era of endless information and minutiae, is a bold act in itself, and the filmmakers deserve a nod of credit right out of the chute just for attempting it. And, happily, they deserve still more credit, as `Pearl Harbor,' directed by Michael Bay, goes on to successfully capture the pain, pathos, angst, frustration and fear born of that day that `Will live in infamy.' Told through the lives of two lifelong friends, Captain Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Captain Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett), this is a movie of epic proportions presented on a personal level, which enables the audience to connect with the story on an emotional level and not just as an observer of a reenacted historical event. And when Nurse Lieutenant Evelyn Stewart (Kate Beckinsale) enters the story, it becomes even more involving, and as it builds in intimacy-- juxtaposed against these monumental events as they unfold-- it creates that empathy that really puts the viewer in the picture and gives that sense of total involvement. This is nothing new to storytelling, of course; writers and movie makers have long understood that when dealing with events that are complex and larger than life, they have to be concentrated and presented from a personal perspective to effect a truly appreciable impact, and as James Cameron proved with `Titanic,' there's no better way to do it than with a love story. Without that intimacy between the characters, which is what provides the audience with a frame of reference and a specific element with which the viewer can identify, the impact of all that eventually happens would be significantly diminished. Like Cameron (and many others before him), Bay recognizes this, and the approach he takes is therefore very effective. By the time the attack comes, you know and care about the people involved, and it gives the tragedy of that day a personal, rather than just a national or historic perspective. And though all that follows is visually stunning, it's that personal focus-- that singular involvement that's been so carefully crafted-- that predominates the moment and makes all the difference as far as what you're feeling and experiencing as you watch these horrific and horrendous events play out. Bay is also successful in evoking a true sense of time and place with this film, and he does it not only with authentic settings and visuals, but by giving the film itself a sense of cinematic sensibility that makes it more reminiscent of films like `Bombardier,' `Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo' and `The Bridges At Toko-Ri,' than the more recent `Saving Private Ryan' (though it does have `Ryan's' same level of realism). It's easy, in fact, to envision this film had it been made fifty or so years ago, with a cast that would've included Dana Andrews, Van Johnson and Gene Tierney as the principals, with Randolph Scott, Pat O'Brien and Eddie Albert in supporting roles. Heading up this cast, Affleck and Hartnett give strong, engaging performances, as does Kate Beckinsale, who successfully manages to take her character to a level beyond that of simply being the romantic interest of the story. She makes Evelyn believable by responding honestly to the complexities of her character's situation, which in turn adds to the overall credibility of the fictionalized part of the story. If there's an element in the story at all, in fact, that could be deemed questionable, it may be Rafe's reaction (some may argue, `over-reaction') to his personal situation; it is not, however, a reflection on Affleck's ability as an actor-- he gives a satisfying, credible performance-- but merely a subjective evaluation of his character's motivation. Giving memorable performances in supporting roles are Ewen Bremner as Lieutenant Red Winkle, and James King as Nurse Betty. Also Notable, are Alec Baldwin as Lieutenant colonel Jimmy Doolittle, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Petty Officer Dorie Miller, a Navy cook who rises to the occasion during the attack (though Gooding does bring a bit of melodrama to his portrayal), and especially Jon Voight, who is excellent in the role of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Tom Sizemore, however, as Sergeant Earl Sistern, falls into stereotype, and with the brim of his hat turned up comes across like an actor playing William Bendix playing a role in a war movie more than anything else. In his defense, though, he does seem to do the best he can with the material he is given, and it is a fairly small part with little time for development. The additional supporting cast includes William Lee Scott (Lieutenant Billy Thompson), Jennifer Garner (Nurse Sandra), Mako (Admiral Yamamoto), Colm Feore (Admiral Kimmel), Leland Orser (Major Jackson), Scott Wilson (General Marshall), Peter Firth (Bennion) and Sara Rue (Nurse Martha). One more qualified than I will have to comment on the historical `accuracy' of the film, but without question, `Pearl Harbor' succeeds in conveying the magnitude, scope and significance of the attack, and does it in a way that is emotionally involving and memorable. It depicts a moment in history that-- regardless of how dark and horrible-- must never be forgotten; and, even as Steven Spielberg's `Schindler's List' and `Saving Private Ryan' did much to preserve their respective moments in history, so will this film help to insure that December 7, 1941, will forever be remembered. I rate this one 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great action scenes; dreadful story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One can only speculate about how great a part timing plays in determining whether or not any particular film is a success or failure at the box office. I suspect that had `Pearl Harbor' been released three or four months later than it was ? in say September rather than June of 2001 ? it might have been able to ride the wave of renewed American patriotism that accompanied that other Day of Infamy, the September 11th terrorist attacks - and found itself some true financial glory. As it is, the film will probably now enjoy a more lucrative life in its home video incarnation than it might otherwise have done under more normal circumstances. So I guess, in some ways, the film's timing ends up being fortuitous after all. Even from the start, one could see that `Pearl Harbor' was designed as a bald-faced attempt to replicate the unprecedented success of `Titanic.' One is only amazed at how completely it fails. In both films a simplistic love story has been grafted onto an historic event of monumental tragedy, one that is familiar to the audience beforehand, comes mostly at the end, and offers scads of special effects wizards gainful employment in bringing the episode to life on the screen. In many ways, `Pearl Harbor' is simply the biggest, loudest and costliest example of that strange hybrid genre known as the `chick flick/war movie.' (In this way, I guess filmmakers feel they have the whole date-night crowd covered). Somehow, one expects to find romance on a cruise ship. It feels right there. A romantic story seems somehow less apropos as the foundation for a film on this particular subject. In fact, the love triangle scenario that makes up fully the first half of this film's enormous three-hour running time is of such surpassing banality that one begins to wonder if anyone bothered to read the script before the actors were pushed out in front of the cameras. For it is quite obvious that all the creative minds engaged in bringing this film to completion were focused far more on the massive reconstructed sets, elaborate explosions and jaw dropping special effects than on anything so simple and banal as character development or thematic depth.It would be hard to imagine three less interesting characters than Rafe (catch the All-American hero name yet!), Danny and Evelyn to serve as the focal point for a film on this important a subject. The first two (played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) are childhood buddies, now turned bomber pilots, who happen to fall in love with the same beautiful nurse (played by Kate Beckinsale). Just think back to the complex characters at the core of `From Here to Eternity.' In that film, so absorbing and grand were those figures and the situations in which they found themselves that the Pearl Harbor attack actually stayed, for the most part, in the background. In `Pearl Harbor,' we are never allowed to forget that the sole purpose for the movie's existence is the attack sequence. Every moment of the first half is painful to watch ? from the awkward and silly first meetings, to the sappy and drippy love scenes, to the inevitable fistfight between the two best friends just hours before they will be called upon to demonstrate brotherhood in action for a greater cause. Rick, the main character in `Casablanca,' uttered the famous truism that the travails of three insignificant people don't `amount to a hill of beans' in the face of events of global importance ? and that philosophy has never seemed more on the money than in the case of `Pearl Harbor.' But then when you are fretting over making back those untold millions you've lavished on your star-studded production, you don't dare allow yourself to entertain such subversive thoughts. I hate to have to say this but the pasteboard love story that weakly props up `Pearl Harbor' ends up being an insult to both those who survived and those who perished in the holocaust.What is NOT an insult to their memories, however, is the attack sequence itself. Here the wretched movie almost redeems itself, for not only is this scene breathtakingly realized in its complexity and scope, but it also captures the poignancy of the devastation in amazingly graphic terms. The gruesomeness of much of the death and carnage put before us makes us fully appreciate, for the first time I think, the enormity of the horror and suffering that accompanied that event. `Pearl Harbor' justifies its brilliant excesses by bringing this moment to epic life for a whole generation who has heretofore probably encountered it only as a highlighted study note in some dry high school or college textbook. For a glorious half hour or so, the filmmakers husband all the resources of modern special effects to plunge us into an epochal moment in our nation's history. Herr, indeed, is technological excess employed in a salutary purpose.The advantage in seeing `Pearl Harbor' on video rather than in the theatre is that, in the latter venue, one could only snooze through the torpid first half and wake refreshed when the bombs started dropping and the guns firing. Now, with the power of the remote in one's hand, one can simply fast forward to all the good parts and leave the sappy ones behind. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DISNEY'S ROMANTIC EPIC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney does it again! Desperate to pull in the teenage market to up the all mighty dollar (and share stake, no doubt), it churns out the romantic epic of 2001 (and probably the decade) PEARL HARBOR!There is plenty to keep the teenage girls happy: Rafe and Danny, two handsomely rugged fly boys are our All American Heroes. They have been best friends since boyhood and always dreamed of being fighter pilots! Best of all is the beautiful romantic triangle that blooms between our two handsome heroes and the gorgeous military nurse Evelyn. For the teenage boys: Play Station game-like rendering of tons and tons of C.G.I stuff blowing up! Digitally-created WWII planes flying and fighting like the X-Wing fighters in Star Wars. Radically cool dog-fights between the evil Jap Imperial Tie Fighters and our Goody Goody 'Rebel' pilots Rafe and handsome Danny.For the Patriots: Loads of Yankee flag waving and tearful patriotic speeches to fire up the emotions of the American people from President Roosevelt himself. (One of the corniest scenes in this flick is also dedicated to him!)WARNING! A LINE OF SMALL SPOILERS HAS APPEARED ON THE HORIZON!Best line in this beautiful Disney Romance: "Even though I love Danny with my whole heart, whenever I see a sunset I'll always think of you." GOOOOO Disney!Best Romantic Scene: The Parachute hangar. Oh, how Romantic! How Beautiful! Wonderful musical score! (The audience is moved to tears) Oh, Danny, you're my Dream Boat! Best Blown-up-stuff scene: The cook Dorie cradles his dying commander in his arms. Oh, yes, and C.G.I explosions. Lots and lots of them.For Audiences over the age of 17: Cliche after cliche after cliche ad nauseum. Here are some Cool Disney Cliches: The Bad Guys are always evil and ugly (Dinosaur) and the Good Guys are always pure and handsome (just about every Disney flick) Evil music always accompany the Bad Guys while heart-wrenching orchestral numbers are gifted to the Good Guys. America is Always the Good Guy. Every other country is the Bad Guy. GOOOOO DISNEY!!!CONCLUSION: Dear Disney Chief Executives: Stick to making Cartoons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went and watched Pearl Harbor (perhaps you've heard of it) on Friday night. I loved it but I decided to hear what others thought of the movie. I heard all good things from the people that I usually trust, however some move "experts" have decided that it is now trendy to dislike Pearl Harbor. They claim that it is not historically accurate, like they watched one special on MSNBC and they think that they are a friggen expert. There is a reason that this movie is classified as Historical FICTION. Not all of the details have to be entirely correct. Many "Harbor Haters" have said that the movie is a loser because the two main characters (Affleck and Hartnett) are not real characters. However, I remember a couple years back when a little movie called Titanic came out, nobody was criticizing because DeCaprio and Winslet were made up. So I beg you, when you see this movie, please just silence that little voice in the back in your head that says this is not correct. Just try to have fun with it and I guarantee that you will have a great time with it. Plus you can't go wrong with Kate Beckinsale and for the women, Ben Affleck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to set the record straight for Pearl Harbor. I really don't understand the high rate of bad reviews for this movie.First of all, it's a Michael Bay blockbuster, why does everyone assume that it HAS to be historically accurate to the point. If what you want is historically accurate, then watch a documentary. Everyone knows that fighter pilots don't't fly bombers and that the Doolittle Raid was much later following the Pearl Harbor bombing. Michael Bay has and always will be an entertainer foremost and his movies will always center around entertaining the audience to the fullest.That being said I'd like to say that I really enjoyed Pearl Harbor and it has been one of my top war epics for a long time now. The soundtrack is just flawless and that alone makes the movie worth watching. I loved Ben Affleck in this (haters be hating). I do realize most people say it's the worst role he's ever played, but I think he did a very good job. The same can be said to Josh Hartnett and the always beautiful Kate Beckinsale. Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight and Mako, they raise the bar of this movie to a higher level, that goes without saying.The special effects are magnificent, the Pearl Harbor bombing sequence is breathtaking and Michael Bay's love for explosions finally pays off.The storyline is one of my favourites. I think there are not enough movies of this magnitude that are able to pull off 180 minutes. And Pearl Harbor makes its mark. I do realize that the love triangle has been done to death, but it just works.So, all in all I wanted to give this emotionally gripping epic war tale a good review, well because it just deserves it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stupid, stupid, stupid of me to take any notice of the critics when this film appeared in 2001!!! As a result I didn't get a copy and watch it all the way through until 2008. I am ashamed of myself.....really. Now I admit that I am an aviation anorak; however, even given the factual inaccuracies surrounding some of the aircraft, ships etc, I still loved all of the special effects. I think it says something when computers can make up for other failings in a film, so that it is still highly watchable. OK, Perhaps I am easily pleased, but at least I rarely rant on interminably about the incorrect cap-badge on the uniform of a soldier 400 yards away, and to the left of the main action!! And the unending supply of ammunition in a Curtiss P-40B Tomahawk certainly did not stop me enjoying the sequences. We all know that we cannot expect the heroes in a 'tale' like this to keep landing to re-arm; that would be ridiculous! How would they ever win a war like that? AS many others have pointed out, this was a Hollywood version of real events, so if you watch it expecting a historical masterpiece then you will be disappointed. Just chill, and go with the flow. I absolutely enjoyed it all. Sorry but the fact is, I wish I had viewed it on the big screen in '01 with a big bag of popcorn and a mega coke!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand the negativity towards this film as it was one of the best films from 2001 and although I admit that I am an avid Michael Bay fan I fail to see how people could dislike it. This film had negative reviews by Michael Bay fans because of the love story, well in all honesty all of his films feature a love story to some extent it is just up to him whether he makes it a big part of the film (e.g. this film along with "Armageddon" and "The Island") or he chooses to only briefly focus on the love story (e.g. "The Rock"). I for one thoroughly enjoyed this film as I enjoy not only a good war film but one with a good dramatic storyline such as this and on being a Michael Bay fan I look forward to seeing "Transformers" and I hope that it will be one of this year's best films and also that Mr. Bay continues to make films of this quality.</fullReview>

(dont know about that bit!) secondly i do not recall in the film anyone mentioning that the on of the British coding machines had picked up the message that Pearl Harbour (sorry about the English I'm actually English!) was to be attacked by the Japenese, and also as mention in another users comment it would be very difficult for a USAF pilot to join the RAF, and then win the Battle of Britain?!?! We did that extremely well ourselves thank you, remember Britain did create the Spitfire (possibly the greatest machine ever built) and also had such inspirational people as Douglas Bader (see, Reach for the skies)leading squadrons. So to sum it all up it was awful should never have been made and if people are now gathering historical information from films then the Director/writer should be punished.Mark Walker</fullReview>

The special affects were amazing and the bombing scene was breath-taking! During the bombing scene i was crying because here i grew up just knowing that the Japenese bombed Pearl Harbor and that was about it! Pearl Harbor is not just a remarkable film, it teaches the real event that happen on December 7. The next time your at blockbuster and your in the mood for a great love story or a extraordinary film or both, rent Pearl Harbor and you wont be disappointed!</fullReview>

The 45 min. attack on Peral Harbor was spectacular. It didn't let me or anyone i knew down. The first hour of the movie was devoted to developing relationships which makes the film more personal and ends up with almost everyone crying at the end. This movie was truly spectacular. Almost no other movie of this scale has a personal feel and all the explosions you expect come threw. Everyone in America at least should see this movie.

		<fullReview>When we like a movie, my daughter and I have been known to see it more than once, but we've never seen a movie as often as we saw Pearl Harbor. When it first came out, my (then) 15-year-old daughter and I saw it 11 times in the theater. Now, 4 years later, I'm still surprised it didn't get better ratings/reviews than it did.I know some people complain that the movie was historically inaccurate (so, maybe they should go watch a documentary), but this movie made us feel many things?a sense of our history, patriotism, pride that our country pulled together then and optimism that it can do so again, and gratefulness to those who make our freedom possible. The flying scenes were exciting, and the bombing scenes were intense (and maybe overlong). Some of the hospital scenes were haunting, and gave a strong sense of the horror and confusion of that day.We loved the old-fashioned love story. I don't understand why some people complain about a love story being put in the context of a movie like Pearl Harbor?in real life, I'm sure hundreds of the people affected by Pearl Harbor were in the midst of their own love stories. And, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett get our votes as romantic heroes any day. We still love this movie.</fullReview>

The effects were EXCELLENT and the acting was EXCELLENT and it was VERY relevent and realistic. Have you watched the documentary on the history channel on Pearl Harbor? It's almost EXACTLY like the movie! The movie sticks to the facts, while touching your heart, and expanding your emotions. This movie definitely deserves a 10. For excellent directing, producing, acting, historic references, stunts, and effects. Just look beyond the story, and into HOW the movie was made. Watch it again. Pay attention to the details.

Don't knock this film till you see it, afterwards, only knock it if you hate it not because of the history. It was pretty accurate to the history actually. Just my 2 cents</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A blockbuster with real quality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**Okay, I would first like to ask all the critics to get off Pearl Harbor's back. In a Michael Bay-directed, Jerry Bruckheimer-produced summer event film, you can not expect Shakespeare in the drama department. If you go in with that in mind, Pearl Harbor will reveal it's quality to you, through it's great action, patriotic feel, and the extremely appealing performances of the three leads. Ben Affleck is a potent leading man. His best performance was in Bounce, but this one ties with Good Will Hunting as a close second. He broods, romances and cries with equal fervor. Kate Beckinsale fits nicely in the film in a strong performance, sharing chemistry with both co-stars. Josh Hartnett is given a kind-of thankless role, but he is strong, charming, self-deprecating and touching at the same time.And- SPOILER AHEAD-- what girl wouldn't swoon at that love scene!! The bottom line is that Pearl Harbor suffers from the prejudice of movie critics who STILL don't realize that summer is the time to be entertained above all. Pearl Harbor accomplishes this while still being the best film that Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer have ever done. I can't help but wonder what the reviews of Pearl Harbor would have been like if it had been released last December, the original date for release. Maybe Gladiator wouldn't have taken home that Oscar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was wonderful.Personally, I don't comment on movies that I think are awful, because I feel that they are a waste of time. I only comment on movie that I truly feel are worth seeing. When I went into the cinema I knew I was in for a good movie. The commercials/trailers I saw were great so I was excited in seeing this movie.The action scenes were GREAT/EXCELLENT/OUTSTANDING there are not enough words to describe them. They had me at the edge of my seats, holding on to the sides of my seat in a tense position. I could not cry only when the credits came up because of how intense the action scenes were. I must admit I fell in love with Josh Hartnett. Maybe it was his voice/accent or maybe because he is just such a babe. He acted so well in this movie. So did Ben Affleck. Kate Benckinsale, who to be quite honest, I've never heard of her in my life was good. And the story line was beautiful.You can also go and take younger kids to see this. There are no senes that are horrible. Even the love scene between Kate and Josh is not bad. There are no naked bodies in this movie. So there is another good point that I will add to this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why so many people put this film down. Have you no taste?I found Pearl Harbor both action filled and touching, a romance set to the background of the planning and attack of Pearl Harbor. It's a touching film, and you really feel the American sailors fear and pain when the Harbor is obliterated. The best thing about the film is the musical score, composed by the talented Hans Zimmer. Truly touching and inspiring, a must see. *****/***** stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't what I expected. An epic film on the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, it was not. A story about two friends with a bond of the deepest kind, set around a historical event, and a pure, innocent, love story, it was.Having lived through such a bond of friendship, including the girl, I am sure I related to it in a way different from most. To me, it was very real and brought back wounderful memories and sad regret. Through all that is Hollywood, that is what I saw. But there is an even more important factor to be considered.Ben Affleck was the headliner in this movie. But in fact, the real headliner was Josh Hartnett, as Danny Walker. Hartnett played the role as good as it could have been played. Little known and little seen, (I had never heard of him before) Hartnett put on a performance head and shoulders above the rest. Perhaps Affleck did not have the best of material but his performance, except in the scenes after the Doolittle Raid, were only par. Hartnett sold me from the beginning and kept me interested until the end.It was a good movie. I have seen it twice and may go again. When it is released on video, I will own a copy. You can also be certain that I will go see other Josh Hartnett films. The guy is just that good an actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to watch the premiere of this movie a few days ago and it was undoubtedly one of the best movies i've ever seen. The action sequence was terrific, not forgetting the well-coordinated sound choreography that surrounded the cinema atmosphere. The movie kept me glued to the seat and stopped me from going to the restroom...especially the parts when Rafe and Danny did the death-defying stunts with the warplanes. Romantic and sad love story(or should I say stories) between the three main characters often made my eyes steam and I couldn't decide who to choose since Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett were both two very handsome actors... A definite 10 from me as I enjoyed both history and the storyline of this wonderful movie. And of course I would no doubt buy a copy of this movie and watch it over and over again. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading reviews by the critics I wasn't expecting much from this film so was pleasantly surprised by it.And yes, I'm a sucker for cheesy movies, and yes I wouldn't recommend this to those who are serious at heart. But for those who love to go and allow there brain to tune into something else for 3 hours then this is absolutely brilliant.I didn't feel like i was sitting there for 3 hours, probably because it was almost like watching two films. One of war and one of love. The love story was, yes, a bit iffy. But not unenjoyable. I laughed more times than I can count through some of the scenes.And the historical war scenes? However inaccurate they were, they were very enthralling. And of course, full of action.See it, it's worth the money, especially if you are a sucker for a feel good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains spoilerswell i have to say i am unbelievably surprised by the comments that people have left on here regarding pearl harbor. it opened in england yesterday and i went to see it this morning with my mom. from the opening scenes with danny and rafe as little boys i was spellbound. i loved this movie, i thought the love story between the 3 actors was well acted and well played out and it was entirely relevant to the story, it gave it a human side that prevents the sheer boredom of most movies about the war. as an english person i never fully understood the horror of what happened at pearl harbor until today and i am deeply ashamed that many english people today still criticise the americans for their participation in it. i adored ben affleck in this movie, he was so beautiful, brave and charming that i could of fallen in love with him right then and there. josh hartnett was amazing, best movie of his career so far, and kate beckinsale, outstanding. the special effects when the attack started are the best i have ever seen, it made me cringe and i was quite sickened by the whole thing. at the end however when rafe gets out of the plane, looks at evelyn and then they bring dannys coffin out, i have to admit i sobbed like a little kid, i was so upset, that is how much the movie had got to me. so the only thing i have to say about the critics who slammed this movie are, go get yourselves another job because you obviously cant recognise quality when you see it. congratulations and well done to all the actors involved and director michael bay, whose dream and vision made me weep. thankyou.. ten out of ten..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last night I went to see Pearl Harbor and it was the best film that i have seen since Gladiator! Jerry Bruckheimer's runs off bad luck is over now after making Gone In 60 Seconds and Coyote Ugly which was the worst movies that he have produces. Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) &amp; Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) are best friends which get caught in a love triangle with Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale). The love story of Pearl Harbor is better than Titanic's love story and the movie but it was not better than Saving Private Ryan but close.Overall: Ben Affleck at the start was awful but after returning from England he was better. Josh Hartnett was ace from start till finish and i'm also happy for him since that this is his first major film and first important character.I give this movie 10/10.</fullReview>

There was a mob scene outside the theatre this opening day afternoon (5/25/2001)that included protesters, photographers, and a line of ticket buyers that stretched around the block. It is beautiful to look at, has perfect sound, and wonderful special effects. Many "serious" film critics are blasting it.

She said it was a fake story line but the bombing was in fact outstandingly done. This movie plot is one I've never seen before. It's so Bizarre and nuts but at the same time romantic and full of drama. I loved the romance and love triangle, even thought I think Danny should've gotten the girl. This is my opinion, but in no way, should it deserve one star. Yes it is an extremely long movie. it is my favorite movie, and you could say I'm obsessed, but what really made this film amazing was the actors Kate Beckinsale and Josh Harnett. I love Josh and Kate. Ben Affleck didn't do the best drunk impression, but he still was good in this film. Best movie I've seen! 10/10 all the way. Boys might find this a one out of ten because of the romance. But girls would love this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Action-Drama Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, this movie is my favorite movie of all, even though it is heavily criticized, and the reason behind is because of these:First point: We all know that what happened in the actual Pearl Harbor attack was just bombing and nothing else. That's why Michael Bay had to make a story out of it having the Pearl Harbor bombing as its theme because it would be boring to watch a film full of explosions without any revolving story. This is also the main reason why we could not sue the producers for all the historical inaccuracies because in the first place, they haven't claimed that the story was a true story nor based from a true story.Second point: The heavily criticized part of the movie was of the love triangle, but I see it the other way around. They have just put some sort of convolution on its plot and they have chosen romance particularly love triangle, because it would be the best way to put drama in it and is the best way to put the people into the shoes of the characters, especially because the target audience of the film was not those who were living since 1941. Besides, having the romance on the first part gave the audience a hinge of feeling during the 40s.Third point: It was not only about romance that the story revolved on. It also was about the friendship of the characters, how it was destroyed by a simple love triangle, and how destiny made them push through with their lives. And this part is very touching and relatable.Literary wise, the techniques used by its producers were effective enough to raise the feelings of the viewers. The computer generated effects, on the other hand, used in the movie was simply amazing. It really looked like real. Hands down and thumbs up for that! The cinematography is to be critically acclaimed. It is obvious that the latter really was planned thoroughly and was given much effort.Congratulations to all the people behind this quite good movie and you deserve a perfect 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is one of my all time favorite movies, It has great actors/actresses and i personally think judged to harshly, it was much better that 5.3 out of ten i would give it a 9.1 out of ten bu just because on the CD with the soundtrack you don't get a few songs that were in the movie, Its historically accurate and definitely made me weep. This movie overall others has one of the best soundtracks ever. Ben Afflack has a great part and so does Alleck Baldmin. This movie really shows all aspects of the war, from Europe to Asia to right here in the U.S. i personally wish that more movies like this were made about different subjects, like maybe a Bismarck and a Lusitania movie would also be great. If you love WW2 movies and beautiful music than this is a movie you need to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as I'm concerned, there's nothing wrong with a portrayal of a usual romance where two people who fall in love near the beginning of the movie are destined to end up together by the end. Anyone arguing with this is either irritated by the film not just focusing on the war of that day, hates Ben or Kate or Josh, or hates the love triangle as opposed to what it should have only been and that is a two way romance between Ben and Kate. It got ridiculous once the writers brought the idea of a baby and a best friend rivalry thing into the mix.I haven't taken into account one thing said by bad reviews. I saw the movie at the cinema with friends and now own it because I loved it and still do. The war scenes are effective and emotional as they should be. There's no argument that Michael Bay should have focused only on the events of that day because he shouldn't - the lives of the main characters should have been and were covered as well. War romances were typical of those days so I don't see the whole big fuss about it. Ben and Kate do have chemistry in my view, although I'm not sure about Josh and Kate. Ben and Josh are great as Rafe and Danny, two lifelong best friends who are involved in the events of that tragic day and ultimately become heroes in the film. A special mention should go to the soundtrack of the film because that was spectacular and composed by Hans Zimmer who also did the music for Batman Begins. The music for the love story is particularly well-crafted.Overall I gave it full marks because I loved the movie, the soundtrack and the actors. Ben Affleck was the star of the movie, no matter what anyone else says about his acting.</fullReview>

Besides that this movie is a large slap in the face to all WW2 veterans alive and to those who died that day.Ben Affleck cannot act to save his life so why bother casting him in a movie this important. The script is filled with some of the worst romantic dialogue i've ever heard since Star Wars Episode 2 Attack of the Clones. Michael Bay is a very talented man but he needs to get someone to pick the scripts for him and make sure that he doesn't screw with them.This movie is not recommended for as history lesson. Go see movies like Tora Tora Tora or 30 Seconds Over Tokyo if you want to see how its really told.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If instead of calling this movie "Pearl harbor", they had called it, say "Enemy at the Port" (like they did with the movie on Stalingrad), I'm sure most viewers would have been more positive in their comments. Yes, it is set on and around Dec. 7, 1941, and the location is (mostly) Pearl Harbor, but the story could have been the same, and been called, say, Iwo Jima, or Tarawa, with the same romance (whether one likes romance or not is another thing altogether), and the war scenes could have been along the same lines, only in a different setting. The reason for the movie's low rating is simply that: people thought they would be seeing a movie on the historical Pearl Harbor events, and they left the theater bitterly disappointed. Agreed, Tora! Tora! Tora! is a much better historical movie. But don't go buy a 7Up and say that champagne is better -- they're not in the same league.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pearl Harbor" is an excellent epic in cinematic representation of the events surrounding the Pearl Harbor bombing and the Doolittle Raid. Though not entirely historically accurate, the story telling is great. It has an intricate plot in the 1940's setting and was a great way to combine a historical event with a dramatic story. "Pearl Harbor" has great special effects, wonderful music, and great performances from many good actors. The story has action, drama, and romance. I personally thought the movie was absolutely incredible and is unsurpassed. Anyone who loves a "Titanic" historic/drama style story would enjoy seeing this movie. If your into aviation, the story is about two pilots during the advent of the American involvement in World War II. If you love action, there is a lot of it here and special effects buffs would enjoy this movie as well. The story is a cross between the historic accuracy of "Tora! Tora! Tora!" and the romance drama of "Titanic." In conclusion, "Pearl Harbor" is a great movie and would be enjoyable to wide range of audiences. I recommend that you give "Pearl Harbor" a fighting chance and see it, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

Well, I want to know what is so wrong about making a love story surrounding people who lived in Pearl Harbor? I'm sure people were in love there, as people are in love everywhere. I don't see how it can be tasteless.The acting in Pearl Harbor ranges from decent to excellent. The screenplay is very good, as are the special effects.

		<fullReview>(!!Possible Spoilers!!) Well I just got back from watching 'Pearl Harbor' and I must say I am in absolute awe.. This definetly has to be one of the most amazing films I have ever had the privilege to witness.. The CGI/effects throughout the movie is amazing.. no.. Mind-Blowing!.. The aerial scenes are terrific.. Better than those of Star wars fame!! Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) have really outdone themselves and surely will win the Oscar For Visual Effects.. But what really got my juices flowing was the initial attack on 'Pearl Harbor'.. It was an eerie site following the 350 Jap Zero's on their way to bomb Pearl Harbor.. And once the bombing commenced all one could do was just sit and stare.. It was so realistic that it felt you were right there getting hacked to pieces by zero fire.. Kudos go to Michael Bay for staging the 40 minute attack sequence. Michael Bay is definetly one of the world's best action directors.. The action in this movie is absolutely amazing.. from the scenes of the Battle of Britain to the DoLittle raid.. amazingly crafted.... But what really spoils this film from being one of the great motion-pictures ever.. is the love story.. which is very ordinary.. and VERY cliche'.. The script is penned by Randall Wallace who co-wrote 'BraveHeart' and in his latest outing he hasn't delivered the goods. It was sadly just too predictable and corny. I won't go into detail about the love triangle because I don't want to spoil anything worth spoiling. Overall this is way above your average Summer 'Blockbuster'. The script is your ordinary Summer Blockbuster fare, but what seperates this gem of a film from the rest of the pack is the action which surpasses anything in modern cinema. I know that's one hell-of-a statement but it's true. The 'critics' (who I honestly think should go f*** themselves) have blasted this movie from every penetratable angle. Please people don't let these hypocrites deter you from witnessing the spectacle which is 'Pearl Harbor'. It is by far the best summer movie in the last decade and I highly recommend it. Just stay comfortable for the first hour so the love story can unfold then prepare to be dazzled.In my opinion I think this movie deserves 8 out of 10 on the imdb scale.. 2 off for the predictable love story..</fullReview>

What happened at Pearl Harbor is well documented, and it would behoove you to read it before stating ignorant half truths and showing the entire world what a buffoon you are. If you hate the movie fine, but don't hate it for it's portrayal of the Japanese or anyone else. Let bygones be bygones, but the Japanese invasion on Pearl Harbor was just what the movie portrayed: an unprovoked attack that left thousands of Americans dead. After the attack came the Doolittle raid, yes, but more importantly, a very long and grueling war on all fronts. If you must protest the American response, protest the bomb...oops too late. In retaliation for the most ignorant and thoughtless attack on American soil, the US destroyed an entire city in a matter of seconds. I'm not going to say that the US did right by dropping the A bombs on Japan, but I will not watch someone spout their mouths saying that the Japanese did not commit such an atrocity as was shown in the movie. The attack was real, the pain and death was real. Sometime take a flight to Honolulu and pay a visit to the Arizona memorial. Yell through the water to the bones of those still trapped inside that they only died because they were in the USNavy during a war, and that the Japanese did not attack them and kill them in cold blood. Again, learn some history before spouting that garbage, please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The critics panned this film because of the love triangle; they felt it was corny. Those who want to view a 100% authentic historical report of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had better look elsewhere. The producers never said it was a historical documentary. Even the critics admitted the portion of the film showing the attack was commendable. The photography and special effects were stunning.I was shocked at the scene of the Japanese attacking military hospitals; hopefully that wasn't the case. Critics of this film might prefer "Tora,Tora,Tora". I enjoyed this film despite its length and never felt that it showed accuracy in all aspects. Those critical of "Pearl Harbor" would have a field day tearing-apart the megahit "Titanic".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is this movie rated poorly. It was a good movie it diserves a good rating. Sure it wasn't as gory as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but gore and violence dosen't make a good movie. It depends on the story and the plot also with war movies if it was historicaly correct. And according to my history teacher (Mr. Miller) PEARL HARBOR was historicaly correct (except for the character, obviously) he also said that most people hated it cause of the love story thrown in there but he told me that it happened in real life (the fact that the guy was shot down and she moved on). Also the music was great. I don't remember any music in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. If the critics have convenced you that this movie stinks don't listen to them this movie was great. If you haven't seen it go and see it, it is worth the money you pay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was terrific. The story was interesting and the war scenes were remarkable. Kate Beckinsale's beauty, like that of Catherine Zeta Jones in Zorro, jumps off the screen. But what I really want to talk about is the disservice done to movie goers by the critics. I have read the reviews in USA Today, the Chicago Tribune, and Roger, "I still haven't been right about a movie" Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times. Ebert gave this movie 1 star. This is the same m***n who gave A Knight's Tale 3 stars. Pearl Harbor was exciting, the acting was excellent, and the actors quite appealing. The scenes of December 7, 1941 were as good as war movies get. For those of you who liked "Saving Private Ryan," this is much better. For those of you who hated "Saving Private Ryan," you will like this movie. It is more interesting and much less manipulative than Spielberg's alleged classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Bay's fourth film is better than three, and more exciting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Armageddon received mixed reviews from moviegoers and critics, everybody wondered what would be next for Bay. When it was announced that Bay would be doing a movie on one of the biggest events in US history, it was met with mixed reactions. How can this man who did three mediocre action films bring something as big and dramatic as Pearl Harbor to the screen? Bay stated that the movie was aimed for young children and teens to give them an education about the bombing of Pearl Harbor. I think for the most part Bay succeeded in that department. He includes a two hour romance between two pilots and a nurse while trying to make a classic picture like the old days. The acting by the cast is surprisingly good for this movie. Affleck comes through here in the eyes of women, but men might hate his style. Hartnett does a good job, and you sympathize with his character. Beckinsale is so damn pretty, she does a good job playing the gentle and caring Evelyn. The screenplay by Randall Wallace has it's flaws with dialogue, but he gets the job done putting all the stories together. The Japanese scenes are well acted and stunning to look at, and the films big 45 minutes are perfect, and may entertain the people who find this movie bad. This is not a bad movie, and deserves better reviews than it received. I would rank it third on Bays best movie list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a bit disappointed when I heard the reviews of this film, having viewed the trailer. It was mentioned that there was only forty minutes of actual action, and the rest was a 'want-to-be' Titanic.However having watched the film, I don't understand where these views were coming from. From the start to the finish, three was pretty much none stop action. From the events of Rafe and Danny's childhood, to the bombing of Tokyo, there was always gripping drama. So there was a bit of Romance, but who cares, we want the characters to be heroes, not robots.As for the comparisons with Titanic, well they were ludicrous quite frankly. The only comparison I can see is that in some point in both films a ship sank.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, I'm quite surprised by how many people dislike this movie. Then again, whenever a blockbuster movie about a historical event comes out all people can ever talk about are the historical inaccuracies. I'll admit that I don't know much about what happened at Pearl Harbor, but what I do know was quite accurate in the movie. People act like movies like these are suppose 100% correct. If you want to watch a movie like that go pick up a documentary on Pearl Harbor instead of watching a movie that is obviously going to have some fiction in it to attract More people to watch it.I enjoyed this film because it was shot excellently and the special effects were amazing. The main reason I watched it in the first place was because I heard about the dramatic romance (I am a chick after all), but even I thought it was a little cheesy. The writing in some of those scenes were a little over the top, as if anyone would ever say, "I'll never look at another sunset without thinking of you". I think, however that the love story brought more feeling to the movie. It made it seem more real, people that had loved ones were dying.The movie might not be a number one in any aspect (writing, directing, acting), but I think it deserves a little more because for a blockbuster movie, it was pretty good. I mean, look at some of the crap that is being put on the big screen nowadays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Danny and Raif have been friends since childhood and now they're in the Army as two of the best pilots in the squadron. You quickly been drawn into their friendship. This is the kind of friendship that lasts your whole life -- a friend that is more than a friend but a sibling of the heart. Soon after you meet them as adults you learn the Raif has volunteered to fight for the British in WWII since the US has not yet entered the War and he's been accepted. Then you meet Raif's true love Evelyn. They have what you think is that meant to be kind of love. Very sweet, romantic and then he breaks the news that he's going to war. Danny is angry that Raif is going but not angry enough to end a friendship and Evelyn is of course upset that he is leaving as well, but he goes anyway. Before he leaves he tells Danny if anything happens to me you have to be the one to break the news to Evelyn. Well as if a sense of foreboding Raif's plane crashes and all believe that he is dead. Sharing a common grief together Danny and Evelyn fall in love. Then Raif comes back, turns out he managed to survive the wreck. But this is months later. Raif obviously feels betrayed and you under go the awful feeling of betrayal, a forever kind of friendship in danger and a woman stuck in the middle in love with both men. To top this all off there is a surprise bombing of Pearl Harbor. This movie has some excellent action scenes, the actors and actresses put in a stellar performance showing us pain in the rawest form. Danny and Raif show the kind of bravery from which medals are earned. Throughout this movie you will experience love, conflict, War and loss. While it does bear some resemblance to Titanic because it re-enacts an epic in history and includes the element of love, this is not Titanic. This movie is like Titanic meets Saving Private Ryan, but much, much more. It is an amazing movie. A definite must see. I can't tell you how it ends though because then why would you want to see the movie? It's worth the ticket and the time!</fullReview>

A movie has never touched me so much and Im not even American. It is a bit of a typical war love story but still good with great actors.I liked the fact that it didnt end straight after the attack, but showed another event, which gave it a sad, but good ending.It certainly deserves alot more praise than it has received.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I simply do not understand why some people have to totally dis this GREAT movie! I have seen this movie once in May, once in June, and once in July, hopefully another few times! I love this movie because of the amazing actors, heavy action, helpful history, and of course love story. If those people think it's so bad, then why the heck did they go see it? I mean, it really can't be that bad! The worst movie I have seen, is the horrific "The Blair Witch Project" because I was not horrified by the story, I was horrified of the bad actors and bad story. "Pearl Harbor" Is definitely my favorite movie! This is why:1. Josh Hartnett (no doubt, I mean it goes without saying! He is such a talented actor that needs this attention! People need to know that he is out there! I myself am very proud of him! Not to mention, his charming looks!)2. The, what I call "Half and Half Strategy." Half was romantics, and half was for stunt maniacs. And of course, since I loved this movie, I have both halves.3. Worth the 3 hours and $7.25.So go see it!! I couldn't help but see it 3 times (to date) and I'll probably see it many many more times, because it is so extremely good! Don't listen to the negative critics, movie-goers, and newspapers. Just listen to people like me, including the critics and newspapers that sound like me! I repeat: GO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!! Don't wait!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was absolutely phenomenal - I rated it a ten - but I would not call it a "great movie." The reason I avoid that phrase is because of the connotation involved. I will not see Pearl Harbor over and over again, I will not buy the soundtrack, and I will not put the poster on my wall. Here's why:World War II is an incredibly serious subject, and I feared upon going into the movie that it would be treated lightly or with sensationalism. Fortunately, the makers of the movie were much more sensitive than that. What we saw was a very real story about very true people. The mixing of fact and fiction was miraculously executed, and it stirred the deepest of emotions within me.I gained new respect for my grandfather, who fought this war. I realized as I watched that if it happened today, it would be my own brother battling to survive the fire and water of the Pacific. I saw the film bear witness to children and the innocent and even the Japanese - for everyone who enters a war thinks God is on his side. Most of all, I found myself thinking about my own inner self. Had I been in that hospital alongside those nurses, would I have been able to save those lives? Could I have made the tough decision?Most of all, I left that theater knowing that we must do everything we can to stop this kind of war from ever happening again. At one point, a Japanese soldier calls his commander "brilliant." The commander's response? "A brilliant man will find a way not to fight a war."Thank you, Michael Bay, for using the genre of film more responsibly than anyone I have ever seen. Thank you, Randall Wallace, for writing a screenplay that shows respect for life instead of joy in fiery death. And thank you to every name shown in those credits scrolled by - I stayed to read every last one. Thank you for changing my heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the music fades, and the screen blackens, one can hardly help but sigh. The movie was good; it was darn good. Everything about it. The acting, directing, music, and the incredible CG were wonderfully combined to form the summer blockbuster Pearl Harbor. Upon reading reviews of this film, it is hard not to notice the terrible blasts it has been receiving from seemingly heartless movie critics and viewers. They complain and complain about it, when they fail to see what it truly is: a tale of "the end of innocence... and the dawn of America's greatest glory." What better way to show this, than with a love story, which is what Pearl Harbor is above all. It is a love story involving three characters, and how the unthinkable at Pearl Harbor shaped their lives, as well as the lives of Americans all over the country. Its purpose was not to perfectly document the events that occurred on that fateful day in December 1941, but rather to show in a way that only Hollywood can, the sights, feelings, and agony that there must have been on that day; and to show younger generations an era in which men and women were so willing to put their country above themselves. Pearl Harbor successfully captures the brutality of war, and the courage of the men and women who fought it. It is an epic tale of love and war, and a time when heroes would rise and fall; but America would prevail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before seeing this film it is important to note the following:1. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer 2. Directed by Michael BayConclusion: Expect a high concept storyline, a script laden with testosterone, stunning visuals edited within an inch of their life, a rousing soundtrack (preferably by Hans Zimmer), a bit of humour, a bit of sadness, and a HUGE amount of "God bless America".With this in mind, and with all expectations of a thought-provoking, 'sensible' film thrown away, Pearl Harbor is the ultimate summer popcorn movie. Clearly, not everyone likes this type of film, and if your enjoyment of a film depends on the script and the quality of acting then this film could quite possibly make you ill. I think it's reasonable to say that if you didn't like Armageddon, you'll hate this. That's not to say that fans of Armageddon will necessarily like this as much.In Armageddon, Bay had 2 1/2 hours to try and fit in as much action as possible and the tone was decidedly tongue in cheek. With Pearl Harbor, Bay and Bruckheimer have tried to go more serious by following the Titanic-approach of a doomed love-story. While this does produce a more emotional ending, it comes at the price of action and pacing. The first hour deals mostly with romance and really could have been cut down a bit. We get some relief with the English/German dogfight sequences which are the first suggestion that we are going to witness something truly breathtaking later. In fact, though this first hour and a half feel slow and tedious at times, this makes the Pearl Harbor attack all the more exciting by contrast.The 35 minute attack is incredible with Bay's kinetic action style finally given a chance to shine. There are similarities in technique to Saving Private Ryan but so what. There are more than enough highly-original shots to compensate for the seen-it-before stuff.After the attack, the film never slows down again, since it tones down the romantic plot and concentrates on the more traditional Bruckheimer "let's kick the bad guys' asses" plot. Consequently, the film becomes decidedly more Armageddon-y with numerous rousing speeches, heroic slow-motions, tough training for a dangerous mission, and an upbeat ending tinged with tragedy before the credits role accompanied by a cheesy, charts-friendly, love anthem.Ideally, the love story could have been shortened at the start because Bay is an action director and romance has never been a strong point in Bruckheimer films. In fact, like the Rock and Armageddon, it is the male bonding that produces the more powerful emotional connection.Pearl Harbor is at the top of its genre - big, loud and, assuming you can switch your brain off, very emotionally powerful. It is not a Titanic, it is not a Saving Private Ryan and to compare it to such films is unfair to the intentions of the film-makers. It is an action film and Michael Bay has yet again proved that in this field of visual entertainment, he is the best of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quintessential Hollywood Big production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor Pearl Harbor is Hollywood at its most ambitious. From glossy photography, beautiful wide-angle shots, eye-widening special effects and exceptionally good-looking people playing the lead characters, it offers a lot of eye candy to those who are willing to sit through the long movie. In fact, it reminds me of a big cake with a recipe in which the makers tried to include all the tried-and-true ingredients of a commercially successful movie: visual treats, humor, drama, action and a story involving love, passion, friendship, vengeance and a good dose of patriotism. It almost seems as if director Michael Bay wanted to challenge the audience with all these elements to be entertained by a movie twice the length of a typical feature without lapsing into boredom. If that was the challenge then he succeeded: it was entertaining, it really did not feel like three hours, and I, at least, did not feel bored at any time during the movie.My impression is that most of the negative reviews are critical of the movie because they are looking for something that went beyond its intentions. Definitely, A Saving Private Ryan this movie ain't. But I believe that one should evaluate a movie, as one would any other work of art, for what it is and not for what it should be. Take the love story, for example. It has been criticized by many as being extraneous. It is true that a story about philosophical and ethical questions raised by war (and treated in Ryan) would have been more fitting in the context. As it stands, the life-changing attack could have been replaced by a natural disaster without losing much from the gist of the story. But what would a quintessential great Hollywood production be without a love story? Besides, the beauty of Kate Beckinsale adds to the visual aesthetics. Another possible charge against the movie might be that it tends to glamorize war. That may be true, but again, this movie is not meant to be a propaganda call for arms, but just a few hours of good entertainment. I must admit, though, that in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks against the WTC, the reply of William Baldwin's character to a question-that if he ran out of plane fuel, he would `find the sweetest military target and try to kill as many Japanese as possible'- sent chills down my spine because it illustrated how righteous the terrorists must have felt. I suppose the recent events highlight the movie's rudimentary treatment of the philosophical issues and conflicts associated with war, especially if one considers the obvious similarities. In the end, if you eat this cake to be enlightened by some new insights, you will be disappointed. If you eat it, however, to enjoy it for its own sake, you will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't watch it solely for history's sake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor has been a source of both pride and outrage for Americans for decades and, in part, justified our use of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A movie based on these events, then, would need to be handled carefully in its attempt to stir patriotism without inflaming wounds from the past. In the rush of quasi-historical movies that have come in the past five years (reaching a box-office high with 1997's Titanic), the moviegoing public has demonstrated a willingness to sit through films they may have suffered through in grade school in order to get a better sense of what it was actually like to be there, to see the things that happened, to hear the whistles of bombs dropping in the air, and, above all, to experience what really happened.Michael Bay's presence can be seen throughout the entire movie's content. The special effects worthy of his previous endeavors (Armageddon; The Rock), but the character development is traditionally Bruckheimer-ish/Bay-ish. These are people who fall in love for no other reason than the fact that they're both young and in dangerous circumstances; the lead roles are bursting with machismo; the leading ladies manage to be both tough and feminine at the same time, without really being either. The major problem with these movies is that too much attention is dumped into the action and not enough into the characters performing the action, and this movie is no exception. Although it manages to stir the blood and capture our attention (the almost-three hour duration is hardly even noticed), in the end you get the feeling you were watching something between a football game and a soap opera.Ben Affleck plays Rafe, an aspiring hotshot pilot dying to get into World War II at a time when most of the U.S. was sitting uneasily on its haunches, watching the war with eyes askance. Josh Hartnett plays Danny, Affleck's friend from childhood and wingman (the two apparently followed their childhood dreams and enlisted together) while cruising in fighter planes. Typical for a Bruckheimer film, there is a deep connection between these two that the audience is left to infer rather than observe. The blooming romance between Affleck and Evelyn (Kate Beckinsall), his duty nurse during combat training, begins with a humorous and touching effect, but sooner or later we have to acknowledge the fact that they're in love because there's a war going on rather than any heartfelt connection made within three weeks' time. The secondary characters are memorable and their presence is not just to fill up a bunker with cadets, but rather to show us the unsung heroes of the war--the ones who weren't necessarily dashing and good-looking, but were called upon to fight, and did so with mettle and guts. Alec Baldwin and Jon Voight both give outstanding performances as Col. Doolittle and Franklin Roosevelt, respectively, but Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s performance is undeservedly short. The most grief we see in him is when he visits his commanding officer's coffin after the attack, a man he speaks perhaps three lines with on-screen. This type of pathos demands a lot of feeling for scarcely-viewed characters, and it gets in the way of many of the film's better points.The actual attack on Pearl Harbor is conveyed brilliantly. The opening shots depict scene after scene of idyllic island life marred by the roar of approaching enemy planes, and the assault on the military bases leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination as far as what conditions were like on the island that day. The tension, pacing and internal climax of each mini-story leaves you open-mouthed, waiting to see who will survive and who will make it through to fight back. The last third of the movie chronicles the redress to the Japanese and its effects on the country and the rest of the war. Sadly enough, at that point much of the tension established throughout the movie's depiction of the attack is diminished, but there is enough going on to keep you guessing as to whether or not Affleck and Hartnett are going to be able to survive not only the war, but the war's effects on their friendship.The historical and patriotic scope of this movie is not to be understated (although Yamamoto's lines seem scripted for this day and age and not for 1941), but the leading roles seem incidental compared with the scope of what really happened. It's unfortunate that Bruckheimer sees it as so necessary to rely on stunning visual and dramatic visual effects (for example, the fingers of the trapped soldiers in the slowly-sinking shift is too powerful for my poor words) while placing so much character development secondary. Learning to balance the two could transform a stunning movie into a truly timeless film.</fullReview>

While I was watching this movie, I felt such a strong connection with the characters. Watch this movie. You will not regret it! I don't know why there are so many bad reviews for such a great movie. One of the best movies I have ever seen because it teaches you about what happened and the CGI looks so real looking!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Bay clearly went to a lot of trouble and expense to film this reenactment of the events which led America into WWII. Unfortunately I have to agree with many of the other reviewers here and state that "Pearl Harbor" is not a very good movie. It has its points: The battle scenes are very well filmed and the attention to period detail is wonderful. The soggy love story at the movie's center is not.As with most epics, playing "spot the star" here is lots of fun. I didn't recognize Jon Voight as FDR. Colm Feore as Admiral Kimmel, Alec Baldwin as James Doolittle orchestrating the bombing of Tokyo, Dan Aykroyd as a military codebreaker racing against time to decipher Japanese messages - they're all great to watch. Cuba Gooding Jr. is also good as a black seaman who finally gets his chance to see combat during the raid.For good measure, Bay throws in the Tokyo raid which took place four months after Pearl Harbor. This makes for a good one-two plot punch, but the first hour of the movie with its excruciatingly slow buildup could and should have been chopped. I fast forwarded through a lot of it. The most ridiculous part of the film's plot has to be Kate Beckinsale's pregnancy, which is magically never visible even after the Tokyo bombing (by that point she'd have to be six to seven months along)! It's a miracle baby!If you're in the mood to see a lushly filmed modern take on Pearl Harbor and it's a slow afternoon, you'll probably enjoy this. If you want to see a more tightly filmed version, try one of the others such as "Tora! Tora! Tora!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor (2001, Dir. Michael Bay) It's a Sunday morning on December 7, 1941. After being presumed dead during the Battle of Britain, Capt. Rafe McCawley (Affleck) struggle in his relationship with Nurse Lt. Evelyn Johnson (Beckinsale), as well as his best friend, Capt. Danny Walker (Hartnett), who is also taking a shine towards Evelyn. Whilst this is going on, Japan are planning a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.It was possible for this film to be a classic but unfortunately is let down by the script. As well the long film length, the main storyline lacks the development needed, which is later wasted on unneeded characters. On a plus side, the special effects, like all Michael Bay films, are amazing and wonderful to watch.Are you gonna be a bad influence? - Nurse Lt. Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale) Of course I'm a bad influence. - Capt. Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really two movies, one good, one bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is actually two movies. There is the "human" element of the love triangle between Ben Affleck, Kate Hudson, and Josh Hartnett. Then there is the actual war film.The war film is one of the best I've ever seen. It's moving, it's well made, the effects are fantastic. They should also be commended for not portraying the Japanese as horrible, evil people. They humanized them, they made them people, not just enemies of America.There are shots and moments in the war film that made me hold my breath. There was beauty and sadness, and it's just well done.The love triangle, the romantic film at the beginning and end of the movie? One of the worst things I've ever seen. I had no sympathy for any of the characters, I had no reason to care for them. They were cookie-cutters of people, and they did the most idiotic things trying to make more romantic tension.If you could take out the entire love triangle, just remove it, you'd have an excellent film. Sadly, this one is just "ok" if you fast forward through those parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Could 'Pearl Harbor' (2001) be my least favorite movie of all time. Possibly. Michael Bay weaves what could be the worse piece of trash of all time.One might ask why I loath this movie so much. Let's take a look. The story is ridiculous. Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett are nothing but unlikeable idiots (played poorly by both actors), and makes people wonder what Kate Beckinsale (who is also poor in this movie) see in them. Michael Bay lack of detail in dramatic scenes is obvious, and makes one wonder why is he a such A-List director. Characters are poorly written and acted by every (who look like they're all doing it for the money only). It also makes the events of Pearl Harbor a small sub-plot to a god-awful sub-plot for a love triangle you can see in any other movie.To add to those, the film is riddled with Historical inaccuracies. Not to mention to ask why in gods name is Dan Aykroyd doing in this type of film. I'm going to end this review on this note, 'avoid at all cost!!!!!!!!!!!!!'</fullReview>

It has many extremely funny scenes even though it's supposed to be a wartime film. It's a great film of friendship, love, and sacrifices. Rafe and Danny( the main characters in the movie) were perfect examples of true friends and their friendship was very touching, even though Danny and Evelyn ended up together. I think this film was pretty good and the soundtrack is pretty amazing. I bought it and the songs are wonderful. Even though most movie critics detest this movie, Pearl Harbour is still a movie you shouldn't miss out on.</fullReview>

A lot of comments state the movie is inaccurate, and gives an example with Danny Walker (Hartnett) giving a radio message saying World War 2 has started. The reviewers in this case are inaccurate. He actually says "I think World War 2 has just hit us" - referring to just hitting America - as America was not involved military with the war prior to Pearl. Yes, the war had started long before that, but as also said at the end of the film in a quote by Evelyn (Beckinsale) - "World War 2 for us, began at Pearl Harbor."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a moral dilemma, Hollywood style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** may contain spoilers ***Let's get to the good part right away: the attack sequence is stunning. The visual effects are spectacular, and the sense of "you are there" is palpable. Plus, they portray the air raid itself with a reasonable degree of accuracy. (I appreciate strict adherence to historical accuracy as much as anyone, but we do have to remember, "Pearl Harbor" is not a documentary about the titular event.)Once we get away from the attack sequence itself, things start to fall apart. Quite a few continuity mistakes dog the film, making it hard to concentrate on the story itself. (Examples: a plane gets shot down in broad daylight and crashes into the sea, but when the pilot swims to the surface, it's night time. A train passing near what looks like the Rocky Mountains would not arrive in New York that same evening. Ships at sea don't sail so closely together that they look like a fleet of toy models in a bathtub.)The Japanese come off looking very cold and calculating. They always speak in rather stilted language ("we shall destroy the great American fleet" as opposed to, say, "we'll cream the jerks!") and the background music is a bit ominous whenever we see them making the pre-attack preparations. The film portrays the attack as being made as a result of the Americans cutting off their oil supply, but they never mention that the U.S. cut off their oil because they were conquering China and other places in Southeast Asia. So it makes it seem as if, for no good reason, we provoked the Japanese into attacking us. They show Roosevelt as badly wanting to help the British fight the Germans, but at least they stop short of suggesting that he knew about the Pearl Harbor attack before it happened, as some revisionist historians have suggested.And then there's the love story (actually a love triangle), "Pearl Harbor"s raison d'etre. Yes, it's rather sappy. But (and, judging by the other reviews, this appears to be a minority opinion), it's also reasonably engaging. Specifically, the filmmakers set up an interesting moral dilemma:if someone appears to be dead, is it wrong for the deceased's best friend and the deceased's lover to then fall in love with each other? And then, when they find out that the presumed dead person is in fact NOT dead after all, what should they do? Will the girl choose her first boyfriend or her second one? And will the best friend choose his friendship with his un-dead buddy, or his love for their mutual girlfriend? In a situation like this, there are no easy answers . . . except of course in Hollywood, where they arrange things in such a way as to work it all out much too neatly.Discounting the too-pat resolution, I did think that the film explored these issues in an interesting way. And here was one detail that I, for one, found quite refreshing: amazingly for a contemporary Hollywood production, one of the boyfriends refuses to hit the hay with the girl when the opportunity arises, because he does not want to ruin things between them. (Regrettably, the other guy doesn't have the same morals, so -- in typical Hollywood fashion -- the two new lovers get it on right away.)All in all, for a good, accurate portrayal of the air raid on Pearl Harbor (and the events leading up to it), skip this movie and see "Tora! Tora! Tora!" instead. For impressive special effects, actually, "Tora! Tora! Tora!" is quite good in its own right, but "Pearl Harbor" is amazing. If you want a sappy love triangle, "Tora! Tora! Tora!" will disappoint you, because it doesn't have one; the one in "Pearl Harbor" isn't too bad.My recommendation: see the movie, but don't expect much out of the first hour and a half. Just sit back and enjoy catching the mistakes. The attack sequence is worth the wait. After that, you can watch the love triangle get resolved all nice and neat, then get on with your life.</fullReview>

A love story in war, i don't think so. this movie rants and raves as a girl flick of a love story. Pearl Harobr was not a love story. It was a story of over 2,000 Americans being bombarded by the Japs. the girl i think was unattractive. but thank the lord that Ben's girl was not in that film. Ben Affleck should have died in that film like josh Hartnett. That was the only real part i liked besides the huge battle. i can't believe people like this film. it is a loss. Michael bay made this film by accident. the battle in fact was cartoonish. Planes could not fly that low and not be shot down. those planes were ten feet long and wide, and wight thousands of pounds. ridiculous. If you like this film, go shoot yourself! 5 out of 10 because of effects, cast members, and an o.k. battle sequence.</fullReview>

The focus of the story is on two lifelong friends and U.S. Army officers (Affleck, Hartnett) and their mutual affection for a dedicated Navy nurse (Beckinsale) in the moments leading up to the devastating attack by Japanese fighter pilots on Pearl Harbor. The film's first half holds your interest with believable characters, impressive set design, and a harrowing, over-the-top depiction of the attack itself, but then it drags on for another hour or so and leads up to an unsatisfying finale. Filmmakers only seemed interested in making the first half meaningful. **?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes Titanic Look Like A Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cameron must be thanking his lucky stars for Michael Bay, because a manipulative old clunker like 'Titanic' should've gone down irretrievably beneath the waves of movie history, never to rate another mention again. But then along comes Bay, and 'Pearl Harbor', and realisation dawns that Cameron is everything that Bay is not, viz: a director capable of managing a decent job no matter how dire the material.And dire 'Pearl Harbor' most certainly is, the screenplay scissored from out-takes of 1940s movies that, unlike this farrago of film-making, at least had the decency to come in on budgets of under fifty dollars. Bay's, by contrast, mops up sufficient funds to repay much of the Third World's debt, though to no other purpose except the dishonouring of the memory of what actually occurred whilst insulting the audience's intelligence in the process.Some, of course, may view it as fine entertainment, as does Bay and his writer. A pity, then, that the thought has never occurred to any of them that of all the explosions in this staggeringly inept setpiece, the biggest bomb of all is the movie itself.As other IMDb reviewers have pointed out, Richard Fleischer did it all so much, much better with Tora! Tora! Tora! Rating: 0 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor wasn't the only thing bombed in this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say about Pearl Harbor? When Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer set out to make this movie they wanted to make a powerful epic war film. They clearly missed the mark on this one. First of all who in their right mind would hire Michael Bay to direct a war film? I'll tell you who, Jerry Bruckheimer. The two together make a great team when making blow up action films, but dramatic movies are definitely not their forte. Michael Bay is no more capable of directing a war movie than David Lynch is capable of directing a movie that makes sense.However I can't completely blame Michael Bay for this awful movie, or Jerry Bruckheimer for that matter. Clearly one of the biggest problems with this movie was casting the whiny Ben Affleck in the lead role. He is the worst cast war hero in the history of war films. I would have been ok with it if the character was supposed to be a whiny wimp, in fact I can't think of anyone better to play that kind of character than Affleck, but they tried to make his character this heroic, cool, pilot. His performance was nothing short of pathetic. There were parts of the movie I enjoyed, but coincidentally all those parts were when Affleck was supposedly dead (to bad he wasn't). Every moment Affleck was on the screen I wanted to throw the remote control at the t.v. You might as well have cast his dorky brother Casey for this part, that would have been a heck of a lot better.The script definitely didn't help this movie much, but as a huge Randall Wallace fan I can't hold him responsible. He wrote the script that Bay and Bruckheimer wanted. Randall Wallace is a very corny dialogue writer and it usually works, in fact it's downright brilliant in movies like Braveheart and We Were Soldiers, but for some reason in this movie it just didn't work. Why is this? The answer is that he was just writing what they wanted, and who wouldn't write some sappy cornball movie when you're getting paid a truckload of cash.The acting overall was wretched. Even Tom Sizemore disappointed in this one, mostly because he was playing the same character he always does. But I can't write this review without giving credit to Josh Hartnett and William Lee Scott. They turned in great performances considering what they had to work with.All in all this movie was a sad excuse for a war film and an insult to the Pearl Harbor tragedy. Most of the time this movie looked like a pepsi commercial masquerading as a legitimate WWII movie. This movie was an insult to me as a fan of war movies and for that reason I can't recommend it. However if you like to torture yourself by watching garbage then by all means give it a whirl.1 out of 10 (would be lower but the scale doesn't go down to minus 347)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aloha film lovers! Many critics felt `Pearl Harbor' bombed at the box office. They also felt it bombed as a film altogether. However, I do have to strike back at these critics and inform them that "Pearl Harbor' was a very important film to make especially because of September 11. As most of us know, the film is based on that `day of infimacy' when the island of Pearl Harbor was `turning japanese'; we really think so. The movie also depicts a love triangle between two best friends air force fighters and a beautiful nurse. Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett execute decent perfromances in parts I am sure they fought hard for to get. Kate beckinsale is on her way to be registered as star in the making in her breakthrough role as the conflicted nurse. So make it a `harbor night' and battle your way to view `Pearl Harbor'. **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you ever realize how even BAD films are good in a way? Think of Ed Wood and his modern day counterpart Lloyd Kaufman. These films are bad, but they don't try to be good, so they suceed at some level because the filmmakers liked them (and at least one or two other people.) PEARL HARBOR is not the worst film of all time, by all standards. It has cutting edge visual and sound effects, and was a minor box-office success. The extravagant DVD box set must have sold even more copies, which is shocking. Whereas TITANIC lacked a story, there were a few good performances and the FX were pretty damn good. PEARL HARBOR has the worst acting and the worst screenwplay I've ever seen in a big budget film. The destruction sequences would have been ten times as apalling if they weren't already used in TITANIC, and the cast is awful. Ben Affleck is not a very good actor. Neither is Josh Hartnett or Kate Beckinsale. Michael Bay is actually an excellent director, and a proven box-office staple. But that doesn't prevent this movie from being terrible, and inspiring a new generation of poor-quality cinema. F</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its not that bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think sometimes people find it easier to jump on a bandwagon, that way they don't have to think for themselves. As Brad Pitt's character said in '12 Monkeys', "there's no right or wrong, there's only popular opinion." That seems fitting in the case of this movie. Its just not as bad as I was led to believe by movie reviewers, movie fans and Joe Sixpack on the street. Believe me, I know bad..I hated 'Armageddon' and that was bad!Of course its corny. Of course the romance is strained at times and sugarcoated. This is where the gap between the generations shows its teeth. Audiences today are unwilling to transport themselves to a time and place when life was probably a lot more joyful. Crime was not that much of an issue, there was no television, and a slice of Wonder Bread was as good as it got. People talked corny because the movies they were seeing at the time were like that! So I think you have to remember that when jumping all over the script. I do see a problem with some of the acting, for part of the movie at least. I didn't buy Affleck for a second and for my money he made a ton of bad acting choices. He had no chemistry with either Hartnett or Beckinsale and I just don't see him as a leading man at times. I did in 'Chasing Amy' and maybe he's more comfortable in movies like that, so maybe he should stick to that. He knew this was a romantic war epic and Kevin Smith was nowhere to be found. Hartnett is much more emotionally available but still has a lot to learn. Beckinsale also seems a little uncomfortable with the material at times. But all problems were overcome with the extensive attack scene, which is exceptionally well-done from all angles. In movies like this, if I can sense the terror, if I can get a glimpse of what that must have been like, then I am grateful. The terror was encapsulated in the screaming plea of an extra, 'I CAN'T SWIM!' Whoever that guy was, he acted his pants off and showed me a soul in distress. That is probably very hard to do, also..show that in two seconds of screen time. Then the hospital scenes were also very well done. The chaos that occured had to have been unimaginable. As a New Yorker who was 2 miles from the WTC when it was hit, I cannot begin to know what being attacked was like..but I do live here so it did happen in my hometown. That day I had to walk home (that's not a complaint) and on the way I spoke to several people (that's not a complaint either). I remember saying to one guy, "This is Pearl Harbor" and that was before I saw the footage of the buildings going down, or this movie. But the movie hit me harder than it normally might have because of the 9/11 attacks. Seeing Americans being murdered in a surprise, cowardly act does not get all that much easier with time, unfortunately. For the people around in 1941, these events were profoundly disturbing. Everyone that complained about 'Titanic' and 'Pearl Harbor' was really just complaining that no one in either movie had a cell phone. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most people, I wouldn't rant about "Pearl Harbor" as a movie on its own merits. There are stunning visuals, but the plotting and acting is a little too syrupy.However, because "Pearl Harbor" is a true story, at least in the big themes, I felt a deep connection with this film. I got the sense that even the cheesy bits were flashes taken from the real lives of real people. These were people I wanted to understand and empathize with. The film did that for me.I've always avoided war movies because the basic point is usually, "war is hell". Of course it's hell, and I don't need to relive a horror and get the requisite trauma and nightmares. But Pearl Harbor, while it had plenty of the horrors of war, did a good job of presenting reality without bringing the horror so close that I couldn't bear to watch it (as in "Black Hawk Down"). The film is rated PG.So, while I would recommend "Saving Private Ryan" instead, Pearl Harbor in my mind is certainly worth watching and a good idea for anyone who wants an appreciation for war without a surround-sound nightmare of reliving it too closely.Who should see this film:-- War film buffs with nothing better to do on a rainy day-- Schoolkids and others who'd like to appreciate the sacrificesmade in WWII but who'd avoid the tougher, bloodier war films.This one is safe and has something to say despite thesimplistic love triangle.I'll give "Pearl Harbor" a probably-undeserved 9 out of 10 because it pays respect to a real life event whose victims deserve honoring.</fullReview>

I was ready to turn the movie off but then Ben Affleck's character "died" and the romance between Harnett and Beckinsdale began to bloom. That kept me hanging on long enough to see the actually attack on Pearl Harbor which was so interesting I couldn't take my eyes off the t.v. The special effects were so good and for the first time in my life I really understood how horrible that day really was. Comparing that day to September 11 now makes sense.The best performance I think was by John Voight who should win something for his portrayal of FDR. Cuba Gooding, Jr., Alec Baldwin and Dan Akroyd were okay too.Please go see this movie. If you don't want to see the love story then fast forward it to the attack scene.This movie gets an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie...better if a love story was not worked in there...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film for the first time around the holidays...This was a quality film, even though it was not totally historically accurate...I am someone who enjoys historical type films...This film for the most part was based on the American point of view of the Attacks on Pearl Harbor, or at least that is what it seemed like to me...I think the love story slowed it down at times, but the special effects and battle scenes were unbelievable...Not sure if I would put this film as one of the best WWII films...It does have some potential, though...Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett were good in this film...If you do have a DVD player, you might even want to pick this one up for the special features as well...There is a documentary on Pearl Harbor which is fantastic and also Faith Hill's video for 'There You'll Be' is on it as well...One film I will recommend you see as well on the story of the Attack of Pearl Harbor is 'Tora! Tora! Tora!'(1970)...that one gives both the American as well as The Japanese sides of what happened, where this one gave the Americanized version only, or that is at least what I got out of it...If you do watch this movie('Pearl Harbor'), I'd be interested in what you thought of this film...I would definitely recommend this film, but will also let everyone know that it is not totally historically accurate...keep that in mind as you are watching it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was exactly like I expected. OK, it was a bit predictable. And all the historic aspects were known as well. At least, it must have been for all the Americans who have watched it. But the special effects were beautiful and it was really interesting to see everything that happened at Pearl Harbor. In short, it was a really cool movie. Not the best I've seen this year, but certainly a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low Expectations - Great Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is the critics' problem with this picture? It at no time sets itself up to be Ibsen, so they shouldn't be surprised that it does exactly what it promises on the poster - provide a professional, superbly made, three hours of entertainment with absolutely brain-popping special effects! If you want art, go to a gallery. The first moving picture that charged admission was simply a film of a train coming into a station. It made a fortune. The point here is that the movies were never designed to be an art form, they are intrinsically a special effect, an entertainment, and this film delivers that sumptuously. Having seen it, I don't know how they managed to make it for $150,000,000!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When PH came out, I thought I read somewhere about the differences between it and "Tora! Tora! Tora!" Funny, but the stories mesh fairly well. Both include the African-American cook who heroically climbs into an anti-aircraft gun to defend his shipmates (in PH he's a central character; in TTT he's just a few seconds of film). Both focus on the bomb that sank the Arizona. Both focus on what the U.S. might have known in advance of the attack.TTT has a more documentary feel, and as such, its information seems more reliable. PH has much greater visuals.And PH tries to graft a love story onto history. I thought James Cameron pulled it off well in Titanic. Here, the love story seems out of place. In Titanic, the DeCaprio-Winslet tryst was functional to the plot -- it led the viewer to all parts of the mighty ship. The PH love triangle does little more than add a little spice to what would otherwise be a heckuva film. Or maybe without the triangle, the movie becomes TTT.But what I think PH does better than TTT is in visualizing the heroism of the soldiers, sailors and nurses who were under attack. You can't walk away from Pearl Harbor without a deep, abiding respect for the men and women of World War II.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie! I thought the cast did a great job, but my favorite was Josh Hartnett. I thought Ben Affleck's character, Rafe, acted unfairly toward Danny after he showed up alive. Did he expect Evelyn to mourn his loss forever and never move on with her life? It's not every day someone you love comes back after being presumed dead. I found myself totally glued to the screen during the movie, but especially during the attack scenes, they were amazing. Usually I can't sit through war scenes because I get too squeamish. I don't cry at many movies, but I cried a lot at this one, especially during the last two scenes. I thought it could have focused a little more on the attacks, etc, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. I personally enjoyed it better than Titanic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so bad after all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, okay. So Alec Baldwin's lines were melodramatic and silly. So Ben Affleck still strikes me as an actor who belongs in another Silent Bob film instead of weeping all over the screen with Hartnett and Beckinsale. "Pearl Harbor" is, nevertheless, a pretty good 3-hour ride. No, this is not "Titanic 2" -- although, sometimes it tries to be -- a disaster epic sandwiched between a romantic storyline. But this is still Michael Bay's best stuff: special effects that blow "The Rock" and "Armageddon" out of the water to accompany a love triangle that's actually believable. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another puff piece from the master of puff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the choice between producing a popular film and a great film, producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Armageddon, Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop, ConAir) will always choose the popular film. He is nothing if not consistent. His films always make lots of money and seldom deliver much more than slick eye candy for the masses. Bruckheimer has a golden opportunity to depart from his blockbuster mentality with this film, but he goes with his business instincts rather than taking a chance with a filmmaker's approach. The result is another big budget crowd pleaser with a cotton candy plot and terrific battle scenes, aided by impressive digital effects.The script by Randall Wallace of `Braveheart' fame is the biggest problem. Wallace is clearly capable of writing an engaging script, but that obviously isn't what the boss wanted. It seems that Bruckheimer has Titanic envy and tries to use the same formula of wrapping a piece of history around a love story. Either that or he is trying to follow in the footsteps of `From Here to Eternity', the much acclaimed 1953 story that occurs as a prelude to the attack on Pearl Harbor. However, FHTE did not pretend to be a story ABOUT Pearl Harbor, and only included the attack as another disruptive event in an emotionally tumultuous story. While FHTE was a gripping and powerful story of love, hatred, lust and honor, PH is a trite and predictable love story that serves an interminable prelude to 30 minutes of terrific battle scenes. The inadvertent love triangle between best friends could have been predicted by a teenager (which seemed to be the target audience of this film, based on the PG rating and the sappy dialogue). And of course the resolution of the dilemma is just as neat and obvious. Personally, I would have preferred it if they had killed Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) in the attack and given Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) an opportunity for some real soul searching as they went on their top secret mission. But such nuance is far too risky for Bruckheimer.Director Michael Bay (Armageddon, The Rock) isn't known for his subtle and insightful direction of human stories. Bay is known for his explosions, and predictably the human story is bungled while the battle is extraordinary. Bay directs a period piece without much regard for understanding and reproducing the 1940's. It seems all he cares about is the military angle. The costume design and hair for the girls costumes was merely good while the military costumes are perfect. Mostly, the '40's feel is missing. The music is all wrong. It should have been big band music instead of the standard blockbuster symphonic compositions which did not fit the period at all. Various details are overlooked, like the fact that well more than half of young adults of that era smoked. Not one character in the film smoked, nor was there a single cigarette to be found in the nightclub scene. Rent any film from the forties and fifties and notice how many people smoke. Everybody. Another thing that is incredible is the fact that Evelyn, who was having morning sickness on December 7 is not showing in mid April, more than four months later. Perhaps if she were 200 lbs I could believe that, but the lithe Evelyn would have shown more than a little pooch by then.Also missing are the colloquialisms of the day. Not a single `swell', `dame', `jeepers' or `ain't' in the whole film. No Brooklyn or Chicago accents. Everyone speaks perfect twenty first century Funk and Wagnall's College English.The battle scene is a marvel of action filmmaking. It is highly realistic as a depiction of the battle, but there was a lot of cheating that didn't escape the notice of WWII buffs. It is pretty amazing that Bruckheimer got so much cooperation from the US government in being able to film in the Harbor. The government even loaned the production company numerous mothballed ships. Unfortunately, a lot of them were ships designed and built after WWII and they didn't bother to clean them up in post production. They built a complete digital world and left post WWII ships in the picture. That is just poor attention to detail in a film that is all about detail. Still, by any standard, this is fantastic action sequence that could not have been more realistic than had one actually been there.The acting is mixed. Beckingsale is excellent as Evelyn. She creates a very appealing romantic figure. Ben Affleck is too moody and sarcastic in the role. Josh Hartnett is much better, coming across as far more sincere and relating to his character better than Affleck. Affleck seems content to play Ben Affleck in uniform rather than trying to actually flesh out a character.Cuba Gooding Jr. gives an excellent performance in a minor role. Veterans Alec Baldwin and Jon Voight do a marvelous job as Colonel Doolitle and FDR.I rated this film a 6/10 on the strength of the visual effects. It would have been much better if it had been about Pearl Harbor instead of being a schmaltzy love triangle story that coincided with the attack. The entire event that is Pearl Harbor is shrouded in intriguing questions. Did Roosevelt know about the attack in advance and allow it to happen to get us into the war? Many historical facts indicate that was the case (it is thought to be more than just lucky that the aircraft carriers weren't in the harbor that day). What was really going on in the minds of the Japanese? Were the diplomatic efforts of the US designed to force the Japanese into attacking us as a matter of honor? As much as I despise Oliver Stone, this film would have been substantial if it had been done in his docudrama style (without the historical rewrites of course).Instead we have another puff piece by the master of puff. Thanks Jerry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS ALERT Pearl Harbour is the best film since Titanic. It is 3 hours long maybe a little longer, but in the first hour it lets you meet the characters in it. Theres Refe who is the father figure too Danny. Danny who is the person in the film who has a lot of feelings and he doesnt want his best friend to get hurt as he plays a bigger part of a pilot. Then theres the gorgeous Evelyn played by (Kate Beckinsale) who plays the women who is a nurse and she went out with refe some time back, and she happened to meet up with him again. In the second hour it shows you the complete bombing off Pearl Harbour and how terrible it was. In the third hour it showed you scenes like Danny getting killed. The funniest part i thought was when the pilots had to learn to fly off the edge of the boat, every time one person done it there would be an applause. I disliked the fact that the scenes off the bombing all happened at once which was a disappointment. this is truly a fabulous film because Kate Beckinsale plays the best parts, and she does it so well. WELL DONE KATE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frighteningly Realistic Depiction of the Attack on Pearl Harbor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pearl Harbor" re-creates the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The battle scenes using convincing miniatures, blended in with the latest in state of the art computer animation, give us a frighteningly realistic depiction of the that attack. The effects are so convincing that you believe that you are watching the real thing. But Hollywood makes the same mistake it made with that other epic, "Titanic" (1997)..it tacks on yet another syrupy love story. This time there is a love triangle involving Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett as gung ho pilots and Kate Beckinsale as a nurse. As in all love triangles with a war theme, you know that one of the principals will pay the ultimate sacrifice. The love story dominates the first hour of the film and drags on far too long. Once the attack begins we are treated to some of the most realistic battle scenes ever put on the screen. We are also made to feel the pain of the men and women who sacrificed their lives that day. The leads are OK however, the film would not have suffered too much had the love story been minimized. There also is a long list of familiar faces in small cameo type roles. Cuba Gooding Jr. stands out as the first black man to win the Navy Cross, Jon Voight does a good FDR, Mako is the Japanese Commander, Alec Baldwin plays the a pilot commander and Dan Aykroyd and Scott Miller turn up in other roles. All in all "Pearl Harbor" gets a passing mark based on its awesome battle scenes, but looses points for the over-long love story. Imagine the film that could have been had they filmed the attack around a story such as "From Here to Eternity" (1953).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen the movie "Pearl Harbor" and it truly touched my heart. I think it is the best movie I have ever seen. I wish everyone felt the same. I loved it the first so I went back and saw it a second time. I cannot wait until it comes out on video. After watching this movie it inspired me to join the Air Force when I graduate from college. Critics have been writing not-so-nice comments about the movie because it is too much of a love story. Without the love story included the movie would be very dull and boring and not many people would want to see it. I do not see how anyone could not love this terrific movie!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breath-taking...Passionate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3 hours...3 short, heart-breaking, elating, passionate, &amp; captivating hours...This movie was not only breath-taking, it was acted with so much passion and feeling; the actors made it very believable. The cast was top-notch and so outstanding. I don't see any room for error with Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, Josh Hartnett, Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight, &amp; Cuba Gooding Jr. As for the love story, it was creative with a tragic twist. I heard radio DJ's saying how the movie focused for like an hour and a half on the love story before Pearl Harbor was bombed; yeah, well, it was the same way in Titanic. Personally, I feel this movie was 100% better than Titanic.As a movie-fanatic and fan of US History, I found this movie to not only be unique and intriguing, but touching and sad. I definitely recommend 'Saving Private Ryan'. It was a movie I intend on going to see again &amp; again &amp; buy...everyone should see this movie; to remember "the day that will live in infamy".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just because this is the most anticipated movie for the summer, it's not good enough a reason for people to pick on it that hard. Come on, people, let's face it: This movie provides:1) A fairly accurate re-enactment of what happened on Dec. 7, 1941 in Pear Harbor, good history lesson if kids haven't learned it;2) brilliant special effects on the attack;3) yes, a cliched war love story, but why not? Love is after all a very cliched thing. What else matters if it touches our heartsand make us feel for the heroes?4) make-believe performance by three leads and supporting actors, esp. young Josh Hartnett stands out as a promising new talent;5) beautiful music score and excellent sound effects.What else can you get for nine bucks? Just because some snobbish critics said something, you don't have to be part of the flock.Go to the theater, and you will enjoy the three hours!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extraordinary film, despite critics' ridiculous opinions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor has caught a large amount of negative attention. Do not listen to the critics, who claim it is a let-down, and a bad film. Pearl Harbor is a surprisingly realistic portrayal of the events that took place in 1941. Obviously, the elements of love are fictional, but many of the other items in the movie are authentic. The action in this movie is amazing, some of the best action and special effects in recent years. Some people complain it takes too long to 'get to the action.' These people are un-patient, because without the first part of the movie, the entire story implemented in the movie would not work at all. The opening sets up the movie, and gives a better effect of the havoc the events at Pearl Harbors caused. The length of 3 hours is not a bad thing- rather it is good, as it is an epic, and any thing less would of given the movie a rushed feel. The time flies by. Don't listen to the critics. Go see Pearl Harbor. It is a fantastic movie that will provide an exciting, entertaining viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grand epic of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't help but to scoff at people that criticize films like this. You don't have to look far to find them either. They all have reputable names like Ebert, Travers, Siegel and some home grown synthetic wannabees like Pevere and Braun ( man she is numb ). These people come off as silly, vacuous, desperate to sell papers, grasping at straws kind of morons that no one really takes heed to or even listens to but are employed and well paid because of the car wreck scenario. You know, you just have to stare as you are driving by....Same thing. I read people like Braun, Pevere and Ebert because I just want to see what assinine comment they are going to make about the film next. There are very few things in this life that are apodictic, but reading a slew of bad, ostentatious reviews ( that are sometimes well written, but ostentatious and wrong nonetheless )by the aformentioned is now becoming one of them. For people like Liz Braun, it is just accepted that she is a little caustic and shows no real knowledge of film but what disappoints me is how people like Ebert, people who I at one time respected are now so deteriorated in their opinion that they can't tell the difference between what is a well made film and what is just flat out entertaining. Pearl Harbor is a marvellous amalgamation of both. It is incredibly well made and it is entertainment at it's finest. By the time this film has finished it's domestic run, it will probably end with close to 200 million and you can add another 200 or 300 million in foreign receipts. The film has to be doing something right. I don't know many people ( not paid critics that seem to have a personal vendetta against Jerry Bruckheimer ) that have not enjoyed this film. I happened to love it.I think by now everyone knows that this is a film that is based on a historical event and it is surrounded by a love story. And you can probably guess what is going to happen to the main characters about ten minutes into the film. But that doesn't matter. What does matter is the execution. What you have here is a film that takes time to develop a love story and then it surrounds it by the imminency of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. This effectively keeps you interested and a little tense about the film. You know the attack is going to be devastating, we have all read the history books, but what you can't be prepared for is how well it is done. Michael Bay showed his flair for the absurd when he did Armageddon. He also showed that he was a visionary icon when he did the same film. Bad Boys was also very well done, in particular some of the chase scenes involving Will and Martin. But this is a film unlike many others hat I have seen. The battle scenes are realistic and scary. The airplanes coming in what looked to be just feet from the ground was nothing short of brilliant. Michael Bay has some kind of eye for detail and some kind of balls for attempting some of the stunts and shots that he did. The effort that must have went into every shot in this film is tantamount to it's success. The audience that I saw this film with was in awe, just as I was at the battle scenes. You had the feeling that you were there. There was so much going on at one time that it must have taken the efforts of four or five directors to keep everything in synch. I don't really have much more to say about the film except to say that it epitomizes what the summer film is all about. It is big, brash, grandiose and loud. What more do you want? When you have nothing but captious critics committing deserate acts of temerity when they critisize films like this, it sometimes makes you want to see these films even more. You should see this film. It is a fantastic piece of work and one that will entertain you and enlighten you over three hours. Judge for yourself. Don't be led astray by someone that sees 3 films a day and has developed a sense of mendacious storytelling and has become a cynic. This is a great film! 9 out of 10- Highly, highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie to see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Maybe a spoiler** So, it's not the best movie in the world. These days none of the movies made are. Yes, it can be compared to Titanic. I have this feeling that tons of people will see it because Ben Affleck is in it. They saw Titanic because Leonardo DiCaprio was in it. They'll see it again, because it made them cry and women love to see those types of movies again. Then, we'll all rush out to buy the movie only watching it for a month before we let it collect dust. But, unlike Titanic it will forever be imbedded in our mind. Whenever we think of Josh Hartnett we will think of his character Danny. Many people say the movie was no good, the same way they said that over Jurrasic Park 2. Of course they say this. They go into the movie expecting it to be something it is not. It is a movie about the bombing of Pearl Harbor, but the whole movie is not the actual bombing. Sure, you can make an almost three hour movie about it, but it would be boring. Think about it--Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett--two cute men--of course they are trying to attract the women, so why would the whole movie center around the bombing of Pearl Harbor. There has to be a love story to keep the women interested. I believe this movie was good. The acting was good. The story was good. It is a movie I would like to see again, maybe I won't buy another ticket to it, but I will buy the movie, occasionally on rainy days putting it in the vcr or dvd player to relive the story of Rafe and Danny. This movie may not be the best movie in the world, but it is a good one. You would not be disappointed. If it doesn't live up to your expectations then your expectations are too high. After reading all these comments and you think the movie is not going to be good remember you are the only judge of what you like. I enjoyed the movie and if you want to be able to trust my judgement as your own I'll tell you that I like war movies and I like romances that are not trashy. I also like period pieces, so I would be a big candidate to like the movie. I will tell there were alot of sad, teary eyes in the crowd and when someone cries at a movie it means they got wrapped up in the story and started to "fall in love" with the characters. All I'm saying is I enjoyed the story of Rafe and Danny and their battle in WWII and I want you to be your own judge on whether you will like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor definitely has to be one of the most amazing films, I have ever seen. It sure does qualify for the best film of the year. (And, one of the best films of all time.) This true tale has everything you could want in a movie, brilliant acting, amazing special effects and much more. The great romance story just adds to this fantastic film. All the actors/actress' involved in the movie are brilliant, especially: Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale who are all *true* stars. Jon Voight and Alec Baldwin did a great job too. I'd advise anyone to go see this movie. I can't imagine anyone disliking it and I give nothing but praise to this movie. I couldn't of asked for better directing, (Michael Bay.) producing (Jerry Bruckheimer.) and writing(Randall Wallace.) to Pearl Harbor. The film is also VERY sad and VERY moving and I had my fair share of tears. Pearl Harbor is a must-see movie for EVERYONE, so go see it now. I give Pearl Harbor a 20/20. BRILLIANT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why all the critics abhor Michael Bay movies. They claim that "Pearl Harbor" is "Hollywoodized" and "not historical," but honestly, I say that if you want something historical, go watch the history channel or some documentary. Bay knows what people like, which is why his movies most always do well. I go to watch a movie to be entertained, and entertain me this movie did. It was the right combination of chick-flick and guy movie so that it could have universal appeal. I don't know if it was the actors on screen or the superb theme by Hans Zimmer ("Tennessee" on the Pearl Harbor soundtrack), but something actually made me feel for the characters. The action sequences were awesome, which goes to show what $150 million can do. I liked Tom Sizemore in "Saving Private Ryan" and wish that he had a larger role in the film, but I suppose that would have detracted from the focus of the story. I have been waiting for a Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer/Hans Zimmer team ever since "The Rock," and I can't wait for the next one. Bravo guys!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You couldn't ask for a better tribute to the women and men who lost their lives at Pearl Harbor. Michael Bay does a wonderful job directing the awesome cast, and the screenwriter did a marvelous job of making the characters seem real and alive. You need the full 3 hours to get the complete impact of what happened before, during, and after Pearl Harbor. You need to sense the idealism of America before the bombing, the terror during the attack, and the rage mixed with fear and denial following the attack! The movie also gives me my new favorite young actor, Josh Hartnett. Handsome, but not flawless in a Brad Pitt kind of way, with a voice that could melt butter and eyes that see to the soul. I'd go sit through it again, just to spend time watching Danny Walker. The movie gets the reality of war across like Saving Private Ryan but without the massive amounts of blood, guts, and gore. The whole movie is raw and emotional....and simply superb!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I walked into the movie theater on Friday, May 25, 2001, my heart was beating a mile a minute because after months of waiting, I was finally going to see "Pearl Harbor". From the second it started, it held my attention. The special effects were truly out of this world! There are not enough words to express how deeply emotional and triumphant this movie was! After this movie, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett will surly be on their way to top-of-the-line Hollywood fame (hopefully including Oscar nominations). As best friends Rafe and Danny, their chemistry had the audience wiping tears away until the final moments. Kate Beckinsdale also did an Oscar worthy job of portraying their similar love interest. After all the reviews I've been reading about this WW2 drama, it's evident that top-notch movie critics did not really experience the emotional impact of this spectacular film. I can guarantee that this movie wasn't perfect but that it deserves a lot more applause and appreciation for it's main goal: to honor those who gave their lives to save their country. I gave this movie a 10 for many reasons and there isn't enough room in this comments section to even name the first five. I realize that I will see many movies in my life, but one of my favorites will forever be "Pearl Harbor".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is a excellent movie, one which men and women can both appreciate. It was like watching two movies in one. A little romance with a lot of action and great story line. Three hours, but didn't feel that long. Gave it a 10! Definitely worth seeing at the theater!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked into this movie with an open mind knowing full well the type of film this producer creates. I was not expecting a history lesson by any means. I go to the movies for one thing, entertainment. I must say I was entertained. I brought my dad who is a retired WWII p51 fighter pilot. He too also enjoyed himself. The acting was in my opinion, sub-par, save for Kate and John Voight who depicted FDR to the highest possible standard. The storyline was good enough to keep me in my seat for 3+ hours. Of course as billed, the CGI effects were incredible, allbeit somewhat lengthy. I would recommend this film for entertainment purposes. If I want to be educated on precise details of 7 December 1941, I'll watch tora,tora,tora, or the history channel.</fullReview>

My guess is that they were written by people who simply do not relate at all to real events or understand how Hollywood should portray them. Also I would guess that most are written by people who were not alive when it all happened.Compared to Private Ryan and Titanic, this is better. It is better entertainment. It does not grind your nose in the gore. It does portray rather accurately the moods and feelings of the time, and I know because I WAS alive then. A little too young to have participated but old enough to be seriously affected and to know what was going on.Yes, Tora and Midway are great documentaries and the more personalized 30 Seconds over Tokyo were good movies for their time. But this combines the best of all those films with the movie technology of today and I found the results outstanding.The love story was much better and more likely than Titanic's contrived unlikely pairing of a steerage passenger with a first class passenger. And Fatso Kate of Titanic does not hold a candle to Pearl's Kate. Leanardo DeCrapio also is not in the same league as Affleck and Hartnet.The concept of two people getting together after thinking a common person has been killed is very real. A close personal friend of mine was shot down in Viet Nam and after four years was presumed dead. His wife was granted a divorce and married one of his squadron members. When the POWs were released in 1973 he was among them. He subsequently married the wife of a squadron member who was killed in action.Compared to CTHD or all the other forgettable films of 2000, this is a real crowd pleaser from my point of view, certainly the best of 2001 so far!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked Pearl Harbor so much, I saw it twice. I've been looking forward to this movie since July 2000. I've heard critics say that the story around Rafe, Danny and Evelyn got in the way or it was historically inaccurate, but to me, I didn't really care about what they said, I still thought Pearl Harbor was great. If people want history the way it was, then they should rent "Tora! Tora! Tora!", but if they want a story, then they should see Pearl Harbor. The characters such as Dorie Miller, Admiral Kimmel and Col. Jimmy Doolittle aren't exactly like the actual people, but I really couldn't tell since I'm not a true expert on history. I know people expected it to be more about the history, but that's why "Tora! Tora! Tora!" is around for. Pearl Harbor followed the fictional characters like Rafe, Danny and Evelyn. I liked how they put these 3 characters into this time, it wasn't a perfect fit, but it was flawless to me. Pearl Harbor to me...took the audience on a trip back in time...when America was still innocent...and it took the audience to that Fateful Day...on a Sunday Morning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be easy for a film maker to fall into the trap of tracing a historical line with a movie like this; instead, concentrating on the lives of the main characters and how they related to this time, makes the movie. The sparks flew between the three lead actors and the tension was palpable. I would highly recommend this film. The violence, intense at times, proves to counterpoint their lives and how they are affected by the events.I didn't believe that it was three plus hours long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Harbor" to ride "Titanic" formula for success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much like the 1998 megahit "Titanic", "Pearl Harbor" uses the formula of placing a melodramatic love story with fictional or composite characters against the backdrop of and epic historical event. It even uses the same trick as to have the fictional characters interact with actual persons who were part of the actual event. The formula worked for James Cameron, so there's no reason to think it won't work here. The characters are likeable and well-acted, the story is somewhat plausible and the sheer size and expense of the production make it more than worth the price of admission. Any true movie goer owes it to themselves and the Hollywood establishment to see this film, if for nothing else, to encourage the producers of such monumental films to open up and make more films like this in the future. I can hardly wait for the sequel...."Hiroshima"....the feel good hit of next summer, maybe?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tora Tora Tora meets 30 Seconds Over Tokyo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen and appreciated more films than anyone else I've ever met. I generally have a preconceived notion of what a movie is going to be about before I go and I am rarely wrong. I had decided I wanted to see this movie the first time I saw a trailer for it many months ago. It looked like a well-done epic and I wasn't disappointed, even though I grew weary of the more than usual hype that preceded it. I was hoping to have a ticket price worth of entertainment, not a soul enriching experience of nirvanic proportions, as some viewers seem to expect based on other comments I've read. Get over it people, it's a film. The criteria should be, "Does it entertain 'me'". Well, this movie far surpassed my deliberately lowered expectations.I think I have seen every action and "effects" movie ever made, having been a fan of such entertainment since the 1950's. I own copies of everything worth watching more than once. I went into this movie hoping it wouldn't be as much of a disappointment as Saving Private Ryan. It was far far better. The improvement to me was the much-increased plausibility of the character's stories. While Ryan was a contrived and twisted premise from a single bare thread of a real example, this movie was rich with the examples from many real life people and very real events. For example, it has surprised every young person I have talked with for them to learn there really were two young pilots who tore to a remote airfield and flew alone into the sky to challenge the collective assemblage of the Japanese naval air forces during the attack (so little real history is taught in schools now days) and I am still rankled to know the one instigator as portrayed by Affleck was denied the Medal of Honor because of his commander's mean spirited rejection because he had not been ordered into the air (a very real life travesty to fail to recognize amazing courage). How's that for a missed story line?I can also easily forgive the filmmakers in trying to present many stories in the form of the two main characters, Affleck and Hartnett, to tell a broader story of America. It saved time in trying to get the audience to buy into them emotionally. Sure some of the film wasn't historically accurate, so what, it's supposed to entertainment first and foremost. No historically based film I have ever seen has been completely accurate and those that have come close to that kind of reality have been roundly criticized for lacking "action", as laughable as that irony is. Sure, an excellent film could have been made in two hours of footage, but instead we are treated with a lot more visually rich entertainment for our money - a real bargain. I also got the unmistakable impression that this was an attempt at much more than just a film about the attack on Pearl. It was an "hommage" to America's efforts in the war - all of America.The love story was actually an extra bit of realism many people are enjoying. It may have been added to attract more female viewers, but so what, aren't they deserving of some consideration by Hollywood too? I cannot begin to count the number of people of my father's generation whom I have heard while I was growing up tell how they met and fell in love during the incredible turmoil of that war. This is the telling of another story in it's own right, of the love and loss of the American women who endured it on the home front. The dull heartache of that kind of empty fear was the reality of their war as they loved and waited for their men to return home - if they did. Sure, a magnificent war story could have been told without the love interest entirely, but it would have been a different movie and far less of a moneymaker, so it may never have been made (this is called economic reality). The truth is one must attract a broader audience to turn a profit these days. I can say I was very surprised to see quite a number of unaccompanied females in the audience - almost unheard of for an action movie. Two teenage girls who came alone sat next to me in the theater and they were absolutely transfixed by the action and moved by the romance. I have NEVER seen another war film attract young female moviegoers this way. There were dozens of them in the theater.This is one of the few films to ever impress me with it's combat special effects. Not the newness or originality of them, or of raising the gee-whiz level of what Hollywood could do (who really cares about that anyway except overactive immature males), but the accomplishment of something far more difficult; stunning realism. To achieve realism, sometimes, less is more. I worked within the Department of Defense for over 31 years. I saw and participated in 4 wars in the military and as a civilian. This film is the closest to the actual experience of the reality of combat I have seen to date, including the vaunted "Ryan", which was more of a presentation of the grit realism of war. Some detractions I have read clearly weren't paying attention or perhaps the closest they've been to this kind of real war is whichever film they last saw. This film achieved the mechanical realism of the machinery of war. It also contained, hands down, the best aerial combat photography I have ever seen (though much was special effects). The feel of reality was almost startling. Not all of it was completely real as it still disappointingly had some of the usual overdone Hollywood pyrotechnic explosions with tons of gasoline to awe the naive audience, but the most real thus far. Add together sequences from this film, Ryan and a few very chosen sequences from the Thin Red Line and you have quite a stunning collection. I can't include the Viet Nam era war epics as they are too close to home; all of those attempts miss the mark with far too much overdone Hollywoodistic pyrotechnic depictions of action.I really enjoyed the performances in this film. All of the younger cast members gave me my money's worth, but I felt Affleck did quite an exceptional job with the heavy task he was given: to make such an over-the-top character believable - he was. Beckinsale's character was absolutely charming and I could easily see several young men fighting over such a beautiful actress. She did a very good job with the American accent too. Cuba Gooding's character seemed almost gratuitous and difficult to dovetail into an already packed story line but I'm glad he was there as he always gives a great performance and he certainly didn't disappoint me in this outing. Also surprisingly entertaining was James King as Betty. She really came across well on the big screen and I'd like to see more of her in the future. I was suitably impressed by Voight as Roosevelt and by Baldwin as Doolittle. Likewise, Mako as Yamamoto and Colm Feore as Kimmel were a valued addition, worthy of praise for their craft. They were fun to watch work. All gave great praise to the historical character's they portrayed with an integrity of realism not easily achievable. The overall quality of the rest of the cast was near impeccable with the only character I felt obviously underutilized being Tom Sizemore. I'd like to see him in more films with meatier roles. I also realize this film was already getting long - approaching The Longest Day in its scope and the length of its cast. Come to think of it, with a little more work and with Disney coughing up some more bucks this could have surpassed even that epic in actual run-time. It sure outdoes it in quality of product. I am going to supremely disappointed if this does not get an Oscar for effects and cinematography. The camera work was a real joy to watch with the only exception being the strangely blurry-lens effects thrown in the hospital scenes when it was under attack.Finally, in these types of films I always wonder how they are able to find enough Japanese actors to fill the cast. But those actors used here were quite excellent and gave heroic dignity to a very difficult task - to portray their historical countrymen without raising concerns of racism and engendering new nationalistic rancor against the Japanese. I would have liked to have seen more of Mako or Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa who played Genda, but I guess that film was Tora Tora Tora, which should be seen for historic comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What are you people talking about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you will have probably noted by this its one of those movies not many people think is okay. There are those who love it and those who want to scream their heads off about how much they hate it. So the only way to find out which one you are is to see it. My biggest problem is with the people who seem to abhor it not because I liked it, even though I did, but because their excuses for not liking it are tired. One comment was that there was not one historical fact in the film, while in fact I can name a couple off the top of my head, i.e. Doris Miller, Doolittle Raid. Another thing that bothered me was how intelligent everyone was trying to sound by finally being able to use the word jingoism. For those who didn't like this movie because there was too much patriotism do yourself a favor find a WWII veteran and talk to him. I am sure you will find out how much we Americans have become shallow little creatures because the people of that era did actually give a damn about something other than themselves. There were only a few but some negative comments on the portrayal of the Japanese. This was one of my favorite things about this, movie although it could have used more screen time. The Admiral comes off as a man doing what his country needs, but has compassion for those he is going to kill and the letter the zero pilot writes just gives a glimpse of the other sides turmoil. If this hadn't been in the film I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much. Cuba Gooding's character is another that is either hated or loved. I would have liked to see more of him, but not at the expense of cutting something else.Now for the big one people's complaints about history. I hate to be the one to take you from your nice little bubble where everything is perfect, but the truth is history is bent. It is not written with in perfection. It is jotted down by a human that wants to talk about his favorite parts. Proof of this is in a book I got on Charlemagne, which was very good except the author decided to leave out the day he had twenty thousand people slaughtered. There aren't many history books written about after Pearl Harbor America set up concentration camps for all Asian Americans, although German and Italian Americans were allowed to live in America like they always had. It is very hard to find a book on how at the end of WWII America brought Nazi scientists that had part of the holocaust here to continue their horrifying human experiments, sound a little fishy to you well go find out how we created the nerve gas tabun, it was our Nazi scientists. But the big thing to remember is this is a movie. No one pays lots of money to see a documentary. As much as you might like to think the studios are there to make art the truth it's a business and they are not going to back something that does not have a chance at making it's money back.Some little notes to add are so many complained of it being cliché. Everything has been done already if you think you have a new idea I am sorry but someone else thought it a long time ago. Cliché just means if people liked it so lets do it again. And we do like it because if we didn't there wouldn't be anyone to buy books or see movies. For those of you who are so above doing something that is cliché guess what that is a cliché in it self.Far too many people said this film was too long. They say to cut the romance and just leave the blowing up stuff. I am not going to comment on the stupidity of our culture and it's downward spiral into incessent babbling. Heck I was happy to feel I got my seven bucks worth after a long line of 80-minute movies. We are coming to the end I swear, but I had to add these couple of things. In one comment while bashing Pearl Harbor it was comparing it to other great films Saving Private Ryan, Braveheart, and Air Force One?What is Air Force One doing on the same level as Ryan and Braveheart. And I laughed heartily when I read a comment stating it had `bad dialogue'. As for reasons I am going to see it again. It is an epic. I like the characters. I love the setting. I love the story. But that doesn't mean you will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last night I went and viewed the Film Pearl Harbor, I have been anticipating this film since I first saw the trailers a while back. I read a lot of the recent critics reviews, but I did not let that stop me, I make my own judgements. This film has been terribly torn apart on the reviews all over the internet. I am glad I did listen, because I saw a gorgeously filmed masterpiece. Far as I am concerned it lands up there really close to the level as TITANIC. I enjoy a love story any way, I like to cry and laugh. I was impressed by the entire film, including the film score. No one got up and left the theater, everyone was glued to their seats, I heard people crying around me. I got so engrossed into the film that I forgot to eat my popcorn. Yes the film was that good, I was moved to tears, especially at the end. Very very, moving emotional, beautiful cinematography, bravo to Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer for making this film! I am still thinking about it, especially the images of those men on those capsizings fleets. This film I just really cannot describe the words, accept to say I was totally blown away!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of everything for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is the kind of movie that has something for everyone. It has romance, so you can take a spouse or a date with you. It has emotional moments of friends bonding as they realize that their lives could end at any minute, so, you can take a best friend. Actually, I'd recommend that you see it with a good friend - it will make you appreciate them even more. It has some GREAT war scenes - very realistic - so those who go see the movie looking for that are going to love the 2nd hour. Basically, Pearl Harbor is a whole lot of romance, war, drama, and patriotism all rolled into one. I noticed that there were a lot of war vets (in uniform) in the theater I saw it in, and I looked around at the end to see most of them in tears. Maybe this isn't the best movie of all time, but I wasn't bored at all during the 3 hours, and I found it as a fitting tribute to those who served our country and gave their lives. People tend to laugh at the romantic aspect of the movie, but let me ask you all three questions: Don't you think that all of those servicemen who fought in the war had wives or girlfriends? Don't you think that the nurses had husbands or boyfriends? Don't you think that every single person who served in the war was somebody's wife, husband, daughter, brother, mother, father, aunt, uncle, cousin, etc? Real, living people actually waited some 60 years ago to hear if their loved ones had lived or died. Pearl Harbor perfectly captures the emotions going through America at that time. Anyone who is not at least *partially* moved by this movie must be made of stone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie kicked ass! It had such good acting in it, a great cast and a kick ass battle scene. The love scenes were a bit to much but that was the only complaint. I thought it was a historical view of pearl harbor and i don't know what the critics were complaining about. It showed exactly what happened to pearl harbor and how both the Americans and Japanese were planning for it. GOod job and great action</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not care what people say about this movie; it was WONDERFUL. I sat down for 3 hours and 3 minutes and enjoyed what you can truly call a summer box office hit. The love story (or stories)was quite interesting since as a viewer, one develops an attachment for the characters. As far as the special effects go, you get a heck of a lot for your money! Of course, there are a bunch of scenes which will leave spectators teary-eyed (I cried like a baby half the time). The actors were amazing, though I wanted to see more of Cuba Gooding Jr. Michael Bay did an exquisite job of directing this movie (long live all his summer Blockbuster hits). It's a very "busy" movie; I don't think I had time to breathe. In conclusion, I want to convert my nationality to American and I want to move to Pearl Harbor to get myself one of those hot Navy boys (there are plenty in the movie!!! ) Well, I have been marked... and it's all good because I LOVED EVERY SECOND of this movie!

		<shortDescription>One of the Best War Films Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has one of the most nerve racking edge of your seat battle scenes I've ever seen. The Romance seems somewhat real and the acting is top notch. From a Canadians point of view some may say it is a little too American but I totally disagree. This Movie was made by Americans about an American tragedy and this movie shows an almost completely accurate tale of what happened those 2 days. A Must see for any Action Fan. The only disappointment is the lack of blood and gore. (After Seeing Private Ryan I almost expect gore in every Wartime thriller and I miss it in this one. But the lack of gore isn't really THAT significant.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who thinks this movie is bad due to its love story is an idiot. This movie makes a tragedy into a patriotic movie (no for me, but GO CANADA) and does a damn good job of it. The action scenes are simply amazing, and are better than any in war movies previous (less gore, but we are desensitised enough, okay?). I highly suggest seeing it, all 205minutes of it, and enjoy it. Because it is perhaps one of the best movies you will see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one awesome movie. Very patriotic but not overly pro-US... Some shots about the hospital being attacked were casting a bias on the Pearl Harbor bombing itself, but otherwise, it was perfect... Not too much romance, credible character relationships, every character appearing on the movie being linked to someone else or some event... And no "free" violence, like The Patriot. The raid was very well rendered, both from the perspective of the sailors, aviators and medical personnel... The kind of movie which takes you on a roller-coaster of emotions, even if it means the story-line is somewhat easy to predict at times...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Guilty Pleasure--REALLY Guilty! (Minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been following this production since I first heard about it for many reasons. Mainly it was because of the spectacle and that I am a fan of war films but also because I was critical of the people behind this production.I must admit that I am not a fan of Michael Bay--I HATED "Armageddon," which I thought was an incoherent mess of a movie. I was worried that Bay was not mature enough for a film like this, and that he just figured that the formula ("Titanic" + "Saving Private Ryan" = $$$ and OSCARS) guaranteed him recognition and a box office hit.Much to my surprise, this movie was surprisingly coherent. It also seemed to me that the quick cutting "style" (or enormous flaw) characteristic of Bay was rather absent in this movie, or at least severely lessened. But "Pearl Harbor" is not inspirational or creative filmmaking; it is a standard reliance on what has worked in superior films of similar subjects. Every camera angle, shot, line of dialogue, or stunt in this movie has appeared in a better film already. However, this didn't ruin the movie for me. I have a weakness for movies like this, so I found much to like. I went along with the romance between Rafe and Evelyn, even if I forced myself to, in an idealistic fantasy way. This is also applied to the look, feel and cinematography of the period piece; the movie looks more like it was filmed at a 1940's theme park than actually in the 1940's, but this also helped me lose myself in the romantic fantasy of the film. The dogfights are also spectacular, and the planes probably move faster and maneauver much smoother than WWII era aircraft, thanks to the flawless CGI. There were moments during PH where the movie would lose my attention--surprisingly enough, this happened quite a few times during the actual attack. The footage is always impressive, but never involving enough to shock or horrify the viewer. This was one of the consequences of Bay's directing, and not the only one (I really dislike his style of montage).I was really looking forward to the final act, which depicts the Doolittle Raid, however it was rather disappointing. It really seemed as if the production was rapidly running out of money and had to speed through the entire sequence to get it done. As a result, much of the suspense and interesting aspects of the bombing raid are lost on us, and they are much better presented in the classic, "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo." Other flaws (that I had a problem with): I wish there was more of a "it just happened" feel to Danny and Evelyn. Instead, Danny nervously (and rather guiltlessly) follows Evelyn around and practices pick-up lines on her. Is this an admirable (or believeable) way for him to act around the girlfriend of his presumably dead best friend? Come to think of it, isn't Danny kind of a JERK?; WHY are the Zeroes painted green!? Other Japanese planes in the movie are photographed in silver, so why would the filmmakers, claiming that they are striving for accuracy, paint the legendary and infamous planes incorrectly?; The climax (in occupied China) of the movie comes off as really convenient, yet it ads a great awkwardness to the aftermath and conclusion.I guess what is most offensive about "Pearl Harbor" is the rush that people will get from watching a bunch of explosions and carnage, when what we are seeing is based on the deaths of over 2000 of our citizens. Michael Bay and even Jerry Bruckheimer may have held intentions to make a respectable movie to honor the veterans (entirely secondary to the big bucks, of course), however in many ways it makes mindless summer fun out of an absolutely horrible, murderous tragedy, and that is what makes me feel guilty about enjoying this movie. Grade: B-/C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film despite minor technical errors!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, no spoilers here. Usually, I'd complain about a film with as many technical errors as in this film. Lets face it, 1970-80's 'Spruance' class destroyers and 'Knox' class frigates were seen getting bombed in the harbor and carriers had angled flight decks not seen until well after WWII. Even the use of the Missouri was an anachronism since it wasn't commissioned until 1944, but the film was great. It played out not only the brutality of the attack, but also displayed Japan's ambivalence towards initiating the strike, our own side's lack of preparedness, and the efforts of a few to warn of the impending attack. Finally, it displayed our preceding generation's ethic and bravery. Though a few ships may have been out of place, the historical significance of the event wasn't lost. Not to mention there were nice action scenes and a love story. Now, if you want to see what would have happened had those 1980's destroyers been there go watch "The Final Countdown"...</fullReview>

Titanic doesn't even compare..this is an absolute must see. The one thing I noticed is the 3 hours of Titanic seemed like it where this movie you never noticed the time. It just captivates you so. The battle sequences were some if not the best staged war scenes I've ever seen on film. This movie will easily top Titanic's revenue and win many many awards. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a roller coaster of emotions. I won't go into plot details, as this is a movie that you must see. However, I will say that, what you see in this movie, you will never forget. I was honored to sit in the theatre with Pearl Harbor Survivors. This is not a "Private Ryan" movie. Pearl Harbor goes many places, and has many goals. It achieves every moment it aspires to. There will be inaccuracies no doubt. This movie may be picked apart by many. Nonetheless, one thing remains true. This did happen. Pearl Harbor was bombed, and this movie can give a glimpse of what it could have been like. This is American history. This isn't just Hollywood shoving special effects at us for a dollar. I may never have to see this movie again, because I may never forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie I have seen in a LONG time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is incredible. However, if you are looking for something that is primarily action (ie Black Hawk Down) you won't find it in Pearl Harbor. Though this movie mainly focuses on the relationships of Danny, Rafe and Evelyn, I think something more in depth is being examined. Since the story of Pearl Harbor is told through the relationships of the main characters, the movie really becomes personal. As you watch and observe how the war affects those who are participants, and those who are loved ones of the participants, you begin to better understand and gain an appreciation for the difficulty that those who fought and still do fight for our country went/go through. Pearl Harbor reveals the hardships and horror of war and the toll it takes on those directly involved. Most war movies I have watched are mostly focused on the fighting, bombing, etc. While those movies may be interesting to watch one time on a weekend movie night, they have not stuck in my mind. Pearl Harbor is an emotional film that goes deeper than the action and really leaves an impact on the watcher. Don't let the 3 hours deter you from watching this film either! Its one of those movies that you want to continue on for a good length of time. Plus, this amount of time is needed in the movie to fully develop the plot. I honestly cannot praise this movie enough! I love love love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie a lot of time's and every time i cried. I hope this movie was not made to show only war crimes against USA. This movie is try to show us what are people capable to do in extreme situation , how they react on extreme situation This movie is about , team , trust , love , friendship , hero's , courage , sacrifice, patriot's everything what is good on the world. I don't wanna be impolite but this movie was made for people who have a heart beat on their chestsNow i will try to explain what i just wrote. In the begin of the attack they are like a herd of sheep without a shepherd , they make a team in a short time and fightback ( team / trust ) Friendship is more important then love Rafe and Danny love same woman but they put the friendship in front of the love and make a team whit other soldiers from P.H. and fightback against Japanese. About the hero's , courage ,sacrifice and patriot's when the pilots heard is a very dangerous mission nobody step back. When Doolittle tell the pilots the true about the mission nobody step back again even they know now it can be a one way "road" a suicide mission. After the mission Rafe return home whit his best friend body ( nobody left behind ) He turn back to Evelyn to be together again and to be the father for Danny's unborn child For me is an amazing story an amazing movie. I am happy &amp; proud cause i am alive and saw this movie and i hope to see more movie like this one before i will close my eyes !!!</fullReview>

Quite possibly my favorite movie, and one of the best I have seen. There are some inaccuracies yes, but the film does what its supposed to. That is paint a grim, ugly image of war. The story could be a little clichéd but its actually quite good. It's executed in a fashion that ties the love story and the attack together. There are several twists and turns, and the solid conclusion ties everything together. I am probably going to get a lot of hate for this, but this is seriously the best movie I have ever seen.

		<fullReview>191 comments and oh dear, is it worth writing another one. Being a brit I'm constantly amused/bemused by the American 'style' of how they see themselves at war, especially this title, and how historical fact, which still hasn't been admitted/proved where this attack is concerned, for sure.. so of course some people are going to be mad. Seems we brits were about the sub film and the enigma machine.. I say what the hey. It doesn't claim to be factual. I just watched from after the start to the attack scene, to the end on BBC1/UK, as I forgot what happened in the film, and though on my 16:9 screen, as usual on TV, didn't see all if it as wide as it should have been (grrr).. was STILL impressed by the effects. But then, I was with Titanic as well.. reading the hows and trivia/goofs, yes, it all added up. It IS another film where one should leave ones brain 'at the door'.. but, for spectacle and action, forget the romance bit.. VERY entertaining. Its all very well watching a film about a known historical event, but didn't Hollywood always do these things? How difficult to get all the designs/vehicles right. 8/10 because of the inaccuracies. I even wondered if the Dollittle bit was an extra fiction bit to round the film off and say, see, we did have a go back, risked it to say take that.. BUT NO? It happened? Well, there you go.I've been educated tonight. The end bit of Ai was criticised, but to me it worked. IT rounded the film off nicely. And as one of the characters in this one I guess, had to 'not come back'.. for the sake of the story line.. again.. OK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as they say.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My take: An expensive, old-fashioned epic rather than the historical event it promises. Not nearly as bad as critics have reported.Since its release and up until now, Bay and Bruckheimer's version of "the day which will live in infamy" remains much-maligned and heavily criticized. Sure it's melodramatic. Sure it's about as accurate as a kid playing with toy planes and boats in a bathtub. But I thought PEARL HARBOR, as an old-fashioned melodrama set on a historical event, is an entertaining romp, depending how you look at it. Despite Bay's self-importance, PEARL HARBOR is a gorgeous, visually-stunning, unashamedly clichéd and old-fashioned epic that, while a mile away from perfection, is also a mile away from what critics make it look. Where else could you possibly still hear such dialogs as "...And then I kissed him" or "I'll be back for you"? Where else could you have a love story as complicated as a love triangle about two young pilots who both fall in love with the same girl, a nurse, amidst their duties in the impending war? How many movies still give as that gung-ho action as planes who go "woosh!!" in the air, chasing and gunning each other down? PEARL HARBOR offers them all, the old-fashioned way. It gets trite and cliché in doing so, but I think that's just part of fun.Like its obvious inspiration, James Cameron's mega-hit TITANIC, the movie is cut into two parts. The first act involves a love story, in this case a ménage ? trois involving crack air pilot Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck), hopelessly devoted to gorgeous nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale), who volunteers to fight in the Eagle Squadron in England. Unfortunately his plane is shot down in the Battle of Britain is he's reported dead, much to the mourning of poor Evelyn, while Rafe's best buddy Danny (Josh Hartnett) provides her comfort. Will these two end up together? Well, after they cuddle in a parachute hangar, indeed they do, much to the anger of Rafe, who turns up alive and seeing his girl in the loving hands of his best buddy.But they really have no time to argue when history interrupts. Japanese Zeroes swoop down in the harbor on the morning of December 7, 1941, having been devised few days earlier by Admiral Yamamoto (Mako), who's famous line of dialog ("I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant.") is only briefly mentioned here. The attack itself is immense, delivering all the explosions, disaster and trauma of the actual attack, only with neat CGI planes and sinking battleships. But just when the movie should have ended at this point, the movie throws in an additional hour devoted to the Tokyo Raid led by Lt. Col. Dolittle (Alec Baldwin, in a clichéd but acceptable role). Running nearly as long as 3 hours (or more!), PEARL HARBOR really doesn't need the extra hour, even if it just for the sake of ending the film on a happy note.But despite the prolonged running time, PEARL HARBOR just about gave me my money's worth. It's a terrific turn on the old 1940's romance movies (as Bay describes it). It's sappy, melodramatic and a bit cliché, but entertaining as whole. The performances were adequate, with Affleck and Hartnett playing bland yet reliable cocky heroes. But Beckinsale deserves some praise who looks and acts like a classic beauty, something that would be right at home with an old-fashioned lover story. Jon Voight momentarily appears as wheelchair-bound President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but goes way over the top in a scene where he literally stands in his own two feet, despite the fact that he was affected by polio. Cuba Gooding Jr. lands an important role that's reduced simply as an extended cameo while Baldwin and Colm Feore play clichéd roles of real flesh-and-blood historical figures. But what it lacks in human and character dimension, it makes up in pure spectacle. The special effects are breathtaking and the production design is spectacular. Hans Zimmer's score is adequate to the film's dramatic and patriotic tones (with the addition of Faith Hill's theme song "There You'll Be", there are guaranteed misty eyes while the credits roll).There are definitely better films about Pearl Harbor, including an accurate one (TORA! TORA! TORA!) and a similarly dramatic one (FROM HERE TO ETERNITY). But just because there are even better choices doesn't mean the lesser one's make bad choices. PEARL HARBOR, while never going to be on the same league as the said films, is still an enjoyable piece of "they don't make 'em like this anymore" entertainment. For accuracy, go see TORA! TORA! TORA! But for pure, old-fashioned entertainment, PEARL HARBOR just about gives me what I have paid for.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've been assigned to write a term paper on America's entry into WW II and you're too lazy to read, this movie will not help you as to it being a reliable source of factual information. There was a real attack on the Pearl Harbor base on 7 December 1941. The attack was chaotic and a real tragedy. There are some real-life characters portrayed in this film, e. g. FDR, Jimmy Dolittle,et al Beyond these and a few other (loose) facts, this film is strictly entertainment, filled with action and "romance." If you're looking for an education and you want factual info on real life events, ask someone who was there. Not many of them still around who were at Pearl Harbor on that day, but they are out there. PS The comment about "bikinis" under TRIVIA is a bit off. Kate B. was wearing a 2-piece sunsuit common in the day. Her outfit was not a bikini. Take Care!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone's so hard on this film and, admittedly, it deserves some criticism. Some of the lines are flat and the "love triangle" plot definitely gets in the way of the rest of the story. Also, the love scenes between Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale are downright laughable. Still, the attack scene is some of the best film-making I've ever seen. The magnitude, scope, and shock are all conveyed perfectly. There's also lots of other things to like here. For one, the film-makers have definitely captured the essence of pre-war Hawaii. Finally, much of the supporting cast turns in top-notch performances: Dan Ackroyd, Tom Sizemore and, especially, John Voight as FDR. My recommendation? Rent it on a Sunday afternoon on the biggest TV screen you can find, make some popcorn, and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

Jerry Bruckheimer out did himself, this is one of his best films. The cast also includes Kate Beckinsale, Cuba Gooding Jr, Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight and Tom Sizemore. The special effects of this film are brilliant, and the love story is truly tragic and will have you in tears by the end of the film.

		<fullReview>OK, it's not as good as other war dramas, such as Band of Brothers, but still was excellent. As a British teenager, I tended to have been brought up on war tales such as the Blitz and the Battle of Britain. Pearl harbour is briefly mentioned as the catalyst that brought the U.S.A into WW2, but never given much thought or detail. So one day as I was off from school with nothing to do, i rummaged round the old video case and found a dusty version of Pearl Harbour. I knew facts about it, the date which "will live in infamy" and the aforementioned catalyst. So i decided i had nothing to lose and watched it.What i found unravelling before my eyes was a fantastic and heart wrenching movie, if a little on the long side at 176 mins.The storyline takes you along the journey of two best friends in the U.S.Airforce, played by Ben Affleck (in one of the best roles i've seen him play) and a young Josh Hartnett, fantastic as a young pilot in training and a devoted best friend.In comes Kate Beckinsale as the customary love interest, looking amazing as a Navy nurse. Obviously Afflecks character falls for her, but then his application to join the Battle of Britain in Eagle Squadron comes through and he has to leave her to fight. They promise they are in love and write as often as they can.In contrast, both Kate and josh get posted in Pearl Harnour, Hawaii. Very peaceful and idyllic. News comes of Ben's death, obviously both are devastated. Three months later, Kate's friends urge her to move on and Josh and she have a chance meeting, leading up to all sorts of things in a vacant hangar.Ben comes back, realises whats going on, but meanwhile the build up that has been running throughout this overture of love, Japanese planning, and American attempted code cracking reach the climax as Pearl Harbour is attacked,.The scenes are intense, and I never realised to what full extend happened that day on December 7th 1941. the sub-plot with Cuba Gooding Jr. is fantastic and shows the racial inequalities of the Americans in the 20th century, and is heartwarming when he receives what he justly deserves.Back to the plot and Josh and Ben off to the hangar to counter attack. They succeed and become enrolled in the secret mission of Doolittle squadron. The love triangle deepens when Kate becomes pregnant.The outcome of the secret mission I won't spoil for you, but the film works out with a mixed sad and happy ending, with the last scene so heartwarming you feel all fuzzy inside. I found this film thoroughly enjoyable and very informative. Contrary to batti's statements, this is not a fill about America good, Japan bad, as scenes featuring the Japanese commander shows his inferior saying :" You are a brilliant man, sir" with him replying:" A brilliant man would know how to settle this without fighting a war." Very True.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't think the movie was as bad as most of the critics did.Yes, the story is overly simplistic, there is little historical perspective and attention to detail, but what's the big deal? The movie is what it was intended to be: a high-budget, typical Hollywood blockbuster, to be taken all-at-once with a good dose of popcorn and beer.What's wrong with that? Not all films can or should be artistic masterpieces! The camera and sound is excellent (the Oscar for sound f/x was well deserved), the acting is good to very good (Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous in the 40's look) and overall, the movie is fun to watch, it provides for 3 hours of very decent entertainment.Just don't expect any metaphysical musings and you'll be alright.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ridden with clichés, a predictable cornball back story, this film manages to take one of the more monumental tales of the 20th century and reduce it to a tale of a love triangle in uniform. The main characters are stiffly played, and so unrealistic that I was unable to care about their fates by the end of the picture. 2 hero wannabes fall in love with a nurse who can't keep her legs together (my interpretation). Her true love is reported missing in action, and she responds to the news by putting out for his best friend. The Pearl Harbor story spills over into the story of the famous Doolittle raid on Japan. Alec Baldwin emotes the role of Doolittle with his typical hammy style, causing the audience to begin to sympathize with Japanese anti-aircraft guns, and hope that they are successful in shooting down the mission, even if after their bombs have been delivered. An enormous effort was made to take this epic historic war drama and reduce it to cornball melodrama.3 out of 10 (Rent the Victory at Sea series if you want a quality WW2 film experience)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best war movies since i saw Saving Private Ryan. Pearl Harbor is a really good movie based on war realism and special effects. The story is good to but it should not have too much romance. When i see this movie it makes me think what it must of been like being there, all the gun firing the adrenaline. Well i would give this movie like a 9.5 out of 10. My favorite part is when the USS Arizona blows up in half and you see the ship fall apart. If i had this movies i would enjoy watching it.This movie should inspire us to imagine that this could happen again but in ur city like me i live in San Diego so it is a higher possibility for me to witness that than a person living in Kansas. So watch this movie over and over until you get it trough your head that it is a good movies. This movie is the best.

		<fullReview>Everyone who is so eagerly writing in to say that this movie is awful because their is this love story this is for you. YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOUR TALKING ABOUT. This movie was not made to teach you guys about Pearl Harbor, if you want to go pick up a book. This movie was made to humanize the attack on Pearl Harbor, to give the event a face which would teach people the horrors of the attack. For the people who say this movie is an anti Japan movie then you guys have no idea what your talking about either. Although I do not have any prejudice towards Japan the fact is that on Dec. 7th 1941 they attacked us with no cause and killed many Innocent people in the process. No where in this movie does Micheal Bay depict Japan as anything other then a country that attacked us, nowhere does he purposely depict them in a bad light and certainly not a some second class nation that the US will just crush, he actually if anything shows the genius behind their attack and shows them as a military force that should not be written off. If you guys want to see a movie that shows the US as a big bad force that is needed every where then go watch The Last Samurai where Zwick felt it necessary for the US to take credit for training Japan's army when in reality the US never sent any military officers over to Japan during that time period.</fullReview>

I held on to my boyfriend a lot while crying because of how sad and drastic it was. I was crying at the end of the movie mostly right after Danny dies because he had just found out that he was going to be a father which made me feel really bad. I really like this movie and would definitely buy and have this movie in my house. Also i would like to add that Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are really hot and that they work really good together. They should be in more movies together because they just click on working together. I would pay to see another love story with these two guys fighting for another girl. So if thats in any way possible please try to make another love movie with these 2 guys working together. Thanks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just recently (2004) saw this movie and now regret not having seen it earlier. This was a truly entertaining HISTORICAL FICTION, and much more than merely a war epic. It was an Audio/Visual extravaganza - where no expense was spared, and tremendous attention to detail was paid on the scenery, costumes, buildings, room decor, music, etc.The movie included an excellent romantic side-plot (with amazing nostalgia such as: bidding farewell thru old fashioned revolving doors). I thought the Affleck, Beckinsale, Hartnett interactions were very well acted.The entire Cast gave absolutely 100 percent and I believe this movie will be valued as a HISTORICAL FICTION.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If people want to learn the precise history of Pearl Harbor or America's role in WW2, they can read a book or watch one of the many TV series'/films/documentaries that have been made on the topic. 'Pearl Harbor' never set out to fit into those categories.Instead, Pearl Harbor tells the truly heart-wrenching stories of three young lovers and their friends as their world is torn apart by war. The actual bombing of Pearl Harbor is only a minor moment of the film, as it is what happened before and after the event that is most important to this film's story. Up until the bombing, many Americans still naively believed that they could continue to stand by while the rest of the world was a war; December 7th shocked them into the reality that they could not. Consequently, lives were torn apart, friends and lovers died and the freedom enjoyed before the war was desperately fought for. This film dealt with the human side, the everyday effect of war on individuals' lives. The human experience of your plane going down over enemy territory and the terror of being captured and killed, when only the week before you were lying on a beach with your lover, was shockingly and painfully portrayed here.Josh Hartnett out-shone Affleck by far, and Kate Beckinsale was also brilliant. The confusion of losing one love, only to find another in his best friend was well portrayed and you believed every word each character had to say.Hans Zimmer's score adds even more emotional depth to the story, as does the Faith Hill song 'There You'll Be'. The film has it's moments of comedy, romance, action and terror. What more could you want from a romance set in wartime? There's only so much you can learn from studying history, wartime in particular. The human element is often neglected, until you can put a face to 'that soldier that died' and can see the effects his death had on so many people, whose lives will never be the same. The total lack of normalcy that war invokes and the way it literally tears lives apart was stunningly displayed.Now having read that..go watch it! At least now you'll know what to expect.</fullReview>

But it's not true that all girls like romance. I disliked the romance, but more of the battle scenes. For any type it shouldn't be too bad!Nice to watch with boyfriend/girlfriend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched Pearl Harbor for the first time. Heard it wasn't that good so I passed on it until I accidentally came across it on cable. My father-in-law passed away last year. He was a Colonel in the Airforce and he was one of the pilots that escorted the atomic bombs to Japan. I never fully understood what that really meant. I know I never will, but I wish to God that I would have seen this film before he passed away so that I could have had and shown a real appreciation for who he was. Sure the romance in the film is fluff, but the terror and horror and courage hit me like a ton of bricks. Had to give it a ten for allowing those of us who just don't get it - a strong feel for our nation's most horrific tragedy and the men who came forward in her defense. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you can adjust to the style, it's awesome.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clearly many viewers disliked this movie. Passionately. Chances are the same people hated Armageddon. Passionately. Michael Bay has a distinctive style which produces powerful reactions - either you go with it and enjoy the rollercoaster ride, or it doesn't work for you and his style comes across as shallow and painfully cheesy. IF you let yourself dumb down and take in the visuals instead of expecting a war movie in a similar vein to all the other recent attempts, you should find huge enjoyment in the film. Indeed, it was the second highest grossing film of 2001 behind Shrek which suggests it can't have been hated by everyone.Personally, I think expectations were too high with people looking for another Titanic/Saving Private Ryan. The first hour is admittedly a little slow, but this is the price for the BEST 45 mins of action ever put to screen. This is the only film I've ever seen where the CGI is almost always indistinguishable from the real stuff. Somehow Lord of the Rings won the Visual Effects oscar instead, despite having some fairly poor effects at times. The hour of light-weight romantic build up gives the battle scene greater power by having such a strong contrast between the frivolous love story and such a momentous historical tragedy - especially in the recent Director's Cut which restores all the battle violence that was originally trimmed for the necessary PG-13 Theatrical rating.The last part of the film was heavily criticised for it's apparent ridiculousness and what looks like a heavily contrived upbeat conclusion. However, the Doolittle raid is portrayed fairly accurately (most of Alec Baldwin's dialogue is a word-for-word copy of Doolittle's actual speeches). As far as the nastier details of the campaign are concerned (e.g. Japanese treatment of captured pilots), financial pressure from the Japanese market forced some omissions. As far as the somewhat contrived love story is concerned - blame Disney. They only agreed to put up the huge budget on the condition that a love story was included.Basically, if you go with the cheese, the film is immensely powerful and entertaining. If you are just too cynical, or unable to enjoy "dumber" films, then there is little chance of making it through the entire film without vomiting.Bay's style, like Tony Scott or John Woo, is highly distinctive and quite probably an indication of the style that will become more popular over the next few years as audience intelligence and attention spans continue to decrease. Perhaps then, Pearl Harbor will be more appreciated. Currently it is simply too uncomfortable a mix of Bruckheimer dumb action/romance and serious war film for most people. Those of you who haven't seen it, try the Director's Cut - you might like it.</fullReview>

On a tight budget to make the film, I thought the entire cast and crew did a remarkable job of telling the story of what happened on the December morning, but still managed to incorporate a love triangle story line. I think adding in the love story, was a way to warm you up to character of the 40's and showed how they who were involved in Pearl Harbor reacted and felt. An all star cast, including Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, Cuba Gooding Jr., Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight, and Dan Akroyd, put on a magnificent performance.</fullReview>

I felt like I understood Rafe more than the others, so it was hard to see him in the situations he was in. I know how it feels to have someone you care about not return your feelings, so I hated having to see him like that.

I never wanted to see it in the cinema but now I wish I had. It is also hard to believe that it performed so poorly in the UK box office. I believe like many movies 'Pearl Harbor' will find its audience outside the Cinema and in our homes. I have seen many corny American movies and to be honest believed this was going to be one of them and that turned me off watching it. I simply believed it was going to be a three-hour 'cheese fest'. I was wrong.There are a lot of negative reviews here, more than I expected but that's fair enough as everyone is entitled to their opinion. I guess some people are really hard to please these days.

		<fullReview>PEARL HARBOR: THE STAR WARS OF WWII FILMS.When one enters a movie theater, they should be in for a new reality. Once that projector plays and the lights dim, you should enter another time and place. The film should be your reality, you should be able to smell the air, feel the heat of explosions, and feel the sweet pressure apon your lips as the screen kiss plays out larger then life.Thats exactly what happens in PEARL HARBOR, the new Summer epic by Jerry Brockhimer and director Michael Bay. Teaming up again from the 1998 summer blockbuster Armageddon, (also starring Ben Aflect) The 2 bring the events of before, during and after the faithful events of December 7th,1941.The film starts off as a flashback in the 20's were our two charaters are playing on an old cropduster. Both clearly have dreams of becoming a fighter pilot and leading a squadran into battle against germans. But when little rafe and danny play around in rafes fathers cropduster, there first flying lesson isnt exactly a doozy.Now cut to the early 40's. With both friends in the air force craving battle in the war, the only thing that stops them from actuley doing it is Americas will to stay out of the war.

WARNING: When on home video, if you buy the pan and scan vhs version of this film, you deserve to be hung! Truly a theater experence, you will walk away from this film stunned, sad, and shaking with fear and pride.THE ROUNDUPACTING: Great, some oscar worthy proforamces in Alic Baldwins john dolittle,John Voights ROSEVELT. As for aflect and the new comers, great, but a little sappy at times.ACTION: P*** BEFORE YOU SEE THIS FILM, or regret it later. This puppys got the action of 10 world war movies and then someADVENTURE: ITS AMERICAS ADVENTURE.DRAMA: Almost de-throning saving private ryan in the way of drama, ALMOST.ROMANCE: Its not Titanics love, but its Armageddons with a little Umph into itSPECIAL EFFECTS: Whats real and whats not? I, the special effects god, had a hard time telling. Makes the Mummy Returns look like a cartoon.SOUND: Whow! I think i got shell shock! My ears are still ringing from all the explosions.THRILLS: Attacks and battles are filled with thrills, but the romance lacks it.(Thank god)FILM LOOK: Bright colors, nice shots, shocking attacks and battles. Shaking camera... OVER ALL:THE GOOD Its all good.THE BAD: Cheezy "Death and return" love aspect. Our main characters seem to be involved in everything, but nothing eazley overlooked, and history migh be a little too simple and some stuff might have been added for effect.BUT AGAIN, nothing to get upset about. You want to entertained or bored to death with details like Tora torra torra!?THE UGLY: The japs as the bad guys. There brutal, but accurate to what they did. Some Japanese might be a little offended, but hey, history isnt politically correct.IN CLOSING: Great film, nice simple but stunning history lesson,and some outstanding roles. Doesnt beat TITANIC as my number one excelent film, but sure comes close to. At least Equal to Ryan!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The subject: we know it.The result: we know it.The special effects: we know themThe actors: we know them and are not surprised as to the standard of their acting.But what about the way it presents WWII? We know it: properly self centered as usual. Who suffered for 5 long years? Europe Who had their country destroyed with Millions of people killed or forever disabled ? Europeans not to speak of the victims of the Holocaust and of course the family for many generations who were irradiated in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Yes the attack on Pearl Harbor was treacherous and lousy. Yes there was more than 3000 guys and civilians killed or wounded.But why? Because as usual the American people always think they know best and do not to learn from lessons of the past, or of their allies i.e. France (1940), Great Britain, Poland, Belgium, Russia, etc. And after their final victory America again reiterate and forget as for example the causes which led to September 11th. which also cost thousands of victims.Nationalism, Isolationism is a LUXURY which has always brought hate and revenge. Instead of always asking for God, they should remember this very simple saying: Help yourself and heaven will help you and not the contrary.This is a very poor picture, with the usual absence of nuance for depicting characters, the good and the bad and we all know how it ends. Millions of dollars have been spent to produce it when they could have been employed to alleviate the suffering of people in some of the towns of the United States. What a waste!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many ways to recall a historical event. You can call for a celebration, throw a parade or recreate it in a movie. The bombing of Pearl Harbor which took place on December 7th, 1941 is one American will never forget and is yearly commemorated. This tragic event has been immortalized on film and attests to it's importance. This film " Pearl Harbor " is the latest remake and for this reviewer one of the finest. The event itself has so many historical statistics one weeps. Further, the sorrow is very vivid in the minds of many survivors living today. Taking only a few hours, the attack did not last very long due to the caution expressed by the attacking Japanese. Indeed, the attack is used as a backdrop to the Romantic love story embedded within the memorable day. Destined to become pilots, two farm boys Capt.Rafe and Capt. Dan Walker (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) emerge as adults fliers and exhibit the courage, fortitude and courage prominent in the American Army/Air Corps. of the 1940's. Kate Beckinsale plays Nurse Lt. Evelyn Johnson the love interest of both men. Adding to the collection of major stars which enhance this movie are some real heavyweights, like Jon Voight, Alec Baldwin, Cuba Gooding Jr., Tom Sizemore and Dan Aykroyd. Although, the film is seen as a 'bit' long, (3 Hrs) the action sequences more than make up for it. All in all, the movie packs an explosive punch with it's Aeriel action, fantastic combat footage and its touching human drama. In time, it should have very little trouble becoming a great Classic. Well done! ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Bruckheimer and Mr. Bay, your history appears to be missing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have noticed a lot of discussion about this particular movie that there is apparently a whole plethora of things wrong with it. The fact remains that there isn't a whole lot wrong with this movie at all. There is only one thing wrong and that's the fact that it doesn't deal with a cataclysmic event that propelled the United States into the Second World War. The title strongly suggests that and so do the trailers, but it is simply not the case."Pearl Harbor" shows nothing, yes nothing, interesting that led up to or resulted from that morning on December 7th, 1941. Nothing is shown about Japanese spies secretly gathering information. Nothing is shown of the Japanese Navy analyzing it and planning the attack. Nothing is shown of American code breakers who actually decoded several Japanese transmissions before the attack. OK enough of what the film doesn't show, but what does it show? It shows that the most important thing before the attack was a painfully corny love triangle. It shows that two American pilots with hangovers can out fly and shoot down enemy planes all without taking damage. It shows us part of the Battle of Britain, which is only relevant in passing to this film. It shows that London has a downtown (it doesn't anymore, because the Germans destroyed it during the Blitz). It shows that WWII fighter air craft can pull off maneuvers like X-Wings from Star Wars, especially if the air craft in question are piloted by Americans. It shows the Japanese as stoic and emotionless individuals despite the fact they managed to pull off one of the most successful attacks in military history. Yet it doesn't show HOW they did.Funny thing is that all this mess actually makes for a fun movie. A movie that consists of a teenage novel type of romance, 40 minutes of explosions, and then the rest of the movie about how the "good guys" get back at the "bad guys." That's your basic outline for a cheesy action movie. And that's half of what this movie is. The other half is an abominable travesty of history that is harder to forgive with repeated viewings. My advice is just to focus on the first half and you'll enjoy yourself and that makes the movie a guilty pleasure for the action movie fan at best. --- 5/10Rated PG-13 for violence. Ages 7+Director's Cut contains more violence. Ages 13+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is a very beautiful film. There seem to be many people who are against this movie- which is beyond me. It is filled with action, romance and drama. Plus- for cry babies like me- it is a TRUE tear jerker! It follows two young men from the time they are children until they are put into the army during world war two. The two share a strong passion for flying and so the whole movie is pretty much based on that. In comes a girl of course who gets in between them and this is where the romance comes in. But the end is the very best part and I won't say any more! Overall, this movie is very touching. It is also half chick flick, half guy flick and so both genders will find something to enjoy. The acting is amazing- well of course Ben Affleck never falls short and Josh Hartnett is absolutely incredible. In fact, all of the other characters, whether they are significant or not- are done beautifully. This is the kind of movie I would watch on a rainy Friday under the covers with a cup of hot cocoa. I'd give it a shot folks! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A strong contender for the title of "Worst Movie I have ever seen." It suffers from the same problem as Titanic; an unwillingness to tell complicated stories with a large cast and no obvious central character. Instead, everything is reduced to how it affects a small group, or as in these two movies, as a backdrop to a love affair. Unlike Titanic, however, Pearl Harbour loses track of reality early on; for example, the way Ben Affleck's character manages to change theatres of war at the drop of a hat. The special effects are unconvincing: one shot of some destroyers being bombed is used over and over again- to make it worse, the ships in this shot are modern guided-missile ships, no effort having been made to disguise them as period vessels. If you want to watch a film about the attack on Pearl Harbour, watch "Tora! Tora! Tora!", and if you want a film about WW2 pilots, with a good script, engaging characters and good special effects, try "Dark Blue World."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As to your history, you need to go back to school. The FlyingTigers were in China fighting the JAPS not England. Atlease 250 American pilots did leave their units to fight in the RAF and one did not have to reject or give up his US citizenship to fight for the British. As to Doolittle's raid it happened 6 months after PH and yes it was a revenge raid. By the way what school did you go to. Also I'm a History major on WW2. And according to records at 3 nurses were killed when fighters attack the Naval Hospital near Ford Island. And as to pilots cross-training, it happened more then you think. And since there were a shortage of bomber pilots it could be possible for fighter pilots to become bomber pilots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me say that I liked this movie. I repeat: I ... LIKED ... THIS ... MOVIE. I know that the story has more holes in it than Swiss cheese and the special effects were somewhat overblown (get the pun?), but this movie is not about the characters nor is it about the special effects. Rather it's about an event that galvanized a nation and transformed the world. That is, it's about the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. After Pearl Harbor, the world was never the same, and although the movie has it's weaknesses, one thing is for certain: after watching this movie, you know that SOMETHING BIG happened on that fateful day and that it effected a lot of people in different ways. Maybe the movie should have provided more historical background - but it's not a documentary. Or maybe the movie should have had a better script - but did that really matter? What DOES matter is the event itself, and in this respect, despite the over-reliance on special effects, the movie does its job well. For this reason I cannot be too critical and that alone is enough to make this movie worth watching.Kate Beckinsdale gives an excellent performance. She is a great actress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbour is one of my all time favourite films. Its great because even though it tells the story of how America were dragged into the second world war, it adds action and romance and excitement. Josh Hartnett is so fit!!!!! Thats one of the things that makes this film great. However this film is also very moving, as it ends in tragedy. Its a definite one to make u cry yet its such a great story and a great film!! Its upsetting near the beginning when Danny and Evelyn receive news regarding Rafes death, and seek comfort in the arms of one another. Yet Rafe soon appears after what we see was a false report of his death and we soon see Evelyn caught between two amazing brave guys who are both in love with her and we get caught up in the story of WW2 making this film a definite crying film yet moves you so much its one of the greatest films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Purely a great drama movie.If you are expecting an action movie, don't expect too much. There are several parts where there are bombs flying, guns shooting, missiles flaring, but for the record, this movie is a drama. In my opinion one of the best. You'd think of it as a classic love story, two people in love, the man going to war, but this love story is totally different. It's more about one love, then splitting up into two. Kind of confusing, but once you watch it, you'll understand. If you like dramas, this is a must see movie. A lot of guys out there should be careful. I know a lot of my friends (guys) didn't like this movie very much at all. Only the parts with the gun firing and the bombings but besides that they thought it was a total chick flick, which it is. But if you like drama chick flick movies, this is THE movie to watch. This movie is truly one of THE saddest movie I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh gosh a pure disaster of a film that is to the 2000s what "Dune" was to the 1980s and "Wyatt Earp" was to the 1990s. A totally disappointing would-be masterpiece that never does find its way and bores with a sappy love story more than it intrigues with a loud and empty action sequence that is interminable. It is 1941 and the U.S. is on dangerous ground as the attack on Pearl Harbor looms as Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale fall in love, but when it appears that Affleck is dead, Beckinsale starts to fall in love with his best friend (Josh Hartnett). A torrid love triangle gets in the way of the tenseness that made "Tora! Tora! Tora!" such an interesting, albeit under-achieving, production. The attack comes, oh does it ever come, and Pearl Harbor is left in shambles. So now Affleck and Hartnett must put their differences aside when the U.S. couter-attacks in the almost unknown Dolittle Raid (which is not written about much because it too was such a disaster for the U.S. military). A long and sometimes incredibly dull film that does best when Cuba Gooding, Jr. is on screen. He co-stars as an African-American sailor who tries to earn respect from his contemporaries in a military that is fueled by racial unrest. Gooding, Jr.'s character is based on a real person who actually shot down several Japanese attack planes and was awarded a medal that was later taken back by the government. That possibly intriguing story is only given a minute glimpse as Michael Bay gets carried away with corny special effects and Randall Wallace's irritating screenplay. A major downer of epic proportions. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It cost roughly $140 million to produce this chimera. At the rate of my current income, that would sustain me for 12,727,272 years. No kidding.Well, so it had a monstrous budget and professionally competent actors, but it's not worth much mention. I suppose it accomplished its goal, which was to use computer-generated effects and make money.Its chief utility may be to introduce kids to some elementary facts about World War II. It wasn't designed to do it, but kids may need all the help they can get. A recent poll showed an alarming percentage of high school students didn't know who fought whom. A goodly number thought we and the Germans fought the Russians. Does that constitute a red flag or what? Basically this is a movie about a nurse who loves two men, only one of which manages to survive the Doolittle raid on Japan. If you're interested in love affairs and that sort of thing, this is your kind of movie. The CGIs are nice and exciting. That ought to hold the interest if nothing else does. Ka-BOOM.For the record, Admiral Yamamoto never said, "I fear all we have done is awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve." That was invented for the film "Tora, Tora, Tora". For that matter, the bombing of Tokyo, tacked on at the end with reckless calculation, since it had nothing to do with the basic story, was not done in formation as the movie shows it. The B-25s took off early and headed straight for their targets one by one, not having enough fuel to form up. They launched early because they were sighted by some Japanese fishing vessels and it was justifiably assumed that the fishing vessels had radioed the contact to authorities. The fishing vessels were fired upon and sunk by our cruisers. They were filled with men, women, and children, according to Rod Steiger, who was among the crew of one of the destroyers in the flotilla.There IS no really good movie about the attack on Pearl Harbor. A far better film of the period is "From Here to Eternity" or, better yet, "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo." I realize it's hard to believe but "Pearl Harbor" is cornier, less accurate, and more dumbed down than "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo," which is a 1944 movie made for adults not kids suffering from attention-deficit disorder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, as a histery major at a MAJOR American university, I'll tell you right off the bat this film had some serious problems with its histery - where was the Titantic? Doesn't Bay know it was sunk at Pearl Harbor along with the Battleship Lusitania? And what was with that Dr. Doolittle raid? Dr. Doolittle was a Canadian zookeeper, not a bomber pilot. And it wasn't an air raid that devastated Vietnam after Pearl Harbor, it was Texas-sized planet killer asteroids dropped from stealth planes. Didn't Bay see "Final Countdown"? And when did Ben Affleck become, like, a fighter pilot? They could at least have given him a jet plane, or used Tom Cruise, who is a real jet pilot. Other than these ridiculous hitorical innaccurasies, it was a great summer blockbuster film! The sizzling chemistry between the two pilots was amazing and heartwarming. Cuba Gooding was fantastic as the black sailor, OMG OMG OMG I didn't even know they had black people back then (and I'm not alone on that one ask any white person)! I watched this with my grandmother and she agreed there weren't any black peeple at the time too, so this film is HIGHLY progressive too.Basically it was about like, these totally cool people, like Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett and all these geeks, who were like, foreign or something and totally evil dorks who can't even speak English. Then the cool people like totally kick the their geek Vietnamese butts. We'll be renting this film for decades to come.Sure it wasn't highbrow, but that isn't what films are for. If you want highbrow just watch Fox News like every other American.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant and unforgettable - world's first impressionist action film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Bay is known for applying his astonishingly fertile imagination to producing gripping, pulse-pounding cinematic action. PEARL HARBOR delivers all this and more because, unlike most of Bay's films, much of the movie has a mysterious, poetic quality. It actually has the unmistakable feel of a tale told from memory ... that sense of days gone by, and long-remembered. The director interviewed a large number of survivors of the Pearl Harbor attack before making the film and screened it for them before it was released. Unlike most American film critics, they found the movie to be powerful and very true to what they felt about their experiences. The key word here is "felt". While the film - other than the battle scenes - is not meant to be taken as a literal portrayal, it is remarkably true, it seems, to the inner, emotional experience. American film critics have always had trouble relating to abstraction - probably because the American film tradition itself is so deeply rooted in "wrought iron" realism. But the critics and viewers who have dumped on this fine work have really missed out on a significant and insightful creation. The core subject of PEARL HARBOR is the way events in the early 1940s plucked a generation of young people out of their peaceful lives and forced them - almost instantaneously - to enter adulthood. They were called upon to sacrifice - to become heroes - to die for a way of life they would ultimately have to deny to themselves. Bay's work here is brilliant and compelling. For once, he devotes his considerable genius for creating powerful images to a higher purpose - and, for the viewer who responds to this, the film lives on in the mind through these magnificent images. During the battle sequence, there is one particular shot of an American flag that serves perfectly as a metaphor for what happened on that fateful day. Though many of the details people have scoffed at are, in fact, authentic, this film is nowhere close to being a docudrama. PEARL HARBOR rather speaks the language of archetypes and leaves you with its powerful and memorable imagery. Most importantly, it is a great, moving, unforgettable monument to the inner experiences of the people who actually lived the epic drama of World War II.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite War movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Readers,It was on a cold Sunday Morning that one of the most horrific attacks against the United States was committed: The attack on Pearl Harbor Naval Base in Hawaii. Over 3,000 people died in a brutal attack by the Japanese Air Force. Several films have been made that explain the events of Pearl Harbor, the most recent is the heavily under-appreciated epic by Michael Bay, Pearl Harbor.Despite its tremendous length, (Three hours!) Pearl Harbor is a magnificent and touching story. It should be watched by everyone and be given the respect it truly deserves, instead of being bashed insanely and relentlessly. The acting is top-notch, both main and supporting cast, the score is haunting and beautiful, the directing is magnificent, the editing is done well, and the film itself is stunning.The film moves in four acts. Act 1 introduces us to the characters; Act 2 is the steady build up and covers the Battle of Britain; Act 3 is the bombing of Pearl Harbor; and Act 4 is the Doolittle raid, the retaliatory strike against Japan by the United States Air Force. Almost an hour is devoted to each act, making it the longest War film I've ever seen and probably topping Saving Private Ryan by at least 45 minutes.Acting: Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckinsale have great chemistry together as well as providing one of the best love triangles ever. Supporting Cast performances by Cuba Gooding Jr., Tom Sizemore, Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight, Cary Hiroyuki-Tagawa, and Mako are cool as well. 9/10Score: German Composer Hans Zimmer proves once more he is the greatest composer who ever lived with his haunting and magnificent score. 10/10Action Scenes: The Pearl Harbor Sequences are amazing despite a supposed few historical inaccuracies. However, this is the movies! Even Saving Private Ryan had a few historical inaccuracies!!! The action is well-directed but is still quite violent despite the PG-13. The MASSIVE Pearl Harbor sequence is powerful and unforgettable, but is less gory and grisly than Saving Private Ryan's infamous D-Day sequence or most of the scenes in Windtalkers. 9/10Overall Grade Pearl Harbor is probably the most under-appreciated war film made. It's also the third best War film ever, defeated only by Saving Private Ryan and Platoon. It's a stunning film about the day that shall forever live in infamy, December 7th, 1941. 9/10Signed, The Constant DVD Collector</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To some of the critics who absolutely trashed this movie, saying it was so fake and cheesy, I don't understand how they can praise Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It had people flying all over the place!!!!It is sad to note that many of the critics are simply clueless about WWII-And those who slammed this movie's love story - it makes me wonder if they are this meanspirited and critical in their own love life (or lack of). Many of the critics never once mentioned feeling any compassion or empathy for the victims of the attack.See this movie. It is a Hollywood movie, not a DOCUMENTARY!!! Transform yourself back to a time when love of country, familiy and honor were an integral part of the moral character of America. A time when we did practically worship our Presidents (this was before Vietnman,Watergate,Clinton/Monica), a time when courtship was very innocent between men and women (ask your grandparents!). A time before rap music, the Internet, tabloid journalism, and political correctness.The setting for this movie was spectacular - the scene of Ben Affleck standing by the train with a fog rolling around as Kate walks up to him, was beautifully portrayed. The hospital scenes and the music scores were haunting.For those who are clueless about WWII, let me help you separate Hollywood from History:- Do an Internet search (or try Amazon) on the 'the rape of Nanking' the Chinese city that the Japanese military invaded where they slaughtered 300,000 civilians, old people and children and raping and killing about 20,000 women. The year was 1937, before Pearl Harbor. (Warning-you may see very GRAPHIC, UNEDITED PICTURES of the atrocities).- Do a search on the 'Bataan Death March' and read about how the brutal and sadistic Japanese military AT THAT TIME treated their prisoners of war.- When Hitler's second man in command was captured afer WWII, Hermann Goering, he was absolutely stunned - "How can a country full of cooks, clerks and farmers defeat the most powerful army in the world?" yes, friends, WWII was fought mostly by TEENAGERS, not men. If you want to read about some real heroes, not Hollywood heroes, look no further than our own military history because it is full of them. Read about the Doolittle raid, yes that is true!!! And Cuba Gooding's character, in real life, was later killed in the war when the Japanese blew up his ship in the Pacific.Japan's leaders must have thought the same thing as the Germans. Before the island of Tarawa was attacked by the Americans, the Japanese general had boasted that "a million men cannot take Tarawa in a thousand years." The Marines took it in three days.See this movie in honor of a father, grandfather, uncle, etc. who has or is serving in the military. Celebrate the heroism of the incredible generation who defended and died for our country.On the island of Iwo Jima was an American cemetary with 6,800 graves, mostly teenaged American boys, mounds with crosses and stars. Thousands of families would have no body to bid farewell. A message chiseled outside the cemetary reads: When you go home Tell them for us and say For your tomorrow We gave our today</fullReview>

Rafe, the charismatic and outgoing of the two lads has just met and fallen for a beautiful nurse Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) but his desire to be a proper fighter pilot has just become reality when he offered the chance to go to England. Determined to go Rafe leaves behind a pained Evelyn but when word comes through that Rafes plane has been shot down Rafe is pronounced dead. As time passes and military and technical training intensify Danny comes more and more into Evelyn's life. Bonded by their loss of Rafe and a sense of alonement the two are soon lovers. Theire happiness however is short lived when Rafe turns up alive and well rescued from a watery grave from a French fisherman. Torn by her reborn love for Rafe and her newfound love for Danny, Evelyn is thrown into emotional turmoil. Rafe meanwhile is disgusted that whilst he has been presumed dead Danny has been sleeping with his girlfriend and the two clash violently but on the morning of December 7th the two are thrown together when the Japanese air pilots drop massive bombs on the small island of pearl harbour. Recognising their potential, Rafe and Danny's boss Colonel Doolittle (Alec Baldwin) assigns them to a top-secret mission and offers them an opportunity to be the pilots they have always dreamed of being. Unable to stand by and watch Danny and Evelyn together Rafe immediately joins along with Danny but Evelyn cannot let him go and when she explains why to a shocked Rafe he tries to persuade Danny to stay but will the boys come home, both to Evelyn and will Danny ever find out her reason from trying to prevent him from accepting his mission. With outstanding special effects and love story to touch even the most frosted of hearts, Pearl Harbour is a classic wartime film that, like the attacks will linger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Love Story in War-time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really love this movie which is awesome for me in every detail. I was speechless after watching it with my husband and other friends at home. I cried and cheered all the time. My friends also loved it. Because this is one of the greatest love stories ever told and deserves 10 points rating- no doubt about it. That makes me think how silly are people who cannot appreciate this movie.Pearl Harbor was attacked by the Empire of Japan, and the American democracy entered the war to protect its freedom. Japan forced the USA to get into the war and the strength of American people during that exhausting struggle turned out to be the road to victory.Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are terrific handsome American guys who make it big in this movie. Kate Beckinsale plays an American voluntary nurse who enlists to serve her country and finds love.The music by Hans Zimmer is absolutely awesome... I bought the CD of the original soundtrack the same week I watched the movie.All in all this is a must-see movie for intelligent people able to understand history and the sacrifice payed by the Greatest Generation of Americans to defeat the Japanese and German imperialism and bring democracy and freedom to the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was absolutely breathtaking. The actors were phenomenal, the soundtrack is amazing, the plot is just mind blowing with sudden turn of events, great setting and props, and MUCH MUCH more. In my opinion, this movie is better than a lot of other war movies I've seen, and I've seen A LOT. in my opinion, this movie is even better than Saving Private Ryan. This movie is greatly underrated that is irritates and even angers me sometimes. It's a very beautiful film that I think everyone should watch. I don't understand why it has such low ratings. Even without the romance, this movie would still be amazing. I have not yet found a thing I do not like about this movie. I'm actually surprised it doesn't have as high ratings as I thought. What a shame. Very good work done by the director and casting directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbor Jolted Us Awake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We Americans are slow to remember and slow to awaken to just causes and that is what this movie Pearl Harbor attempts to do. Forget the love triangle and whether or not the guns used were historically accurate. This was a movie to make Americans aware that we can be attacked and our life's are not as secure as we would have ourselves believe.I'm not here to criticize the writing or the direction of the movie. It was what it was. There are other movies that focus on the attack and love triangle. Tora-Tora-Tora for one which presented the attack from both the Japanese and the American viewpoints. As far as the raid on Tokyo 30 Seconds Over Tokyo is an excellent movie that depicts that raid with Spencer Tracy playing the role of Dolittle. When all is said and done a little over 3,000 people were killed at the attack of Pearl Harbor. We fast forward to our time; on 9/11 between the two towers of the trade center, the Pentagon, and Shanks Field in Pennsylvania a little of 3,000 people were killed. I experienced 9/11. What amazes me is how soon we Americans forget when Americans have given there lives that we can remain free and secure. Pearl Harbor was and is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply wonderful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie so many times and it is just epic. It has everything a movie with such a theme should have.I always say that for an epic movie to be created there are just two things that needs to be perfect, script and director, who could argue with the talent of Michael Bay (Director of the transformers trilogy, I am number four, Armageddon...), and I read a review claiming the script by Randall Wallace to be insane and yet genius, a result too clear on the screen, the love story is unique and the action seems to be right in the room. It grabs hold of your every fiber from start to end and afterwards your'e so inspired but don't necessarily have something to with that inspiration, yet it remains there. 10 out of 10 for excellent scenery, great acting and an incomparable love story. I've heard complaints of how it is historically inaccurate, and I couldn't care less about it, the only thing that made me consider lowering my vote would be just the fact that I am not a Ben Affleck fan, but that's not fair to take in consideration, Johs Hartnett however impressed me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure i understand this film isn't 100% historically correct but it has to be one of the best war films of its time down to the cinematic and action qualities, this film reminds you of all the awful tragedies that happened during this 'Sneak' attack. It shows how the Japanese planned there attack to cripple Americas fleet of ships, if you like action war films, with a romantic storyline then this could well be the film for you... the only downside is the length of the film which is filled with different story-lines.Some Reviews will try to say that the film has nothing to do with the actual facts on pearl harbour, you have to remember this is a propaganda type of film.. All in all this is a memorable film that will always be in my films pile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overly Criticized</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While reading just a few of the comments, I experienced great anguish at the "armchair warriors," or, those I regard as "warriors," criticizing this film. It is a compelling story yes, and maybe only 5-10-15% of the depictions were a complete re-creation, accurate in every detail. The idea was entertainment, and I give the makers of this film a very big hand. First of all, this happened one December morning I either remember parts of while visiting (as folks did back in 1941) or that I revere very highly among all of the other actual recollections in my life. I treasure seeing this and other historically founded films. The producers of this piece tell that many depictions are composites of actual events for sake of placing diverse events and important results into a deserved perspective.I want to start by saying that I am surprised the Navy even gave Doris "Dorrie" Miller the decoration he received; the Navy Cross. This was 1941 and a segregated military was still the national model. It seems likely that if this happened after 1990 or 2000, that he might have been awarded the Medal of Honor. On the face of it, others who remained at their station and who performed similar gallantry did receive the Medal of Honor. No doubt they deserved theirs, and I see that this is not a solitary view as this is the view of a writer at encyclopedia.com. I hope the President and members of Congress see fit to upgrade this award for him.I was astonished at the details covered by this film. The amount of work to just do the flames and explosions is beyond belief.There is a large effort apparent by the stunt persons who acted in the production. Mentioned are the feet of primer cord, dynamite and gasoline used in the film. The arsenal and ordinance expenditure used in this film I feel sure, exceed the GNP of small provinces and it all had to be paid for on the gamble that it would be shown enough to just come out even. That it was overlooked for Oscar® nomination or award receiving only the "Best Sound Content" award seems very surprising.Having been a training flight instructor I have even greater respect for the men (and perhaps women) who flew their aircraft between actual ships just feet above the water where any minor miscalculation would not have been survived. The scene where tho two childhood pals, Rafe and Danny played chicken does not look like a computer generated piece. Maybe parts of it were manipulated, but undoubtedly the actual head-on closing speed of what must have been 400+ mph is real as well as the maneuver to first roll one direction and suddenly change to the opposite direction and then do this clear of each other. I am sure the slightest mistake would have erased two men's lives and retired two old war birds. A big hand for the pilots and certainly for their bravery and for whatever they were paid to do this. It must have required many rehearsals and many spine-tingling moments-to-hours expended by the pilots and undoubtedly, backup crews were also used in order to insure the shooting schedule.A lot of ingenuity is apparent when seeing the battle scenes and later viewing the special effects section on the second disk. While others have been critical of this film to extremes, it receives my highest regard and respect. Gor another similar topic to come to the screen soon is very unlikely. unlikely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I studied American History in college with the goal of teaching. I was never able to enter the field, due to the non-academic aspects of the American educational system (coaches, coaches and coaches). This is a seminal work in that it invites serious investigation of our past. I know many inaccuracies were present in the filming of battleship row. Does that mean the event did not occur? I do know that my parents generation were fully invested in winning the war after loosing the early battles. To the many young Americans who do not have a clue of what it means to be an American, it might be a place to start. If we "support our troops", is that verbal, or are we ready to report for the draft or even to volunteer for active duty? That is the question facing our present generation.</fullReview>

I like the FDR in the movie. This movie was patriotic and the Americans were without a doubt the good guys. My daughter does not like war movies but she liked this one (because of the romance elements). I found it very entertaining and would watch it again though it was not my favorite movie. I personally liked TORA TORA TORA better. I think you need to stick to action or romance they are hard to mix.

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is based around 1940-1941 and the plot is very detailed. It captured me and took me into the story, the battle scenes were thrilling and the romance scenes were steamy. I didn't like the fact that one of the main characters had to die in the climax when we were bombing the Japanese. Well I thought Ben Affleck did a spectacular job as Rafe, (but i preferred Danny's Style), and all being said, I think they dragged this one on a little too long. I mean it was supposed to be about the battle, and about 40 minutes were actual BATTLE scenes.All in all, I thought this movie was a cut above your average war flick (Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, Behind Enemy Lines, etc etc...) It had everything I was looking for, all in one movie. I guess it was my fault to go to the 9:30 show!</fullReview>

At the same time we follow the story of a planned Japanese attack. The Americans knew there was going to be an attack but they didn't know where.But of course we do. Then the attack hits. Who will survive? The Americans plan an attack back and some men come forward to volunteer for it. Including Rafe and Danny.

		<fullReview>Personally, I really loved this movie. A lot. But that's just me. I realize that it got bad reviews, both from the newspapers and critics, and from people on this very site, but I disagree. Everyone rants about how it is historically inaccurate, has a "hollywood" plot, and does the soldiers on both sides injustice. However, and this may not be 100% right, most people who gave it such bad reviews were expecting a war movie, or a history movie, or a documentary, not a love story, which is what is primarily is. The attack is very important, don't get me wrong, but it is not the only thing happening, and is crucial to the plot. As long as you don't start this movie expecting it to be a documentary, accurate to the letter, I think you will really like it, as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stick With It - The Wait Is Worth It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is two movies in one, and almost forces anyone trying to review it to divide it into two parts.You have to have some serious "stick-to-it-iveness" to make this work for you. The first hour and a half or so is all about the love story between Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale). The most generous thing I can say about this is that it is excruciating. The romance is never really fleshed out. It appears almost out of the blue and seems to move in a stuttering way that doesn't make a lot of sense. I didn't think there was much chemistry between Affleck and Beckinsale, or for that matter between Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett, who played Danny - Rafe's best friend and eventual rival for Evelyn's love. Too cliché, and the reason for the conflict between Rafe and Danny is too contrived. This first half gets a 2/10. You will almost be prepared to turn this thing off - until the Japanese attack!Here's where "Pearl Harbor" begins to shine. Everything you've heard about the special effects contained in this are absolutely true. They are magnificent, and succeed in putting the viewer right into the heart of the battle. The acting still doesn't shine - but it doesn't have to! This is edge of your seat stuff and makes the horribly dull first half worth it. These have got to be some of the most realistic war scenes ever put together by Hollywood. The second half rates an 8/10.A couple of casting notes are in order. Dan Aykroyd as the naval captain who is also the crack decoder just didn't work for me, and Jon Voight - who played President Roosevelt - simply did not capture the part. Overall - no better than average performances, even from the leads. So, let's see. A 2/10 for the first half, and an 8/10 for the second. That averages out to 5/10 - and that seems right to me. Not a glowing endorsement overall, but you will be amazed by the battle scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I browse through IMDB (best movie site ever), I notice not a lot of people find this movie very favourable. The story sucks; laughable characters; overlong and boring. And 'Titanic' won best picture. Sure, the resemblance to 'Titanic' is strong throughout, but I believe it surpasses it. James Cameron and Micheal Bay are two minds that think alike. Can't develop characters very well but they sure can develop destruction scenes very very well. Yes, in 'Pearl Harbor' the love story is pretty bad, but arn't all Hollywood love story's bad?. I believe foreign films potray them best. But if there is one thing that Hollywood can do well, it's blowing up stuff real good. 'Pearl Harbor' has, in my opinion, one of the most spectacular action sequences ever comitted to film. It sure beats 'Titanic's sinking ship. So yes, I do recommend this film. One more thing... why is 'The Lord of the Rings' holding the top spot on the IMDB scale?.</fullReview>

First of all I know theres a lot of F/X in the movie but in order to show the ships blowing up you'll need special effects. When I go to the movies, I dont go and criticize the poor script writing or lame cinematography. It's either I like the movie or dont. In my opinion Pearl Harbor is one of the best WWII movies ever made. The scenes were done really good. Michael Bay did such a good job on this movie. The music really moved me. I have no clue why critics put down this movie. I didnt think it was too long. Saving Private Ryan was long and so was Braveheart but no one complained about those movies. And so what if there was a love story. Dont get me wrong I loved Braveheart, and Saving Private Ryan are really good movies. The acting was really good too. I dont know why everyone is putting down this movie. But in my opinion I think you'll like the movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes war movies or is patriotic to our country.

		<fullReview>I really don't understand the concept of people hating this movie. I mean can someone please explain me where this movie lacks soul, a good direction, background score &amp; screenplay. The movie is 3 hours long &amp; to be honest I hate watching movies which are so lengthy specially 3 hours. I want to watch Godfather but couldn't since the movie has 3 hours of runtime. This is the only movie which I took a risk of watching &amp; believe me I didn't felt bored even for a sec in the whole movie. To describe movie in 1 word, I would say MASTERPIECE.The movie begins two childhood friends desires to become air force pilot. The characters of Raff &amp; Danny are well scripted &amp; the cast is been placed perfectly for the movie. Kate looks beautiful &amp; charming lady working as a nurse in a navy. The love triangle between Raff, Evelyn &amp; Danny is beautifully scripted &amp; executed throughout the whole movie. The first 70 mins are totally based on the main characters life which I believe very well directed there was neither too much or less or romance in between Raff, Evelyn &amp; Danny. Meanwhile Japanese makes a strategy to attack America on Pearl Harbor. The movie takes sudden twist when japs plans to attack Pearl Harbor which according me takes movie to new level. The start of air attack on Pearl Harbor are the soul of the movie. The 40 mins of Pearl Harbor attack is gonna blow you away. The action sequences at its best, &amp; of course it will be cause Michael Bay is behind camera. Best use of cgi in that year made this movie to have the best war action sequence ever hit Hollywood screens. The attack on Pearl Harbor what I believe wont have been better if any other director would have directed this movie. The action any days beats the war action sequences we see today in other movies. The cast of the movie is well very casted, each &amp; every character has a crucial role in this movie. You won't find yourself saying that this character was useless in this movie. The background score of the movie is was soothing, the japs score is perfect scored &amp; mostly importantly the score of Pearl Harbor attack scenes adds more emotions to the movie.I don't understand why people &amp; critics says that the love triangle wasn't needed in this movie at all. OK tell me what about Titanic, jack &amp; rose meet up on a ship just for 2 days &amp; they fell in love sooo deeply with each other, don't you find this hard to digest if we look practically. The love triangle takes months before attack on Pearl, which completely makes sense. Titanic sinking scenes adds emotions to the people but what about this movie, there should be more emotions involved in this movie cause this movie is based on true history, while on the other hand jack &amp; rose are fictional characters created by James Cameroon. Well both Titanic &amp; Pearl Harbor are completely different movie &amp; Titanic is my all time classic movie. But we cannot say that Pearl Harbor lacks emotions in the war sequences, people Bay wanted to show the attack on Harbor to show the reality nor a emotional movie for ladies to carry with hankie in their hands. Of course there was so many moments which made me emotional too, specially when Danny dies &amp; the last scene of the movie. Stop criticizing about the movie lack emotions, if you want emotional movies to watch. Better consider yourself as a women who cry's even on a small stupid scenes.OK the next thing, why people always blame Bay for his work, why don't you blame the writer's who actually writes the movie not Bay. OK we understand what Bay has all the authority to make some changes in the script but still he is not that fool enough to direct movies which will make people &amp; critics blame &amp; abuse him for his work. Appericiate for what work he has done either criticizing him. This is no doubt Bay's finest work behind camera &amp; has been executed &amp; portrait perfectly well on big screens. I regret myself for didn't watching this movie in theaters as I was just 14 that time &amp; would have gone to watch it. I have seen the documentary of Pearl Harbor on National Geography, no doubt it reveals the important &amp; crucial details about Pearl Harbor. But still Bay wanted to show the real disaster not some kind of a documentary.Watch Pearl Harbor it's a highly recommended movie. The movie which got everything a viewer needs in a movie. MY RATING ? 10/10 WAY TO GO BAY !!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was literally chocked when I saw the really bad reviews for this movie. Chocked! I read that some of u were saying that the actors were bad and that it was the worst World War II- movie in history.WHAT? Are you seriously kidding me? Well.. Can't blame other people for not having the heart on the right place. This movie was, in my opinion; beautiful, sad, heartbreaking, exciting etc. This is a cult movie. This plays in the same league as Titanic, with Leonardo DiCaprio &amp; Kate Winslet. Kate Beckinsale, Josh Hartnett and Ben Affleck are GREAT actors! They're trustworthy and veridical, amazing.. I've seen this movie maybe 6 times, and every time I shed some tears. I believe Pearl Harbor and Titanic are the best movies ever made./Sara from Sweden</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is yet another example of why I get so frustrated with Michael Bay. Aside from a few good projects like The Island, Transformers and a couple of others, he's generally trash. There is no heart to this film, and it doesn't know whether it wants to be serious or jokey in tone half the time, which ended up grating me to no end. Ben Affleck has proved to improve his abilities since than, but at around this time he couldn't act worth a lick!. His obvious wooden performance is quite the turn off, while Josh Hartnett who I actually like a lot of the time isn't much better. The love storyline plods ever so terribly and I didn't give a damn what was going on, while Michael Bay makes the action scenes much too overblown once again.Bottom line. Pearl Harbor is not worth the long running time it has. Save yourself the torture, and if you must, rent some of his better work.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearl Harbour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, after hearing all the bad reviews of this, i sat down fully expecting to be disappointed. However, in spite of a weak love triangle (I agree it was awful), i think the rest of the film was great! Although it isn't the best war film ever or the most accurate one, i'm sure any of the actors or crew would say that they never intended to offend anyone by it being unfaithful to the real heroes of Pearl Harbour and the DoLittle Raid, and so if you watch it with a pinch of salt and don't compare it to the greats like Saving Private Ryan, then you actually get an enjoyable film out of it. The war scene's are good, the music lovely, and the actors aren't all that bad. So my advice? Sit down, watch it without being overly critical.... and you might just find a film that will become one of your favourites, as i did. And well.. the ending, lets just say, i bet you cry :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>you can't deny it's an epic romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>we all know about the massive dislike for this movie due to its apparent blatant disregard for the people involved in the pearl harbor attack. what needs to be seen here is that this film is an epic romance like few other, and it's Michael Bay at his sensationalistic best.The sweeping angled shots, the slow motion sequences, the consistently dramatic and intense score....it all works as long as you can get over yourself enough to be able to appreciate the great storytelling going on here.I feel sorry for anyone who can watch this film and not be truly moved by the poignancy of it all. When it comes down to it, this film is about the romance, and they really do it well. Admittedly some scenes may be a little stressed (having your gal sitting on your knee in the cockpit while you do a barrel roll?); but this isn't a problem for the romantic idealist that most of us are lucky enough to have somewhere within us.We all loved Cuba Gooding jr's character; i challenge anyone to deny they had goosebumps when he manned that gun and let out a maddening scream as he shot down that plane.I imagine Alec Baldwin's character is what pushed the haters of this movie over the top. He was a perfect stereotype, delivering the macho-hero-patriot-badass-never say die lines. It's sensationalism, its exaggerated it's painfully Hollywood, but it fits, and you can't help but love it.In terms of pure entertainment, and pulling at the heart strings, this film is tough to beat. I am a fan of the classics, i love the indie circuit, but most of all my main criteria when judging a film is if it can move you, and the impact that it leaves. We all know this film scores high in this area...and il say again if you aren't affected by it, then maybe you should try and think back to when you became so jaded or distracted from what fascinated and moved you in younger years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it applies here. This is probably one of the best war movies possible and is horribly underrated. I don't give a rat's tail about historical inaccuracy or anything else this movie is harpooned about; historical accuracy is for documentaries, not a movie like this one, which is made brilliantly. (It even says so in the "goofs" section; you can look for yourself!) What is also great about this movie is that the filmmakers chose to tone down the blood/gore (except for the hospital scenes) and language enough to get a PG-13 rating. This feels like a kids' movie in comparison to "Saving Private Ryan" and the like. Just be careful not to get the R-rated director's cut. This movie also has one of the most powerful and emotionally overwhelming film scores I have ever heard. I'll probably get screamed at by John Williams fans, but trust me; this Hans Zimmer score is surprisingly good. It is the most I have ever cried during a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Author: Zanzibar from UK, Wow! Snooty much? Geez, get over it. It's just a movie. It's Hollywood not history. This is our story and we should tell it the way we want. It's an emotional, dramatic telling of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. To get your knickers in a twist over stupid details is ridiculous. I personally like it. No, wait I loved this movie. I loved it when I first saw it and I still love it. Say what you want about it. But the acting was great, the story was compelling and it gets my approval. The only thing I have to say against it is the length. It is a very long movie, especially with the directors cut. While it's true that there are historical inaccuracies, this movie tells a story that must be told. Again and again. The lives that were lost, the event, the day must be remembered. For my generation it makes that day come alive. It's something that shouldn't be forgotten and this movie takes you back to that moment, to that time and for me, it's one of the best WWII movies I've seen. That's why I give it 10 stars.</fullReview>

The film was quite simply excellent, the chemistry between the cast members is amazing (Kate Beckinsale's performance was stunning)and the special effects were superb. You really get a sense of the horrors of the attack on Pearl Harbour. The film was not necessarily historically correct but that does not detract attention from the films version of events.I take back all previous statements about the film and give it an 8/10 for its emotive, harrowing yet excellent movie portrayal of the attacks on Pearl harbour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PEARL HARBOR Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS-8(35mm and 70mm release prints)On the eve of America's entry into World War II, two young fighter pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) - friends since childhood - are driven apart by their love for a beautiful woman (Kate Beckinsale), but they're forced to set aside their differences when Japanese forces attack the US naval base at Pearl Harbor...One of the most expensive - and vilified - films of its day, this gargantuan epic stands accused of exploiting historical tragedy for commercial gain, courtesy of producer Jerry Bruckheimer (notorious for a string of opportunistic blockbusters) and director Michael Bay (previously responsible for such unassuming action fare as "The Rock" and "Armageddon"). This argument may - or may not - have merit, but as a *movie*, PEARL HARBOR is romantic, flamboyant and defiantly old-fashioned, like a 1940's picture postcard come to life. And as a spectacle, it's hard to beat: The attack on Pearl Harbor is one of the most breathtaking set-pieces in Hollywood history, offering a pilot's-eye view of the aerial bombardment, the destruction on the ground, and the horrendous loss of life. It may seem exploitative to some viewers, but Bay uses modern technology (including a terrific multichannel soundtrack) to capture the drama, heartbreak and horror of the occasion like never before.Randall Wallace's overheated script is a little too jingoistic in places (co-star Alec Baldwin is much given to speechifying in this regard), but the friendship between Affleck and Hartnett is depicted with great tenderness and affection, and while their dispute over Beckinsale is probably the least engaging aspect of the entire production, the pay-off still packs quite an emotional wallop. The supporting cast includes Cuba Gooding Jr., Mako and Dan Aykroyd, with Jon Voight as President Roosevelt (his speech to Congress on 8 December 1941 remains as powerful today as it ever was). Try to see the R-rated director's cut, which offers a slightly more graphic - and therefore more honest - depiction of the death and destruction inflicted on American servicemen (and women) during the Pearl Harbor disaster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb! An epic that takes you on a rollercoaster of emotion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has been trashed since its release, but is a true epic. The performances by Affleck, Hartnett, and Kate(who looks like an angel) are all strong and convincing, and the special effects are so realistic that it will make your stomach churn. It is rare that a film affects me that way this one does. One minute I was laughing, the next filled with anger, then in awe of the action, and I even cried. Those who have trashed this movie are the people who go in expecting non-stop action for the entire 3 hours, and those who have labelled it another mindless blockbuster, without giving it a chance. Don't get me wrong there is PLENTY of action involved, but it is more than just the action that makes the movie. What makes the movie in my opinion, is the love triangle, and the strength of Raef and Danny's relationship and the situations that life throws at them.(This is coming from a guy, so it is not the chick flick that many label it as.) I have seen this movie twice already, once with my brother and the other with my girlfriend, and we all loved it. As I said this is a movie for both guys and the girls. While the script isn't anything Oscar worthy, it definitely draws you and keeps your interest, and builds up to a beautiful yet horrific climax, after all, this isn't just a movie about the bombing like many people go in expecting. I was not one of those people so I went in with an open mind and just hoped there was plenty of action throughout the movie(Which there was) Beckinsale was absolutely georgeous, and perfect for the role of Evelyn the nurse.(After watching her performance, I was glad Charlize Therone did not take the role) I have always been a fan of Affleck and once again he did not disappoint, but the strongest performance was by Josh Hartnett who I have been following closely from his early days in The Faculty, and H20. He really steals the screen every time he is on.(even when sharing it with Affleck)Critics may have blasted this movie, but in my opinion they went in with the frame of mind that they were already going to blast it, so don't take what most of them say about this movie too seriously, and give it a chance, it is definitely the best movie of the summer so far, and has all the makings of an epic. SO GO AHEAD AND SEE WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT, YOU WON'T REGRET IT. I know I will enjoy this movie time and time again. (****) out of (****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No it is not the overpolished shots, nor the melodic sound track, nor the brave hunks libe Ben and Josh, nor the lacrymal effects of the death of one of the hero, nor the classical love-story, nor the underlying jingoistic heroism after the humiliating coward attack that make this film disappointing : it is the waste of so much talent and money.The acting is fair and mostly credible whereas the story is so cliched. Ok yes you can feel a few emotions but it seems so "Bruckheimered" that I find it hard to really identify myself during the emotional scenes. If you don't see what I mean just imagine the slow-motion camera on the hurt soldiers + hans Zimmer music and you will already fancy the revenge of the sleeping giant (the US). Or you could imagine the third role good black guy (Cuba Gooding, Jr) who should also be entitled to be a true American hero by shooting one plane.Anyway besides the clichés and once you forget the historical inaccuracies, you could have "the epic romance story during tragic history" style of film, and that's where the shoe pinches because the epic soufflé never rises and the romance is predictable, contrived and too melodramatic !Understand me, the movie is not that bad : you get more at watching it fully despite the 3 hours long than watching the trailer. It works as long as it aims at entertainig and has even some good points : the battle scenes are impressive (and even should I say it : nice),and the film is also a respectable tribute to the American heroes of WW2. Ben Aflleck is rather convincing, every shot of the film is like a Hawaian postcard. So bad the clichéd storytelling entangled all that.(6 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film. This review which follows is perhaps the most balanced anyone will find.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>some SPOILERS will follow...I purposely waited until "Pearl Harbor" was on DVD so that I could see it not only in the comfort of my own home theater, but also take advantage of all the interesting extras sure to accompany the DVD. I am not disappointed. What follows are (1) a review of the film itself, (2) a commentary on the misleading negative reviews, (3) a short discussion of the statistics of IMDb votes, and (4) a comment on the DVD itself.REVIEWING THE FILM - The film itself is rather long, about 3 hours, on 2 DVDs. As we see from the "extras", great care was taken to incorporate realistic stories composited from several real Pearl Harbor heros, and to accurately recreate the horror of the surprise attack at 7:55AM on Sunday, December 7, 1941 by the Japanese. It is a highly pro-USA account, but considering that this is a "movie", and the target audience was primarily American, that makes sense.The story starts in 1923, in Tennessee, where boyhood friends Rafe and Danny pretend to fly and shoot down Germans. Cut to 1941, Long Island, where both of them are fighter pilots. Rafe falls for pretty nurse, Evelyn, then is asked to go to England to help fight the Germans. Very successful there, he is eventually hit, ditches, is recovered by French, but presumed dead. Distraught and now both assigned to Pearl Harbor, Danny and Evelyn become friendly, real friendly, she becomes pregnant. Rafe is alive, he shows up, there is an emotional struggle among the three to do the right things.Then the attack comes, all three are heroic, Evelyn in triage, Rafe and Danny shooting down 7 enemy planes. As the war progresses, Jimmy Doolittle conceives of a plan to launch bombers from a carrier, and Rafe and Danny volunteer to participate. The success of this mission is pivotal in the Japanese feeling vulnerable while the USA feels they can win the war. Rafe survives but Danny doesn't. In the end, Rafe and Evelyn and young son "Danny" are seen building their lives, all forever changed by the events of WW II.Is the movie perfect? Far from it. Are there some cheesy lines? Sure there are, mostly because it seeks some "entertainment" value. However, the film overall is a fine achievement, showing through a fictional love story how some of the people likely were affected during that historic period. Plus, it contains 30+ minutes of truly magnificent re-enactment of that short but critical attack on Pearl Harbor. It cannot help reminding us how horrible war is.My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, everyone should see it and understand it for what it represents, without being overly critical of what some may consider its weaknesses. We thought Ben Affleck was very effective as Rafe and Kate Beckinsale as Evelyn. The best acting accomplishment, however, was Jon Voight as President Roosevelt. The IMDb ratings for "Pearl Harbor" cluster near "7" and that, or "8", is an appropriate rating, compared to all other modern feature films.MISLEADING NEGATIVE REVIEWS - "Pearl Harbor" is a victim of "the bandwagon effect", where people read the opinions of others then adjust their own opinions to reflect the majority. At release, many well-known critics (see Ebert, for example) said some very negative things about this film. General audiences then went to see the film, and, jumping on the bandwagon, formed negative opinions also. Reading many "user reviews" reveals that the majority of the unbiased reviews are quite good, which is appropriate. To learn more about this do an internet search on "bandwagon effect" and read several of those summaries.STATISTICS - The 13% of "1" IMDb votes for "Pearl Harbor" and the 15% of the "10" votes are equally out of place. Remove those two extremes and the votes cluster strongly around a rating of "7" and are fairly normally distributed. Compare that, for example, to a less-emotional recent film, "The Yards", which clusters much like "Pearl Harbor" but without the unusual "1" and "10" votes. "Pearl Harbor's" current rating is 5.8 while "The Yards" is 6.7, with almost identical median votes. All of which supports the contention that this film deserves a rating of about "7" overall.THE DVD - As DVDs go, this one deserves a "10". It has either Dobly 5.1 or DTS 5.1 sound selectable. As I have found in all other DVDs where both are available, the Dolby sound track is much more aggressive in the low bass region. Example, at my normal volume setting for movies (-20dB), and at my listening position, the first big explosion at 90 minutes into the film recorded 102dB in Dolby but only 93 dB in DTS. Since the dB scale is logarithmic, that represents EIGHT TIMES as much sound on the Dolby track. That is not a subtle difference! The DTS track overall is more realistic, however with a great subwoofer the Dolby track is certainly more exciting.Disk #2 has the last 1/3 of the film, plus two very nice extras. The first is a 47-minute "making of" which in many ways is more fascinating than the film itself. Just money would not have made this film. The men and women behind the location scouting, first-hand accounts, filming, special effects did almost unimaginable work to get this film made.The second nice extra is a 45-minute History Channel special on the "Unsung Heros" of Pearl Harbor. Watching it convinces us of the accuracy and validity of the story told in this film. As I have said in other reviews, anyone still watching movies in the theater or at home on VHS are missing at least half, sometimes more, of the enjoyment of recent-release movies. DVD has come of age and it is the only way to go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too long, too depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie about the events leading to Pearl Harbor and the aftermath up to when America bombed Tokyo. The movie looks beautiful--some of the shots literally took my breath away. The special effects are very realistic. The film deals with an actual event but the three main characters are fictional and the action scenes are exciting if a little bit too fast and furious (I almost wish I had brought some Dramamine with me). A rousing music score is great too. All the acting is good too (especially Ben Affleck and Kate Breckinsale--Josh Hartnett is OK). Also there's strong supporting roles done by Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight (as President Roosevelt!) and Dan Aykroyd (very good in a straight dramatic role).But I don't like the movie. It's way too long (3 hours--this easily could have been done in 2 1/2 or even 2 hours); the script is chock-full of every war movie cliché you can think of (right down to all the Japanese being evil and cold-blooded) and the direction--Michael Bay is very good at action--he is horrendous at romance. The love scenes between Kate Brekinsale and Ben Affleck have some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard in my life--the actors deserve credit for keeping a straight face while mouthing those lines. Also you do not film a love scene with the camera jammed in the actors faces. We know Affleck and Brekinsale are both beautiful--we don't need constant close-ups to prove it. Also, there are reports that Michael Bay was uncomfortable directing the women in the film...it shows. Beckinsale and the other women in the cast are good, but they seem to be unsure of how to play scenes. I don't blame them--I blame the director. Also, Cuba Gooding Jr.'s part is little more than a glorified cameo. What is he doing in this? His total screen time amounts to (maybe) 15 minutes!The destruction of Pearl Harbor is unbelievable. It's also very grim and looks way too realistic. It's 40 minutes of ships blowing up, men (and women) getting gunned down in cold blood or drowning to death. It's not entertaining--it's depressing. I've also heard that this movie is chockful of incredibly stupid historical inaccuracies.Also, I saw it at a preview audience--people were hissing the film at the end. What does that tell you? Bad dialogue, historically inaccurate, full of clichés and a far too graphic rendering of the bombing. I can't recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the problem??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read more than enough negative reviews of Pearl Harbor to last until next summer's blockbuster comes out. Apparently, looking for the good elements in a film is old-fashioned and naive, but I found plenty to appreciate in this film.The cast is charming, funny, and believable. The stars are, perhaps, too attractive, but this is the way almost every movie is cast. Why rake Pearl Harbor over the coals for choosing appealing actors? The characters are memorable, and real, despite some cornball dialogue. Were all the critics expecting Shakespearian complexity in a big-budget re-creation of 1941? Even a less-than-poetic script can't diminish the impact made by this fine cast, who give the "greatest generation" an accessible, familiar face.Pearl Harbor's romanticized look at pre-war America certainly misses the mark on historical accuracy, in favor of beautiful shots and a politically-tactful summary of world events that led America into war. If the film had concentrated on facts and figures, it would have been an expensive documentary, and an obvious rip-off of "Tora! Tora! Tora!" Instead, Pearl Harbor gets involved with a group of people who lived through an extraordinary period of world history. It gives the audience, especially young adults, the impetus to seek out more information about the attack on December 7, and World War II as a whole. Even those who criticize the film have been motivated to examine its flaws and to exhort the public to learn the "real" story of Pearl Harbor. Education and awareness of America's past is a positive outcome, regardless of the critical review of a film.As for the motivation behind Pearl Harbor, I must admit this is the weakest point. The film was not made for love of country, but for love of money. Released on Memorial Day weekend, in the year that will see the 60th anniversary of the attack, Pearl Harbor was carefully calculated to be a success. It is not as visionary and artistically inspiring as it should be, but it can be appreciated on its own merits.The film is touching and well-acted. It succeeds as a love story, a war epic and an action spectacular. It is well worth the price of admission, and is a fine addition to the ranks of WWII films from Hollywood's past.Rated 8 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good &amp; Bad Of 'Pearl Harbor'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE GOOD - This is beautifully filmed, and a sharp DVD print really brings out the brilliant colors in here. The action scenes are awesome, although it takes awhile to get to them. I didn't mind because the love story is better than normal, thanks to Kate Beckinsale, with that 1940s glamour look and dress. She never looked as pretty as this - just spectacular. Josh Harnett and Ben Affleck play likable-enough characters and the supporting cast is good. The film got panned because it didn't go into enough details about the war strategy but films that had done that in the past had wound up boring, so they made the right move here.THE BAD - This is almost too much believe, except I saw it for my own eyes. The idiots who wrote this movie - Liberal history revisionists, I presume - make the attacking Japanese almost look like the good guys! This is either political correctness gone amok or downright anti-American propaganda that should have USA viewers upset, to say the least. Excuse me, but all eyewitness accounts (and common sense) do NOT have the Japanese pilots happily waving at kids just before dropping bombs. That, and almost making it sound like poor Japan had no choice in what it was doing, is an incredible insult to American viewers and those who lost their lives in that unprovoked incident.OVERALL - The latter ruins making this glossy and interesting movie a "keeper."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no idea why there are some bad reviews with this movie, this movie is class act through and through, from the acting to the soundtracks, the aerial shooting and war scene's. I have continued watching this movie over and over, it may seem inaccurate in some scenes and the dialogue does seem to be verging on romance rather then the hoo-ah it push's to achieve, but in all context this is a very enjoyable and certainly an all round enjoyable movie. The acting on ben affleck and kate beckinsale was astounding, the choice in soundtracks were superb and all the prestige and pride this movie deliver's is awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes it is not historically accurate, but when are movies word-for-word correct? I agree that there were some terrible clichés in it, but it was not that bad. The movie was not supposed to be an accurate depiction of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, rather it was about the impact of it revolving around the stories of two American pilots and the nurses stationed in Pearl Harbor. What I think I loved best about it was the music and visual effects. Hans Zimmer delivers beautiful and compelling music throughout the movie at the right moments. The visual effects (being 2001) were accurate. The actors too were good for the parts. Maybe there were some cheesy parts but you'll get that almost anywhere. Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett had good chemistry being best buds along with Kate Beckinsale as their love interests.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am pretty sure everyone came to see an exact representation of Pearl Harbor. Well, people don't do it to well anymore. So what if some things are inaccurate like the weapons they used. War is still war. Pearl Harbor was still bombed, doesn't't matter what weapons they used. The Pearl Harbor scene was very, very well done. Everything else, some people might like it, some people might hate. It is a love story and even thought the characters are not real there is bound to be a woman whose boyfriend didn't come back after fighting the war. They showed an attack very well. I think people just have to calm down and stop looking for things to not like in a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>December 7, 1941, A Day That Will Live in Infamy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay's film Pearl Harbor is based on the true story of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941. It starts out in a field with two young boys playing in a father's crop dusting airplane. Little do we know that those two boys are going to be a big part of America's victory in WWII. Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) and Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) are Army Air Corp Pilots and best friends. Rafe goes to Britain to fight the Germans, leaving love behind. His plane gets shot down and he is presumed dead. As Danny comforts Rafe's girlfriend, Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), they draw closer to each other. When Rafe turns up alive, the two former friends become enemies. It is through the turmoil of the war that the two are able to reconcile their differences. This film was made to remind everyone of the disaster that America had to overcome that morning in December. It was made to remember all those men that fought and the women that nursed soldiers and civilians back to health. This movie is seemingly aimed more towards the audience that knows little about what actually happened in WWII. Pearl Harbor is not for the historians. It may not follow the events exactly as they happened, but overall it is a good film if we are just looking for some great special effects, fight scenes, a few laughs or a good cry. There were many mistakes in this movie. In some of the shots of Battleship Row, you could see the Arizona Memorial in the background. Also, at the end, the pilots flying Doolittle's Raid crash land in China after running out of fuel. They are shot at by Japanese patrols, and there was only a vague explanation of the Sino-Japanese war that was underway. Some viewers may be confused as to why there were Japanese patrols in China. Bruckheimer and Bay did not make a history film to be shown in classes or to be compared to historical events. They made a war film with a love story entwined. I feel that Pearl Harbor is a good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor displays a stupid love triangle between Rafe, Danny and Evelyn. The love story lasts almost an hour and a half into the movie before the war even begins. Overall, Pearl Harbor was a well done movie, minus the love story, with intense battle scenes. Not every scene in the movie was accurate but they did an amazing job of trying to recreate it. The graphics are outstanding, really no words to describe how good the graphics are.Pearl Harbor is the most expensive movie ever made and probably one of the hardest movies to film. I honestly don't know how they managed to film it. It's amazing. Also, the score is beautiful.I would give Pearl Harbor 10/10 stars but for adding the crappy love story, I give it an 8.This is the best war movie I've ever seen but for those who want to see a real war movie with no love added into it, I recommend you watch Saving Private Ryan instead.Less love and more action please!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Think World War II Just Started</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Bay's "Pearl Harbor" is terrific, explosive, exciting, and technically well-made. John Schwartzman's photography, and the film's effects, are outstanding; and, many of the supporting performances would have been exceptional, in a better story. Unfortunately, this film is far too long, and focuses on a the lamest possible retelling of the eternal "love triangle" during a war setting.The film's length is not justifiable. First of all, the Japanese segments are pointless; since there is no attempt to portray them accurately, or with substance, they should have remained in the shadows. Secondly, the underused supporting cast's stories are even not worthy of inclusion. For example, Cuba Gooding Jr. appears to receive a medal, due to his race, apparently. And, Jon Voight appears to do his Franklin D. Roosevelt impression. But, Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler appear as themselves. So, wasn't the real Roosevelt good enough?Ben Affleck (as Rafe McCawley), Josh Hartnett (as Danny Walker), and Kate Beckinsale (as Evelyn Johnson) make up the starring threesome; and, they are earnest and attractive, playing out the storyline like they were acting in an old movie. Still, there really isn't anything to this trio; compare them, for starters, with the extraordinary characterizations in the silent "Wings" (1927). Then, see "From Here to Eternity" (1953). Either of those film's stories would have been preferable to this non-smoking "Pearl Harbor". It's all so obviously contrived and predictable; and, with such good production values, a certain level of disappointment is assured.****** Pearl Harbor (5/21/01) Michael Bay ~ Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale, Cuba Gooding Jr.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Little Dry if You're Looking for Accuracy. Unbelievable if You are Just Looking for a Good Story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first came about watching this movie after seeing an episode on MTV of I Love the New Millennium in which they described it as 'having a lot of stuff blow up' and it being the 'death of Afleck's career.' I had some time to kill, so I dug out the old VHS that we had of Pearl Harbor and started playing it. I was surprised that it was a Michael Bay film at first, for I am a fan of his work and didn't think he was into historical events.The first half hour or so, I was appalled with the film work and bored with Afleck's relationship with Beckensale's character. Once his character of 'killed off' I started to actually get into the movie. I found that I was very emotionally drawn to the struggle of everyone in this film. The emphasis on color during the bombing scenes, and the artistic approach taken when filming the Arizona going down really touched me, as I have an uncle that is still entombed in the ill fated ship.Once I got to the end, with the scenes in the rice paddies, I was ready for something to happen. The whole movie had been leading up to this point and I thought sure one of the boys was going down. Sure enough, one did, and I found myself crying, actually crying for the rest of the movie.Historical accuracies and made up characters aside, a lot of us nowadays know a little about what happened at Pearl Harbor to know how devastating an event it was. This movie, if you let it, brings to life a little bit of what it was like, and continues to be like in some places, for soldiers around the world. In my opinion, it's a wonderful movie that gave me a new perspective on war with the added bonus of my favorite kind of film, a love story.</fullReview>

This movie gets me every time; I'm not a person who cries at movies and this one makes me wail. The whole love triangle thing with Danny-Evelyn-Rafe is so tragic. I like the way they solved it but it still tore my heart out that Rafe a) watched his best friend die and b) is raising his best friend's child from his wife's womb.In addition to being a amazing(and tragic) love-story, it has realistically depicted war scenes. People say that it was too graphic; war is hell.</fullReview>

The Battle Of The Bulge with Henry Fonda is one of the most historically inaccurate War films ever made but I still enjoy watching it. Don't be scared away from checking out this film because of the unfair reviews seen here. Give it a shot. The acting is decent, it has enough stars to maintain interest and the action sequences are very good. Perhaps a bit video game-like at times but very much worth watching.

		<shortDescription>The biggest blockbuster of the season weighs in as the summer movie season begins.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By Dean KishThe biggest blockbuster of the season weighs in as the summer movie season officially begins. Like the $139 million dollar juggernaut that it is, Pearl Harbor roars across the screen as Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett star as best friend aviators. Rafe (Affleck) has to leave his best friend behind when he joins the highly-respected `Eagle Squadron' out of Britain. The Eagles battle the Nazis as America still refuses to enter World War II. Rafe's beloved Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) is a nurse and is just getting to know her fly-boy when he takes the assignment in Britain. Rafe asks Danny to look after Evelyn if anything should happen to him overseas. Danny is a man of his word. Tragedy brings down one of the three and the pain it causes brings their lives face to face with the horror that is the Japanese sneak attack of Pearl Harbor. That lone event changed the face of the world and America forever. Who will live? Who will die? And strategically, how will America overcome this disaster? There are so many ways to look at this film, that it's hard to narrow it down into one review. I basically see the film as three smaller films brought together as a huge 3-plus hour blockbuster juggernaut. The first film focuses on the love story of the three leads. The second is the actual events that transpire before and during the attack of Pearl Harbor and the third is the aftermath. Each of these sections of this huge film could have been its own actual film. Director Michael Bay really challenges himself a lot in the first hour of this film. The love story, subtle lighting and humor are really like nothing he has accomplished before. These scenes were great in that they show Bay is evolving as a director. I did find however find that the actual `love-story' plot was quite contrived and was an almost typical wartime drama scenario. Bay's CGI effects and rip-roaring attacks, throughout the second hour are amazing and very intense. These scenes are a marvel to witness. But the film seems to drag quite a bit as the attack dies down. The whole third hour seems like a sequel. Why didn't screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) find a way to conclude the lead characters' story in the events of Pearl Harbor? Wallace's script had too much meat and did tend to flip-flop to a lot of different people not around Pearl Harbor. The script should have summed up the love-story in the first 20 minutes, trimmed down some of the flip-flops and narrowed the focus of the film to the actual events of Pearl Harbor. If this would have occurred the film wouldn't have been so long.The lead actors are dashing, daring, beautiful and wonderful to watch. Affleck is good as the steel-hearted hero who faces a moral dilemma. Harnett is believable as the guy who falls for his best friend's girl. But of the three, Beckinsale seemed to release the most range as she seemed to be the one tortured the most. I really liked her during the hospital sequences when the siege was happening. These blurred moments reflect the stress both within Beckinsale and in the events occurring. I really liked this technique. My overall favorite performance wasn't even by one of the main leads. Jon Voight's performance as Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Voight's grasping of the classic historical figure was incredible and it's amazing how he even resembles America's greatest president. I loved this performance and I do hope there is an Oscar nod here. Pearl Harbor's historical lay-out and formula kind of reminded me of was how the mini-series `The Winds of War' was a set-up for `War &amp; Remembrance' except they were two long and massive mini-series. Pearl Harbor may have included too much stuff in its story. The whole first hour could have been vastly trimmed to bring the actual event closer to the front of the film. `The Winds of War' and its sequel were the most ambitious complete World War II dramas ever conceived. Pearl Harbor may have been too ambitious. This American interpretation of the Japanese invasion is very respectful to the Japanese and doesn't show them as tyrants. I liked that the Japanese were perceived as doing a strategic thing and that they knew that they were awakening a sleeping giant. I am not sure if this is actually the correct portrayal of Japan during this time period but it definitely won't harm anybody today. Pearl Harbor is the kind of film that is meaty enough to spend those inflated theatre ticket prices on. It has something for everyone. (4 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.</fullReview>

This movie is mostly a love story with a historical background. So if you don't like love stories don't watch this movie. But, this is a beautiful story and at times a tear-jerker. And if you people are like "Well, why watch this movie its terribly inaccurate?", then what movie do you actually like? Most movies whether based on books or facts is going to be different from the actual thing. All movies are based on the director's take on the story, sorry to tell you.

		<fullReview>Recap: Two kids grew up as best friends with a fascination for flying. They both become army fliers during the WW II and end up at Pearl Harbor the fateful day the Japanese strikes. They also end up in triangle drama when both become involved with the same woman, a navy nurse.Comments: A long movie, but a little to my surprise, not too long. It has no problem to fill out the entire 160 minutes it runs, which many other movies finds it hard to do. One reason this does is that it has a few distinctive phases, or acts. There is pre Pearl Harbor, the attack and then post Pearl Harbor. Each with it's own story, almost like small movies or episodes within the movie. Because of that, no story runs too long, or gets old.But honestly, the story is mostly secondary to the real experience. The epically beautiful visual part of the movie. If a depiction of a brutally violent and fatal event ever can be described as beautiful, I think this is it. Two details I was most impressed with was the bomb-perspective, were we got to ride piggyback on the bombs falling. And the vortexes behind the fighters as they fly through the smoke. Attention to details are appreciated.This was a positive surprise for me. I had expected nice visual shots, and was not disappointed. But I had feared a much weaker and duller story. But together with the action shots it never felt long. Good entertainment, whatever others say.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to be historical accurate then watch a documentary or read a book. I have to say that I loved this film, despite knowing that it's not entirely accurate and is centred round a love-triangle. Yes, it could have been better and it didn't need the love story, but give the film a break! It was well-made with superb special effects. I think one of the reasons people vote this film down is because they went to watch it expecting it to be bad and predictable, in other words, a remake of Titanic - typical romance involving a girl that two guys want. And I'm not dissing Titanic here either - I loved that film even more so than Pearl Harbor. I'm almost certain that if this film had been released as the first of its kind - modern epic of tragic historic event with love triangle and very attractive actors - it would have made just as much as Titanic did. What went wrong with Pearl Harbor was the way it was hyped about - most expensive movie ever made, etc etc. People thought 'oh yeah, been there done that' because they'd seen Titanic. And it did bear many similarities to Titanic but that does NOT make it a bad film. And I wish people would lay off the Americans. OK, so it's the biggest, richest and best (in my opinion) country in the world - so what? Any other country would act the same if it was them. I hasten to add here that I'm English and live in England, just to clarify that I'm not American and therefore not biased. Maybe some of the dialogue was cheesy but that was the DIALOGUE, not the pro-Americanism. Surely anyone - in any country - is going to act patriotic in the middle of being attacked by another country! It's a natural reaction. You can hardly imagine the characters standing there saying 'well, let's give them the benefit of the doubt - there's a reason for this' can you?! Maybe there is a reason but when you're in the middle of something like that surrounded by death and destruction, your instinct is to protect people and defend your country. So lay off the Americans everyone! The place rules - get used to it! In my opinion, Pearl Harbor was a cinematic masterpiece with a very touching love story. The people who went in there expecting it to be rubbish came out thinking it was rubbish, not wanting to admit their expectations had been wrong.10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mesmerizing movie from beginning to ...near-end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not your strong nationalist type, yet I enjoyed Pearl Harbor tremendously. One of the reasons virtually anyone could endure a watch or two of Pearl Harbor is for its incredible cast. Cuba Gooding Jr., as a patriotic cooker, Jon Voight as the unforgiving President with guts, Dan Aykroyd as the intuitive and barely able to get himself heard of subordinate, the list goes on forever.Secondly, CGI-based special effects in P. H. were used for the better. That is to say, if you tend to agree with other reviewers about the script sounding dull at times, I could nearly allow myself to suggest renting this movie solely for those amazing scenes bearing special effects. The hovering over the fleet scenes and the subsequent bombing are remarkably rendered, blended with black &amp; white presumably historical footage transitions.The photography, the nurses and soldiers uniforms, the make-up, the settings and the soundtrack of Pearl Harbor are nothing short of extraordinary to those eyes and ears. Kate Beckinsale looks gorgeous and most of all sincere all throughout the movie, thus one can't help but feel bad for her when she swears she was not intentionally doing harm to Rafe while he was away. Another movie in which one may find echoes of Rafe / Dany somehow confrontational friendship is Gattaca.Of course, you get your moment or two of bravado, especially when some of the pilots attempt to climb into their planes after the zero's attacks over the bay is acknowledged. Such is the case when Tom Sizemore runs for cover, grabs his gun shouting "I need more ammos, ladies!" but that should not distract viewers excessively.Concerning the ending of the movie, the predictable nasty counter-attack in the "an eye for an eye" tradition, I feel it could have been cut off or shortened. We know for a fact that Americans would have their revenge on the japs after that massive blow, anyway! **Review hopefully slightly improved over the previous one, or let's say rephrased**</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I liked it. The general idea is nice. A story about one of the most tragic episodes of the US history, depicting national heroes that did their best to save the country. We can see Americans as a strongly united nation, true patriots of their country. Although some historical inaccuracy takes place, the battles, events and emotions the heroes came through look really impressive.The movie also touches upon some other eternal themes like friendship and love. Do you think it has never happened for real? I think it has. Every soldier had to leave something dear to him - family, girlfriend, friend whatever. The war brought a great loss to most people who took part in it and that is a suitable scene for such a film.The actors and Michael Bay did a great job. It looks naturally and impressive. And it keeps your attention till the end. While watching I didn't want to switch off. And I doubt whether anyone did. So it's worth watching.</fullReview>

The attack is about 45 minutes and after the attack they bomb Tokyo in planes and that is brilliant to watch. It really makes you feel like you are in the attack. It is like going back in time and being in the attack and the planes bombing Tokyo. Before the attack it is a love story about two best friends loving the same woman. It also shows the Japanese planing the attack. It very realistic and if your like war films like me you will love pearl harbor. If you like world war two like me you will love pearl harbor, if you like love story films (unlike me)you will love pearl harbor too. It is amazing.</fullReview>

The military nurses that did die were navy nurses, not civilian. I was especially touched by Jon Voight's performance as FDR. When I saw him in the first scene I was "oh no you're not." But as the movie went on I was totally pulled in as it was obvious that he had carefully studied for the part. The love story was a bit over the top, but the impact of what happened and the aftermath of the event was well portrayed for those who were not around in those days. No picture depicts history exactly. If it did we wouldn't want to watch it. This film caught the essence of it however. If you weren't moved by it then you have a heart of stone.</fullReview>

Don't miss out on a great movie because of the secondary story of the love affair. If all possible see this movie on a large widescreen TV with surround sound. The DVD has DTS sound. I swore bullets were flying by me. They filmed this at Pearl! right at the spots where this whole thing took place. They took bits of the stories from the men and women that were there and put them into the film. For the little bit of historical fact that was not right, like Dan Akaroyed's part in the film; it is overshadowed by the real stories and information that was put in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing spectacle, but what happened to the script?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As we all know, the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941 was a major event in history, so why not do a film version? I do applaud a film that takes on a very ambitious project, and this film is indeed that. However, I was hugely disappointed in this film, it had huge potential but it doesn't work.Well there are some good things. Visually and technically the film looks phenomenal, the attention to detail is wonderful. The sets are realistic looking, the costumes are fine and the cinematography is stunning. The music by Hans Zimmer is pretty darn good as well, it really gives power to the climatic scenes. The action and special effects are very well done, the actual attack which forms the film's middle act is utterly riveting.Sadly, everything else doesn't work. Shame really that one truly brilliant scene, a great score and wonderful visuals are literally gone to waste by a bloated plot, cardboard characterisations, questionable historical accuracy and an awful script.Pearl Harbor is very long at 3 hours. Don't get me wrong I have absolutely no problem with long lengths, what was the real problem was the pace. It was so slow, that the slower scenes were close to tedious and there were parts at the beginning where I was finding it hard to keep awake. The plot is also very bloated, a lot is crammed in including a love story and old-fashioned heroics, but for a long film I was expecting a lot of attention to plot. But Michael Bay seemed to be concentrating a lot on the visual aspect of the film and seemed to have forgotten about the story. Consequently these details were underdeveloped, and the film is full to the brim with historical inaccuracies. The actors are undeniably talented, but they are given very little to work with. I had real difficulty empathising with any of the characters here, for me they seemed rather cardboard and clichéd. Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale both give lifeless performances and their chemistry is non-existent. Jon Voight is wasted yet again as Roosevelt, somehow he felt more like Dr Strangelove, and out of the cameos Dan Aykroyd especially is completely out of place. Bay's direction is also uneven, there are parts like in the attack itself where it is great but others where it is sloppy. But the worst asset was the script. It was AWFUL! It gave the actors very little to work with, and some of the dialogue instead of moving turned out to be unintentionally cheesy.All in all, this film was disappointing. There are some good moments, but a vast majority of it doesn't work. 4/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one that gets better and better on repeated viewings. For those who had a bad reaction to the movie when it first opened, they owe it to themselves to watch it again. Too much of the negative press had to do with Ben Affleck's negative nitwit hyper publicity at the beginning of the decade when this movie was released. That obstacle is now mercifully in the past, and the movie can now be objectively judged on its own merits, and they are many. The wrap-around love story works incredibly well to frame the actual attack and personalize it. Also, the movie espouses strong American values and virtues, showing us Americans at their best. Cinematically, this movie couldn't be stronger. It is visually stunning and audacious--a triumph of the movie makers' arts. It saddens me that such a great movie has been given such negative press. The negativity, I think, stems from something not related to the true quality of the movie. Watch Pearl Harbor again--it's great!</fullReview>

Go there, see the REAL thing, go to the museums, take the boat ride out to the USS Arizona Memorial walk above the ship, smell and look at the oil that still leaks from the boat, talk to the guides who lived through it and then watch this movie.Anybody who has the ability to criticize Hollywood for making this film and being as accurate as possible all while still making it entertaining has NO heart. There are more Japanese people at the REAL Pearl Harbor paying their respects than you can ever imagine.Sadly there are more Americans on this board who've blasted this movie and ridiculed it....those Japanese people have more heart, soul and respect than the cowardly people on this site who criticize a movie that changed American history and in the process crap on the graves of all the men who died at Pearl Harbor!!If standing over the USS Arizona and looking down at the ship and knowing the bodies of many of the 1100+ men that died on that ship that 7th day of December 1941 doesn't make your hairs stand on end and your heart skip a beat, you aren't an American nor a human with a soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PEARL HARBOR (2001) Rating: 7/10Pearl Harbor is a movie you just couldn't avoid. I must have seen the trailer fifty times; fortunately, it's one of the best crafted ones I've ever seen, so it never bored me. What came out of these few minutes I've seen over and over is the very dramatic speech made by President Roosevelt (played by Jon Voight), Hans Zimmer's powerful score and plenty of the kind of striking visuals director Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer have used us too. What was less obvious, but which was widely known if you visit movie websites, is that the movie's entry point into this historical events is a love story, just like in Titanic (9/10). Well, try as he might, Bay will never be James Cameron, but for all of its shortcomings, Pearl Harbor remains as satisfying as summer blockbusters get. This one won't win any Oscars (besides some well deserved sound, editing or special effects awards).The screenplay was written by Randall Wallace, best known for writing Braveheart. Like that film, Pearl Harbor holds many contradictions. It's both idealistic and ruthless, based on real events but very free in its interpretation, and it strives to please both regular moviegoers and critics. Plus, depending on one's perception, both movies will seem either manipulative or just effective filmmaking. I fall in the latter category. Sure, some twists are forced (I didn't buy the way the love triangle was set up nor how it was resolved), but for the most part, the movie worked me like a puppet. I laughed, I cried (surprisingly a little too much), I shuddered, I was thrilled... The works, basically.Pearl Harbor goes on for three hours, but it didn't feel long to me. I enjoyed Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett quite a bit, Kate Beckinsale much more. The romance part of the movie was cute, nothing more. I thought the romance between Kate and Ben had more chemistry then the one between Kate and Josh.The film's first hour is surprisingly engrossing. Then comes the movie's big set piece, the half hour long Japanese air raid on Pearl Harbor. Well, you've seen the trailer, but still: whoa! You gotta give it to Michael Bay, he shoots some badass destruction! Countless "Zero planes" filling the skies, bombing ships and bases, men running for their lives or being blown to pieces, more explosions, mucho shooting... All executed with a true sense of action, unlike some of Bay's other movies. In Armageddon or The Rock, I sometimes felt that everything was edited too hysterically, but here the rhythm felt right. Bay doesn't keep cutting back and forth, instead he holds long, impressive shots. Some might complain that while watching a re-enactment of "a date which will live in infamy", the audience shouldn't be going "oh man! how did they do that?" but being shocked by the horror of war. It's a good point, but I think you can have it both ways. I cringed every time men and women were shot down or blown up, but I still appreciated Bay's visual skills.If this were my movie, I would have ended it soon after the big attack. It's like, how can you top that, why not leave on a high note? The last act of the movie isn't all that bad, but it's just kind of underwhelming to go from such a powerful sequence to what mostly adds up to a Top Gun retread. And I don't even like Top Gun! I always found aerial dogfights quite boring. They can be exciting for a little while, but then it's just planes flying here and there and close-up shots of the pilots' masked faces. Yawn. I'll give it to Alec Baldwin, who plays an important part in the film's climax as the colonel leading the American counterattack on Tokyo, he makes his shlocky dialogue sound good and gives the subsequent mission scene some momentum. Voight is also pretty good as the President, despite the ridiculous scene in which he gets up from his wheelchair. Other supporting characters include Tom Sizemore as an officer who does little more than shoot at planes, Cuba Gooding Jr. who shoots at planes, boxes and kisses up to whitey (someone alert Spike Lee!) and, of all people, Dan Aykroyd as a code breaker. Love Dan Aykroyd, didn't buy him here.I've been reading through some other reviews for some time, and like most of the people at this site, pan the film. Bad dialogue, corny romance, self-gratifying action scenes, iffy historical accuracy... All that might be true, but I believe that within the right mindset, the movie manages to be a success. It's not Saving Private Ryan, but I'm glad it isn't. Pearl Harbor is an old fashioned stab at melodramatic romance and World War II heroics. It's not the Learning Channel, it's a variation on real events as they would happen in Bruckheimer's world, with pretty nurses in fashionable bikinis making out on the beach and hunky pilots flying through golden skies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is one of the most spectacular movies I have ever seen. It is simply brilliant! And I can't believe the critics said it had a weak love story. It was such a good, refreshing love story - entirely original with strongly developed characters! In fact I was surprised at how well developed the characters were. I thought that it would basically just be an action movie, but was I pleasantly surprised. The movie totally gripped me emotionally AND visually. It's simply out of this world. It was funny, it was sad, it was exciting, it was tragic! This movie has everything! Pearl Harbor deeply moved me. Ben Affleck was awesome, Kate was endearing, and Josh - well, what can we say about him? He is simply stunning - WOW! I really wish him well in his future - his future in a movie career looks really bright. The attack scene was excellent. I've never seen anything like it in any movie. It really made you feel as if you were a part of it - as if you were right there! Good work, everyone! What else can I say, except that I simply LOVED the movie. It's BRILLIANT!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, this is a superb movie. The plot is extremely moving as well as neatly put together. I suppose it could have been better if the director had chosen to end the movie at Pearl Harbor, the actual attack scene. Then again, maybe not. The ending was very tragic, which always makes a movie better. I HATE happy endings. The acting was great on all parts and dialog could have been improved in certain areas, but truthfully it was pretty good. What really needed work here is the cinematography. A couple scenes, such as the actual bombing scene and the one just before the bombing had excellent cinematography. Other than that, the camera angles were terrible. In up close fight scenes and dialogs the camera switched too fast and was not held steady. However, notice i still gave this movie an 8 out of 10, which means it has to be a pretty darn good movie to still be memorable enough, and have bad cinematography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is a very interesting movie. Now their are two sides to my opinion of this movie. The historian in me knows this movie is horrible in showing everything that occurred. But i love the atmosphere of this movie. Jerry Bruckheimer's movies always look good. I also am a sucker for war romances ( I love the Winds of War). If you don't like romance in war movies i would steer clear of this film. Although i would watch anything Kate Beckinsale is in because she is gorgeous. I did have a problem with some of the casting. Ben Afleck works in the movie but i hate Josh Hartnet in this movie. He's just kind of there, he doesn't do much. His relationship with Rafe is not fully shown so it kind of diminishes the whole story. All in all this is a pretty average war film, the highlight is the special effects an beautiful scenery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget history, forget reality, in this very expensive and good looking Hollywood popcorn action movie. Served with a standard love story as the focus, and copious amounts of artistic license, this is heros save America stuff, again, obviously aimed at the broadest possible Hollywood audience. It was also fun.For me the best parts of the movie were the scenes with Jon Voigt as President Roosevelt, in particular his speeches - I thought they were well done. Ultimately, a wasted opportunity to portray a tragic and important story in America's history. If you want to see a serious film about Pearl harbor, then I recommend Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was stunned to read all of these posts about how bad this movie was. I have seen it several times and i have enjoyed it each and every time. The fact is that of course, some of the stuff in it was historically incorrect, but isn't that the same for most movies? I think a lot of you are missing a lot of good about this movie.For starters, this movie tells a great love story between a friendly nurse and two guys who are practically brothers. Bay does a great job showing how close these two were, showing their childhood together and even showing at the end Ben Afleck naming the son after Danny. This movie also has amazing special effects, and it does a good job portraying president Roosevelt. Sure, you can say some of it was corny, but i thought it told a great story on two friends, both in love with the same girl, during one of the toughest times in American history. More than anything, this movie shows how our country came together during such a hard tragedy and with that being said, i do not know how you can give it such bad reviews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refuting the claims of inaccuracies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie 6 out of 10 stars for the action but when I read the reviews about being historically inaccurate I got mad.This movie did have its bad points like the bombing of the hospital and the way the cockpit scenes showed the joystick up around the pilots chin and the way they slid all over the place when the plane turned.But to address the claims of being historically Inaccurate all I can say is do some research.Yes the love triangle was totally fiction but there was a lot of fact as well.There really was an RAF Eagles squadron that took in volunteer American airman as did the French air core of WW1. It was run by the RAF and was made up of all American pilots. When the US joined the war they reverted to the US Army Air core.As to the mention of the Flying Tigers being in England under US control made by another reviewer of this movie. They Were in China and a civilian air core up until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. When the US joined the war they reverted to the US Army Air core.As for Cuba Gooding Jr. playing a token black in this movie, LOOK IT UP he was portraying a very important person in history. Doris Miller was the first African American to receive the Navy Cross for Distinguished Service.It really bugs me when someone tells you something is inaccurate but then the "facts" they give are even more inaccurate. Look things up before you start throwing stones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i would like to point out that more than 50% of the comments on this film came from men? What about the notebook, you probably hate that one too, right? We all know that PEARL HARBOR is more than just some "war movie" but looking at the previews or even the cover of the movie, you could tell it was going to be a girly type movie with a love story, so don't blame your stupidity for watching it on the movie, because i'm sure almost every girl who loves stories such as this one LOVES this movie. It's not at all a rip off of the TITANIC. the titanic is about a boat that sinks? how, in ANY way, is that related to Pearl Harbor?. You are so pathetic for wasting your time talking negative things about a movie, in which half aren't true. Guys, we don't need your input. Just because you don't like sappy love stories doesn't mean that the movie isn't brilliant, because i think it is one of the most brilliantly made love stories of all time. i'll even say it's so much easier to relate to than Titanic or The Notebook.. Pearl Harbor is definitely a classic. Besides, who said a movie had to be accurate? Then what's the fun of watching it, huh? stupid guys. Go back to watching your stupid made up drug stories and car movies. i'm sure you like that bullshit much better right? This movie is beautiful. and there was love during the war, sorry you want to spend your time thinking about the people dying. Think of all the women that lost their men, this movie brings that out. And us women like to watch that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The epic of this year! MUST SEE MOVIE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor must be some of the epic movies that has hit the big screen in the last five years. Beautifully portrayed characters with realistic emotions of war time. When I first saw it, it was breathtaking. I had friends that said part of it was predictable where one of the main characters "dies" in Europe. What I see on that part of the movie was a common scenario during the war when you thought someone was dead but they actually weren't. It was used well and people that didn't like that concept need to realise that that was a reality of war. Anyway, the computer graphics effects are incredible. One of the most amazing parts of the movie is the Japanese pilot (which the movie orientates a bit around) is aiming his bomb site over the USS Arizona. He hits the switch and we watch in awe as the bomb falls out of the plane and the camera follows it all the way down towards the ship. It was deffinitely the most stunning 3D effects I have seen in a movie. In the huge 3 hours of playtime, Pearl Harbor manages to take the viewer back into 1941 and the storyline is very real and gripping. Michael Bay (Director) has shown true directing skills all round in all aspects of this film. This film had little bits that were a tad boring, but most films have a bit of that. Rafe McCaulley (Affleck) is a master fighter pilot with his best friend Danny Walker (Hartnett) who is also. Certain situations cause them both to fall in love with a courageous army nurse Evelyn Johnson (Beckinsale).Other characters that I personally thought where played well was Jimmy Dolittle (Alec Baldwin), President Roosevelt (Jon Voight) and Earl (Tom Sizemore). I give Pearl Harbor 10/10 for its action packed, drama filled, epic movie of this year, maybe even decade!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pearl Harbor is one of the best movies in Michael Bay's career. My wife and me enjoyed every minute.Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale, Alec Baldwin and also Jon Voight as the US President Eisenhower delivered all an Oscar worthy performance.Then the picture is beautiful and the soundtrack took me really back in that historical time.The air combats were well executed and the Japanese attacks with their bomb explosions looked all very real.The story is so good mixed with adventure, romantic scenes and sentimental dialogs that at the end I had even tears in my eyes as in the must see TITANIC with Leonardo Di Caprio. Don't miss it if you like films with high emotional feelings. I mean it has very deep psychological elements that I was involved in each scene crying oh no and so on if you know what I mean.Normally my comments don't get such high votes but this one merits a solid 10/10. I cannot understand why this great work is so underrated.It is no doubt another DVD for my best of collection.Last but not least I want to express my great respect to all the victims that lost their lives in the battle of Pearl Harbor.

		<fullReview>In 1940 as Hitler and his Nazis invade Europe, America refuses to join in the battle. Two military pilots named Danny (Josh Harnett) and Rafe (Ben Affeleck) have been good friends since they were kids fall for a sexy nurse named Eveylen (Kate Beckinsale) for Rafe seems to get the girl until he is called for duty in Europe, a month later after Rafe is assumed dead it's now Danny who falls for Evelyn. It seems he isn't dead at all but alive and a love triangle starts for now the Japanese have a plan to attack on Sunday December 7th 1941.Co-starring Jon Voight as President Rooservelt, Alec Baldwin as Captain Doolittle, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Doris "Dorie" Miller, Mko as Admiral Yamamato, William Lee Scott as Billy and Dan Ackroyd as Captain Thurman this is an outstanding and underrated WWII action-drama from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, Braveheart writer Randall Wallace and director Michael Bay. It's been criticized as a cliché mushy love story disguised as a war movie but it's not true, i believe it has the right ingredients of a successful blockbuster from all three filmmakers and really depicts WWII in a glorious fictional kind of manner. Who cares about accuracy and all that? i think he does a small bit of historical accuracy even on some casting like Cuba Gooding Jr. who made a damn good role of playing the first black American soldier to get the cross-medal and i love Hans Zimmer's brilliant score. The action sequences are well executed by one of the biggest Hollywood action maestros Bay and it's a very well made movie that is a must see for everyone as i loved it since i saw it in theaters before my graduation for it's a sad, sometimes uplifting and dark War drama that even has a bit of humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film should contain a health warning!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few films I've come across which actually make you want to beat yourself senseless with a heavy object. But this is surely one of them. Quite possibly one of the worst films ever made and I can't believe I managed to watch it through to the end! Twice. Once in the cinema and once on TV!First off let me say that I can understand the need to make a compromise between historical accuracy and the telling of a 'good story'. That assumes of course that you have a good story to tell, rather than this banal boiling-pot of the oldest clichés in the book.The heights of implausibility which this film manages to attain are just jaw-dropping. Saving Private Ryan managed to interweave an implausible story with historical events while maintaining a semblance of believability. Pearl Harbor just had me swearing obscenities at the screen in frustration! I can forgive the use of late-model Spitfires in the 'Battle of Britain' sequences. What is less forgivable is the portrayal of the Battle of Britain at all given that it took place in 1940 and not 1941 as depicted here! And it is never quite explained how Ben Afleck manages to get himself released from his duties with the RAF and return to Hawaii - I guess he decided he'd had enough and so handed back his plane and uniform! Isn't that desertion in most people's book? Some of the special effects during the attack on Pearl Harbor are, admittedly, not bad - despite the appearance of what appear to be quite modern warships in some shots! But the makers seem to think that the more special effects they can get into a single frame of film then the more realistic/impressive it will be! Unfortunately it just ends up looking like an intro-sequence for a Medal of Honor type game. Less is definitely more sometimes! Talking about effects - what was that all about with the sequences in the hospital during the battle? Did they get a dud batch of film stock that had been exposed to sunlight or something? It's all very well trying to be smart with film effects but sometimes you can end up looking like complete amateurs - which I'm afraid they do here.As for our intrepid heroes suddenly becoming experienced B-25 pilots - oh pur-lease!! At this point I had my head in my hands and was sobbing uncontrollably. The boys even manage to get involved in hand-to-hand combat, wiping out an entire Japanese platoon in the process. Presumably this was to show that our heroes were capable of going toe-to-toe with the enemy as well as just dropping bombs on them? Who on earth was this film aimed at? I'm sure the majority of filmgoers are not complete imbeciles but this is exactly who the target audience seems to be. It could be viewed simply as a romantic adventure yarn (although the romantic element is dire) but it seems to want to portray itself as much more than that, which is it's biggest weakness. If you want to be a heavy-weight historical drama then you just cannot mix in the sort of love-triangle claptrap and implausible plot lines that are in this.Dreadful. Watch it and cringe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even before this movie's release it was hard to hide from. The trailers only hint at the visual spectacle it is. Expertly directed by Michael Bay and written by Randall Wallace, this truly qualifies for epic status with its nearly three and a half hours running time. Outstanding visual effects; the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor is ruthless, relentless and totally chaotic. Hans Zimmer's musical score is grand as it is haunting.The story is a reenactment of one of the most tragic days in America's history, but a lot of the facts are very loosely interpreted. Albeit few can walk away from this movie with total disappointment or a dry eye. Two childhood friends(Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett)learn to fly and go off to join the war and end up falling in love with the same Navy nurse(Kate Beckinsale). The three lead characters are out acted by the brilliant performance of John Voight as President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Alec Baldwin succeeds in making Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle look smug and arrogant. In smaller roles, but notable work in support comes from Cuba Gooding Jr., James King, Mako and Tom Sizemore. Kudos to producer Jerry Bruckheimer for a project well done. Romance, drama, and dynamic war action...PEARL is interesting and enjoyable; a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with the critics that Razzie nominated producer/director Michael Bay (Bad Boys, The Rock, Transformers) and producer Jerry Bruckheimer were great choices and could have made a great film out of a big event in history. Basically it follows friends Capt. Rafe McCawley (Razzie nominated Ben Affleck) and Capt. Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) becoming pilots in the army during World War II, and both meeting Nurse Lt. Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale). Rafe and Evelyn hook up quite quickly, before he is transfered to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. The surprise military strike by the Japanese bombing the Harbor was one of the biggest attacks in the history of WWII, with over three thousand men killed. Anyway, Evelyn and Danny hooked up when they thought Rafe was dead, so of course when he returns he is very upset, but they do have to continue fighting in a counter attack. Also starring Cuba Gooding Jr. as Petty Officer Doris 'Dorrie' Miller, Tom Sizemore as Sgt. Earl Sistern, Jon Voight as President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Colm Feore as Adm. Husband E. Kimmel, Mako as Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto, Alec Baldwin as Lt. Col. James Doolittle, William Lee Scott as Lt. Billy Thompson, Michael Shannon as Lt. Gooz Wood, Scott Wilson as Gen. George C. Marshall, Peter Firth as Capt. Mervyn Bennion - USS West Virginia, Greg Zola as Lt. Anthony Fusco, Ewen Bremner as Lt. Red Winkle, Jaime King as Nurse Betty Bayer, Jennifer Garner as Nurse Sandra, Dan Aykroyd as Capt. Thurman, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Cmdr. Minoru Genda and Prison Break's William Fichtner as Danny's Father. The film should have just been about the attack, and focused on just the bombing and fighting. If it wasn't for the ridiculous attempt at a romantic story almost dominating the film this would have been great, the key scene of the film and all the battle sequences are good, but at almost three hours long it isn't one you'd see more than once. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated for Best Visual Effects, Best Song for "There You'll Be" (also nominated the Golden Globe) and Best Sound, it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Hans Zimmer, and it was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Remake or Sequel, Worst Screen Couple for Affleck with either Beckinsale or Hartnett and Worst Screenplay. Adequate!</fullReview>
