		<fullReview>I saw this movie and absolutely ADORED it! however, i do speak french fluently, which might explain why, because the humor is typically french, and having lived amongst french and American people, i know that most English-speaking people will seriously not find this movie funny, be it in french or English. furthermore, these are the type of jokes that are only funny in the original language, which REALLY explains why people who saw it in English find it stupid. so chances are that if you didn't like it, either you didn't understand the humor, or you have a stick up your *** and are too cool for downright stupid comedy, because this movie is SERIOUSLY HILARIOUS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyably stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RRRrrrr!!! is a French caveman comedy set in the 'Stan Age' (everyone is called Stan - at least in the English subtitles - because they haven't got round to inventing any new names yet) that is either stupidly enjoyable or enjoyably stupid (or just plain stupid) depending on your mood. There's not much in the way of plot, revolving around a 600 year fight between the Clean Hairs and the Dirty Hairs over the secret of shampoo that gets sidelined when the world's first murder is committed, but that's just an excuse for a series of spot gags along the lines of a Tex Avery or Looney Tunes cartoon.As usual with French comedy there's a tendency to find cold-blooded murder extremely amusing (some French comedies end in massacres that even Peckinpah might think was over the top) that doesn't always translate, but there are more than enough good gags, both visual and verbal, to compensate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seemingly stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film on cable last night, I was bored and looking for something to kill the time, but what a seemingly stupid film turned out to be a pretty interesting work which reminded me of our own lives (or probably just that I'm presuming too much). The plot itself is pretty dumb, a 800 year war on shampoo and the history's first murder case. The dirty clan's plots to seize shampoo are downright moronic, but look at ourselves seriously, aren't there many things we do also equally stupid and useless? And about the stupid war, ah, the stupid war...I don't speak french so I don't know how's the quality of the sub, but it did make me laugh, the film itself is funny, the actors, the music, the colours, it's just unreal and that's what makes it funny. The scene in which the camouflaged boss dreamed about the modern world is unbelievably superb. He was stoned, and of course he should be, and looked around with terror while the salesman rattled on without any change of expression like the presence of the strange man dressed in leaves surprised him not (or at least not showing it). The boss then had a recurring nightmare, or a trauma, something that might be subtle, but within all of us.What's so great about this movie is that it parodies many aspect of our lives with seemingly stupid and childish approaches so successfully that I can't help laughing, at ourselves!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the most enjoyable movies I have come across. All of the jokes are completely ridiculous, so you can just stop thinking and laugh. After the introduction to the movie, I couldn't stop laughing for over half a minute. Now, if you are the type of person who exclusively likes movies which make you think (some of which are good), you will HATE this movie. If you just want to sit back and laugh at the incredible stupidity of all of the characters, this is the movie to do it with.I watched the movie with subtitles, but having knowledge of French couldn't hurt. From the little French I know, I managed to pick up a few of the jokes missed in translation and laughed at some of the translations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 35,000 BC, the tribe of the Dirty Hairs is in war against the tribe of the Clean Hairs for eight hundred years, trying to get their shampoo. The chief of the Dirty Hairs (Gérard Depardieu) sends his daughter Guy (Marina Fois) disguised to the enemy tribe to get some shampoo for his tribe. When the healer of the Clean Hairs tribe (Alain Chabat) surprisingly kills two cavemen of his tribe, their imbecile chief (Maurice Barthélémy) assigns Pierre with curled hair (Pef Martin Laval) and Pierre blonde (Jean-Paul Rouve) to investigate the murder and find the criminal."RRRrrrr!!!" is a non-sense and silly, but also very hilarious French movie. I liked a lot this original comedy, which is forgettable, but reaches the target, giving 94 minutes of entertainment and laughs. Fortunately I did not pay attention of the underrated IMDb Rating of 4.8 and I decided to buy this worthwhile DVD. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "RRRrrrr!!! Na Idade da Pedra" ("RRRrrrr!!! In the Stone Age")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was one of the best French comedies I have ever seen. Alain Chabat is one of my favourite directors, French or English. Although it may be funny to an English speaker watching it with subtitles, I think that to be able to understand every bit of this movie, puns and all, you have to be fluent in French. I speak french myself, and I own the movie. After watching it with the English subtitles, I have noticed that some of the jokes were either badly translated, or impossible to translate (such as "L'âge de Pierre", and everyone being named "Pierre"), exactly like the Austin Powers movies, which were impossible to translate properly to french. I didn't give this movie a 10 because Jean Rochefort and Gérard Depardieu did not have a big enough role. This is really the type of movie where you'll be repeating the jokes over and over again days after you've seen it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thousands of years ago. A bunch of cavemen attempt to solve the world's first murder mystery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The French satire is made in the vein of films such as The Flinstones (I mean the original cartoon series, not the tenuous movie). So it was the absurdity of the situations that made me laugh through the whole movie. This might of course not be everyone's cup of tea, so if you don't find concepts introduced in an era when those things didn't yet exist funny then this movie will definitely not be your favorite. Also, if you don't laugh at the Mounty Python movies, it's not worth watching this film either. However, if you like distancing yourself from everyday things by looking at them set in the past and find the discrepancy between those modern concepts and the movie's era hilarious, you should no doubt watch RRRrrrr!!! I think it's worth at least a penny, or whatever the DVD costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one of the best comedy I've seen in past time. So much parody on any film produced by Hollywood. Guaranteed hour and a half of laugh if you like comedy's of this kind of course. The film itself show's about pre historical people life in modern perception. The chief who alway's asks whether they know his wife, the guy who does his hair with chicken bones, the white hairy guy they all bring so much laugh so it's just worth seeing. The first crime in human history is traced by those three and one girl who is rival tribe of dirty haired agent who is looking for a recepie for a shampoo. Overall so much action and laugh and people relations in prehistorical age. And the humor is more like Scary Movie or Lesly Nilsen comdey style - one of my favorite. Just worth seeing</fullReview>

I watched it alone and I was laughing out loud (I would be probably embarrassed to laugh if somebody was around).Complete trash. Complete waste of time. But in a good way.

		<shortDescription>Pour les connoisseurs...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was my first Alain Chabat movie, but one in a very long list of absurd humor comedies that I've seen... So, I'd call myself quite a "connoisseur" in that field. The title seemed ... promising... and the film itself turned out to be even better! I'd have to agree with whomever commented before saying that it resembles the Monty Python type of humor, which it does, very much so, actually... Take the starting scene, for instance, in which the Voice Over tells the dramatic story of a certain American battalion which fought heroically on the 973rd hill in Vietnam (whatever that means!!!) while gun fire and bombs are heard in the background... he then announces that this film DOESN'T tell that story!!! I would only recommend RRRrrr to those who enjoy absurd humor and who have good knowledge of French. Otherwize, you'd end up not getting half the jokes in the film!!! The most relevant example in this case would be the "Nous sommes a l'Age de Pierre" joke... In no other language would that make any sense or be funny!!!The fact that Gerard Depardieu is playing in this film is clearly out of marketing reasons. I'm sure that a lot of people went to see RRRrrr because it had an "Alain Chabat" label, but I bet even more went for Gerard Depardieu! This film brings a fresh, fun look to Stoneage movies, in a quite "Mel Brooks"-ish way (but without the singing and dancing)... dealing with a wide range of absurdities from "Why would any human kill another human?" to... being in a Carrefour (anyone's nightmare!!!).It's remarkable how Alain Chabat masters lighting in this film... one second the mood is pessimistic, dark, gruesome (when talking about the murder) and the next second - with no cuts! - it's sunny and bright and everybody quits the investigation and hits the playground for a match of beach volleyball!!! (one has to see to believe!)Well, I wouldn't want to spoil the fun of this movie, so my next comment will be WATCH IT... It holds a L.O.G.G.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know whether the person who left the previous comment watched it in French or English, because that would probably make a big difference to the humour. I found that it contained a brilliant use of non-sense and 3rd degree sense of humour. Though some jokes can only be understood in French, as some of them can't be translated into English and still have the same meaning. But if you understand relatively good French, or you have a French translator at hand, oh, and a good sense of humour, I would recommend watching it!I got a fair few laughs out of it, and my French isn't that great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely hilarious!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie! It's definitely worth seeing, unless you're the kind of person who's into Hollywood comedies and typical American humor, i.e. if you think "American Pie" is funny. The absurdity of the plot and most of the scenes/dialogs makes them impossibly funny... Icouldn't laugh hard enough! I understand French, so I grasped all the jokes. Though I think even if you don't speak French, the movie is funny. Being a French movie (as opposed to Hollywood), it's not sugar-coated, so it contains scenes which some people might find grossly violent. Personally I loved all of it and will definitely watch it all again. Don't watch it if you don't understand or like French humor, because this is typically French. Reminded me a little of "Les Daltons", which I also loved. (I have no idea why it got such a low rating here.) Also don't watch it if you're expecting to see perfect people with perfect bodies. Watch it if you want mad fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RRRrrrr is weird but funny. French humor...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RRRrrr is a movie about crazy stupid jokes. Even though the plot is pretty crazy itself, the jokes are very weird. As I have mentioned, it is typical french humor. That means that you will not find it too funny if you are not a little open minded and also if you don't speak french. The jokes are mainly playing with the words, but there are also many visual jokes. The humor is typical Alain Chabat (Astérix et Astérix Mission Cléopatre, La Cité De La Peur, ...).Some will find it heavy. Others, including me will find it delightful and have a heck of a good time watching it. A nice surprise is the apparition of many famous french actors in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could be the French Monty Python</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having moved to France, I wanted to understand French humour. Seriously, I couldn't understand it, until I saw this! Some people prefer witty humour. Almost all today's comedians do that, but what's wrong with humour that is stupid? The Goons, Monty Python and The Goodies are a perfect example, and so is RRRrr! There are so many gags and jokes in the film that it is generally okay to not pay attention to the plot (although the 300 year war over the secret of shampoo is quite clever). My particular favourite is the investigation of the first murder ("I've got it. She died of old age, but young.") Apart from that, there is also the idea of giving the animals tusks, thus ending their names with "-moth" (horsemoth, bearmoth, hippopotamoth, etc) and the film's beginning. So, as a conclusion, I highly recommend this film, it being one of my favourites. If you love Monty Python and want more goofy humour, then watch this, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RRRrrr is a french film about the war between the clean hair tribe and the dirty hair tribe, the latter fighting to get shampoo. What kind of a plot is that, really? A stupid but genius one! Okay, i may not be objective in my review because i'm French, but i recommend this movie to anyone who can understand a bit of this(beautiful) language. As everyone said, the jokes are so typical it can be hard to understand with the subtitles, as they're playing with words pretty much the whole time. As for myself, i watched this movie at least 5 times. Sometimes with my friends, sometimes alone, and every single time, i end up laughing extremely loudly. Alain Chabat is a genius and hilarious French producer, and the actors (part of the Robin des bois, a typically french humor show)are great and really funny. For the non-french speakers, if you're willing to make a small effort of comprehension (maybe take a dictionary with you? OK it's too much i know), you'll be far from disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentiously Unfunny...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three major R, four minor ones and three exclamation marks, this is the (so) unconventional title of the "Robin des Bois" movie, the first one? and in a sense of poetic justice, the last one, too.Would you be surprised? This is not the kind of film you 'review', this is the film you warn people about not watching it. But I doubt there are still people in this planet having this on their watch list. Well, I'll save you time, watch the 'other film', whatever it is, it might at least try to tell a story, or to awaken some emotion. That prehistoric thing, doesn't even deserve to be called a movie, it's not even so-bad-it's-good, it's not even so absurd it's funny? at least, not if you intend to watch the whole movie at once because the longer you stare at the screen, the less you understand what's going on.Anyway, the first time I saw it, a quarter had passed before my mind was in autopilot mode, somewhere I was wondering whether I was missing something or not. Was there an attempt at a plot or have I been dumbed down. The story is about a prehistoric tribe, the Clean Hair. They live during Stone Age, and guess what? They're all called 'Stone' (Pierre in France) a passable gag whose only brilliance is that they had to build the whole character-naming on that. There's a rivalry opposing them to the other tribe, the Dirty Hair who wants their secret to have clean hair. The story also involves a murder, the first 'crime' to be committed as in Tex Avery's "First Bad Man" cartoon.That's it, these could have been interesting premises, these are just crumbs on the scale of the film's length. Yes, there are some funny moments but most of the time, the characters wonder and exchange words that doesn't work even on the basis that they're ad-libbed. It's so blatant that I doubt the actors could endure their own movie if they had to. I stopped watching it the first time, the second, after twenty minutes, I was on IMDb with the sound left on, just in case I would hear something interesting. But take my word for it, no matter what you do, it will be more precious than watching this film, even staring at a blank screen.The film had one merit though: it put an end to the previously harmonious marriage between TV and Cinema humor. TV incarnated with the 'Canal+' channel. Founded in 1984, 'Canal' paved the way to a great generation of comedians: from Coluche to Jamel Debbouze. In 1994, the most emblematic alumni of Canal+, "Les Nuls" troop made a great crime thriller parody named "City of Fear", it was a success and made a star out of Alain Chabat, the leader. Many comedies would follow, and Chabat would be the king of French box-office with his "Asterix : Mission Cleopatra", 14 millions of viewers, the second highest-grossing French film at the time. In 2004, his "RRRrrrr!!!" would attract 1,7 million viewers, a great start spoiled by a bad word-of-mouth.And there's no excuse for that. While Chabat directed his 'Asterix' with the heart of a fan, in this mess, he let the control to the 'Robin des Bois' . A few words about them, the Robin des Bois were a group of comedians specialized in a form of awkward geek-humor oscillating between Monty Python and Andy Kauffman, in the five-minute format, they were hilarious, but in the movie, they're just incomprehensible. It seems like the film wasn't even prepared, as if the comedians were brainstorming five minutes before they hear 'action' and they instinctively believed that whatever would make them laugh, would translate well in the theater, a proof, if needed that even a comedy can be 'pretentious'.It's not the first time, comedians make a film for the big screen: in the 70's, it was the Splendid troop but their director was an outsider who could have an external view and make them leave their comfort zone. "RRRrrrr!!!" is the product of people who, unfortunately, took their popularity for granted. Chabat lost his magic touch and the Robin des Bois would follow different paths, the more versatile Jean-Paule Rouve had the most successful career so far. Finally the dreadful adaptation of "Lucky Luke" would hit the final nail on the coffin. It was the end of an era started in 1994.That's what you get with empty plots, a few cameos (Depardieu again and even jean Rochefort indulge to this ugly-looking cinematic mess) and a huge marketing publicity. The only justice is that the film was a flop and there's nothing more to say about it, except that it's crrrrrrap with more 'r' than the title, which I think refers to the sound of people groaning at the abysmal non-sense they're watching. It deserves a "1" according to IMDb standards, but you know what, I give it a 3, and you know why? Because of the first gag.The first gag has to be one of the most hilarious opening voice-overs to any film. Since I told you, not to watch the film, I'd feel hypocritical not to spoil the opening. So here it is; with a war-sounding noises in the background, on a black screen, the narrator presents the story of a 1969 Vietnam troop that had a routine mission but ended up being caught by the Vietcong for a ferocious battle. It ends with "This film doesn't tell their story". A laugh-riot, it's all downhill after.But it seems that this gag was so great it drained out the authors' creativity, a pity because if the rest of the movie was 10% as funny as this gag, with a 'conventional' story within an unconventional tone, it might have worked. Instead, it's a waste of talents that will waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the first 15 minutes or so, "RRRrrrr!!!" feels fresh. Then you start to realize that most of its jokes are variations on the same joke: prehistoric people doing anachronistically modern things. It could have played around more with the "whodunit" aspect, but it refuses to do so - it shows you the murderer right at the moment of the murder. The film looks good, it has clever moments and at least one inspiredly surreal sequence (hint: supermarket), and Elise Larnicol is perfectly deadpan, but the comedy runs out of steam long before the end. Depardieu's participation is little more than an extended cameo. ** out of 4.</fullReview>

So even you got evening to waste, let me suggest you to get drunk or even do nothing at all instead of even considering watching this movie - RRrrr!, in any case, is definitely NOT an option. As for now this is my number one in most crappy movies of 2004 (or maybe of 21th century as for now) and from all the movies I watched lately RRRrrr! was the one which made me feel embarrassed watching it. Rating 1 of 10 is too much for this "masterpiece".</fullReview>

But RRRrrrr!!! is by the Robin des Bois, who count among the worst "humorists" of today, Chabat only has a small part and I really wonder what has gotten into him to make this film... In this movie, the few guests stars (Depardieu, Rochefort) really seem bored to death, there is one gag every ten minutes and it's not even funny, or it is the first time but not after having been overexploited over and over again. It might have been a funny short movie, there is enough material for an half and hour short, certainly not for a full-lenght feature.</fullReview>

I like french movie like taxi and stuff but this one takes the cake even shut up was funnier. unfortunately you have to type ten lines before submitting this comment but my mother told one thing "if you do not have anything nice to say then do not say anything at all" but in this case it is my duty as citizen of this planet to warn society for this movie. I liked dumb and dumber i even like those french cops movies in the 80's so it is not that i like a "dumb"movie but truly this is totally stupid,really folks sorry the a great actor Gerard Depardue would do this movie still amazes me</fullReview>
