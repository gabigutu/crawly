		<shortDescription>The whole is not the sum of the parts - at least not on a single viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like so many of Terry Gilliam's films The Imaginarium Of Doctor Parnassus is one that is going to need multiple viewings to truly form an opinion on. Like Brazil, Adventures Of Baron Munchausen, Fisher King, Fear &amp; Loathing In Las Vegas and Tideland (even Time Bandits really) there is so much going on here that expectations or reputations get in the way and make it hard to digest and appreciate on a single viewing. No bad thing necessarily.Of course Parnassus has the particularly insurmountable problem of being the late Heath Ledger's final performance and following on from his superb, Oscar-winning turn in The Dark Knight. It is impossible to see the film through eyes that don't see it as the film he died making. Some parts of the film may perhaps work even better than they may of done had he lived ? some of the best films are triumphs over adversity and adverse conditions don't come much greater than your star dying mid-shoot. But whatever works and doesn't in the film it is hard ? impossible on a first viewing ? to divorce yourself from the knowledge you bring into the theatre.On first feeling Parnassus seems patchy, and curiously it feels like a film that may not have worked as well as it does had nothing happened to Ledger. Don't get me wrong I'd rather have a Gilliam failure and Ledger still alive to put it behind him and move on than a wonderful film that is largely the result of his tragic death. But we don't have that so I'm just looking at what's there.The fact is the film is at it's best when galloping around the fantastical worlds of the Imaginarium, with Ledger's character Tony now played by Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell. Depp and Farrell are particularly good and imbue the film with an energy lacking in much of it.The casting generally is good. Christopher Plummer is steadfast excellence as always. Lily Cole is a surprisingly strong choice. I've never understood the viewpoint of Cole as "sooooooo beautiful" that the gossip sheets and magazines espouse but she has a quirky intrigue that works wonders in a Gilliam world and proves herself as an actress amongst a proved group of impressive performers. Hers is probably the best debut performance I can recall of a model or singer turning to acting. She puts a lot of professional actresses (no Keiras named!) to shame.Andrew Garfield is that intriguing mix of annoying and brilliant. Like DiCaprio in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? I started out thinking he was terrible and then grew to realise it was just that I hated him, his character. He annoyed the hell out of me. In another words he had inhabited the character so fully, so convincingly that my negative feelings toward him where directed at the fictional character. A superb performance.Tom Waits steals moments constantly. Waits hasn't been given such a juicy role that fit him better since Renfield in Coppola's Dracula and he revels as Dr Nick (the devil) here.Oddly the performance that, again I specify on first viewing, leaves you a bit underwhelmed is Ledgers. It is not a bad performance but the expectations as you go in, knowing it was his last performance, means you expect something special. Brokeback Mountain/Dark Knight special. But of course not every role is as powerful as his in Brokeback or as scene-stealing as the Joker. I mean he didn't know it was his last performance for crying out loud. Therefore it cannot possibly live up to expectations and is destined to underwhelm until multiple viewings and some distance allow it to be judged fairly. That there was such a fully formed character there that three other actors could step in to play alternate universe versions of it entirely convincingly is arguably a testament to how strong a performance Ledger did give. It is not a likable character or a flashy character (it doesn't even really seem the main character until the alternate worlds with the alternate Tonys come in) and so Ledger's understated subtleties are easy to miss.When you watch Fisher King the first time you remember Robin Williams, not Jeff Bridges. In Twelve Monkeys it's Brad Pitt that comes away with you not Bruce Willis. And yet on further viewings Bridges' performance seems superb, Willis' perhaps the best of his career. I suspect on repeated viewings I'm going to see the strength of Ledger's performance better. I hope so.And of course this is a problem much of the film has. Gilliam doesn't make simple, overly explained films for the masses ? thank Gilliam ? you have to work with them. The problem here is that with your mind distracted with thoughts of Ledger and expectations built on that promise of Gilliam at his creative best, three step-in performances and Ledger's final performance it's hard to get your mind around the story and enjoy it as a piece of work.Sometimes Gilliam films work, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they get better and better on repeat viewings (Brazil); sometimes they work instantly (Twelve Monkeys); sometimes they seem to work but the more you see them or think about them they crumble and ultimately don't (Brothers Grimm). Sometimes they just seem to be a mix of great ideas, wonderful performances and ingenious set pieces but hampered by an overabundance of theatricality and almost too much going on for its own good (Baron Munchausen). On a first viewing Imaginarium Of Doctor Parnassus feels like this latter. Bits work, bits don't. It's enjoyable in places but perplexing ultimately.I will definitely revisit it though to see if changes on repeat viewings. I feel sure it will, but whether that's a good or bad thing, well, I'll have to wait and see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film but not for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film on the way home after a trip to Sydney. I was run-down, slightly feverish and head-achy, but none of that interfered with my enjoyment of the film.I'd actually forgotten that the film'd been released but when I saw the choices available it was the logical choice. I missed 1 minute of the opening credits but for once that wasn't a crucial thing. This being a Terry Gilliam film, you know it's going to be a) fantastic in a classic sense, b) complicated with many red herrings and original characters, and c) something you can watch more than once.I was not disappointed. It took a while before I followed what was happening and that's part of the charm of this film. The story (really a parable or allegory) is built up in layers and seemed to me perfectly cast (even allowing for Ledger's "ring-ins" after his untimely death). I particularly like the play between Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) and Mr Nick (Tom Waits). I found it interesting to see the visual influences in this film as well. The fantasy segments all have the mark of the director's animation days with Monty Python. There's also a Harry Potter influence in that Parnassus's wagon/theater looks like something from one of those films, and Parnassus himself reminded me strongly of a drunk Dumbledore.But this is NOT a film for everyone. The ending is NOT a Hollywood style "happy ending" by any means, but one that reflects on the nature of life. Anyone expecting this film to be a bit of "holiday entertainment" will be sorely disappointed, as the plot is not&nbsp;as predictable and the clichés used in the film aren't the sort you usually see.A top film that makes one think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece - go see it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Terry Gilliam's dark masterpiece. It's a brilliant film--there are fabulous, fantastic, surrealistic visual effects; gorgeous cinematography; and stunning performances by an amazing cast of consisting of both famous stars and lesser known (but excellent) actors. It's in the vein of the great European surrealistic movies like Fellini's "8 1/2" or "Satyricon". But--if you're not open to a mind bending, almost psychedelic fantasy and a plot with strange twists and turns that can be challenging to follow, this won't be for you. The cast is terrific--I mean, Tom Waits plays "Old Scratch"--how can you lose? Christopher Plummer is excellent in the title role; Heath Ledger's last performance is stellar. Lily Cole, Johnny Depp, Andrew Garfield, Jude Law, Verne Troyer, and Colin Farrell are also very good. The costumes and sets are gorgeous, though often in a dark and grungy way. By the way--it also ends up being a story about ethical choices in life and how some people are very misleading. Probably not material for a box office hit, sadly, as this film is probably too unusual for most Americans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It struggles to keep things in order, and often becomes weighed down by tired filler, but Gilliam returns to form nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suffering the double whammy of being directed by Terry Gilliam (forever the attracter of on-set misfortune ? Don Quixote, anyone?) and the untimely death of its star, Heath Ledger, halfway through shooting, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus has had a troubled upbringing. But with the actor's tragic passing, its unremarkable place on 2009's cinema calendar was upped by being Ledger's second posthumous and final movie, unfairly burdening the film with the anticipation of it being something great.It's not great. But it is a good movie, and probably Gilliam's best in over a decade. Also, bittersweet though it may be, Ledger's inability to complete his work is remedied in an incredibly inventive manner that arguably improves what would have been; the multiple facets of Ledger's mysterious Tony in the Imaginarium is a great inflection, and Gilliam deserves credit for this creative retooling, and for the fact that the haste in which it was applied is not at all noticeable. Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell (who all donated their wages to his daughter, Matilda) honorably step in to play the alternates, paying poignant tribute to their friend. All are good (though Farrell's Irish accent is far too thick to flatten), Depp probably being the best, but its all mimicry; Ledger is the one who does all the work. His Tony, performed with a flawless English accent, is a great part for him, possessing all the characteristics of vintage Ledger ? charismatic, droll, physically erratic, etc. It's not on par with his work in Brokeback Mountain or The Dark Knight, but seeing how much fun he must have been having, seeing that wily smile, makes it a none the more fitting goodbye to the man.The multi-personas also, despite sounding like classically contrived Gilliam, actually turn out to be the most credible part of the movie; they represent the most fascinating of the film's many mediations on reality (Gilliam is always at best when toying with reality, and this is no exception) - different parallels of the human psyche (or at least Tony's) are all challenged, and make for genuinely thought-provoking stuff. The rest of the film, however, is a bit of a patchwork; provocative but hopelessly overwrought. As always with the Brazil director, you can't fault his ambition, but he's always been patently unable to neatly combine all of his ideas into a satisfying whole.His biggest mistake is going contemporary. Gilliam's sense of humor, being that of a Python affiliate's, has always been well-authenticated by a theatrical and undeniably British zaniness. But here, we get modern social satire in the form of Tony's revamped version of the group's travelling act, and we get conversational verbosity (particularly in the poor improvisation of a pointless Verne Troyer), and it simply doesn't suit. Better are the moments where a group of "violence-loving" coppers dance about in skirts or in the inebriated ramblings of Doctor Parnassus.Why Gilliam didn't stick to his personal brand of appealing outlandishness is a shame, and a mystery, considering his fine cast of comically-endowed Brits, with glorious thespian Christopher Plummer at its head as the titular Doc. Of all the actors on hand here, Plummer is the one who best excels with the material. Playing a man who has lived over one-thousand years, he manages to convincingly carry himself with the weight of that time, his sallow-skinned and ravaged face, heavy, sad eyes, and world-weary frown scarily naturalistic. He's a heart-breaking character, and Plummer makes him an uncompromising presence.Also impressive are newcomers Andrew Garfield and Lily Cole, and Tom Waits as Mr Nick, the Devil himself. The notorious singer has never really had any good roles to work with in his career, and, in all fairness, his talents as an actor dictates just as much, but he's simply perfect here, his Machiavelli stealing all the scenes he wonderfully chews with his smarminess. It's not exactly a creation of noteworthy prowess (and neither is the character ? the cavalier, smooth-talking, gentleman-like villain, who relishes fomenting, is very overdone), but he's just such a hoot and effortlessly magnetic. He's pretty much the best thing here, and worth the admission price.Along with the cast, the visuals, a branch you can expect brilliance in with Gilliam, are a real saving grace. The special effects in the Imaginarium aren't extraordinary, but that's the point; it's an accentuated, animated reality ? one's greatest dreams (and nightmares) aren't supposed to be realistic. And few images this year are more stirring than of a harrowed Parnassus wandering through a vast snow-plain, giving up his struggle at a crossroad sign that reads "High Road" or "Low Road".It's a very entertaining movie, and thematically sound (it manages to make existentialism and solipsism accessible), and endearingly whimsical in tone and style. Unfortunately, it frequently degenerates into a muddle, the many ideas it juggles far too incoherently transcended. Thankfully, however, after the monotonous middle act, the movie picks up steam and the great Imaginarium sequences arrive to compel. And, in the end, it's a sheer miracle that the movie got made; the fact that Gilliam didn't give up, that he persevered and single-handedly defeated one of the worst production catastrophes, and that he gave Ledger his swansong, is something truly amazing. And it is for that reason that The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus will be remembered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Unique and Extraordinary Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus is a very strange film but it pulls together wonderfully. It was dark but funny at the same time. I really loved the imaginarium sequences. Gilliam uses dream-like imagery and odd behavior to construct a fantastic escape into imagination. Although the CGI was admittedly simplistic, it was fitting for the fantasy realm. Great performances, especially by Heath Ledger and Colin Farrell.I don't think this movie is for everyone since it has received mixed reactions. I also would advise against having certain expectations going into it, because there's no way to anticipate what you will get out of the film. But for me, it was certainly a real treat and very enjoyable throughout.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main talking point surrounding The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is the fact that it is the last appearance of the late Heath Ledger, however, there is a lot more to talk about with this film. Ledger's performance is good, as one would expect, but he has done better and more iconic roles. The problem faced by his death occurring before filming completed is overcome easily and one would not necessarily know that Ledger had died just from the evidence of the film. There is a fitting tribute to him in the film, as Johnny Depp's version of Heath Ledger's character comments on how celebrities who died young will live on forever.However, this film deserves to be discussed as a piece of work on its own. Like many of Terry Gilliam's films it is both complex and imaginative. The titular Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) operates a mostly unsuccessful travelling show where he hopes to send members of the public through a magic mirror into the Imaginarium where they will ultimately face a choice between giving their soul to Parnassus or the Devil (Tom Waits). Those two are having a contest for the soul of Valentina (Lily Cole), the Doctor's daughter. Helping the Doctor's show are the lovelorn Anton, the dwarf Percy and Tony a mysterious stranger who can draw punters. Initially all these plot points work well. Doctor Parnassus is a desperate man who has almost given up hope, whilst the Devil is entertaining to watch, yet evidently devious. The heart of the film lies with Valentina who wants a normal life but is it unaware that it is far more complicated than just the raising of money. Unfortunately, the film runs into difficulty in the last third as the plot lines all come together and even more are added, creating a overly complex ending where nothing gets resolved properly. The acting is good, with Lily Cole surprisingly impressive and old hands Christopher Plummer and Tom Waits leading by example. Terry Gilliam direction combines the fantastical and the ordinary in a way that only he can. It is the first time he has participated in the writing process for two decades and this film has an autobiographical feel as Doctor Parnassus tries to entice with stories and the imagination only to be met by cynical crowds. This effort to wow the public may not move them away from CGI and is short of his best, but it is still entertaining and favourable over films which lack charm, imagination and storytelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A world so strange as strange can be...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus tells the story of the immortal Dr Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) and his magical Imaginarium, a travelling show in which a volunteer from the audience gets to experience their greatest need in vivid forms and then has to choose between two paths. Choose correctly and you will be enlightened, choose wrongly and things won't be so good for you. Dr Parnassus however has a very dark secret; he once made a bet with Mr Nick the Devil (Tom Waits), in which he won immortality. Centuries later, he decided to trade his immortality with youth when he met his one true love, on the condition that his daughter Valentina (Lily Cole) belongs to Mr Nick when she reaches 16. The daughter is now reaching that consenting age, and Mr Nick comes to collect but Dr Parnassus is not about to let go. However, being the devil that he is, Mr Nick renewed the wager: Whoever entices the first 5 souls wins Valentina.Enter Tony (the late Heath Ledger), a mysterious man found hanging under a bridge by the Imaginarium crews and was revived by Anton (Andrew Garfield) to join the show and eventually make it successful. However, there's something about Tony that makes Parnassus' loyal friend Percy (Verne Troyer) uneasy. Tony's shady backgrounds and friendship with Valetina also make the jealous Percy more anxious. Dr Parnassus on the other hand is happy with Tony and he promises his daughter's hand in marriage to whoever that helps him win the bet. A race against time and choices of morality ensues in the wonderland that is the Imaginarium.Terry Gilliam directed this painting of a movie wonderfully with timing and pace coherently controlled. He gives us not just a great story but a whole world so outstandingly created with visual effect and cinematography that might leave you wondering where you are at the end of the movie and where you were during it. The Imaginarium, with its doorway made of simple foil sheets, is filled with random worlds produced by people's mind which is so vivid and mysterious and weird. This whole film is weird. But in a good way.What most might notice is the fact that the script and dialogues flow and form so smoothly and realistically that it is like watching real people in real situation. Heath Ledger did improvise some of his line and that fact alone proves how great of an actor he is. Although you might find his acting a bit similar to last year's most famous villain, The Joker in The Dark Knight (2008) which, of course, he himself played. His acting is believable, since he is an Australian playing British. Then there are Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell, each playing the different version of Tony when he enters the Imaginarium. The three actors played that one role so well that they disappeared into Heath Ledger's character so effectively that you are seeing a man whose face had changed and not a change in the person himself.But of course, this is not a story about Tony but Dr Parnassus (as in the title). Christopher Plummer did well playing a failing, sometimes drunken, side-show immortal and he provided enough mystical quality for the character. There are also several flashback scenes of a younger Parnassus also played by him. Tom Waits, played the Devil brilliantly with his growly voice and dark demeanour. Lily Cole proved that she can show real raw emotion in some scenes. Verne Troyer plays a lovable Percy, equipped with fast witty comments and wise words. And Andrew Garfield plays the distress young man, Anton.The score is great. Nothing ground-breaking but the music disappears and becomes a part of the scene. A great touch is when whenever Mr Nick appears, the score changes to something jazzy or bluesy.The storyline itself is something to be loved and the twist and turns of the plot is something to be admired. It's one thing people might not expect from a CGI-laden movie. But the story will grip you and make you captivated that you will sit through the 120 minutes just to see how it ends. The writers Terry Gilliam and Charles McKeown deserve an applause for handling such complicated story so well.It is basically a story about a father protecting his daughter. But what makes it unique is the fact that is it layered with metaphors and references about religion, the battle between good and evil, choices people made, impression people put up and morality behind each of our action.Not many people will like this movie simply because of its strange nature. The storyline itself is quiet confusing and its combination with the weird graphic of the Imaginarium world does not help at all. Some parts need a second viewing which I'm sure will be a rewarding watch. But if you understand it, I expect you will love The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Imaginarium of Terry Gilliam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw it at the Toronto International Film Festival!Apparently, Gilliam was not "on" anything while conceiving this masterful work of abstract reality. And i, for one, believe this statement is genuine. This is because through the visual chaos presented on the screen lies a single idea that weaves the entire picture together. Yes, there are flaws in the story but life has flaws and that is why artists like Mr. Gilliam create the means to escape from that daily monotony.The cast had perhaps more heavyweight star-power than any contemporary Hollywood blockbuster could ever dream of (Ledger, Plummer, Depp, Law, and Ferrel. Each of them bringing their talents to the table even as Tom Waits steals the show popping up unexpectedly every now and then in the most unusual fashion. Heath is a true chameleon; this time, sporting an English accent. But it is Christopher Plummer who is the true lead as it is he who we follow on the mission to save his daughter from the grasp of Waits' devil that underlines the entire film. While watching, one ultimately forgets that it is the last time that Heath will ever grace the big screen and yet it seems as though he goes out with the same grace many thought had already passed with The Dark Knight. It is also particularly strange how the last shot of the Joker in The Dark Knight is hanging upside-down (sorry for spoiler) and the first shot of Tony in this film is hanging under a bridge (not really a spoiler). The latter is foretold by Parnassus via a tarot card called "The Hanged Man" which foretells happiness at the price of sacrifice...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rajo loves it, but knows it won't work... how tragic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just before leaving to go and see The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus, the latest offering from the perpetually 'unlucky' yet stubbornly visionary Terry Gilliam (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Time Bandits), I asked a good friend, also a movie buff, if he wanted to come with."No way," he proclaimed. "I can't sit through a Terry Gilliam movie." Having sat through the 2 hour + film myself, I'm convinced he made the right decision, as I even had a tough time with it. It's definitely too long, rarely makes sense and feels as though it might unravel at any minute. As usual, Gilliam's imagination takes over the film, running completely wild in every direction, resulting in a rich visual feast that's a delight to look at. As usual, though, this comes at the expense of clarity and accessibility, which is unfortunate, especially so considering the multiple real-world challenges that severely disrupted the film's production and its theoretical comprehensibility anyway. Is Gilliam ever gonna catch a break? And, if he does, will he be relaxed enough to create something that more that a handful of folks might like? This film's script (mostly unchanged, despite production difficulties) will definitely try one's patience; characters make weird choices and important plot elements are left unexplained. As a decision seemingly made to serve the story, most of Gilliam's film operates on a kind of dream logic, which at the best of times put a huge grin on my face and made me feel all gooey inside and at the worst of times pulled me right out of the film, faster than a spilled cold Coke in the lap. As an example of the latter, one would think that Gilliam, having famously made the creative decision to bolster the late Heath Ledger's incomplete performance with the work of Johnny Depp, Colin Farrel and Jude Law, might have installed some sort of interesting yet logical plot device allowing that singular character to appear physically different at times. Sadly, the reasoning is, for some reason, half-baked - the other characters in the film are just as puzzled as the audience is at the changes, even going way too far with their "No, wait... who are you?" line of questions. If one's own characters seem to think it's out of place, then the audience will have no choice but to question it as well. Disbelief: unsuspended and resolute in its anchor-like stolidity (how's that for a sentence?).Now, despite all that, I absolutely, positively and without question adored The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus. Because Gilliam is really, really good at what he does best. It's far and away one of my favourite films of the year, and easily the most important film of Gilliam's career, warts and all. With Parnassus, he continues to stylistically explore potent ideas about the power of storytelling and imagination, and what happens when the worlds of fables and make-believe collide with our cynical, sober reality - all concepts I personally go nuts over. When in this mode, he always managed to sub-textually raise questions about imagination and dreams as important sign-posts in our collective unconscious, lighting the way to collective and individual hope, joy and happiness. The difference with Parnassus is that Gilliam has finally made a film that is explicitly and without question about that exact thing, positing at its core that stories and imagination and new ideas are the very things that hold the fabric of the universe together. A beautiful idea, and as relevant as ever considering Hollywood's constant push for the bottom line over creative integrity, and Gilliam's own personal feelings regarding his stifled creativity and the uncertainty of his place in modern cinema. And if you're anything like me (Naive? Simple?), this stuff, when fused with Gilliam's impeccable eye for composition and always fantastic production design will help you forget that the film isn't perfect or logical or accessible.Despite all of the aforementioned flaws in the story (which, understandably, most movie-goers may have a low tolerance for), The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus is actually quite brilliant, and contains some of the single best movie moments and ideas seen all year, and by dint of its stellar cast (besides Heath Ledger and friends, the film stars Christopher Plummer and Tom Waits, both in memorable roles), serves as a showcase for some of the best talent working in film at the time of production. But because of its flaws, it probably won't generate the word of mouth necessary to bring the crowds (and as such, the box office receipts) that Gilliam so desperately needs in order to continue to be able to make films of this scale. Which is too bad, as directors like Gilliam, who so zealously worship at the alter of imagination and visual splendour with a slavish dedication to film-making craft are not so high in abundance. Maybe if he was actually able to, you know, make a film without having outside elements messing up his plans, he might actually live up to his ultimate potential as an original story-teller able to easily reach the masses. As it stands, though, his status as such, as well as the very fabric of the universe it seems, continue to be under threat.My score? 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well today I've seen Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus; I would say it's great! Terry Gilliam made another masterful work in his traditional vein of early works. Undoubtedly it could be better, but considering complicated circumstances under which were whole creation of the movie this is not just concocted story, it's elaborately tailored picture with heart and deep sense.Looks a little bit patchy at first view, I suppose it's related with the death of Heath Ledger who didn't end his performance nevertheless Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell imbue the movie with new shapes and different atmosphere. They not worse they just different, somebody may deny such substitution but they need to think at first. What choice Gilliam had? These tree actors are probably the best that cinema industry has for this role. Without them, this film won't even exist.This film is not for everyone, there are lacks of hints to get accurate picture and you'll need to face a lot of puzzles within it. But obviously when you begin to peer into the deepest niceties you start to understand all charming aspects and the main idea. This entire story filled with dozens of perplexing moments due to the abstract reality mood yet it's all looks really stunning and amazing especially perfectly contrived mysterious clouds around Heath Ledger's character Tony. His enigmatic origin has specific magnetism, it takes spectator's mind and don't give him any chance to digress from twists and turns of the plot and constantly keeps him on tenterhooks. No doubt this work deserves the highest mark, Gilliam made a great job and I believe his efforts and efforts of all who were involved in the creation of this masterpiece won't escape from clever viewers. Pity that it is the last movie of Heath Ledger, because in fact it's not a film about his character, it is basically about Doctor Parnassus. But still I'm happy that last film of Ledger was so terrific and magnificent. Ledger left us beautifully like such outstanding actors should. Rest in peace Heath we all know that you were the best. And you still the best, cos like Johny Depp sad in the movie ''Nothing is permanent, not even death''.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many reviewers wrote they could not sit through the film. Sadly, in today's "I must constantly be entertained with my 1.5 second attention span", moviegoers tend to actually stomach "Gone In Sixty Seconds" yet cannot follow an intelligent, thoughtful film, replete with the fantastic imagination of Terry Gilliam. I had little trouble not only following this film, but following the changes of characters caused by Heath Ledger's death. Actually, the best of the characters was Johnny Depp, as usual. Everyone else who played the part, including Ledger, seemed to be walking through the lines. Overall, I loved the film. It definitely should have won best set decoration, and Christopher Plummer should have been a candidate for best actor. But as I said, short attention spans and focus on mindless drivel like the constant barrage of car theft shows indicates a somewhat less sophisticated audience that may not appreciate an intelligent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In London, the sideshow troupe of Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) promises to the audiences a journey to the "Imaginarium", an imaginary world commanded by the mind of Doctor Parnassus where dreams come true. In the stories that Doctor Parnassus tells to his daughter Valentina (Lily Cole), to the midget Percy (Verne Troyer), and his assistant Anton (Andrew Garfield), he claims to have more than one thousand years; however, when he felt in love for a mortal, he made a deal with the devil Mr. Nick (Tom Waits) trading his immortality per youth. As part of the bargain, he promised his son or daughter to Mr. Nick on the sixteenth birthday. Valentina now is almost in the doomed age and Doctor Parnassus bets with Mr. Nick that whoever seduces five souls in the Imaginarium will have Valentina as a prize. Meanwhile the troupe rescues Tony (Heath Ledger) that was hanged on a bridge by the Russians that explains why he had been chased and he joins the group. Tony and Valentina fall in love for each other and the jealous Anton discovers that his competitor is a liar."The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" is another original movie with the surrealistic and imaginary world of Terry Gilliam and last work of Heath Ledger that had to be replaced by Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell in the "Imaginarium" to complete the missing scenes. Further, the trio of actors has donated their income with this film to Heath Ledger's daughter to guarantee her financial situation in the future in magnanimous attitudes. The duel between Doctor Parnassus and Mr. Nick together with the vision of the world of fantasy of Terry Gilliam is awesome. For those that liked this movie, I would like to recommend the also surrealistic "O Homem Que Desafiou o Diabo". My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "O Imaginário Mundo do Doutor Parnassus" ("The Imaginary World of Doctor Parnassus")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A messy disappointment from Terry Gilliam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having walked out half way through Terry Gilliam's The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus a few weeks ago I had the opportunity to sit and watch the film from start to finish with lowered, or at least more realistic expectations.This is the story of Dr Parnassus who is constantly in game of give and take with the devil. Its a battle for souls that kind of mirrors the battle for God and the Devil. Parnassus travels around putting on shows overing enlightenment to anyone who'll take it, but it rarely amounts to very much. As the film opens time is running short, Parnassus' daughter is to turn 16 which means that she'll be handed over to the devil however into the mix comes the amnesiac Tony, who they find hanging from a rope under a bridge in London. As Tony tries to find his past and the Doctor drinks himself into oblivion the Devil has yet another wager up his sleeve.A brilliant cast (including the stand ins for Heath Ledger) try to do what they can with a script that kind of rambles all over the place constantly reinventing itself like the never ending wagers that Tom Wait's devil keeps coming up with. I'm certain that this made some sort of sense on the page, or at the very least in Gilliam's mind but what has come out on screen is kind of like an uncontrolled brain explosion. Its like Terry Gilliam was thinking about all of these things and when suddenly they just sort of popped out before they could adequately be put together. I'm told that the film is very close to Gilliam and reflects things important to him, if that is the case, and I suspect it is, I think Gilliam should be told not to share next time. I really had no idea what he was getting at.Don't get me wrong it has some great bits. The imagery is, as with all Gilliam films, stunning. Some of what we see in the Imaginarium is amazing. Most of the bits, as bits, are wonderful but as a whole they don't work. There are simply too many plot holes and too often Gilliam stacks the deck in what ever way he wants things to play out or adds things that make little sense even in a nonsensical way (say the signing police number). If you want an example of Gilliam forcing issues think about the scene at the fair early on. Think about how the family, and everyone else ignores them. I mean everyone ignores them to such a large degree that its intentional. Its much too fake.They are behaving like a monstrous movie family not like a real family. Worst of all is the fact Gilliam can't even keep his characters consistent, one need only loom at the Parnassus character to see that. He is so all over the place as to never seem to fully formed. He drunk, he's not. he fights, he gives up. Give him 30 seconds and he'll change.I stopped caring about half way into the film.When I originally discussed this film with friends I said that I felt nothing and that I was bored, something I had never felt in a Gilliam film. In someway I think that was true and in some way I think I was wrong. I think the boredom and lack of feeling was a reaction to what I feel is the scatter-shot nature of the script. How can I feel anything when there is no way to know what is really going on since the film doesn't seem to have a clear idea either. I know when it was done I was of the opinion that you probably could even argue that the whole story was a story.Its a mess.No I did not like it. Honestly between this film and Peter Jackson's Lovely Bones I've had to come up with a new movie list, namely major disappointments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It makes no sense, but I enjoyed it so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trying to come up with some kind of rating for The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus is quite a challenge indeed. On one hand, the plot goes absolutely nowhere, the ending is nearly incoherent and the point seems lost in an overly symbolical climax. On the other hand, the movie is absolutely beautiful, some characters are beyond excellent and the ideas behind it are tremendously original. And I'm an absolute sucker for originality.Imaginarium makes no bones about being completely out-of-this-world from the outset, following a troupe of actors and mystics. The leader, Dr. Parnassus, is mostly silent on stage, rumoured to be an immortal who has lived 1000 years. Also following are Parnassus' 15-year-old daughter Valentina, youthful romantic Anton (who is, of course, head-over-heels for Valentina) and wisecracking yet wise midget Percy. They soon run across a mysterious amnesiac stranger, who has new ideas for the show.Parnassus accepts, because he's made a deal with the devil (given the name Mr. Nick) and needs to collect five souls before the devil does, which he accomplishes by having people enter his Imaginarium, a world inside his/their mind (its difficult to tell just whose mind it is). And so the race is on, and Valentina's life is at stake.The exact "rules" of this soul-collecting business is never explicitly stated. Some parts near the end involving this simply make little to no sense. In fact, the entire ending is full of mumbo jumbo that probably demands a second viewing. Even with this oddity, the ending is nonetheless exciting.The middle, however, does drag somewhat. Despite what one might think, the Imaginarium scenes appear in the beginning, then cut out for nearly an hour. The movie doesn't have much steam in the real world, although Ledger's enthusiac salesman performance does give these bits some life to them, as well as any interactions with Percy.It does, of course, have a very standard love triangle, with Anton and the stranger vying over Valentina's affections. Thankfully, neither suitor is displayed as particularly perfect, but it does feel somewhat by-the-book otherwise. Anton is the sweet, age-appropriate suitor, with a gleam in his eye and jealously in his heart. The stranger (eventually revealed to be named Tony, but I much prefer the early moniker George) is much cooler and more assertive, but there's mysteries in his past. How it all ends up is slightly surprising, but its mostly the same as always for the romantic side of things.As for the actual imaginarium scenes, if Avatar is a testament to the raw power of CGI, this film is a testament to their artistic value. Likely entirely green-screened, these sequences are quite dazzling, with rivers turning into snakes and sinister Russian mothers. Its like Alice in Wonderland went slightly more over-the-edge, and some while some bits are truly bizarre, its all quite fascinating, especially when it is first re-introduced after the middle.One of the big buzzes of Parnassus is Ledger's performance, being his last before his untimely death. While he has extraordinary bits as the salesman of the show, the meatier bits in the imaginarium, unfortunately, were not filmed before he passed. In an act of true genius, Gilliam used three other actors to fill in (Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrel), with the explanation being that his appearance changes. Which would have made sense had the other characters had their appearance change as well, although one other exception does occur, giving it somewhat more validity. All three actors pull their weight wonderfully to help the film. Jude Law, in my opinion, was the best of the three, although Farrel was also great with likely the most screen time and dramatic impact. Depp was certainly entertaining, but seemed too much like Johnny Depp, clashing a bit with Ledger's characteristics on the outside. Unfortunately, Ledger's character is last seen as one of these forms, leaving the characters sendoff disconnected.The supporting cast has some big standouts. Plummer is appropriately wise, but does little more than expected. Lily Cole is a beautiful subject for the role, and perfectly exudes youthful naivete, although the character's age sometimes makes her actions squeamish. Verne Troyer (yeah, that Verne Troyer) is exceptional as the comic relief Percy. The true standout is Tom Waits as Mr. Nick, the trickster devil. A stlish mix of clever and evil, Mr. Nick is one of the best villains of the year, and an excellently entertaining performance.Imaginarium simply must be seen twice to get a proper opinion of the movie. If originality and style is more important than pure dramatic substance for you, then I would recommend this movie, as few like it exist. If you want more substance, look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE SPIRITUAL SIDE OF PARNASSUS - one of the most meaningful films I have ever seen... (minor spoilers)...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read quite a few reviews of 'The Imaginarium Of Dr Parnassus' before I finally got around to seeing this amazing film. Most reviewers comment on the basic plot / story line, the Terry Gilliam style of visual effects, the actors' individual performances, etc but what surprised me the most is the sheer spiritual depth of this movie which no one seems to talk about or recognize. I cannot think of any other film that is as multi-layered in this regard. It appears the state of mind / soul of the viewer determines the viewing experience. People who are primarily focused on the physical and little on the spiritual world will miss a lot of what this film is about and therefore will not be able to adequately appreciate it. I would actually find it to be quite a challenge to verbally explain certain meanings/messages as in a way they're perceived on a spiritual level first and kind of need to be 'translated' into words - that's a really rare thing in movies these days and something I highly value. There is a lot of symbolism in this film. For example, look up the meaning of 'The Hanged Man' tarot card, which appears in the film several times... http://www.tarotteachings.com/hanged-man-tarot-card-meanings.html . I now understand why it was impossible for Terry Gilliam to remove that hanging scene - it is an integral part of the movie...Even if you can't understand the deeper meanings of this film, it's still very entertaining due to the wonderful visual effects and strong acting performances. Heath Ledger managed to demonstrate a completely new acting style (his variety of characters in a few brief years is simply astounding), Lily Cole was perfectly chosen for her role and as she has said so herself, her acting benefited greatly from the mentoring she received from Heath during the filming. She did a wonderful job and I think she's got amazing potential. I can't wait to see how she'll develop as an actress in years to come. I also really enjoyed Christopher Plummer. He managed to play a very difficult role that could have easily destroyed the whole film if his acting skills weren't so impeccable.Incidentally, when you watch the film, experiment viewing Dr Parnassus as a reflection of one's eternal soul and the other actors as various aspects of life rather than specific characters and the film takes on a whole new meaning... I thought the casting in general is superb and one can't help but walk away from this film feeling enriched. I watched it with my 13-year old son who was completely mesmerized from start to finish...I'm so glad and grateful Terry Gilliam completed this profound film because I personally consider it a much more suitable last performance of Heath Ledger than what the Joker would have been. I feel Heath has left us with a deeply meaningful message - a precious gift to be cherished. Make sure you go and see this movie. Try to not intellectualize it but instead keep your mind open and 'let everything come to you.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An experience. That is the best description I can think of every time I see a movie by Terry Gilliam. He truly is a visionary, who's work is like non other. It's as if there are no rules in his line of work. Beautiful, imaginative, sick...It actually is quite hard to describe his work logically, because everything about his work is not based on logic. It is as if his imagination bursts out of his mind beyond the comprehension every time he does a movie, yet everyone of them, in my opinion, is genius. And "The Imaginarium Of Doctor Parnassus" is a perfect example of what Gilliam is capable of.The story is quite original and imaginative. Of course it definitely is not for everyone, since this movie REALLY stands out. But as for me, I loved everything about it. Everyone who loves stories about bargains with the devil will surely at least like it, because not only does it use this old fashioned element, but here it dressed up really well. It ads a sort of a humor to it, as the all the characters, especially the devil, are presented here with a nicely exaggerated charisma. And the story's drama put together with this interesting sense of humor creates an absolutely fantastic and aberrant overall atmosphere, which will make you enjoy practically every minute of the picture with tranquil satisfaction. The cast is just amazing beyond praise. So many A list actors (Heath Ledger, Christopher Plummer, Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell, Jude Law, etc.)put together in one place, make this film even more enjoyable. And the fact that the character Tony was Heath Ledger's final performance, really makes you pay a lot of attention to his role, which is absolutely FLAWLESS! And the rest of the cast give the most decent performance, especially Christopher Plummer, whose acting here is impossible to complain about for any movie admirer. The visual effects are incredible. Probably even imaginative enough to match the imagination of Mr. Gilliam. At moments of watching some of the more visually superior scenes, I actually thought to myself "How high, and 'on' what Gilliam was, to be capable of creating such pictures?" But of course this director isn't 'on' anything, but a true master in the craft of filmmaking.Definitely recommended. This movie is a must see for any Terry Gilliam fan, any Heath Ledger fan, and anyone who likes imaginative and bizarre stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resurgence in Gilliams ability to match creativity with an ability to deliver a fully formed concept.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam films are never known for telling a straight story and his productions are no different. Often both are fraught with setbacks, doomed failure and last minute redemption. His 1999 production of The Man Who Killed Don Quixote was a spectacular disaster. On the second day of shooting, a flood ravaged the set causing $15 million in damages and was compounded days later when his lead actor, Jean Rochefort, sustained a slipped disc which forced the film to shut down. However, a second film crew was documenting the entire proceedings and produced the rather interesting documentary Lost In La Mancha.His latest opus, The Imaganarium of Doctor Parnassus was no different. Starring the late Heath Ledger, whose sudden death caused production to grind to a halt having only filmed a third of his parts, it seemed that once again Gilliam's film would be destined for the cutting room floor.With developments in technology, Gilliam initially planned to use computer generated effects to change Ledger's appearance akin to those used in The Curious Case of Banjamin Button and finish the film. However, the actors JOhnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law were eventually cast to portray alternative versions of Ledger and production resumed several months later.The film itself concerns the travelling theatre troupe led by Doctor Parnassus who offers unsuspecting members of the public a chance to enter a magical mirror to unbeknown worlds of an almost hallucinatory nature. These worlds are classic Gilliam animations of a similar theme of those first espoused on Monty Python albeit using modern CGI to create an ethereal reality reflecting the subjects mindset. Those who enter the Imaginarium are manipulated by Dr Parnassus to offer them an experience of a lifetime.The twist in Parnassus's ability, however, is that his powers were granted by the Devil for a ransom and now he is back to collect on the bargain, his daughter Valentia. The role of the devil is adeptly played by Tom Waits who plays his character as a reluctant anti-hero, seemingly willing Parnussus on whilst simultaneously mocking his ability to beat him at his own game. Indeed, the Devil can also change the landscape of the vision by those who enter the mirror giving him a somewhat unfair advantage.It's true of Gilliam films that the plot is often muddled by the visuals employed to truncate or assist the narrative and certainly there are moments in The Imaginarium where it detracts from the storyline by an overambitious and needless set piece. Nevertheless, the visual effects are stunning at times and add to the grandeur of the moment.It is also interesting to see how Gilliam has used the mirrors own powers to change Ledgers character as he enters successive times and how this allows other actors to take his place. It would certainly have been interesting to observe the original idea as subverting the plot to allow Farrell, Law and Depp would have seriously altered the concept of intent as initially conceived.Ledger's own performance is satisfactory and it's a shame we do not get to see the change in his own character throughout the entirety of the film but which is adequately filled by the performance of his fellow stars.Despite these setbacks and reworkings, the film succeeds in pulling the viewer into the story, despite how ridiculous it becomes at times. As the race reaches its climax for Parnassus to save what is dearest to him, the fragmented storyline pulls more or less neatly together and it is easily Gilliams best film in a decade although not without it's aforementioned detractions.This will certainly please fans of his previous work and must have given the studios enough confidence to start production on the ill-fated Don Quixote project which is his next film. Let's hope this is a resurgence in Gilliams ability to match creativity with an ability to deliver a fully formed concept.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are movies that come along every once in a while and leave you pleasantly surprised. The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is one of those.I was very curious about this film, but was cautiously curious as it seemed to be waaaaaaaaaay out there. And it is. But in the middle of the bizarre is a morality tale that is charming and instructive.Depp, Law and Farrell, seamlessly stand in for Ledger during fantasy sequences that actually work better having Ledger replaced as it adds to the fun mess happening.The film has some of the most unique sets and effects seen this past year. It makes you wonder what the director might have done had he been given the Alice in Wonderland project and not Burton.Christopher Plumber and Tom Waits are excellent as the dueling forces of good and bad. Necomers Andrew Garfield and Lily Cole bring a fresh face and air to the proceedings. Verne Troyer, made famous for playing Mini-Me in the Powers movies, is wonderful as the assistant to Plumber's Parnassus. Ledger brings his usual flair for the odd and as mentioned previously, Depp, Farrell and Law step in for Ledger and all three deliver performances that enhance Ledger's. This is a definite rental for the curious and I bet, like me, you will want to purchase it so you can experience the absolute joyful bizarreness of it all as much as you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deep and beautiful movie, requires a special mood and a bit of thinking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would have been hard not to like this movie, since I had early previews from friends that it is boring and pointless, so my expectations were really down. I did watch it, nonetheless, and I am glad I did. If you ever watched Tideland, you know Terry Gilliam is capable of works of terrible beauty, often concocted from the ugliest bits life can provide; such is this film.This is Heath Ledger's last film, he died during filming it, but his character is not the main one, just the extra ingredient needed to take all the important ones out of their equilibrium state. Because of this tragedic death, other actors came to fill up the role, such as Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell.And still, the important character, the Faust that can't keep himself from betting with a mischievous devil that isn't even very unfriendly, is Christopher Plummer's, who played marvelously at his age of 81. I loved the way the devil was toying with him, addicted to playing games that he didn't want to win in the end so that he keeps playing. The visuals were great, the atmosphere both miraculous and brooding, but rarely in the same time. And Lily Cole was cute and sexy as hell.Bottom line: a weird film that you need to think about to get at his many hidden meanings, with beautiful imaginative imagery and great actors. What is not to like?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only limit is your imagination, just mind that the devil's in the details.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher Plummer plays the titular Doctor Parnassus, a man granted everlasting life by the devil (Tom Waits) but dogged by the pesky one ever since and also obliged to hand over his only daughter (Lily Cole) to him on her sixteenth birthday. Luckily, the devil loves a good wager and decides to give the doctor one more chance. If five souls enter his imaginarium (a world fuelled by the doctor's talents and the imagination of those who enter) and choose the good over the bad then the doctor gets to keep hold of his daughter. With his wise helper (Verne Troyer) and a naive, lovestruck young lad (Andrew Garfield) both helping and hindering him, the doc feels that things are looking bleak until charismatic, conniving Tony (Heath Ledger, in his final role) comes along and shakes things up.Directed by Terry Gilliam, fans of the imaginative, visionary director's work should know what to expect from this film. Forget that, this movie manages to exceed all of your expectations and shoots straight up there to sit beside the very best in Gilliam's filmography (and that's some fine company indeed).With the blend of a great cast (including Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law playing imaginarium interpretations of Ledger's character), a wonderfully grandiose yet also small and personal tale and some visuals that will take your eyes to a spa, treat them with all of the best treatments on offer then replace them, soothed and content, this film is a treat for any lover of great cinema.Considering the sad loss of Ledger during the filming process, it's amazing just how seamless the whole thing seems to be and how fantastic a swansong it is for the actor's career. Gilliam has had his ups and downs through the years, his budget battles and his creative compromises, but this stands tall as testament to what he can achieve when everything falls into place. Quite astonishing.See this if you like: The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, The Fisher King, Mr Magorium's Wonder Emporium.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terry Gilliam gold......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film yesterday and in retrospect, after reading some of the reviews here I wonder if we are all seeing the same film. I found it complex, thought provoking, and visually stunning. The character of Dr. Parnassus is in my mind a classic tragic hero. The man who once knew what he wanted and has lived long enough to regret it. Tom waits as "Nick" was great casting as was the character. Its not often that the devil is portrayed as someone who is a facilitator of your most erroneous desires. It actually makes his a rather sympathetic character in my opinion. I think that even with Plummer's brilliant portrayal of Dr. Parnassus and Ledger's portrayal of Tony as well as Depp, Law and Farrell as Tony in the imaginarium, works so well that in imagining this film with Ledger as Tony in all 3 roles in the imaginarium doesn't seem to work. Each person who enters has their own fantasy and therefore their guide wouldn't necessarily be the same person now would it? Already a big fan of Gilliam's, this film entrenches my feeling that Gilliam is really the most imaginative film maker now alive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is SO busy and chaotic that it turns into a bore to follow. Trying to chase down the non-sequitor story lines becomes a absolutely labor intensive. I was psyched to see it as it is an exceptional cast and if there is any saving grace, that would be it. The trouble is that there are too many story lines thrown at you before you can get to the crux of the deal; None of the arcs are all that engaging or captivating; they just keep popping up out of nowhere and end up nowhere. The heart of the story is Parnassus's deal with Nick and what he ultimately has to give up when time comes to settle up; but frankly Terry Gilliam puts you through the ringer to get you there. Terry Gilliam's films seem to get more and more cluttered which is a pity being that the best work he did was with Monty Python as a visual artist and possibly satirist and though Brazil and The Fisher King were fun and engaging, the rest of his films become like a forest of fun house mirrors. I got a headache watching this film. Sorry Terry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HEATH LEDGER's sudden demise during filming of THE IMAGINARIUM OF DR. PARNASSUS made it necessary to change the script so that his unfinished scenes could be played by other actors within the realm of the crazy world of the Imaginarium. This clever adjustment to the script provides three other actors with fill-in roles for Ledger: JOHNNY DEPP, JUDE LAW and COLIN FARRELL.Heath is a complete delight in his role as the mysterious stranger who comes upon the traveling sideshow and has the power to change everything. CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER is a marvel in the title role as the 1,000 year-old man who has sold his soul to the Devil and must turn over his daughter to Mr. Nick (TOM WAITS) on the occasion of her sixteenth birthday. Newcomers ANDREW GARFIELD and LILY COLE are well cast as performers in the troupe.All of it is filled with wondrous sets, gorgeous costumes, and an abundant sense of good humor. Everyone in the cast seems to be having fun with their roles, particularly Heath Ledger. I dare say that if he had lived to complete his role, it may well have garnered another nomination for him.Terry Gilliam has directed with a firm grasp of tongue-in-cheek fantasy and made a vastly entertaining film out of a slim story idea. Whether it appeals to you or not will depend entirely on your taste. It's certainly not a film for everyone but it is bizarre and fascinating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A diversion from reality, a fun adventure into the mind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Don't worry if you don't understand it all at first" The quote from the opening of The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus just about sums up the entire film, and perhaps the works of its director as a whole. The films of Terry Gilliam defy explanation or description; he approaches each film with his untouched creative vision and inventiveness. Every world he creates is wholly unique; he is the master of the original, and the fantasy. The great Dr. Parnassus made a wager, a bet with the devil himself, and he won. Granted immortality, but at a great cost, the life of his first born, his daughter on turning age 16 is forfeit to the fiend. Living on the street as a traveling stage show; Parnassus grants onlookers a chance to enter into his Imaginarium, a world of their own mind. The doctor is cursed, cursed to live forever, to watch and wait for the day of his daughters 16th birthday, a day that is looming. The devil loves a game, and makes another gamble with the Doctor: Lead 5 souls into the Imaginarium, grant them the choice between the sides of darkness and enlightenment. Win 5 souls before the day of his daughter's birth and win her freedom. The match is set, but the devil does not play fair, he loves the game above all else. There is an interesting conflict between Dr. Parnassus's two worlds, the grim dank reality of his life as a meek street performer, and the whimsical animated realm of his Imaginarium. Containing some of the most grounded characters of a Gilliam film, and yet some of the most fantastic dreamscapes. The traveling stage troop rescues a hanged man, a young man left for dead, fortune places him in there company, an amnesiac played by the late Heath Ledger in his last performance, one that he was unable to complete, Ledger proves once again the great talent that was lost. He is expressive, shrewd, and a joy to watch. It is an unavoidable distraction to think of the man behind the character, to see the great talent just beginning to come to light, we lost an actor of immense talent and charisma. Terry Gilliam for all his creativity and skill may be cursed. His filmography is fraught with difficulty and even disaster. He fought tooth and nail over his edit of Brazil, his lead actor in Don Quixote had a herniated disc and a flash flood destroyed a set, nearly every one of his films has struggled for financing and his creative control. And now the young burgeoning talent he cast in his latest dies during film-making, the man is truly cursed. The solution to the passing of his actor and friend was quite ingenious. As Ledgers character enters the Imaginarium, his appearance is changed, altered to reflect the imagination of the current participant in the realm. Jonny Deep, Jude Law, and Collin Farrell each admirably take there turns as incarnations of Ledger's character. It works surprisingly well, as they all bring a slightly different persona to the character as he is transformed by imagination. Farrell is able to capture the essence of Ledgers performance with the greatest quality, but all three are to be commended for finishing the last work of a great man. The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus is a wild film, the animated formless, ever changing realm of imagination is vivid and very enjoyable to observe. It is a very interesting fantasy, and Terry Gilliam's insane touch is present thought out. It does not reach the level of Gilliam's greatest works, it lags a bit struggling to truly catch my attention, but I enjoyed the movie, it was a fun if confusing ride, I can't say I understood it all, but I think that maybe the point. It is a journey of wild creativity, and unmistakable original. A very entertaining abstract vision, with a surprisingly likable ending, it's a fun diversion from reality, a glimpse into the mad mind of Terry Gilliam.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My reaction after the credits rolled was, "What a shame!" Much of what I feared prior to watching it (that it would be a somewhat sad attempt to recapture the visual style of Gilliam's earlier work, that imagery would trump substance, etc.) turned out to be all too true. Unfortunately, due either to budget or Gilliam's stylistic preferences, the visual imagery and CGI remind one more of "Who Killed Roger Rabbit?" than anything else. The imagery pales in comparison to recent movies like "The Fall," which does not rely on animation or CGI (much).The other main problem is the story. Being coy or unclear is not a substitute for philosophical depth or profound thought. Whether you take the story as allegory, metaphor, or parable, it just doesn't have anything to say. Furthermore, the few things that it tries to say (about choice, about sacrifice, about human nature) are pretty simplistic and (I believe) either debatable or demonstrably untrue. It's just that Gilliam has chosen to roll them up in a sweet eye-candy coating. As has been said about some small towns, "There's no THERE there." Finally, I have to mention that I HOPE that Gilliam's intent was not to write a parable about his experiences in making films. (Many people have spent a great deal of time working this out on different forums.) If it IS about his experience with getting his films made, then I have lost a great deal of respect for him. There are a great many films out there about the film-making (artistic) experience is like, but this isn't one of them. And simply thinking that, because YOU (the film-maker) believe your films have something to say and are significant artistic expressions, doesn't make them intrinsically good or artistic. Lots of people have profound thoughts and ideas to express, but it doesn't mean that the person who has the background or funding or graphic artistry to express such ideas actually has anything worth expressing.This film is not worthless, but it is fundamentally empty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vague Plot Where Things Kind Of Just Happened Without Thought Or Explanation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" looked like a film that I would really enjoy. Once it began it also felt like one that I would really enjoy. However, while in the theater and being in the middle of the film, I was no longer sure if this was indeed a film that I really liked. I held out hope until the end, but once it concluded I was left with a bit of an empty feeling.I get where they were going with this film. Yes it was confusing at times, but I did understand it. The problem is that the story seemed to go from point A to point C to point E without ever hitting points B or D. For example, Tony hooked up with the others and then all of a sudden understood and knew all there was to know about the imaginarium. There should have been more explanation of the bet as well. Okay, I understand that both entities are after five souls, but how do they acquire them? What does it mean to get the souls? As the movie progresses we can kind of see what it entails, but we are really left guessing. That seemed to be the real downfall with the movie as a whole: lack of explanation and continuity. I did rate this a tad above average because you could gather what was going on (though it was vague throughout most of the movie) and because it looked very nice, but this movie really should have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pandemonium of Doctor Gilliam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Doctor Parnassus runs a show of some sorts traveling in an ancient stage coach pulled by horses. He has lost a bet to the devil which obligates him to give away his daughter when she turns 16. The movie starts out quite impressively and witty, but quickly morphs into an excruciating mess of harrowing scenes and maniacal acting. If there was a plot to speak of at the beginning, don't bother looking for it after the 30 minute mark. Who was it that said that movies need some type of outline, some coherent narrative structure or something to keep all the separate parts together? Why bother with that when you've got all this entropy to explore! Another self indulgent atrocity from Mr. Gilliam who seems determined on making absolutely sure that no one in their right minds will ever provide him with funding again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ironically, the plot and characters are as elusive as the Imaginarium itself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gilliam's strength, as always, is in having the ability to project the craziest depths of his imagination on to the big screen and this film provides the ideal platform for him to showcase his stunning visual conceptions. The 'Imaginarium' itself is a spectacle of fabulous colours, wonderfully bizarre landscapes and alluring visions; each personal to whoever enters through the magical mirror of Dr. Parnassus' mysterious travelling sideshow.On the face of it, this vague idea along with an unparalleled cast sounds like it could be a winning concept for another masterpiece from acclaimed filmmaker Terry Gilliam (Twelve Monkeys, The Fisher King, Brazil, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas), but I think it lacks the substance to make it a winner. Having said this, credit should be duly given to Gilliam, as the sudden death of Heath Ledger before filming had finished meant that some of the script had to be rewritten and other actors drafted in to complete Ledger's part (Depp, Law and Farrell).The plot is hazy and with so much going on throughout it is very difficult to summarise. Dr. Parnassus (Plummer) is accompanied on his travels by his 15 year old daughter, Valentina (played very well, actually, by model-turned-actress Lily Cole). They are joined on the road by two more assistants; the somewhat irritating, yet harmless character of Anton (Andrew Garfield) and Parnassus' "number two", Percy (Troyer). Parnassus possesses the extraordinary power to invite people into their own imaginations through the main attraction that is the Imaginarium, which appears to be a completely ordinary two-sided mirror from the outside. Once inside, however, people are enticed one way and another and eventually, required to choose their fate. Heath Ledger effortlessly plays Tony, an ambiguous, enigmatic character who brings charisma and charm to the failing sideshow. It is very much a supporting role and he turns up towards the second half of the film. Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law each bring an interesting dynamic to the character, even though they feature only for short spaces of time within the Imaginarium.I would like to watch this film several times more before making my mind up completely as to whether I like it or not; but the main reason that I wouldn't put this amongst Gilliam's best is that it is quite slow-moving in places, where Gilliam seems to have gotten so carried away with his imagination-land that some of the other scenes are lacking focus. It is also difficult to feel any empathy or emotion for the characters, because even with some excellent performances ? particularly Plummer as Parnassus himself ? there are no distinct personalities to love or hate. In this sense, it is quite possible that this will appeal to cult fans of his niche film-making style. In any case, it is absolutely essential when watching this film that you abandon the desire for a plot in any conventional sense of the word and accept that, in order to appreciate it, your imagination must take over?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imaginarium of Terry Gilliam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film interesting and visually stunning, but flawed. At least one of the flaws cannot be attributed to faulty writing/production, but several others can be. For example, there is nothing new or original in the story: it is a straightforward retelling of Faust, the man who makes a pact with the devil and discovers that the devil is smarter and has all the time in the universe to prove it. The ideas of a man who asks for immortality but neglects to ask for eternal youth, and of a child born with a curse on her because of a prior wager her father has made with divine powers to further his own interests, are taken straight out of Greek mythology. Still, one could do worse than borrow from Goethe and Greek mythology. The movie weaves in and out of mundane reality (the traveling freak show in modern England) and schizophrenic hallucinogenic scenes inside the Imaginarium, which is the carnival attraction into which Dr. P lures potential sacrificial victims in his attempt to outwit the devil. The scenes inside the Imaginarium show what happens when you give an ex-Python unlimited access to digital effects: quite stunning, but having little to do with the story. They show the fantasy of Gilliam running wild on a huge budget, more than effectively advancing the story of Dr. P and his accursed daughter. I ask myself what a 1930s producer/director, Fritz Lang or Tod Browning for example, might have done with this story and these characters, but without the digital effects- -the story might have benefited from leaving the hallucinogenic details more to the imagination of the viewer than brow-beating us with a pixel- barrage of details. The real horror of what Dr. P is doing is masked by the almost Dr. Seussian silliness of the visual effects (dancing policemen??): Dr. P is luring souls to eternal damnation in an attempt to free his daughter from a wager he made centuries ago. Dr. P is, in essence, trading in human souls. Dr. P himself is immortal, but his daughter is not, and time is running out for her; the horror of her situation, and the evil Dr. P is willing to perpetrate to undo the effects of his own damnable wager, could certainly have been ratcheted up by more subtle means than Gilliam employs here.The reality scenes sometimes interweave with the fantastical ones in schizophrenic confusion, indicating, so I suppose, Dr. P's own tenuous grasp on reality. The schizophrenic quality of the film is enhanced by the fact that several different actors play the part of one of the main characters, Tony. I ask myself whether any producer/director would have chosen this as his preferred mechanism to unfold this story, and the answer I come up with is, "no". It is a trick which doesn't quite work for this story; though it did work for "I'm Not There" (no one could play Bob Dylan). The film just barely manages to make the trick plausible by implying that the differences in the character's appearance are due to the perspectives of the different people who perceive that character within the Imaginarium. OK, it was made necessary by the death of the actor in the middle of production, otherwise the film would not have gone public; I can see that Gilliam made the best of terribly unfortunate circumstances. But it is still a dubious trick.The casting is excellent: Plummer is entirely convincing as the world- weary Faustian character, Miss Cole acquits herself well as the girl clueless as to her own impending doom, and Waits is superb as the devil. If I hadn't seen any other film with Heath Ledger in it, I would not have thought him an especially gifted actor based solely on this performance; maybe if he had completed the film, it would have shown his true abilities.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" is the type of movie you have to watch to fully grasp, because words hardly do it justice. And this is exactly what you'd expect to come from the imagination of director Terry Gilliam; something that is so odd and bizarre, yet so stunningly beautiful and coherent at the same time. It is like a surreal mixture of "Alice in Wonderland", "The Chronicles of Narnia", "Monty Python" and "Harry Potter" all rolled into one fabulous mixture.Not only does it have a great storyline, but "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" is also accompanied by fabulous acting performances by those cast for the various roles. And you have some really big names, talented actors and actresses cast for this movie. But even more so, it is accompanied by some really incredible visual effects and ideas.And the costumes, wow! Those alone are enough to watch the movie, it was nothing short of spectacular.That being said, it is perhaps a fact that this movie is not suitable for just anyone. I am sure that the oddity and absurdity of it will have some people disapproving. I, however, was drawn in and was enjoying every single minute of the approximate 2 hours the movie ran for."The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" is truly a movie that you should give a chance and watch it if you haven't already seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stories Must Be Told, But The Truth Must Be Told As Well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot in Terry Gilliam's manic eleventh film is typically all-consuming, all across the board but there's a foundation, I think. His far-out creations in character, costumes and CGI effects, all with his charming trademark textural density, are given purpose by a story that necessitates alternating dimensions. Features of this story were required by the death of Heath Ledger halfway into the filming, although the state of the narrative itself I imagine was intact from square one. It concerns an oddball, boilerplate traveling show that unravels out of a shabby old camper in dilapidated corners of London populated largely by lushes and freaks. Comprising the show is the fine and enduring talent that is Christopher Plummer, in the form of the astronomically old Parnassus, squatting mysteriously on a stool while his id, Anton, played by decent new face Andrew Garfield; his daughter and his agitated midget played inevitably by Verne Troyer, perform for a loudmouth posse of beer buddies.Percy and Anton save the life of a man hanging from a bridge. Why they can do this is safely not described. The man on the rope is Heath Ledger. That's right. He gets in on the traveling wagon performance, is repulsed by its primitive style and recommends making it more state-of-the-art. Why it's so flimsy is because Parnassus is several hundred years old, having made a deal with the devil, played typically by Tom Waits, to live eternally as long as Satan can take Valentina when she turns 16. So you have to concede that Parnassus took his own sweet old time procreating. But naturally he wants out of the deal. I always did feel like Satan must often run into default risks.Tony, it unravels, can access or summon or manipulate or make up odd dimensions on the other side of a mirror on the crummy footlights. In these dimensions, anything goes, which is invariably what Gilliam favors. CGI lets the filmmaker and his designers to go crazy, which they consciously do with vigorous fervor, and some astonishing imagery appears. I think Ledger was supposed to be the master of all of these worlds. Alas, Gilliam evidently finished filming all the outer-world London scenes, Ledger returned to New York for R&amp;R, and after that came tragedy. True to Gilliam's filmography's most prevalent thread of fantasy as escape from reality but carried by an air of loss, he juxtaposed him by casting Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law as the Tonys of Imaginariums Nos. 1 through 3 and not elaborating further, as in fact with Imaginariums, that's not necessary. Depp looks the most like Ledger, although it's an ironic feeling of mine that Farrell steals the role. In a sense, the finished product is rather serendipitous in its tragedy, as in most of Gilliam's films, fantasy is treated as creative and imaginative escape from reality, but it also carries with it an atmosphere of loss. This often evokes a violent and sudden response, as is the case with the presence of the humongous squashing foot crashing down that appears in the Python credits he animated.My dilemma with Gilliam's films, which nonetheless inventively combine the Gothic and romantic, is that, while I don't need A-B-C, Act 1-2-3, I do somewhat prefer having some idea of a film's own conditions. You get the feeling that if a creative idea hits Gilliam, he finds himself at liberty to seize and squeeze it for all the juice it can drain, which is good, though often going not just for broke but for overdraft fees. Almost invariably longing to like Gilliam more than I do, I went out of my way to see Doctor Parnassus essentially to be confounded. Gilliam has never been guilty of the crime of being on auto-pilot. But a good deal of his movies are an acquired taste.Now what I see is a company of seasoned actors sportingly attempting to maintain their sanity while all around are losing theirs. Can it be easy to play one-third of a master of one-third of a capricious fantasy realm? You only have to dive in. Ledger himself---who makes Tony comparatively down-to-earth in the "real" world, which is of course intentional---must have been ready to do the same and would have given the plot more cohesion. Nevertheless, this is without a doubt an Imaginarium. The best angle is to sit there and let it wash over you. Get caught up in the present-tense much in a way like reading a Kurt Vonnegut book, not worrying so much about hearkening back to the beginning or guessing the end, because at any rate you can't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heath Ledger's last film. Full of fantasy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the talented and quirky Terry Gilliam, a morality tale of sorts. Special effects galore and the last work on film of Heath Ledger. The mysterious Doctor Parnassus(Christopher Plummer)and his traveling Imaginarium show is the subject of amazement and wonder. The old doctor has reasons to worry about a deal he made with the Devil himself many centuries ago. Parnassus in hopes of endless mortality, made a wager with the devilish Mr. Nick(Tom Waits). The two compete to seduce five souls and the prize being Parnassus' first born upon the age of sixteen. The doctor's daughter Valentina(Lily Cole)is just a few days short of the age of "being legal". A strange man named Tony(Ledger)appears and sure seems like he is aiding the old man save his daughter. But who really wins and who loses what? Ledger would suddenly die before completion of the film, so Gilliam takes the offer of Johnny Deep, Jude Law and Colin Farrell to play alternate versions of Tony when trapped in the Imaginarium. A fantastic and magical visual that carries a PG-13 rating. You will find yourself wanting to watch this movie again just to take in what you might have missed. The screen does stay pretty busy and it is full of fantasy. Also in the cast: Verne Troyer, Andrew Garfield, Michael Eklund and Johnny Harris.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The imagination of Terry Gilliam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is an interesting film. Aside from the peculiar circumstance that Gilliam found himself in, the story is about an ageless man, Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer), whose dealings with the devil have left him on an endless journey for love, happiness, and souls. He, along with his daughter Valentina (Lily Cole), assistant Percy (Verne Troyer), and actor Anton (Andrew Garfield), tour from place to place looking for an audience to show the wondrous powers of Doctor Parnassus and his Imaginarium.The Imaginarium is a place where the Doctor can better a person by showing him the goodness that is inside of them. It's not that easy though. Along the way there are temptations by Mr. Nick (Tom Waits), who is in a nutshell the devil. One must choose wisely in order to free themselves and their souls from eternal damnation.One night while traveling, they come across a man hanging (by his neck) from a bridge. The man (Heath Ledger) does not know his name or what he was doing there. They take him in and with his help try to attract a new audience for the show.I don't want to give away too much detail about the story because it's really not that important. Basically Doctor Parnassus tries to win a bet with Mr. Nick in order to save Valentina. The man (who is later named Tony) tries to help the Doctor win his bet, while wooing the lovely Valentina, who is the love interesting of Anton. It's a bit complicated but the film explains it more clearly than I can.I'm not sure if I would have liked the film as much had I not known what Gilliam went through in making the film come to life. The changes he had to make to the story are absolutely brilliant. The way he constructs the rules of the Imaginarium world make the story believable, though highly fantastical.The look of the film is very much like Gilliam's other works in the past like Time Bandits, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, Brazil, and there are a few things that are straight out of his animations from his Monty Python days. I love detailed and over the top landscapes and sets. They are vibrant and full of life. Cartoonish and surreal. This film succeeds where Peter Jackson's The Lovely Bones fails. The fantasy world looks like a fantasy world. Jackson made the afterlife look too fantastical. It should have looked more like the world in What Dreams May Come.The story is a bit loopy and some of the writing is a bit unpolished, but that's okay by me. I think you know that it is going to be a bit off after reading the title. I was completely absorbed into the story. It was weird, exciting, and completely off the wall zany. Gilliam has a way to make the most ludicrous things seem so natural and sort of necessary. I can always expect to be amazed by the look of his films.This isn't his best work. I would give that title to The Fisher King or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. It is a very odd and unique viewing experience that not every one will enjoy, but I think a lot of people can find something to grab hold of. This is the definition of a escapism in cinema.</fullReview>

An interesting tale of a leader traveling theater troupe who, having made a deal with the Devil, takes audience members through a magical mirror to explore their imaginations.'The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus' which received two nominations at the Academy-Awards this year, will ensure a huge fan following in the coming years.

His writing isn't, it has it's share of flaws, but he can be forgiven.In the acting department, Christopher Plummer is fantastic, he steals the show with a controlled performance. A true legend! Late Heath Ledger is, as always, good. Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law's appearance makes you moist eyed, as they did this role of their late friend Ledger. Oh boy, what a emotional moment!I recommend this film to everyone.... Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A double fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some fantasies are exactly what the description asserts, a story that is entirely out of the realm of logical human experience. Others may on the surface appear that way but have a logical explanation. This movie is a bit of both.The history and identity of the title protagonist is entirely the first. Doctor Parnassus (a marvellous Christopher Plummer), a couple of thousand years old (and cursed with immortality), has made a Faust-style deal with the devil personified in Mr Nick (Tom Waits). But the other half of the title, the Imaginarium, may well lend itself to a convincing explanation by Freudian logic.Underneath its cloak of grandiose mysticism, this movie has more melodrama than you may perhaps notice. The cheap travelling show comprising a quartet of the Doctor, his lovely teenage daughter, a gentle-hearted young man and angry dwarf could have gone on with its mundane existence had not been for their chance rescue of a man hanging from the London Bridge, gangland execution fashion. The man, resourceful and manipulative Tony, (Heath Ledger) loses no time in becoming the driving spirit of the show, engineering a complete modernizing transformation and at the same time winning the heart of the lass from the nice lad. The other plot line is the aforementioned deal whereby Mr Nick will gain possession of the lass when she turns sixteen.A vast majority of the audience probably know that this movie is the last screen appearance of the enormously talented, late Heath Ledger whose tragic, accidental death made the completion of the movie an almost impossible task. Many would have also be aware that no less three A-list heartthrobs have come to director Terry Gilliam's (The Fisher King, Twelve Monkeys, The Brother Grimm) gallant rescue: Johnny Debb, Jude Law, Colin Farrell. But it wouldn't be until when the audience actually see the movie that they marvel at how well the scheme works, to the extent that it almost looks like the scheme has always been there, to enhance the star power of the movie for the box office. (I understand that this is not the case and the original intention is for Heath Ledger to play all the three alter-egos of the character Tony).The way the Imaginarium works is just like one of these freak show tents: the paying customer goes into the mysterious area inside (through a mirror, in this particular case) to experience whatever awaits them. The various fantasy world experienced by the customers can be interpreted as illusions induced by the good doctor, drawing out the depths of their desire and fear. Tony is the guide in the imaginary world, appearing in different personas to different people, hence the magnificent, beautiful trio of Debb, Law and Farrell. Moving towards the end of the movie, reality and illusion converge and blur so that the final destruction of the character Tony is filmed in the physical form of Farrell ? a sequence that Ledger never had a chance to complete filming. The end credit closes with a poignant caption that the film is an offer from "Heath Ledger and friends".This movies has received Oscar nominations for art direction and costume, well deserved not only for the colourful worlds in the Imaginarium, but also for the portrayal of the more deprived parts of London.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different and most certainly original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trippy fantasy confuses, baffles, delights, and entertains on every front.The trickiest part of starting this review is articulating what kind of a movie this is. And the closest answer to that is probably a mind bending fantasy which is not a million miles away, in style, from the Never Ending Story.The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus appears to be about the fortunes of a quirky travelling theatre show, a stage drawn by horses on which the resident actors play fantasy roles to entertain their audiences every night.What emerges quickly though is that through the mirror on the stage, with more than a nod to the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, is a surreal mind-bending reality where the rules of planet earth no longer apply.Add to that the main plot development of Heath Ledger's Tony who joins the crew but appears to have a mysterious past and you have a recipe for an intriguing story.It goes without saying that the star of this tale is literally its imagination - special effects galore create a breathtaking world of surrealism and creative ingenuity, behind that mirror lies a fantastical world.But the performances of Plummer, Ledger, Garfield and Cole (not to mention Troyer and the 3 cameos) are all uniformly excellent with Waits having a whale of a time as a dark foreboding figure lurking in the background who appears to have history with Plummer's Parnassus.Add to this direction which is fast paced, coherent, sharp, and well realised with wonderful cinematography and you have the makings of a very well conceived film.Yes, it is confusing, and in places absolutely mind melting, but it's not made as a date movie or for a bunch of high schoolers. It has a brain, and originality, and more than a touch of class.Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fantasy, best work of Gilliam in many years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming to see this with low expectations ? while I admire his inventiveness, I have never been much of a Terry Gilliam fan myself, and the word from the critics was not that good - I was very pleasantly surprised with this film. This entertaining and very imaginative fantasy starts with a traveling sideshow driving in a horse-drawn wagon through the seedier parts of a contemporary (if not very realistic) London. Heading the show is a very old wizard/psychic named Dr. Parnassus (veteran Christopher Plummer in a great performance) who promises the few members of the audience interested in them that if they cross a magic mirror, they will travel to a parallel world where their deepest fantasies rule (the "imaginarium" of the title), and where they will have to make a fateful choice about whether they want to follow good or evil. The show has little success (their forays into the magic portal tends to end badly for the audience), but in time the somewhat pathetic troupe (who also includes the beautiful teenage daughter of the wizard, a midget who is the sidekick of Dr. Parnassus, and a young assistant who is madly in love with the daughter) will see a change of fortune when they find and rescue a man hanging in a London bridge (Heath Ledger in his final performance before his untimely death). The man joins the troupe and claims to be an amnesiac, but eventually it will be found that he is a crook running from Russian gangsters from whom he took money. With time, we will also learn more of the back story of Dr. Parnassus: he was a monk who made a deal with the devil (impersonated wittily by Tom Waits) centuries ago: he gets to be immortal, but in exchange, he was to give her daughter to the devil when she turns 16. So you get the idea of the sort of convoluted plot here, but let me assure you that when you see it, you will find it very entertaining and less confusing than it sounds. An intelligent and unusual film, full of intriguing ideas, and helped by the fine performances, including that of Ledger: he died before shooting ended, so in his forays into the imaginary portal he is replaced by three different actors: Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus: What Goes Around, Comes Around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam, The mind behind the erratic and genius Fear and Loathing Las Vegas and Brazil, had his creative work cut out for him, when one of his stars and backbones passes away suddenly and quietly right in the middle of shooting of his latest film, The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus. Though with the passing of Heath Ledger, it gave Gilliam a chance to explore a different approach to explain the fanciful story that he had created, built entirely around a man and a bet.Like most of Gilliam's stories, to find the complete plot, you must delve deep and find it within yourself. The basic outline is centered on Dr. Parnassus (Christopher Plummer), an immortal holy man that has been in conflict with Mr. Nick, the embodiment of Satan (Tom Waits) to both collect and redeem souls throughout the course of life. Where Ledger's character falls, is something of an oddity, for he's found dangling under a bridge by Dr. Parnassus' daughter ----- and their traveling troupe. With the arrival of Tony (Ledger), Mr. Nick Brings up an ancient bet that unless Dr. Parnassus can save five souls in his imaginarium, then his daughter belongs to him.Spelling out the story is fanciful and tricky enough, yet to watch it unfold is a well-paced and lingering, allowing the viewer to slowly ponder over what is exactly going on and enjoy the overall well written comedy and spectacular sights that are in the imaginarium. But what is this magical place, full of color and CGI majesty? Simply it's the place where ones true self ? the things you most covet and treasure but may not need ? are shown, and you are given the choice to repent or live with your sin. Thankfully the movie never gets preachy, as easily as it could have gone in that direction.By all rights, the story itself could have been tightened up, to tie up loose ends and remove unneeded material ("He's upstairs"), yet it's obvious that the cause of most of the hitches due to the demise of Ledger. It was almost as if parts of the movie were left in as a homage to the departed actor, which in most cases wouldn't be a bad thing. However, when you have a movie that is so warped and mystical, plunging you directly into your imagination, those types of errors cannot be left. The same could be said for the three accompanying actors; Jude Law, Johnny Depp, and Colin Farrell. The trio was added into the script later, once changes needed to be made and shooting had to go on. To use them as other embodiments, "mirror-images" of Ledger in the Imaginarium. I have to say that as a whole, all three of them did a fantastic job of mimicking Ledger's mannerisms and patters, trying to truly be him without overshadowing. Though Law feel a little short ? being bland and underwritten overall - while Farrell rose a little higher ? almost perfectly mimicking Ledger from earlier scenes - all of them worked splendidly as a unit. Still the movie worked, even with its downfalls. The comedy and delivery in the way it was handled (subtle and indirect undertone) flowed effortlessly, again helping the pacing of the overall story. Which also helps this movie, in the end, give it one of the staples of a "what do you think?" ending. Much like "Donnie Darko" or "Memento," by the credit roll, no two opinions of the message or meaning will be the same, and that's perfect. Because as we all have learned growing up, happy endings are not guaranteed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dr. Parnassus A Unique Adventure With Good Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is a unique adventure with good performances from the cast by writer/director Terry Gilliam whose admirable in making this movie thats original and might not be for everyone but I for one thought it was decent. Perhaps not the best movie I've seen but I still enjoyed it for what the film was. I won't get to much into the plot because it's better to see this movie without knowing too much about it. Dr. Parnassus marks the last film you'll see the late Heath Ledger in who sadly passed away while making this in January of 2008. Ledger is great as always as the mysterious and charismatic stranger Tony who joins a traveling theater company that gives it's audiences more than they expected. Ledger's part is more of a supporting one and thats okay because he immerses himself into the role (just like he did with his other roles and as Batman's arch nemesis The Joker in 2008's blockbuster hit "The Dark Knight") and he turns in a very good performance none the less. He's actually in it more than I thought he was going to be. Ledger doesn't appear on screen until about 24 minutes into it and some maybe a bit shocked with his introduction into the story considering the first time we meet him he's hanging by his neck from a bridge. While watching though it you can't help but feel sad at least I did knowing this is the last movie you'll ever see him in because he really was such a chameleon. An extremely talented and gifted young actor who seemed to take his roles seriously, without taking himself too seriously and there's no doubt in my mind that he will sorely be missed. Rest in Peace Ledger. Christopher Plummer is equally impressive as the character of the title who makes a deal with the devil for powers and immortality. Plummer like Ledger becomes the character for the film and he turns in a solid performance as a man who tries to make up for past mistakes by beating the devil at his own game of bets. The rest of the relatively unknown cast including Lilly Cole, Andrew Garfield, Verne Troyer, and Tom Waits as the Devil are effective as the supporting characters who are at least developed to a point where you know a little bit about them. Waits does a good job as the Devil who gives the film some dark humor from time to time and he's clearly having fun playing Satan. Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell, and Jude Law play alternate versions of Tony when he enters the mirror into an imaginary world and all the three actors do an excellent job of making you believe it's the same character while putting their own little twists to the role. Depp has the smallest part of the three and his appearance is more like a cameo (he's only on screen for 1 maybe 2 minutes) but he still turns a solid performance. Colin Farrell and Jude Law have a little more to do and I feel both actors like Depp have done justice to the character Heath had created for the movie. Well done. This film maybe light on action but what it does offer is character development (Parnassus and Tony), some humor, drama, and solid performances by the cast. The film's pace was a little slow at times, some questions are never answered leaving them ambiguous, and the ending isn't quite what I expected but the exceptional performances by the cast (especially Ledger, Plummer, Depp, Law, Waits and Farrell) make up for it's few flaws. Overall The Imaginarium Of Doctor Parnassus is an original mystery adventure drama thats certainly worth the time to watch. It's different and a little weird but in a good way. So if you're a fan of Gilliam, the late Heath Ledger, Christopher Plummer, or anyone else in the cast than chances are you'll definitely enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Complex Film That Requires Multiple Viewings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great Doctor Parnassus, brilliant and immortal, is in a contest with the devil (Tom Waits)... their latest competition? Who can collect five souls first? The problem for Parnassus is that if he loses... he must give up his 16-year old daughter to the devil himself, losing the one thing he really, truly loves. But a new hope has fallen their way: Tony (Heath Ledger).I had mixed feelings on this film. I had wanted to see it for months, and I didn't really know what it was about. But the prospect of a new Terry Gilliam film had me enthralled, along with the checkerboard patterns the trailer showed. Ultimately, I did not get what I expected at all from this one, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but put me in a strange position. I had to judge a film from a false preconception.Even after leaving the film, I didn't know if I liked it. My friends were left in a similar condition. One later decided she didn't like it, another decided he did. A third is probably still perplexed. I'm slowly coming to a realization that I liked it, but would not rank it among Gilliam's best. I'm partial to "Twelve Monkeys", for example.I have to give them credit for the way Heath Ledger's character was used even after the actor died. And Tom Waits gave the performance of his career (outdoing his amazing run as Renfield in "Dracula"). I'm not really clear on why the daughter played such a central role, she was somewhat annoying and not really much of a "prize". And the animation left me feeling "eh"... I'm not big on animation, and I didn't feel it was used in the best way in some scenes.If you're a Gilliam fan, please check this one out. It's Heath Ledger, Jude Law and Johnny Depp, after all. And it beats the pants off of "Brothers Grimm". But don't forget the Gilliam classics, "Time Bandits" and "Brazil".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Cinema Magic. Terry Gilliam Is A True Ph.D. Of The Imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>wonderful movie. but then again i've loved all of Terry Gilliam's movie's. i don't find Gilliam to be indulgent or a acquired taste. i think he is always brilliant and provides the cinema with memorable fantasy with the same extraordinary skill that say, a Walt Disney or a Tim Burton does. how can anyone who contributed so much to the classic 'Monty Python' humor be an acquired taste? come on. TERRY GILLIAM IS CLASSIC CINEMA GOLD. period.anyone who doesn't delight in or 'get' Gilliam is acting like a bore. he has contributed so much and has been around for such a long time. how can anyone not marvel at films like 'Brazil', 'Munchausen', 'Fisher King', 'Jabberwocky', 'Brother's Grim', 'Fear and Loathing', just to name a few. i even loved the ill-fated 'Tideland' which everyone seemed to hate and i loved it. Terry Gilliam is imaginative fun and on a very adult, intellectual level. unlike Disney and Burton, who are for kids and families, Gilliam is pretty much Disney for adults.i really loved everything in this whimsical film and i hardly minded the substitution of different actors for the late Heath Ledger, even though it was noticeable.one of the best things about the film, however, was the really terrific, earthy, performance by the incredibly talented Verne Troyer. he should have gotten at least an Oscar nomination. i've always felt Troyer was an actor of great comic timing(the 'Austin Powers' movies prove that) but in 'Parnassus' Gilliam lets us see a more natural, down to earth side of Troyer that is both human and sympathetic without seeming like some 'OZ' like stereotype.there are so many themes in 'Parnassuss' that fascinate, mythology, death, dreams, and as the evolution of the dream show at the many malls ending at the upscale Leadham Market suggest, a all too real comment on consumerism. along with so much fantasy in Gilliam films is always the inclusion of reality. bravo Gilliam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and complex as only Gilliam can do it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is what could be called a modern fable or allegory. It isn't your traditional story where good triumphs over evil and everyone walks off into the sunset, neither is it your action film full of explosions and robots. It is something that not many films try to handle nowadays. Gilliam, though, is not your average director. And like a renaissance allegory, he presents us a visual and moral puzzle. The film as a whole is hard to fathom the first time around, it's not for your mainstream audience, rather for people who like the surreal or the puzzling. For that is exactly what this film is. One is reminded of another work of his, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen. Both have that sort of dream-like edge and ambiguous plot where you are not sure who is who, and when reality begins. In fact, he frequently causes us to question the boundaries between reality and dreams. The film itself floats as if it were a dream, and if visions of pearl necklaces wrapped around enormous high-heeled shoes don't cause you to question what is going on, than why don't you try to handle images of rivers turning into cobras, or ladders that reach into the sky. It isn't technically precocious or completely freaky, but Terry Gilliam has that rare knack for creating the most unusual imagery out of the most mundane things. You can't fight a Terry Gilliam film, he doesn't wait for the audience to catch up with him, and he doesn't care if you understand his work or not. It's alienating at times, but for those who delight in his fiendish puzzles, he can provide an intensely fascinating experience.Yet the surreal visuals and the puzzling complexities of the plot are not the only thing that can delight the eye of the soul. The actors keep gamely along with Gilliam's euphoric rushes. the plot may swivel in and out, round and round, but everyone keeps up. Christopher Plummer creates a combination monk/sage/magician/wino, who is usually drunk, and occasionally not as wise as you wish he was. Yet there is depth, the character is not very likable, none of the characters in this movie are, but you get the feeling they are real, and it is only a good actor working with a good script under a good director that can carry it off. Lily Cole, the model-turned-actress, who debuts in this movie, is Terry Gilliam's interpretation of a nymph, it's surprising a person would choose such a film for a debut, but she keeps along, and manages to pull off a fine acting job. So does Verne Troyer, of mini-me fame, who is the wise-guy, the voice of reason in this film, and Andrew Garfield as the careless idiot who nevertheless has a heart of gold, though he may not seem to have one. Tom Waits pulls of a cigar-smoking devil with a love for gambling, and a heart who like Gilliam, delights in puzzles. However, for many, the focus of the film is that it is Heath Ledger's final work. He has worked with Gilliam before (The Brothers Grimm), and he works well in these films. His character we first meet hanging from a bridge, which if that isn't weird enough, it only gets steadily more strange. His character seems nice at first, but by the end of the film we realize he is a selfish man who gets his just deserts. Depp, Law, and Farrell, Ledger's replacements, work well as his alter-egos. Farrell has the most to do, and he does his best with it, while Law and Depp act wacky enough, though don't get me wrong, the acting was superb. Overall, 10 for script, acting, story, visuals and everything else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No consistent storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not that this movie has bad actors, it is not that this movie has bad special effects, but to develop a consistent story line is quite a failure in this movie.The idea is very creative and promising: a world that is different then ours, a world where you have to face your good and bad sides. My expectancies wheren't very high, but although that this movie was one of the most disappointing for me.It looked like they changed the script after Ledger died. For me there was no clear idea about which direction the movie would go. I am sure the movie director did not had a clear idea to. There where to many directions, isolated scenes and moments in it which made me ask: why am I sitting here in this cinema.To bad the storyline went so diffuse, because it does not give you the feeling of 'getting into the movie' . Besides that it will be a movie that I soon forget. A missing chance for a wonderful and original idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heath Ledger will be better remembered for The Dark Knight than this movie, despite the fact that it features his last performance (incomplete, substituted by Depp, Law and Farrell).In fact in many ways Ledger is one of the least important elements here - the major feature to report on is that Terry Gilliam's visual imagination is still firing on all cylinders. It's a shame that the structure of the movie isn't a little better defined because there are points where it's far from clear who is doing what and why: the early part of the film, in particular, is fairly muddled. And that's a serious flaw in what, otherwise, would be a fairly special movie.I must single out Lily Cole. Prior to this my knowledge of her was limited to pictures of her as an angular clotheshorse, a shock of red hair surrounding an unusual face of huge eyes and doll-like features set in unsmiling grimness. And how wrong I was, in almost every significant way. She is given quite a big role here, with serious acting demands placed on her, and she comes through with flying colours. Her face is animated, her smile is beautiful, her body turns out to be far from stick-like, and her performance shows range and the promise of much to come. I am completely besotted and, from the way he films her, so is Gilliam.I was a little concerned over the age of Cole's character - it would not have affected the movie to have made her two years older so that any unsavoury paedophilia suggestions could have been avoided.This film is not perfect, but well worth a visit nevertheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The visuals and sets are elaborate but it's not quite enough to recommend a rather intriguing but wholly unremarkable film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In modern day London, a travelling circus called The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus invites people to enter a mirror whereby they are transported into their inner dream lives. The Imaginarium is made up of the guru Parnassus himself (Christopher Plummer), his daughter Valentina (Lily Cole) and a young man named Anton (Andrew Garfield). Parnassus is regularly taunted by a Lucifer-like character who calls himself Mr. Nick (Tom Waits) and it is revealed that Parnassus has made a wager with him. As the company is struggling to find an audience, they discover a man named Tony (Heath Ledger) who is being hanged under a bridge. They rescue him and for saving his life Tony helps the company find an audience.The last film of Heath Ledger's career is dedicated to him as a film made by his friends. Yet as with a number of Terry Gilliam's films, this is a visually extravagant title, undermined with a poorly told narrative and illogical plotting. On the whole, it is more likely to be remembered for its daring casting approach of using three other actors ? Jude Law, Colin Farrell and Johnny Depp ? to play Tony, given that Ledger died before the film could be completed. Certainly, the film opens promisingly enough. The contrast of the Victorian-like architecture and the Imaginarian wagon is juxatoposed against the thumping bass sounds of a London nightclub, allowing for a clever hook. The audience is forced to think twice about where this film is actually set and thus the Imaginarium is viewed as an anachronism. Unfortunately, for much of its duration the film doesn't seem to have an idea of where it is heading, leaving us to wonder just what is going on. A flashback to when Parnassus met Mr Nick results in a truly bizarre conversation about the way storytelling makes the world continue, while the eventual revelation about the wager that Pernassus has made with him, never has a sense of emotion or urgency. Similarly, Anton and Valentina's relationship ? one of the more recognisable elements of the film, is never really developed despite the obvious implications that he likes her and becomes jealous when she is around other men. There are a lot of ideas in this film, but it feels extremely unclear and incoherent about what Gilliam is trying to say.Though thematically it is a failure, the film is still an exciting visual experience due to some really magical sets, costumes and art direction. The imagined world behind the mirror is a real sight to behold on the big screen. A moment where a giant head of a bobby officer bursts from the ground echoes the Trojan from Monty Python, while the emergence of a massive snake from a river with the face of Mr. Nick is strange but also extremely amazing to watch. Though as beautiful as these moments are, it is somewhat difficult to visualise a number of these scenes as an insight into a person's own mind or their desires though, if this is what was intended. Again, it is just not quite clear what was meant to be happening in the film.Those that were amazed by Ledger's iconic performance in The Dark Knight and are expecting something of the same magnitude are likely to be disappointed as the script has not characterised Ledger's role as thoroughly as it could have. Tony never comes across as someone particularly interesting or as someone we really come to know. Out of the other three actors playing Tony, Depp has the briefest part, so short it almost borders on being a cameo. Regardless, it must be questioned whether someone like Depp, with such natural charisma, could have brought something more magical to this strange role if he had been the star of the film himself. Colin Farrell has perhaps the edgiest transformation of Tony but this only occurs right at the very end of the film. Tom Waits is a real surprise however, excellent as Mr. Nick with an extremely fitting raspy voice for his character, while Lily Cole is mesmerizingly beautiful as Valentina.The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is certainly not as awful as Gilliam's Tideland. It is quite an ambitious film, which outside of its own narrative, holds a sentimental value for the memory of Ledger. While you can certainly appreciate the efforts of his colleagues to complete this film for him, the rest of the film is still undermined by lousy storytelling and too many unanswered questions. The visuals and sets are elaborate but it's not quite enough to recommend a rather intriguing but wholly unremarkable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A huge disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Im gonna tell the truth immediately: The movie is really, really bad. Yes, it's the last movie of Heath Ledger and he did a great job in 'The Dark Knight', but he can not save the movie. I had high hopes when i saw the cast, almost all my favorite actors star in it (Depp, Law, Farell).. But even they can do very little to make the watching enjoyable.I saw this film as a pre-premiere during a festival in Amsterdam and right from the beginning i was shocked by the poor quality of effects. They look like they were rendered by a 1990 computer and they didn't have any imagination at all. This might be forgivable for some art-house films, but since this is a big budget movie on which the story depends on the effects (most of half takes place inside the imagination of Dr Parnassus) it makes the movie almost unwatchable.Also the movie lacks any sort of coherence whatsoever. There is no general style or vision on how to handle the imagination theme, it is simply a random collection of different 3d images. I read some reviews in which people praise the unmatched imagination of the director. If it's so unmatched, how come EVERY dream sequence feels like something we have already seen before. Sometimes the sequences take place inside a supposedly scary forest. A forest not very different from the standard horror movie (dark, steamy.. you know the routine). Sometimes in a looney tunes kinda setting. Yes, literally a looney tunes setting that you see in cartoons such as Roadrunner, only rendered in 3d. Wow, what a groundbreaking imagination this man has..This randomness even affects the story and dialogue. There are points where the movie tries to teach us serious cliché lessons about love and life/death and then moments later the dialogue and atmosphere is like your watching a children's cartoon. Hell, the part where a bunch of policemen suddenly started doing a musical routine completely killed it for me.Usually I am a big fan of original movies that are the product of an imaginative director (Pan's Labyrinth, Amelie or the recent Moon), but if you value a gripping story to come with crazy special effects, then steer away from this as far as you can.Watch The Dark Knight instead again to see Heath Ledger at his best.. This movie does him no justice. R.I.P Heath Ledger</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terry Gilliam finally back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is really a shame, that Heath Ledger has left this world. Seeing him in this movie and his performance in the Batman movie (The Dark Knight), you really wish you could see him in more movies. Which of course will not happen. We can even be glad that we have the chance to watch his performance on this movie.Heath Ledger had shot most of his scenes already, before he passed away. Terry Gilliam got convinced by the crew and the cast of this film, that he should continue in Memory of Heath L. And so he came up with a few new ideas, how this movie should be. And if you have no idea about Heath Ledger passing away and that whole story, you might even think the movie was planned like that from the get go.It's a crazy world, that Terry shows us, which won't answer many questions at the beginning and will leave with a few at the end. An end, that is really great and comes pretty close to the "Brazil" brilliance. The whole movie seems like a comeback. Not that Terry G. was gone, but his Grimm Brothers movie did hurt his reputation.After this excruciating experience (it took quite a few years from start to finish), Terry is planning to finally film one of his dream projects. Don Quixote! Johnny Depp will not play the lead (he was cast back when Terry tried and couldn't finish, watch "Lost in La Mancha", a great documentary about the "Un-making" of that movie) and it's not out yet, who will play the lead role. Heath Ledger would have been great ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ledger Would Have Been Proud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty good film on many different levels. It's your usual stuff from Terry Gilliam and he's very thought provoking on a completely different level. Heath Ledger would have been proud of this film and I believe he would have gotten a kick from it. Ledger's performance is fantastic and really aside from everything else that's going on in the movie, the most interesting theme going on in the film is Ledger's character. Ledger plays the outside of the character while the other actors play the inside of him. Ledger plays the character as a very likable guy, as if he's the good guy in the film, which it comes as kind of a shock to find out how grotesque his character is on the inside(And that's why the movie and character work because of Ledger playing the character as a good guy). Ledger's character is a great metaphor for life on how people put up fronts and as you get to know them more and more, certain layers start peeling off and you get to see them more for who they really are, and Ledger's character is an absolute brilliant example and study of this truth. It's brought together even more complete and complex by(which Gilliam had too)adding the performances of Depp, Law and Farrell as the Ledger character as well(again, as the inside of the character they play). What's brilliant is, once the movie is over, you go back in your mind and/or you watch it again and you say 'Okay so that was his intention there' and 'That's why he asked that question there' and 'That's why he seemed so nice and kind here and there because of his motives and/or agenda in the long run.'(in Regards to the Ledger character). And the way each actor plays Ledger's character is perfect for the movie. Depp shows the initial stages of who Ledgers character really is, then another layer is peeled off and we see more of his scheming from Law, and then finally it's all peeled off to the core of who's Ledger's character really is in the inside, with Farrell's brilliant performance. It's a fascinating trick, and you don't quite understand the whole nature of it until Farrell(Ledger's character) is in the Gondola with Valentina and her inside is happy, colorful, she wants love and romance from him and he's kind of being a sourpuss about it. Then all of the sudden everything gets dark and you see the orphan and you truly realize how dark and bad Ledger's character really is. (Even the Devil, played brilliantly as well by Tom Waits, has more of a heart). But the brilliance of the movie is that it doesn't give this fact away until the end of the film of how 'evil' Ledger's character really is. And as in life, almost every human being, in some sort of way, has a front, a show that they put on, but on the inside, down to the core of their inside, who really knows who they are or what they're about, and this movie is a brilliant psychological study of that. A Great film, a must see for Ledger's performance/and the other 3 performances that bring his character fully to life. Also worth a look for Tom Waits too. Miss you Heath, you were a great and inspiring actor to watch. You did some terrific work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird and a bit messy, but interesting to say the least</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(www.plasticpals.com) Considering he lost one of his actors during production, it's amazing that Terry Gilliam managed to complete Dr. Parnassus at all. He's had a string of bad luck that left his version of Don Quixote incomplete, and then the studio decided to release this film so close to the juggernaut Avatar.Like his other films it is a bit messy and confusing at times, as he catapults the characters into realms of their own imagining. This amazing feat is possible thanks to the titular Imaginarium, a key to the story and how the film manages to continue in spite of Ledger's death; his character takes on different appearances when inside of it. Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell make cameos to fill in the gaps, and the transitions from one to the other seem quite natural given the Imaginarium's power.The problem is that the Doctor, played to a T by Christopher Plummer, made a pact with the devil (Tom Waits) to give his firstborn child in exchange for the love of a beautiful young woman. The devil fulfills his part of the bargain and Parnassus marries her and they have a child. When the devil returns 16 years later to collect his prize, Parnassus isn't ready to give up his doll-like daughter Valentina (Lily Cole). The two decide to settle the issue through a bet ? whoever wins over 5 souls in the following days will decide the girl's fate. There's a bit of a muddled love triangle going on between Valentina, a suitor from the theater troupe to which they all belong, and Tony (Heath Ledger); an amnesiac who tags along and proves a natural.The adventures they share (both inside and outside of the Imaginarium) are appropriately surreal, and may warrant a second viewing just to sort it all out. It's interesting to see Gilliam working so much with computer graphics, especially in a film that speaks from the heart about the importance of story-telling and imagination without becoming preachy or feeling corny. It does seem to end in a very different direction than it foreshadows, perhaps due to the logistics of working around Ledger's absence, but it works and is an incredibly original film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning, incredible film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" centers around the title character (Christopher Plummer) and his band of carnies that go from town to town setting up their side show. Truth be told, the side show is just a cover for a Battle of Souls between Dr. Parnassus and Satan. The two have made a bet (or a series of bets), the wager being the soul of Valentina (Lily Cole), Parnassus' daughter. With the end of the bet at hand, the group comes across Tony (Heath Ledger), a young man on the brink of death who has the gift of persuasion. Before long business is booming but the group begins to question Tony's motives. The deadline with the Devil draws near, however, which sets off a chain of events that pit Parnassus, Tony, and Satan against each other in a final showdown.Let's just get this out of the way up front: "Parnassus" is a freaking weird film. It is NOT for everyone. I myself ignored it for a while, assuming it wasn't for me. Terry Gilliam is one of the best, most gifted directors in the industry and I really mean that. Very few people can take a vision to the screen the way he does. With that said, however, his films are SUPER weird. And if you haven't seen a Gilliam movie then you can't understand what I mean. He has a style completely all his own and more often than not, it's too weird even for my slightly strange tastes. So take my statement of this not being for everyone seriously when considering the next paragraph."Parnassus" is a magnificent film. Gilliam's script is inspired and pulls some original content from a story that's been told a number of times. The visuals are outlandish, of course, but fantastic and work with the story as opposed to overshadowing it. The performances, however, are the bread and butter here, especially those of Plummer, Ledger, and Tom Waits. Question: is Christopher Plummer the most underrated actor of our time? Answer: Yes, yes he is. The guy brings the noise to every single role. Dr. Parnassus is a doubtful, broken, and desperate man, yet good to his very core, and Plummer brings all of that and more. Likewise, Ledger shows some serious talent in what was to be his final performance. Waits is the equal, if not the superior, to them both, however. His version of Satan is smooth, debonair, and terrifyingly appealing. Waits steals every scene he's in and that's a serious compliment given who he's stacked up against.In addition to all of this, the finishing of the film is a stroke of genius. As you may or may not know, Ledger died in the middle of production. Rather than starting over or scraping the project entirely, Gilliam cast Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Ferrell in Ledger's place. Gilliam weaves these faces and the changes into his story, making it a plot point within the movie rather than asking us to simply suspend reality and ignore the change in appearance given the circumstance. A masterful finishing touch in my opinion. In the end, "Parnassus" is that rare film that grows on you. While watching I thought it was solid, a day later I described it as very good, and now, a week or so removed, I feel it borders on great. A truly, truly special film.Check out my site: www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Against The Odds, Gilliam Has Done It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gilliam is back with another fantastic imaginative piece of cinema. Kudos to the filmmaker for finishing the film against all odds. Due to the untimely death of lead actor Heath Ledger midway through filming, production had been halted. Then Gilliam came up with an inventive idea to complete the film (which lead to the casting of Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell).Even though the special effects aren't entirely first rate, Gilliam's imaginarium world remains visually dazzling. With some amazing cinematography and stunning art direction, the film manages to keep the viewer mesmerized. The writing too is quite good. The dialogues are witty and the quirky and funny characters are well-developed. I only felt that Gilliam was trying to tackle too many things for which there wasn't enough space and consequently, the story ends up lacking in development.Christopher Plummer is outstanding as the 1000 year old master of theatre who seeks salvation. He's both impressively restrained and physical. This is the right swansong for Heath Ledger who delivers a charming performance and his male counterparts pay good tribute to him. Andrew Garfield is brilliant in a role that suits him to the T. Lily Cole is competent.Flawed it may be but 'The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus' is definitely worth the viewing for its visual inventiveness, quirkiness, humour and high entertainment value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but full of holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie on television last night. I had never heard anything about it. Its entertainment value was above-par. I would say a 9/10. Seemed very similar to Pan's Labyrinth from an entertainment perspective. However, the storyline had so many unexplainable holes in it, it was kind of a turn-off. Storyline gets a 4/10. For example, there were at least a few souls that entered the mirror, that didn't count as a "soul tally" for either Dr. P or the devil, even though their motives looked to be pure. Also, the midget's immortality was never explained, nor was his dedication to Dr. P. However, I think the draw of this movie is quite evident from the fact that I continued to watch it for 2 hours, even though there were glaring holes in the storyline that were never resolved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a whole lot of symbolism you have to crack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was crazy. Don't get me wrong, though. It was crazy in a good way. This movie plays with your imagination. We're transported into different worlds- inside the Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. I enjoyed seeing the different places. All the color that was in it and etc. It really reminded me of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' with the delicious candy and the beautiful edible rivers- only obviously, this film was a whole lot crazier.This movie is about Doctor Parnassus who has to give up his daughter, Valentina, on her 16th birthday to the devil, after losing a bet. But the devil gives Parnassus a chance to stop this by making ANOTHER bet- the first one to get five souls wins and gets to have Valentina.The 4 stars that I gave in the rating was for the settings and the tinge of magic and fantasy that the movie gave. The last star is for the cast and crew. I admit that I've never heard of this movie before. But after watching one of Ledger's films, I got curious about his career and saw that this was the last film that he made, so I decided to watch it. It's impressive how they managed to make this movie still work even after the main actor passed away. It made me think about the 'Harry Potter' franchise and how they would handle it if one of their main characters died. The whole cast and crew did a terribly wonderful job even after the very unfortunate tragedy that they experienced. The other 3 Tonys did a wonderful job. Especially Johnny Depp. I also thought that it was wonderful and selfless for Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Collin Ferrel to donate their earnings to Heath's daughter. Once again, kudos to the cast and crew!Now for this movie's big failure. After the film, I asked myself, "What just happened?" There were so many things happening. I couldn't understand everything. And judging from the board and other reviews, I'm not the only one. It was just too confusing. I think it was the symbolism that made viewers kind of confused. Up until now, I still have so many questions. But I won't bother researching on them anymore, since most people's answers are, "It's left up to your imagination." I'm a fan of open ending movies, but this one was just crazy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful movie, but secrets destroys everything?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Secrets destroys everything? ? even in the movies. This is in many ways a spectacular movie. Partly set in the world of our own fantasies, also known as the Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus, to see this movie is to enter an Imaginarium in itself where anything is possible. As always there is a struggle between good and evil, where our own imagination can set us free, and beat evil. Dr Parnassus wants to help us with this, but at the same time he has made a bet with the Devil, and struggles to keep his own daughter, Valentina, out of the Devil's hands. Of course he has told her nothing of this, and she secretly dreams of a normal family. And stage hand Anton is secretly in love with her. Because of all these secrets, their family is falling apart. Unfortunately, so is the movie. It is just too frustrating to see these, to us at least, well known secrets. I just wished the characters would spit it out, and was annoyed with most of them when they didn't and acted quite stupid because of it.Along the way they rescue and recruits the mysterious character Tony. Along with the quickly approaching deadline of Parnassus' last bet with the Devil, Valentina's 16th birthday, he sets everything in motion. Finally. But he has too many secrets himself.In many ways it is a wonderful movie, in the way that you never really know what to expect next. Anything can happen, and frequently does, in the Imaginarium. That is what keeps interest in the movie, that and the tragic events that surrounds the movie.Gilliam must have faced a great difficulty as writer and director with Ledgers tragic death. Apart from the real loss, he was now missing one of the leads in an unfinished movie. But some real clever rewrites and the efforts by Depp, Law and Farrell respectively, the story actually survives. And out of it came a good movie. But with the talent both in front of and behind the camera, I feel that it could have been much more. But the frustrating, annoying traits in the characters, in fact too much stereotypes in a story based upon unlimited imagination, destroys too much. I couldn't fully enjoy the story as it should be?6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Multi-layered dream.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, let me put things straight first... if you're looking for an entertaining, unprovocative, just-to-pass-the-time flick, this is certainly not the one for you. Terry Gilliam again creates a very mind-provoking, highly symbolic story that might probably take you some time to fully grasp. The movie works on different layers, and with each layer it digs deeper into existential themes such as good Vs evil, religion, and destiny. For example, on one level Doctor Parnassus represents the god figure and his imaginarium is nothing but the real world which is full of choices and temptations. His show is religion; the stories which have to be told to keep the balance of the universe. However, it is clear that no one is longer attracted to his show (i.e. religion) because it looks ancient and old-fashioned as Tony observed. On another level, Doctor Parnassus is the representative of Man himself who always seeks immortality and is instantly lured into wagers and bets with the devil. Christopher Plummer and Heath Ledger give unique and haunting performances. I also like the twist added to the movie after Ledger's death to justify the special appearance of Depp, Farrell and Law who added a lot with their robust presence. Nevertheless, the film is not totally flawless. There are some letdowns that will stand in the way of truly enjoying the experience. The movie is extremely slow-paced that you can't help feeling bored sometimes. Besides, the colorful and imaginary scenery is not that beautiful; it terribly lacks attraction and vigor. All in all, I did enjoy the movie, not as expected though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bizarre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To sum this film up in one term, i would have to say; "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" is a very BIZARRE film. No surprises there as it is written and Directed by Monty Python's own crazy genius, Terry Gilliam.The film is dark yet funny at the same time. The story is fairly simple and the special effects, though not exactly mind blowing are feeling decent as well. The imaginarium scenes are very dream-like and I think if terry Gilliam accomplished anything from this film - it is surely the perfect bizarre atmosphere and feelings of dreams or in other cases, nightmares.Most of the cast is great including the late, great Heath Ledger (though not his best role) as the main character of Tony. The other versions of Tony most notably Depp, were sufficient (though not brilliant) in their own portrayals of the imaginarium versions of Heath Ledger's character. Same can't be said however for Colin Farrell's portrayal as to put it as nicely as i can, was just out of place! He doesn't look anything like the other Tony's and he seemed like a completely different character which is a shame as he is the last version of Tony to appear in the film and made me feel quite detached from the original character. Not sure if this was Terry's intention but then again - the whole film changed drastically after the unfortunate demise of Heath Ledger.The rest of the cast were also very good especially Verne Troyer as the fiesty Percy and Christopher Plummer as the title character, Doctor Parnassus.But the real star of the show who completely owned every scene he was in, has to be Tom Waits as The devil. He was so un-believable evil without coming across as menacing or scary. He was more of a trickster. More mischievous and delivered all of his dialogue superbly with just the right amount of humour and sincerity needed to pull off a Devilish portrayal that seemed so natural, almost as if he actually IS the Devil!Perfect casting!!!All up, an entertainingly strange film that works better if you have an imagination!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exciting and delightfully messy film running on imagination and mystery complete with a high-concept item chucked in for good measure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a premise as such as there is in this film, and an eye and a mind as wild and creative as director of the piece Terry Gilliam's, I think there is that fear that after the early exchanges in The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, it might just all meander off into nonsense. Thankfully, this isn't Inland Empire; a 2006 David Lynch piece that incorrectly thought the uncanny blended with the random blended with a half-dozen or so dabs into genre and shot in a distinct manner on a format rarely used makes for interesting viewing. The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus sees its director identify its high concept and off-the-wall ideas, the man consequently reigning in his directorial style and what he brings to certain pieces in order to deliver a ravishing and exciting piece of rather delirious entertainment. While not as involving as the best of his work that I've seen in 1995's Twelve Monkeys, nor as scathing in its statements as 1985's Brazil, the film that may have seen a man's visual approach to texts clash a little too well with the film's premise and general idea, 'The Imaginarium' is kept grounded and interesting throughout.The film sees an age-old, rickety horse drawn carriage trudge its way through contemporary England; displays of great eccentricity and performance from those that inhabit it, fearless in the dank and low-level set places it dares to set up to try and entertain. Here, the comparisons to Gilliam's own work and style of film-making that he brings to the medium of cinema might be relevant, as something that you'd usually associate with being placed out there in the multiplexes so as to get the masses to roll on up and observe, despite the traits that make it resemble something not obviously mainstream, tearing the thing apart if they feel needs be. But the cart comes with its own quirk, an item that cranks the premise up a gear: an odd mirror-come-doorway located within the cart that grabs you as you walk through it, thrusting you into a world created purely by your own imagination before dumping you back out again; weary and dithery with glee and amazement at what just happened. Look at it as a sort of cross between a black hole located in deep space and the portal in Being John Malkovich. As the film wears on, we come to learn of how such an item came to exist and exist for as long as it has done.In beginning the film in the night-set; down-trodden; tramp littered streets of London, centuries old buildings towering over the setting, Gilliam immediately gets across an odd clash of pre-modern and contemporary. This as he begins on an age-old building that looks a bit like a church or town hall as a cart trudges by in one direction, but modern day cars roll off the screen into the other. In having the cart set up for the first time outside a nightclub entrance, Gilliam allows it so that rowdy patrons may spill out into the night from whatever rave-set activity within and straight into the limelight of another sense of nightly entertainment, one of a less modern; less contemporary kind: theatre or stage-show. Something additionally established rather early on in the text is that recognition in the clash of mostly dominant aesthetics within English and American film texts, something made apparent when we realise the film comes across as realism driven when on the dark and unwelcoming streets of London in the 'real' world but rather escapist driven within the cart after entering the portal gadget the troupee carry with them.The film's mixture of borrowing from these dominant British and American aesthetics twinned with the blending of cast members from each nation compliment the odd aura that sticks with observing this high-concept idea just dumped into a film about a group of four people, ranging from rather young to rather old, but each of whom have their own dreams; outlooks and opinions. These people are Anton (Garfield), a young Englishman with a crush on Valentina (Cole) who's the going on sixteen year old daughter of the man that owns the cart, the titular Doctor Parnassus (Plummer). Verne Troyer's Percy completes the team, and a fifth member is stumbled upon in Tony who is discovered hanging from a noose under a local bridge; pipe in throat so as to survive and strange markings on forehead. Tony being the character played by the four actors in Law; Farrell; Depp and the late Heath Ledger, whose task of playing the role was horrifically cut short by way of a premature death in 2008.The film is, for the best part, split into three separate strands. You have Tony's story of who he is, why he cannot remember anything and why he's turned up plus who it is that's out after him clashing with the love story in Anton's fondness for Valentina; all the while accompanying Parnassus' verbal, gambling driven rivalry with a shady customer in Mr. Nick (Waits). Mr. Nick is this American voiced character whom arrives with a gravelly voice; a black pinstripe suit and a cigarette holder, supposedly The Devil Himself. Nick's first scene sees him with Parnassus way-back-when, essentially an American attempting to talk our titular character out of doing the Buddha chanting he engages in and into something else more modern or more interesting: something people are going to care about in years to come. Dressed up like he is, a rich; noir-infused; fat cat, he might very well supposed to be representable of American attitudes towards certain texts and what audiences find 'engageing'. After a further wager involving daughter Valentina, the stakes are raised and a degree of peril settles in; something the film refreshingly allows its heroine to have an opinion on rather than blank her voice. The film is imaginative, persistently engaging and exciting; twisting down a number of unexpected routes an enthralling throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Faust Legend for Modern Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam's latest movie may not live up to the expectations of a visually-brilliant work of the imagination, but it is nevertheless an enjoyable experience. The movie, for all its pomp and visual extravaganza, is the typical conflict between good and evil. An immortal monk makes a wager with the Devil to see who collects a number of souls first. This game is repeated several times across the centuries and with different prizes.As the movie starts, Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) and his troupe of actors stage a sideshow called The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus in the streets of modern London. Operating outside bars and nightclubs, they only seem to get the attention of hostile drunks and the police. They live in misery. It seems no one's interested in what Doctor Parnassus has to offer. And what he offers is a journey to the Imaginarium, a world of imagination where people are given a choice between good and evil. Because it's an easier path, most people seem to choose evil.To make matters worse, Doctor Parnassus once made a deal with the Devil and the prize is his daughter, Valentina. Unbeknownst to her, when she turns 16, the Devil will come to collect her. The Devil, however, makes a new bet with the good doctor: the first to collect five new souls gets Valentina. It's a chance, made better by the sudden appearance of Tony, an amnesiac man they save from hanging. Tony, with his good humor and persuasive ways, brings a new life to the sideshow and helps them in looking for the coveted five souls.But Tony hides dark secrets and his past may put in danger the existence of the Imaginarium. There's no need to say more.Following this fantastic premise is a movie that celebrates imagination and creativity. Terry Gilliam and Charles McKeown pick up old conventions and ancient stories - like the Faust legend - and give it a modern twist. There's a mixture of high and low culture that is typical of today's fiction: the ancient, wise mage getting drunk and living like a beggar; the devil being a smooth talking, well-dressed con man. Then there are little jabs at modern culture: how people's imagination is dulled by consumerism, social drinking, TV and video games. Doctor Parnassus, trying to save people through the imagination and the art of telling stories, finds mostly indifference from people who are bombarded with countless distractions every day. I don't doubt that Terry Gilliam, constantly plagued by difficulties in producing his movies, sees himself a lot in Doctor Parnassus.The special effects in this movie are quite good, but it's the hand-made stuff that impressed me the most: the art direction, the props, the horse-drawn carriage that sustains the convertible Imaginarium theater, and the costumes.Heath Ledger passed away before completing this movie, but his performance was much enjoyed. That's not to say that I think he gave the best performance in the movie. For me that distinction goes to Christopher Plummer, this much underrated veteran actor, who pulls off Doctor Parnassus perfectly.Jude Law, Johnny Depp and Colin Farrell complement Ledger's role as Tony, appearing as distorted versions of him when he enters the Imaginarium. Each one of these actors played him with a different style and a different personality, and in a movie which is about identity, secrets and deception, this was not only appropriate but much appreciated.Although I wouldn't call myself a Terry Gilliam fan - his work leaves me indifferent as often as it fascinates me - I wish he'd have more means to keep making movies like this on a regular basis. If cinema can sustain movies like Avatar and Alice's Adventures In Wonderland, it's a shame there's hardly a place for The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy addition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam is a mastermind of visual imagery, filling every shot with beautiful, bizarre, meaningful, and mundane elements. "Imaginarium" pulls more from his Monty Python work than darker sci-fi films like 12 Monkeys or Brazil. Anyone familiar with Python will see similar themes pop up here.He, and the producers, rescued this film from the "Gilliam Curse"-- which included not just the death of Heath Ledger part way through filming, but also the death of a lead producer. (the film is dedicated to both.) And the Heath "issue" cannot be ignored and will probably never be disassociated from this film. On the one hand, I personally found no disruption by the 3 other actors (Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell) who "take over" for Heath throughout the film.On the other hand, this film is overwhelmed by themes of death, suicide, and destruction. The very first shot of Heath in the film seemed unbelievably shocking to me considering his untimely passing. Sitting in the theatre, I was stunned throughout the film by the audacity it seemed Gilliam had to keep such strong imagery which cannot help but remind us of Heath's own flirtation with, and ultimate loss to Death. I'm sure this affect will lesson with time, perhaps unfortunately.Unfortunately because this whimsical, fantasy film is indeed a parable about playing with the Devil, betting with Death. It gives us one protagonist who is immortal and another who uses his own death (or the appearance of it) over and over. Heath's actual death provides a bitter undertone that reinforces these themes even against the most fanciful of Gilliam's animation. Perhaps Gilliam is the Dr. Parnassus, ever creating wild worlds. But Heath is not the Devil, making bets against the beauty, but the Everyman, trying to make his way and sometimes getting lost.Imaginarium is not my favorite Gilliam film, it is not even in my top 3, however it is a very worthy addition to his body of work. As a last record of Heath's work: if his last finished film "The Dark Knight" was the final twisted chapter, Imaginarium is the coda- beautiful and dark, a grim smile and wink to send us on the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original idea...but poorly worked out and so long winded.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phew... just sat through "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus". And my feelings towards the film coincide a bit with the way I felt when first saying the title... long-winded. It's a mouthful it is, and man can they TALK in this movie !! Pointless conversations that don't lead anywhere... I mean what's point trying to sell a crappy show (sorry, it was.) with endless jam mering. I'll level with ya... had to take an aspirin after the movie because my head was pounding.Little bit about the movie:As they don't use a narrator, which I'm all for, you go into the movie blind without any preparation. But when, after some talking of course, something actually happens... (to me it was the first time someone went in the mirror) you could easily predict the whole story. "...I've lost again" So we had a fight between good vs evil. Although I find that good wasn't always good and evil most certainly wasn't always evil. If you're gonna make movie like this... you better do it good and that's where Terry lost it's tracks IMO. So you make a bet with the devil...isn't gambling prohibited? So you have a midget,dwarf, uh, vertically challenged person (best scene of the movie was the stumbling cop, btw... and any lily Cole scene with her body showing) for a conscience. What was the point of this movie??? I couldn't find anything original story-wise. I liked the settings of the dream-worlds, sure.. very artistic and they've definitely been looking at some clever artists.You wanna see a better movie about the devil and it's tough choices he could offer you ?? Go see the Devil's advocate!! At least the devil has flair in that movie and not some bowler hat. Good god...As a side note, this movie gained a lot of hype because of Heath's death but although he did a decent job in this movie... I'll always remember him for his Joker performance, but mostly for his Ennis performance in Brokeback Mountain. Possibly the best love story ever told! But I'm going off topic, sorry. Back to this sad thing... The other actors filling in all did reasonably well, but they ought too as they were Hollywood's finest.I'll end my review by using a quote from this movie, which explains my feelings towards it:Valentina: Is this going to take long? Dr. Parnassus: Yes, yes, yes quite possibly.(was he talking about this movie?)P.S.: sorry if this review is long winded, but hey so was the material I had to work with :-)Regards Raf</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traveling theatrical troupe--led by the boozing, ill-tempered, but genuinely magical Doctor Parnassus--encounter hostile London crowds while encouraging individuals to explore the outer reaches of their imagination (via Parnassus' mystical mirror); unfortunately for Parnassus, he has been gambling with a force from the dark side and owes "Mr. Nick" a soul, that of his nubile daughter on her 16th birthday. Ill-conceived, ramshackle flight-of-fancy that rarely takes off, this despite top talents before and behind the camera. Heath Ledger, as a suicidal philanthropist-turned-barker (feigning amnesia!), died during production, forcing director/producer/co-writer Terry Gilliam to reconfigure the plot after his untimely demise. Pity the film runs out of energy even before Ledger appears on the scene, with confusing action and cop-out fantasy sequences that are alternately over-baked or frozen solid. Andrew Garfield gives the only appealing performance as the host/court jester of Parnassus' sideshow, although Gilliam unwisely turns this character into a klutz--and it's not at all enjoyable hearing other characters putting Garfield down when he's the only person on-screen who makes a direct, honest connection with the audience. The rest of the picture feels like a cheat--and a burden. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sprawling Disaster from Beginning to End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Terry Gilliams' "Doctor Parnassus" is an overly ambitious, sprawling, overly indulgent, excessively long (that is how I felt watching it anyway) film chock full of special effects and I hated practically all of it. The look of the film - the broken down, old fashion stage coach which serves as a stage set driving through the slums of London - is gloomy and depressing. Furthermore, I found very little relief from this depressing cinematography from the imaginative sequences of Doctor Parnassus' imaginarium. Under these circumstances, a pretty good plot and fascinating characters are needed to hold my interest. But the plot is utterly incomprehensible. I do not know what on earth Terry Gilliam was trying to achieve with this film (his movie, Brazil, made more sense) and I don't think he knew what kind of film he wanted to make. Gilliam may have been trying to make a witty and clever film, but there is nothing witty, thought provoking or intelligent about it. Gilliam may have been trying to make a film that was amusing or had something to say about the human condition within a fantasy world, but there is not a single laugh to be had in this picture and whatever he may have been trying to say on the human condition was either lost on me or not that important to begin with. Gilliam threw everything into this picture including the kitchen sink and the result is one big grotesque, artsy mess. The other criticism I have is that the characters are so boring! Christopher Plummer is really dull as the extremely old Doctor Parnassus who achieved immortality through a deal with the devil. He is just a lazy drunk with nothing interesting the say. Then there is the devil. I never thought that anyone could make the devil, the personification of evil, utterly boring, but Tom Waits (dressed up in a black tuxedo and tie from the rushing 1920s) has succeeded in doing just that. Then there is Anton (Andrew Garfield) who to put it bluntly is a big nuisance. The only characters in this picture whom I like at all were Heath Ledger's Tony who has a certain swagger and showmanship about him that gives some life to this dreary picture and Lily Cole's Valentina when she is being slutty. But if you want to see scenes like that, then you can go to the youtube video with the title Lily Cole sex scene with Colin Farrell, though don't expect too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only from the mind of Terry Gilliam. One of the original Monty Python members, who can come up with such chaotic convalescence in a story. A man who gets saved from a death sentence by the Russian mafia by the good Doctor's entourage only to become the Imaginarium's spokes person. The Imaginarium is a unique mythical chamber where a magic mirror harnesses the human Imagination and amplifies it to such a degree, that anyone who passes through becomes more aware and more secure when they exit. Christopher Plummer plays a brilliant role as the soothsayer who is already a thousand years old, to try an open peoples imaginations and win a bet against the devil. Try to save five souls in order for a contract to vanquish. In the middle are the doctors daughter and Tony (Heath Ledger - Final role before his death), who gets people to see that everything is worth living for. But for Tony, his crime against the Mafia was stealing loads of money possibly to save others using it, hence his death sentence. I loved the captivating scenes of utter ridiculousness, with ladders leading to clouds, or over-sized Fabergé eggs. Johnny Depp also played the role of tony yet took different faces, including Jude Law. This worked like a charm every time Tony wandered into the mirror. But his tattoo was his give away to the mob. I loved the story, loved the chaotic fun, and certainly the familiar effects that Terry Gilliam is known for. The last films I enjoyed from Terry was Twelve Monkeys and Brazil. Quite an accomplishment of movie making from an already deranged man like Terry. I hope he does keep developing such fun films. Great cast, great laughs, and a good memoir to an already Oscar winning screen legend, Heath Ledger, R.I.P.</fullReview>

And yet it makes it worth every minute of shooting. The story is not complex but the development is. What we found here is Mr. Terry Gilliam subtexting himself; while the picture shows us the story we can see underneath the deep desire of the director trying to expose himself to the audience not overtly but giving away drops of mysticism here and there and trying to balance the eternal search for the right and wrong of every human being mixed up with the more radical feelings: fear of death, ambition, hatred, love, desire... What would you do to obtain immortality; and then what else would you for the person you love?Gilliam is definitely back on form. He crafted not a perfect but a very personal (I would say the most personal movie of his career) complex and delightful blitzkrieg of images and emotions. (Forget about the CGI's; they do not really count for what's the core of the movie.)About the cast... there is very little to add: however famous for being the final Ledger's movie the true glory I believe goes to a superb Mr. Plummer; furthermore, hats off for the most lovely devil so far, Mr. Waits, and we certainly cannot overlook the terrific performance of Mr. Verne Troyer. The inclusion of these three characters alone is worth the movie.Once again, not flawless, but worth seeing over and over and over again... Parnassus and the devil are not opposite characters but the complementary side of a whole; it makes absolutely no sense for one to exist without the other.Go see this one. Little by little it will grow into you. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heath Ledger's death also killed this film, it just refused to die.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part of my annoyance with this film is Heath Ledger died halfway through production, not the film's fault, obviously, but he was replaced by the misleading and confusing trio of Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farell. I like all of these actors and from the billing on the movie box I expected all of them to be in the movie, and they are. The trouble is they are all playing the same part so they never appear on camera together. Let me try to explain. Dr. Parnassus possesses formidable mental powers that allow him to bring the imaginations of people who enter his imaginarium real. There is a catch though, Dr. Parnassus deals with the devil and he is competing with him on a regular basis for the souls of those who enter the imaginarium. There is a really neat concept going on in this movie and some of the imaginarium scenes are fantastic, but the movie takes forever to get going and it doesn't really make the rules of the imaginarium or the status of the wagers with the devil very clear. As a consequence I felt like I was wandering through someone's imagination without a program guide. I wanted to like the movie but was glad when it finally ended. For a fantastic imagination movie see Alice in Wonderland instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terry Gillian at his best! If you wish to escape from the boring into something extraordinary then do so with The Imaginarium or Doctor Parnassus. My ONLY regret with this film is that I just discovered and had no idea it existed. MUST SEE FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES TO DREAM! Hope you enjoy it as much as me &amp; my family did! Ledger puts on performance truly worthy of being his last film. Tom Waits is the perfect durbied devil. As for the rest of the cast I can't say anything bad, and must ONLY give them PRAISE! It's SO refreshing to see a new Gillian film. The man is a TRUE VISIONARY GENIUS! Anyone who hasn't seen other Gillian I HEAVILY RECOMMEND THEY DO SO IMMEDIATELY! I also recommend The Adventures of Baron Von Munchusen one Gillian's earlier films which involves a theater troupe as well.If you enjoy this film you will surely enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolutely fascinating film experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my humble opinion, there are only a few directors who achieve transforming narrative formulas and technical processes from modern cinema into genuine cinematographic art, reflecting a personal vision which does not simply fit into the commercial requirements from the medium, and which also transcends the simple popular entertainment in order to become into something different, which is on some way more valuable thanks to their intention of affecting our spirit with ideas or feelings expressed through pure narrative.In short, those few directors have the ability of creating dreams they share with the spectator...something which will not be necessarily satisfactory or pleasant for everyone, but which is undoubtedly different to what we are accustomed to experience as passive spectators in the cinema.In the list of those brilliant directors, I could include David Lynch, Guy Maddin and Terry Gilliam.With The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, his most recent film, Gilliam brings us another excellent movie, which, as most of his films, may not be for everyone, but which I personally found to be absolutely fascinating.The story from The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is almost incomprehensible, and I understand that the bizarre screenplay and the strange characters will be difficult to assimilate by the casual spectator.However, I was truly hypnotized the whole time I was watching this film, mainly because of its dream-like tone, which reminded me of the strange dreams-hallucinations I had under the effects of the fever due to some debilitating sickness.Besides, the film is saturated of Gilliam's characteristic rampant imagination, from the prosaic juxtaposition of middle-aged and modern elements to the hallucinating drives through imaginary worlds inspired in the psychology from their owners.That unstoppable imagination is also expressed with many special effects, which are well done.Before speaking about the actors, it is obligatory for me to mention the Heath Ledger (1979-2008)'s tragedy, and the effect his unexpected death had during the production of The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.Many people will prefer to remember The Dark Knight as Ledger's last performance, but his performance in The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is credible, and much subtler than the one of the Joker, because he has to keep his emotions under the surface in here.Needless to say he does it very well, and he shows a lot of conviction as Tony.Due to Ledger's death during the filming, Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell worked as his "substitutes", and I have to say their presence was very naturally integrated to the unpredictable screenplay.As for the rest of the cast, the great Christopher Plummer is perfect on his character; that also applies to Tom Waits and Lily Cole.And, finally, Verne Troyer surprised me with his performance, because he shows unexpected emotional levels I would have never imagined due to his slapstick work in the Austin Powers movies or in the TV series Jack of All Trades.In summary, I found The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus to be a fascinating hallucination.Needless to say, I enthusiastically recommend it if you like Gilliam's work; and those people who have not had the pleasure of watching movies like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Twelve Monkeys or The Adventures of Baron Munchausen will find a great introduction to the mind of one of the few honest and audacious contemporary directors who never loose the fidelity to their personal vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How could anything be so bad?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It will be very difficult for me to write ten lines about this film. This film is so typical of the way-out artsy stuff that pretentious critics love. These critics talk about good vs evil, about regretting that you get what you wish for, etc. No, it is simply a very bad film. It is pure garbage. Its plot is overwhelmed with senseless noise; it substitutes annoying noise, special effects, stupidities, etc., for plot development. One needs not worry about a spoiler - the movie is so bad that 99% of viewers won't get to the end.The acting is good, as expected from the well-known stars, but the lesser known ones are good as well. It is a shame that they are wasted on such a tedious story. Anton is annoying. Typical is the scene where he uses slight-of-hand to keep Ledger from grasping the flute/pipe. It is not clever; it adds nothing; it simply annoys. There is a constant grabbing of people, of drunks, punches, whippings, and the like. Plummer is drunk for most of the film. Does this add anything? - NO. It is simply tedious and obnoxious. Will film-makers ever learn that drunks are not really funny, they are usually belligerent, annoying butt-heads.I didn't expect much from Gilliam - he has been riding the Monty Python wave for decades. Other than "...The Holy Grail" most of Python is not really funny, and even The Holy Grail relies on chopped up bodies and pure silliness (shrubberies, attacking rabbits, etc.) to get laughs.Many will see this because it was Ledger's last film. This is not a good reason. Don't waste your time; avoid this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't care for this movie; it's like a crazy Tim Burton film. I did get the main plot which is Dr. Parnassus is immortal and has made a deal with the devil. The devil will get his daughter's soul on her 16th birthday. It's just 2 days till her birthday and the devil has made a new offer. If the Dr. can collect 5 souls before her birthday, the devil won't take her. I understood that part. It's the rest that I didn't get.The daughter and the Dr.s followers find Heath Ledler, whose name is Tony, hanging underneath a bridge. They save him and then it's day and it looks like this is the 16th century, however, Tony still has his cell phone. And then it goes back and forth between fantasy in the Dr.s fun house and what looks like currant times and olden times, like before cars. It was just too weird.FINAL VERDICT: I don't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this looking at the bright side of life, or the dark side?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going through the world of the battle between good and evil on film has taken its toll on me as I look at the worlds of light and darkness and strive to figure out what are the underlying messages of the creators of films like this that I see. As imaginative as modern movie makers can be with the technology of computer generated effects, it can also be as confusing as the devil's own playground which this seems to be desperate to give viewers a one way ticket to. Even if this does feature an allegedly decent character in Christopher Plummer's Dr. Parnassus, the fantasy story of them fighting to collect souls just strikes me as something spiritually unsound.Thus, I can only look at this for its qualities as a film-through its general story, through its performances and through what it delivers artistically. I can imagine if I had been there in the dinner and have to go to the bathroom, I would never have left my seat. However, on DVD, you can pause it and even walking to the kitchen, you must leave it at the where you left it without missing one second of it. I attribute to how it looks, and the fear that even missing one minute of it could send me scrambling to find my place back and simply taking in every issue as I would a painting in a museum makes it virtually necessary to give its full concentration.Veteran actor Plummer, by all counts, is the leading actor and he shares acting honors with Tom Waits who plays Satan himself. As I have learned through my biblical studies, Satan when he appears is charming, and that is certainly the case here. But Satan is a phony, and it is obvious through looks that way to get through his excellent performance that this man even as tempting as it is can not be trusted at any percentage. Heath Ledger originated the role that is later taken over by Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell. It is often perplexing to try to figure out how the character of Tony is played by four actors and who the character actually is.Plummer's deal with the devil however leave me cold with the film overall, why he would even consider giving up the soul of his beautiful daughter to Satan, having dealt with him when he pretended to be a younger man in order to seduce the woman he loved. This shows a lack of moral ambiguity to Plumbers character, and that really doesn't create any sympathy for him. It gives the impression that Hollywood films push the idea of eternal youth and that aging gracefully is not a desirable life.Some moment are perfectly convoluted and even though the film is luscious to look at through an artistic vision, you must be in tuned to some views of the occult to understand where this is trying to go. I don't, no matter how much I open my mind to it, and find many elements of the underlying meanings to be massively disturbing. Reminding me of the same director's "Baron Munchausen" with a bit of "Dante's Inferno" thrown in, I won't praise it for what I felt it was trying to do, but I will give it thumbs up for looking as tasty as it does. The temptation maybe there for me to be taken in by this, but fortunately I am able to resist it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow crescendo upward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imaginarium is a film by Terry Gilliam for the contemporary age. Admittedly, the first half of the movie is boring. It gets more interesting as the story continues. The film, with its special effects, reminds me of Peter Jackson's The Lovely Bones. However, this is a better movie. It also stars famous actors such as Andrew Garfield and Verne Troyer.The message of the movie is also memorable. It teaches the viewer to judge people for who they are rather than who you want them to be. Choice is also a pretty big theme in the movie.The film is strangely fantastical for one that picks up on Judeo-Christian story elements. Perhaps that is not a bad thing. It might get more people interested in religion in an age that values science and pure reason.In terms of humor, I would not expect that much. There is one scene that I found amusing. For spoiler reasons, I am not going to divulge it; it does involve policemen and violence, though. Since the film is one by Terry Gilliam, it is of course going to simultaneously have understated and outlandish humor at the same time. Again, the film relies on having an over-the-top presentation. In that vein, the film, out of all Terry's films, reminds me the most of his 'the Adventures of Baron Munchausen.' Both movies, if I am not mistaken, seem to tout Counter-Enlightenment values.Mild thumbs up. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very Much like His Peers Tim Burton and Wes Anderson, Terry Gilliam is an Artist's Artist. He is that First and Foremost and the Imagination Gilliam puts on the Screen in the Form of Surreal Imagery is Always Unique and Interesting. This One is No Different. Inside the Mind of Dr. Parnassus is where Gilliam Shines with a Landscape of the Unreal and the Viewer is Certainly Taken to a Place that Never Existed Before. That is what the Art of the Best Cinema does Best.But this is a Tedious Pleasure and is also Quite Unpleasant at Times. Terry Gilliam is a Filthy Fellow. Not Profane, just Dirty, in that the People, Places, Props, Sets, and Costumes Outside the Mind of Parannus are in Need of some Serious Scrubbing. Watching it makes You want to take a Shower. Everything is Ragged and Unhealthy Looking.The Film is a Jumble of Juxtapositions and Clutter Standing In for Complexity. By the End of the Movie the Excessive Exhilaration is Exhausting. As Stunning as it may be to Look At, there is a Feeling that You Want it All to be Over With. When it is, there Might be a Sense of Disappointment along with Relief because it Doesn't Add Up to Much.The All Star Cast, with Stand-Ins for the Early Departed Heath Ledger by His Friends as Homage, Manage to Bring the Thing Home. That Works as a Nice Eulogy but the Film doesn't Quite Work as a Whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Got to give Terry Gilliam credit for imaginative visual style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In London, Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) leads a troupe of traveling entertainers including his daughter Valentina (Lily Cole), midget Percy (Verne Troyer), and Anton (Andrew Garfield). Parnassus claims that many centuries ago, he gained immortality from the devil Mr Nick (Tom Waits). However it's a trick that turned everlasting life into everlasting torment. Then one night, they find Tony (Heath Ledger) hanged off a bridge. When he comes to, he can't remember anything.It's got the wild imaginings of director Terry Gilliam. This is one rambling disjointed crazy confusing mess. And it has nothing to do with replacing the deceased Heath Ledger with 3 other actors Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell, and Jude Law. I understand that part. Everything with the devil is just confusing. It is weak storytelling. However I have to give him credit for visual style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most ambitious film works of Terry Gilliam in recent years. Movie filmed in the usual manner, the director of grotesque, sarcastic, grim fantasy. The beauty of its visualization does not concede the previous film, as the Brothers Grimm and Tideland. Despite the length of almost two hours, the pace of the picture is extremely chaotic and confused. Cinema abounds large number of well-done computer graphics. Also in the movie made &#x200b;&#x200b;a lot of great scenery like the coach of Parnassus and the stage. The cast is pretty good. The hero, played by Heath Ledger seemed quite faint and not memorable. Can not be said about Tom Waits. Which are brilliantly transformed into a diabolical nature. The audience did not understand the risk of film and be bored while watching. The plot is worthy of a theatrical production, but the on-screen incarnation came vague and insane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously the film has problems, but when taking into consideration the circumstances behind the film, it's pretty darn great. I was completely swept away by the magical imagination sequences. The CGI bringing bizarre and wondrous things to life. The performances were also very strong, with Andrew Garfield given such a layered performance you can't really see where he will end up, especially when he comes into conflict with Ledger. Ledger gives a fine performance, but given his character has lost his memory it's also a fairly flat role. All of the revelations about Tony come in the imaginarium, which gives the interesting meaty parts to Depp, Law and Farrell. Farrell standing out a great deal as he gives a us a marvelous turn around. Each of the three 'replacement' stars plays their part well, they aren't trying to outdo each other or Ledger. Stealing the show is the musical God also known as Tom Waits. Here he plays the devil with all the charisma, charm and seedy sinister motions one would expect. He's simply fantastic, making the devil more than just an evil villain, he's also a guy having fun. It's a fascinating treat that one wishes Ledger could have completed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much of a farewell to Ledger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus was the greatest motion picture ever made, it still would have left me with a bittersweet feeling because it's the last film made by Heath Ledger. I'm not sure if he had that elusive "it" to be a full fledged movie star, but anyone who's seen Brokeback Mountain and The Dark Knight knows Ledger's awesome talent and can lament all the great works we've been denied by his untimely death. This is not one of those great works as it founders on Terry Gilliam's weaknesses as a writer and his inability to translate his imagination into modern CGI effects. If you've seen Gilliam's other works, you may have expected his creative vision to explode in the limitless world of digital magic. The most interesting looking things in this movie, however, are made out of wood, canvas and paint instead of pixels. As a story, it's not awful. It's just that Gilliam has created a fable without giving it a real moral. T he Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is a parade of fancy set pieces that never amounts to anything and doesn't even look all that fancy.The Doctor in question (Christopher Plummer) is a millennia old gentleman who has been reduced to wandering the streets of London in his wagon/performance stage with his soon-to-be-16 year old daughter (Lily Cole), an enthusiastic vagabond performer (Andrew Garfield) and the diminutive Percy (Verne Troyer). Though the details are a bit sketchy, Parnassus is able to allow others to enter his imagination and experience their wildest dreams. Despite that, his traveling show has fallen on hard times and The Devil (Tom Waits) is soon to collect on an old agreement. Into this falls Tony (Heath Ledger), a man found hanging by his neck from a bridge and who may have the answers to all of Parnassus' problems, both material and metaphysical?if Tony's dubious past doesn't turn out to be the ruin of them all.I suppose the main thing to know about this film is that Ledger plays, at best, second banana to Christopher Plummer and that Tony is arguably behind Garfield's Anton when it comes to screen time and significance. That speaks to Gilliam's charm and failing as a commercial filmmaker. Who else would have the confidence or indifference to be able to call on the services of someone like Ledger and use him as a plot device in the service of other actors' performances? Not that Ledger doesn't have a few scenes to shine and prove that, while he might have never been a Tom Cruise or a Tom Hanks, he would have been someone long remembered in cinema. But there's not enough of Ledger here to elevate the movie and, given what Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell do as replacement Tony's inside the Imaginarium, that probably would have been true even if he'd lived to finish shooting.The ultimate problem with this as a movie is that Gilliam never defines exactly what is at issue between Parnassus and The Devil. It has something to do with imagination and choice and, honestly, it seems as though Gilliam himself gives up trying to figure it out by the end of his script. The lack of a coherent theme eventually undoes it all, including a plot where Gilliam and co-writer Charles McKeown have to contradict themselves not once, but twice in order to keep the movie going.As I mentioned, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus isn't awful. It's very elaborate yet even more ordinary and perhaps that's for the best. The more amazing and powerful it was, the more painful it would have been to watch Ledger in it. Instead, it's a gentle goodbye to someone we'll regret losing long after we've all forgotten that we should.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is fantastic in the magical sense. It has child-like wonder qualities (thanks to Terry Gilliam) and incredible scope compared with nearly any other film in terms of settings. The plot line is a simple story that is expanded into many suspenseful scenes where characters must solve dilemmas which are always just around the corner from where they are. There are brilliant performances and the outstanding cast has a lot of creative range with which they work. The actors seem to be stretching from familiar film territory and their established personas and this approach suits this film of wild imagination. Overall the film is very enjoyable and presents many surprizes and delightful moments. However, it would deliver more energy and urgency if some careful editing happened to make the film shorter and the story much tighter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun, surreal and very crazy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst filming The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus Heath Ledger unfortunately died and there was the possibility that this film may have become one of the great unfinished film. But with respect and great determination Terry Gilliam and his cast and crew carried on to make this very strange, surreal fantasy film.In London there is a travelling show that is headed by the 1000-year-old immortal Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) who has the power to take people into an incredible fantasy world. His entourage contents his 15-year-old daughter, Valentina (Lily Cole), his confidant Percy (Verne Troyer) and sleight of hand Anton (Andrew Garfield), who is in love with Valentina. Doctor Parnassus keeps making bets with the devil (AKA Mr. Nick) (Tom Waits) who gave him his immortality. But as a result of the bets Doctor Parnassus has to give Mr. Nick his daughter on her 16th Birthday. If Doctor Parnassus is able to get five more souls before Mr. Nick does, then Valentina would be safe. But as the troupe struggles they save Tony (Heath Ledger) a man with amnesia would has the give of the gab and he could help Parnassus in his plight.Terry Gilliam is a great director with an great imagination. His films can be filled with darkness and light and he is not afraid to give his films a bittersweet ending. He is a director who stands by his conviction and willing to fight with producers. But he is a very divisive director and his films certainly do not appeal to everyone. The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus will please Gilliam fans but newcomers may not be won over.The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is darkly funny and surreal beyond belief. The imagine world was deliberately child like, being brightly colourful to dark and horrid: it reminded me of Peter Jackson's version of Heaven in The Lovely Bones. There are some usual Gilliam traits like a song and dance number involving the police and there is a lot of good dialogue. The horse drawn giant cart looked like something out of Harry Potter and the special effects were of a high and imaginative level. Gilliam also keeps the film as a fast paced, multi-layered film, with most of the characters filled with good and dark elements. And at the same time there is a clash between the grim version of London to the colourful world of the Imaginarium. It is a strange film but it is really enjoyable.The film is also filled with excellent acting and it is a strong performance from Ledger anyway. Cole shows come promise as an actress and Garfield was really good as a kid suffering from jealousy and unrequited love. The filmmakers employed a clever device to carry on the film: Ledger had finished all his filming in London and only had to film when he was in the Imaginarium world. To overcome the problem Tony turned into a character people wanted him to be and Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell took on the role. Depp and Law even looked a lot like Ledger and Depp was really good in the film. Depp even used the Jack Sparrow voice for the role. Plummer is a veteran actor and of course was going to be good and Tom Waits is dark and snaked tongued as the devil and his performance reminded me of John Malkovich.Overall, 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extravagant fairytale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An extravagant modern Fausto-cirque fairytale full of magic. The Imaginarium is Gilliam's return to his old and most playful self.The movie tells the story of a traveling "Magic show" troupe, led by old Dr Parnassus, who gambled with Evil something very important re his daughter Valentina thousands of years ago...The acting is very good, especially on the part of Christopher Plummer, who is truly terrific as Dr Parnassus, as well as Tom Waits as the Evil. This was Heath Ledger's last film, and he is good in his portray of the naughty, nervous and charming Tony. Also good is Andrew Garfield as the good-natured but jealous Anton, and Verne Troyer as little man bright Percy. Lily Cole is OK as the homey dreamer devoted daughter Valentina; she looks stunning in the film, and I think she'll be good in the future when she gets rid of the stiffness of the catwalk and gets a bit of experience.The parts of Tony behind the mirror, played by Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell, who replaced Hedger after his death, are cleverly used and well performed. The two first actors really keep in tune with Ledger's performance, body language and even inflexions of his voice, and they look physically similar, especially Depp. Collin Farrel is, in that regard, a rupture. I think the story would have also worked even if Hedger hadn't passed away, as they the segments are extremely believable without Ledger too. I mean, the story of the well-off housewife is a paradise of shoes, shopping, in which she is romanced by Depp. Isn't that the true fantasy of any modern mid-age housewife? The images, costumes, colors, decorations and visions of the film are spectacular, full of creativity and artistry, and, most importantly, an intrinsic part of the story, never an indulging showy element. Is the heart and soul of the movie what captivates the viewer, not the special effects. One feels immediately drawn by the magic mirror to a world of entrancing fantasy in which the viewer would also like to experience. The mirror is, after all, a way of day-dreaming in luxury, if you have dreams and imagination.I found the end of the movie a little bit rushed, and the part of the story related to the past of Dr Parnassus underdeveloped.A very enjoyable film with a good story, amazing creativity and good acting, that will entertain both adults and youngsters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fitting final work for an actor who pushed the envelope in role choices</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" will, of course, go down in history as the movie Heath Ledger was working on at the time of his death. But rather than let the movie die with his star, director Terry Gilliam hired several of Ledger's fellow actors - Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law - to take Ledger's place in the few scenes that still remained to be filmed. As such, it would be easy to focus on this rather unique turn of events and not on the fact that the finished product stands as an absorbing, imaginative and thought-provoking work in its own right.By setting his tale in the modern world, Gilliam brings a discipline to his storytelling and a reality to his flights of fancy that, in some of his previous works, have managed to get away from him. The narrative focuses on a second-rate carnival troupe that travels around London in an elaborate but rickety carriage playing to inattentive, unappreciative - sometimes even downright hostile - audiences. The troupe consists of Dr. Parnassus (Christopher Plummer), a thousand-year-old seer and magician who was granted immortality by the devil (Tom Waits) in exchange for handing over any female child he might have when she turned 16; Veronica (Lily Cole), his soon-to-be-sixteen-year-old daughter, who is unaware of the pact and who simply yearns for the day when she will be able to break free of the group and live a "normal" life; Anton (Andrew Garfield), a young assistant, who has feelings of his own for Veronica; Percy, a wisecracking dwarf (Verne Troyer) who provides the cutting voice of reason for the rest of the performers; and a mysterious, nameless man (the Ledger character) the troupe rescues from a suicide attempt, a man without memory or identity who joins their merry band and who, with his barker-like charisma, helps to finally generate some public interest in the act. The flights of fancy come in the scenes involving a magic mirror the troupe uses as a part of its routine, a mirror that serves as a portal into the very imagination of Dr. Parnassus for anyone daring enough to step into it.The beauty of "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" is that it rarely allows the fantasy elements to supersede the drama. The script keeps its eyes firmly focused on the characters - their hopes and dreams, and the lives they're leading. But there are deep, dark secrets to be uncovered and dealt with before the truth about the characters - especially Tony - can be fully revealed.Yet, it is when we go behind the mirror that we get to see Gilliam's own fertile imagination in its fullest flower. Here he has created an entire world out of distorted perspectives, painterly backdrops and the melding of CGI with human characters - and done so in a way that only Gilliam (and, perhaps, Tim Burton) can do it.Through the use of wardrobe and makeup, not only does Gilliam do a seamless job melding the three actors into the Ledger character, but, with the script, he manages to actually work Ledger's premature death and the fact that the part is played by several different people into the story itself.Ledger's work here, so full of energy, whimsy and understated pathos, truly reminds us of what a great talent we lost when he died so suddenly and so early - and makes us lament the great performances that we will never get to see in the future. But all the acting in the film is topnotch, with Plummer, in particular, distinguishing himself as the world-weary Parnassus forced to live an eternity of regret as a result of a rash action taken earlier in his life.This film is a fitting valedictory for an actor who took great delight in pushing the envelope when it came to choosing the role that would most help him to grow as an actor. He will be sorely missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If at first you don't understand, don't just write the film off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this film and then reading some of the critical reviews for it, what i found most surprising was that many of it's detractors were so baffled by it that they concluded that there was no point to it all, simply madness without method. This breed of critics are to be pitied, and i can only imagine what their uninformed, simple-minded reading of a David Lynch film might look like. In Dr. Parnassus, the story-telling is unconventional and the effects dazzling, but one does not need a PhD in film theory to pay attention to the narrative clues in the dialogue, and indeed, in the entire film. I don't want to give anything away here, but the words "morality play" and "dream logic" spring to mind, and the film has many subtleties worth exploring, although i don't feel that these are as obscure or arbitrary as the critics seem to. The visuals may be surreal but i certainly didn't see them as chaotic, rather i think they are integral to the allegorical meanings in the film. Overall i thought it was quite a good film, but it has its flaws; one or two main characters (Anton, Tony, Valentina) lack the right amount of depth to make you really care about what happens to them, although i often feel this way about the characters in Gilliam's movies; perhaps its simply because he does stories and visuals better than he does people. Having said that, some of the individual performances are great: Heath Ledger is charismatic, if not fully realised as a character, while Depp, Farrell and Law all excel with the material they are given to work with. Tom Waits and Christopher Plummer hold the script together with their assured performances as personifications of good vs evil, imagination vs materialism. This film fell just short of being truly great (again, symptomatic of the Gilliam experience for me), but perhaps i need to give it more time to grow on me. Its definitely worth watching, and i think even those viewers who find the style not to their taste will at least be entertained by it, as long as they come to it without expecting it to hand them a message for life on a plate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastical "Imaginarium" concept a good match with Gilliam's style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Crack open the mind of filmmaker Terry Gilliam and you're likely to find something akin to the imagination world inside the mirror in his film "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus." Known for surrealism, candy-coated visuals and deliberately hacking at all that stands for common sense, Gilliam applies these trademarks to the kind of film where they belong most: in a fairytale fantasy.Although the details are certainly fuzzy, "Parnassus" makes itself fairly accessible compared with the rest of Gilliam's repertoire. Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) is an ageless man who runs a traveling side show with his daughter, Valentina (Lily Cole), a dwarf (Verne Troyer) and a young man named Anton (Andrew Garfield). Their act offers people a unique chance to see possibility of imagination by stepping into a mirror where a world of their subconscious awaits them.At the end of one's trip into the imaginarium is a choice that reveals the heart of the film. The first path belongs to Parnassus, but the second is commandeered by the devil himself (Tom Waits). Turns out Parnassus has engaged in many a bet with "Mr. Nick" over the years, including one that promised him Valentina on her 16th birthday, which has nearly arrived. Parnassus and Mr. Nick are in an argument over human nature and through the imaginarium, Parnassus hopes he will prove his point. By this point, the devil has made a fickle alcoholic out of Parnassus, but all that is about to get complicated when the travelers pick up Tony (Heath Ledger) from the brink of death.Ledger's unexpected death in 2008 certainly threw a wrench into this film, but in a world where anything's possible with Gilliam defining "possibility," there shouldn't have been much doubt. Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell all play versions of Tony when he enters the imaginarium, where the person who enters sees things according to their deepest desires, thus justifying the change. It works excellently and the three actors capture the spirit of Ledger's oddball performance.The premise of "Parnassus" alone provides Gilliam every excuse he needs to justify the whimsical and bizarre events of the film. Those with big imaginations themselves will pick up on the "rules" of his story fairly quickly, particularly the visual metaphor. The film is also driven by an idea: human nature. This is not the age-old worn down debate of good vs. evil and whether humans are inherently one or the other. It's about whether -- when given free will -- we can face our mistakes and continue to write our own personal narratives despite temptations to rest, to give in and save ourselves the woe of uncertainty. This choice is what manifests itself in the world of the imaginarium and in Mr. Nick and the doctor's wagers.I suppose most will struggle to see this brilliant meditation on a rarely discussed theme amidst the swirling surrealism and abundance of strong characters played by equally strong actors who offer the temptations of simply watching the character subplots unfold from the love story to Tony's back story. The young Garfield and Cole create memorable characters for being new faces, which credit their casting in this film. Gilliam has always had a knack for finding exceptional talents and recruiting proved ones. Between Ledger, his fill-in, Plummer, Garfield and Cole, Gilliam has compiled one of the few excellent multi-generational casts.Stick with "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" and good will come of it. Gilliam does not want to alienate anyone; the very last scene alone provides some excellent last minute insights into the themes. Behind the abstraction, the odd clash of period-style costumes and dialogue in a contemporary context lies a wonderfully human story.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I enjoyed watching this movie, and had a lot to discuss afterwards, I felt strangely unsatisfied. Wondering why, I have come up with three major flaws: - As a spectator, I couldn't get involved with the characters' fates. In fact, they don't really have a fate. All characters are allegories, they fulfill functions, but they don't really live. They fail to develop credible relationships and conflicts. Although most actors are great, their characters are more like puppets. - This is due to the second flaw: A lack of time and rhythm. Many things happen too fast, so choices can't be motivated, relationships can't be developed. This is most striking in "Tony": He's the central character, obviously ambiguous, but everything that he does and that happens to him comes as a surprise. When he is suddenly redefined as "evil" in the last minutes of the film, this is absolutely unexpected. And during his seductor scenes, he didn't seem at all seducing to me (OK, I'm male, but my wife wasn't impressed either) - irrespective of the actor. Seduction needs time, but he never has it. Elderly ladies fall for him within seconds, but it doesn't seem credible. - A relatively small point: The dream-landscapes behind the mirror are all too candy-coloured and sterile, too much like Disney Land, too little like Phantasia. On the other hand, the actors are great. Especially Tom Waits is probably the best Mephisto I've ever seen. And the film give plenty to think about. What does it all mean? To me it seems to be a huge cosmology. Dr. Parnassus quite obviously is God (Why else would Mr. Nick exclaim "Oh God" almost every time he sees him - does the devil pray? And with whom else would the devil gamble about souls?). But he's a god who has renounced omnipotence long ago. God is a storyteller - a romantic concept, and indeed, the movie is full of romantic irony -, and he has left story-telling to mankind. That much is clear, questions turn up now. It is also a story about choices, and about freedom. So, what's the relationship between morality and freedom that Gilliam develops? Furthermore, it's a story about fantasy, and I think that Valentina herself may be the allegory of fantasy. But how does it relate to the other issues? And what exactly is Tony's role? He's repeatedly dubbed the "liar", so it's probably a character who avoids moral decisions by deceiving. Perhaps it's a mistake to rate "The imaginarium" as a movie. It's rather a mystery play. It's fun to think about it and resolve the riddles, but it never really moved me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Imaginarium of Terry Gilliam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam is fascinated by the power of the imagination. In Brazil he presents a Hollywood happy ending that only exists within the protagonist's unconscious mind. With Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, he shows us what the imagination can turn the real world into when under the influence of heavy hallucinogens. With the Fisher King a catatonic homeless man played by Robin Williams hallucinates attacks from a dark knight. In 2005's Tideland, a young girl uses her imagination to escape the horrors of her own life. Now with The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, Terry Gilliam once again explores the imagination to its most convoluted and perverse depths. This may be his most surreal work to date.The plot follows a traveling troupe of, err, entertainers that travel the streets of modern day London in a horse pulled buggy. They are lead by the ancient and immortal Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer). It is out of this buggy that they perform their show, trying to convince people to enter Parnassus' imaginarium. The door to this imaginarium is a shabby mirror, an Alice in Wonderland looking-glass like device. In here they can exist in their own fantasy world where Gilliam lets special effects run wild and anything can and will happen. Those who enter, as is the case with a strong dosage of LSD, don't necessarily have control over this mind-blowing visual extravaganza. The devil, named Mr. Nick and played by an elegant and conniving Tom Waits, lurks inside and tries to fool the visitors into giving up their souls.Over half the film takes place outside the mirror. While not inside Parnassus' imaginarium, these 'modern' streets are still a product of Gilliam's own imaginarium, shot using his traditional wide-angle lens. Heath Ledger, dressed in a white tux and an A Clockwork Orange-esquire mask, persuades middle-aged and elderly women to jump on stage and partake in the show. The devil still lingers, following the troupe and making bets and playing games with Parnassus over the possession of the doctor's daughter. Parnassus is joined by his very voluptuous 16-year-old offspring, a street kid who loves her, and a little person named Percy, played nicely by Vernon Troy. Percy is not a midget, but he is apparently immortal like Parnassus, though unlike with Parnassus, Gilliam does not explain why this is.To many, Gilliam's lack of cohesive plot structures are often frustrating. To me cinema is a visual art before anything else. The visuals in Parnassus, both the bright Mushroom Kingdom-like CGI world of the imaginarium and the modern-baroque Gilliam set design of 'the real world', are undeniably wonderful. I felt the characters and the plot, half-baked as they are, were interesting enough to keep me into it even during the most extravagant of scenes. Gilliam may no longer have anything to say, as he did in his earlier films (see Brazil). All he has tried to do here is create a work of surrealist escapism, and at least for me, it worked. In the theater I was completely absorbed into Gilliam's ever-expanding imagination, and 3-D glasses and a $300 million budget were not needed to do it.more reviews at mediasickness.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill Pullman didn't die during the making of "Lost Highway", but the same can't be said for narrative coherence, however, which bites the dust hard, at the very moment when Balthazar Getty shows up, unannounced, in that prison cell, supplanting Pullman, and emerges as the regenerated protagonist. The 1995 cult classic, also starring Patricia Arquette(and her breasts), can now be seen as a precursor to "Mulholland Drive", in which David Lynch test-drove, half-successfully, his utilization of dream logic. If only Heath Ledger's sudden and improbable death was only a dream, and the consigning of his unfinished character(Tony) to Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell could be explained as a filmmaker's license to be surreal for the sake of surrealism, and not out of necessity. Not wanting to suffer the ignominy of another lost film while in production(like his unrealized epic "Don Quixote", memorably documented in "Lost in LaMancha"), the former Monty Python trouper turns to the idea of multiplicitous personas, which, not surprisingly, hardly seems out of place in such a ramshackle production such as "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus". Depp, of course, was slated to star in "Don Quixote", so his participation in this free-wheelin' movie seems like fate, a serendipity of macabre-like proportions. Taking over for Ledger, Tony #2 escorts this middle-aged socialite through a phantasmagoria of giant-sized shoes and accessories, as Depp becomes a sort of Freddy Krueger(after all, these dreamers have the potential to die, ala "A Nightmare on Elm Street", a film that, incidentally, starred a young Depp), when he tries to off the cougar by luring her to a motel where the devil(Tom Waits) can claim her soul. The plot revolves around the collection of souls, in which Dr. Parnassus(Christopher Plumber) needs five to save his daughter Valentina(Lily Cole) from the clutches of Mr. Nick. The plot, however, becomes instantly negligible once the filmmaker rolls out the Tonys, as the film, literally, turns into a memorial for Mr. Ledger, most pointedly, in a scene where Depp observes a trio of flotillas memorializing James Dean, Rudolph Valentino, and Princess Di, and by association, his good friend Heath.Although Ledger's character turns out to have two faces(well, actually four), the star of Catherine Hardwicke's "Lords of Dogtown"(check out his spot-on send-up of Val Kilmer) apparently died before Tony reveals his dark side, which means we're spared the image of him choking a "child", a job that falls to Colin Farrell, the last Tony. The moviegoer can enjoy the late actor at his benevolent best, playing straight-man to Anton(Andrew Garfield), in a charming scene where the circus performer plays keep-away with Tony's flute. Best of all, he gets to hang out with Mini-Me, sorry, Percy(Verne Troyer), a sarcastic dwarf. Ledger gets to play the charming straggler who joins a traveling circus act(it's a shame that he doesn't get to kiss the girl), while the job of playing more the nefarious thief who hides out from his pursuers, falls on the shoulders of his collective stand-ins. Tony #3, as played by Jude Law, has a sequence in the imaginarium that recalls, in equal parts, Monty Python(the music-hall number performed by the singing policeman has a very British feel to it), and yes, Lynch, as tiny people, Tony's pursuers, who are the size of miniature toys, disappear under the hem of a peasant's dress, which is a direct steal from "Mulholland Drive".(Remember the tiny old people that the Naomi Watts character hallucinates?) Is it a coincidence that the circus performers first encounter Ledger as a hanging man, a man who could have possibly been lynched?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eccentric and quixotic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is first and foremost a Terry Gilliam film, which could make or break the overall experience for you. Gilliam has a very specific style that is best described as an LSD trip with a more cohesive story. His films are usually incredibly visual, are wrapped around a unique story, and above all else spectacularly weird. The one thing his films can always guarantee though is originality. Doctor Parnassus is very similar to Gilliam's The Brother's Grimm, which also starred Heath Ledger. At least as far as visuals go. So if you're not a fan of other Gilliam films like Time Bandits, Baron Manchausen, Twelve Monkeys, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, The Brothers Grimm, or Tideland among others, then it's safe to say you probably won't enjoy this film.The other piece of information that's worth knowing going into this is to not expect much Heath Ledger. Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell were brought in for a reason. You're left wanting more, which is probably a good thing. It's not a stab at Depp, Law, or Ferrell as they all portrayed Tony pretty flawlessly. Ledger is around long enough to show potential. He has a few standout scenes and a great speech or two. Then he's gone. Out of the three actors that also played Tony, Depp did the best job. When you first see Johnny Depp as Tony, he still looks like Heath Ledger. His actions, his body language, his dialogue, it all feels like the same character. Without giving too much away, it feels as if Tony changed every time he stepped through the mirror. Well, that's not entirely true. It's more like Tony's true nature was revealed more and more with each transformation. Depp seemed to be the Tony we were first introduced to while Jude Law was the version of Tony that was swept away in Doctor Parnassus' imagination. He wanted to escape. To reach the clouds. Then there's Colin Ferrell who is the true Tony. Despite the fact that four different actors played the same character, it all still felt like the same person.The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus isn't a film for everyone. It's incredibly bizarre and it takes a while for things to actually get rolling. People who see this film solely for Heath Ledger's appearance will probably be disappointed and those who aren't a fan of Gilliam's work most likely won't have their minds changed with this film. But if you're willing to give a different kind of film a chance, a film that winds up capturing your imagination, then step through the mirror and enjoy the eccentric journey to The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film what gives you back the Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just been to watch The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.Interestingly, it's only in a little, traditional cinema here, not in multiplex. This was the time, when I realized, each film needs to be in its perfect place. Although, this movie is full of great and spectacular elements, what could be nice in larger screen, in this small theater, with friendly café out, movable seats inside was in its perfect place.To tell the truth, originally I decided no to watch this piece, because of its trailer. Fortunately, the film is totally different.I was a bit afraid (and tired, bored) of Terry Gilliam's traditional visualization. I entered late, I set, in the middle of the almost empty rows. The film started. Two hours later, I realized the coat was still on me. The film was over.It is hard to find the proper words for a description. It just gives you something what I forgot long years ago. How great is to go to Cinema...A part of mine still wants to see the magic, the wonder, as children want to have it...One of the greatest strength of the film, that Terry Gilliam forgets to be Terry Gilliam, or better to say, he has changed, and well, he created something magical...All the cast is great, no slowing downs, no pointless twists, or boring parts, well-written characters, believable situations, high-talented actors and actresses.The other, very fortunate thing, that the story is as eternal as the duel between the Goods and the others...Heath Ledger is extremely good, Christopher Plummer is I think in his best, Lily Cole is a great surprise, Andrew Garfield and Tom Waits are also, among the tops. They are united as one, and united with the movie itself.Somebody must continue to tell the story in the world, not to have its end.Terry Gilliam and his cast did it, and still, in me they are doing it.This is what storytelling means. This is what acting means. This is what magic means. This is what Cinema means...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heath Ledger's final film is as wildly imaginative as you'd expect from the mind of Terry Gilliam. A 1000-year-old man (Christopher Plummer), having made a deal with the devil (Tom Waits) must gather five souls through the use of his unique mirror or risk losing his daughter (Lily Cole) to Mr. Nick. Then an amnesiac (Ledger) encounters the old man and his troupe, setting off a chain of events that promises to either save Dr. Parnassus or doom him further. The entire cast is outstanding, and Ledger himself is superb, but they're almost overshadowed by the entrancing visual design of the film, with epic, jaw-dropping set pieces and surreal cinematography.Parnassus runs a midway-type show from the back of a large wagon in London. His show features a man dressed up as Mercury, who introduces the good doctor; a lovely young lass, who ushers the customer into the mirror; and a dwarf, who aids and abets. But the show isn't received very warmly by the Londoners who drift into its orbit, in the periphery of rundown carnivals and decrepit shops, and Dr. Parnassus is soon visited by Old Scratch himself. The two, who long ago made a deal that bestowed immortality on Parnassus, make a new wager: if the good doctor can claim five souls (with his magical mirror) in two days' time, his debt to the devil will be met; if not, Mr. Nick can claim Valentina, Parnassus' daughter.Meanwhile, a stranger stumbles into their midst; a young man with strange markings on his head is rescued from hanging beneath a bridge. This young man - philanthropist Tony - infuses the troupe with a sudden burst of energy and retools the show to appeal to a more upscale audience. But at what cost? Those who enter the Imaginarium inevitably exit with a sense of euphoria and a real desire to give prodigiously, as long as they follow the rules. Rules such as no unauthorized admittance and only one customer at a time. You see, when one enters the Imaginarium, one enters one's own imagination, and when one doesn't have permission to be in the Imaginarium, one experiences an unhappy ending. And when two people enter, their imaginations overlap, causing chaos and pandemonium.Ledger died unexpectedly during the filming of this movie, of course, and his death left director Terry Gilliam with a decision to make. He could scrap the movie, recast the part, or perhaps retool the part. Gilliam chose the latter. At a few points during the film, Ledger's Tony enters the Imaginarium when he shouldn't have, and doing so changes his appearance dramatically. The first time, he becomes Johnny Depp; then, he's Jude Law; finally, he's Colin Farrell. (All three actors donated their salaries to Ledger's young daughter, Matilda.) It's usually not a good idea to use a new actor in an established role (see Plan Nine from Outer Space, for example), but it certainly isn't easy to explain why your leading man suddenly looks different. Gilliam's clever script modification makes perfect sense.It is the magic of movies that always brings me back for more. When I go to the theater, I'm looking for something astounding, beautiful, captivating, real and surreal, delicious, and overall creative. The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus recalls many of Gilliam's earlier works, particularly 1989's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (minus the whiny British girl), and his own imagination has never looked so fluid, cohesive, and downright gorgeous. But lest you think that all I liked about this movie was the look, fret not - it's exceedingly well acted, with pitch-perfect work from Cole, Plummer, Waits, and all of the Tonys, especially, the late, great Ledger. Exquisitely detailed, with passion in every second of every shot and in every inch of each set.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Gilliam movie since "Twelve Monkeys"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review does not spoil the whole film, but does reveal a few things about the introduction that may spoil its impact on the first-time viewer.Let me say to begin with, that I grew up with works like C.S. Lewis' "Narnia" chronicles, Michael Ende's masterpieces "Jim Button", "Momo", "The Neverending Story" and his not quite as well known, but brilliant existentialist/symbolist/dream-like works for adults, "Mirror in the Mirror" and "The Prison of Liberty", Diana Wynne Jones' "Chrestomanci" series and many more - in short: Fantasy fiction that does not necessarily entail something with dragons and magic wands, but builds universes with their own set of rules in which different aspects of human existence can be highlighted. Therefore, if there ever was a target audience for "The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus", I definitely belong to it. I do not agree with the reviewers who think this is all visual surface and no coherent content. The thing is that the story, a piece of fantastic fiction, is much more complex than your average Hollywood blockbuster. At the core of the story lies not a straightforward "battle" between good and evil, but rather a "game" between these two forces, but this core is surrounded by psychologically realistic, yet dreamlike story lines of people, their flaws and peculiarities, delivered in a scenario with metaphysics too difficult to explain in a short review, especially without spoilers.To boot, Terry Gilliam makes the bold move of starting the film "in medias res": Without any further introduction (other than an indication of the geographical location), we are thrown into a clash between the old- (and odd-) looking world of Dr. Parnassus' horse pulled traveling menagerie and unpleasantly drunken young people stumbling out of modern discotheque, a clash that ends as jaw-droppingly surreal and pompous as you could hope for in a Gilliam movie. Plus some. But after this we have to get a good stretch into the movie before Ledger's character, the mysterious Tony enters the story and prompts a few explanations of the film's world that is otherwise taken for granted and hardly discussed by Dr. Parnassus' employees. So, I do at least understand if some viewers are so puzzled that they are immediately turned off.However, "The Imaginarium..." has so much rich symbolism and layers of meaning and great story ideas that I think it is wrong to dismiss it as a mere visual exercise. Yes, the visuals are stunning, not in virtue of being "well-made" (although they are by most standards), but in virtue of being extremely imaginative in a no-holds-barred way, where time and the risk of alienating the viewer does not limit the amount of weird creations that are crammed into a shot.Although I am overwhelmed by this movie and do consider it Gilliam's best since "Twelve Monkeys" (for the time being I will not try to compare it with his earlier masterpieces), I hesitate to give it 10 immediately - I need repeated viewings to test the film's long-term impact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine the standard paragraph here, the one others are writing about Gilliam's grand ambition but lack of execution. The man made a very bad career decision, to try to map his very particular and limited imagination into film. He has two notions only. One is dear to my heart: the idea of an inner story where the causal nesting of folds is questioned. This is the future of mainstream narrative. He's right on the money here, and so were some of his Python buddies. Clever writers and filmmakers will lead us into new spaces with this. His other notion is a very specific and limited set of images. It is like limiting Shakespeare to a vocabulary of 2,000 words. I saw these almost 40 years ago, and thought them ? well, lacking in the three things he chooses to be measured by: they are not clever, they do not connect with important things in our lives, and more ? much, much more disastrously, the transitions are not engineered. There is no narrative. Sure, there is a story in which the world of the images exists, but the world of the images has no narrative. It is as if they were filler, which is just the role Gilliam played for Monty Python.The girl here ? a former model who exploited a fashion trend in post heroin awkwardness, is pretty good. Sadly, she is better than Heath and all the guys who play him. She and Plummer are allowed to use their bodies, and he is limited to internal gathering.

		<shortDescription>Just Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Critics and other reviewers here at IMDb have been incredibly kind to this awful film, and I have to believe it's only because it was directed by Terry Gilliam, and everyone's giving him a pass because of his other and much better films.I watched this mess based on the trailers, and I thought that its visual style (and what I've seen of Gilliam's past work like "Brazil" and "The Fisher King") would at least make the film worth watching if nothing else did. I was wrong. Never again will I trust that cool production design and surreal special effects alone can carry a movie. Without a compelling story, or any sense of control, or just any plain sense for that matter, Gilliam's visions are just a bunch of images vomited on to the screen without context or coherence.One might think this anything-goes, free-wheeling style would create a sense of freedom in the viewer, but it doesn't. It instead numbs the viewer to the point where he doesn't care what's going on, because he can't make any sense of it anyway.What on earth has happened to filmmakers in these recent times? Don't they think movies need good, solid stories anymore? Give us characters, ideas and events to care about, and put things like style, special effects, etc. at service to them, and things will take care of themselves.Grade: D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Imaginarium of Terry Gilliam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam remains one of the more idiosyncratic and creative writer/director/producer phenomenons in the business. His ability as an illustrator and as a satirist date back to his college years at Occidental College in Los Angeles where he daily startled students and faulty alike with his broad but biting and well groomed antics. For this viewer THE IMAGINARIUM OF DOCTOR PARNASSUS is one of his strongest forays in the field that can only be described as the Gilliam Genre. He combines a superb cast of characters portrayed by some of the finest actors in the field with his gift for creating visual effects that step beyond mere illustration but stay within the realm of painterly artistry instead of depending on CGI. And despite the zany story line that is typical of Gilliam's output, he also has some strong philosophical points to make. Comedy and fantasy combine to make drama in the line of Shakespearean creators. The story, written by Gilliam with and assist from Charles McKeown, is a mixture of fairy tale an the Faust legend all played out in the present day world - with very special exit points through mirrors into the world of pure imagination. Christopher Plummer gives great dignity to the immortal Doctor Parnassus who is the Faust of the tale - selling his beloved daughter Valentina (a wonderful Lily Cole) to one Mr Nick (the Devil) played subtly by Tom Waits. Parnassus runs a bizarre sideshow with his daughter Valentina, his lead man Anton (Andrew Garfield) and the 2'8" Percy (Verne Troyer). Into their lives drops (from a hanging under the bridge! rescue) the odd Tony (Heath Ledger, proving in his last role that he was truly a fine actor). Tony helps Parnassus alter his pact with Mr Nick in a series of strange events and in the course of these events the character of Tony is developed as three others - Colin Farrell, Jude Law, and Johnny Depp. The rest of the tale is left up to the audience to squeeze in the moments of high comedy and advanced, surrealistic creativity that Gilliam offers this project. 'All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players: They have their exits and their entrances...'. It is a pleasure to give into fantasy with Gilliam's films, and this one is a jewel!

		<shortDescription>An amazing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Terry Gilliam's work: the wild fantasy, the sarcastic wit, the characters who run the gamut from caricatures to real, well developed, believable people caught up in dreamlike adventures. The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus is vintage Gilliam: it has roots in Time Bandits and Baron Munchausen and even The Brothers Grimm (though fortunately, it's a much better movie than that one.) It's about the power of imagination to transform us, the need to tell our stories and the dangers of accepting stories told by the forces of authority. It is also about death and immortality: a theme that resonates all the more because it was the last movie Heath Ledger worked on before his untimely passing left it half finished.The film is a miracle in many ways. Heath Ledger's death didn't bring it to a halt because three distinguished actors who were his close friends stepped in to finish the part of Tony: Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell. Gilliam was able to incorporate them seamlessly into the action and the story stays intact and even benefits from these transformations.I think it has a straightforward plot, excellent performances and a wonderfully satisfying resolution: the creating of new stories never ends. The images are beautifully created and photographed. Yes, it poses more questions than it answers, there are layers of symbolism and allusion flying by, many of which will take two or three viewings to absorb, and there are some elements that I'd agree don't work very well. But overall I found it beautifully told.Christopher Plummer plays Dr. Parnassus, an immortal with the power to guide the imaginations of those who enter the Imaginarium, presenting them with choices that reflect problems in their lives. The alternatives are the hard road to virtue or the easy road to hell. The wrong choices lead them into the arms of the Devil, Mr. Nick; the right ones lead to a fulfilling life.Dr. Parnassus is one part Dr. Faustus, one part Lear and one part Prospero. He has made one too many deals with the Devil: the latest requires him to turn over his first born child, Valentina (played by the beautiful Lily Cole) to Mr. Nick (Tom Waits) when she turns 16, which will occur in just a few days. Parnassus knows no way of saving her and drinks to numb his feelings of guilt and grief. When Mr. Nick shows up early to collect, he offers Parnassus one more deal: the first one to win five souls in the Imaginarium will get Valentina. Valentina, however, has her own destiny in mind.Plummer is excellent as the drunken mystic, tortured by grief for the loss of his daughter and then spurred by hope of saving her. Percy, his dwarf sidekick (Verne Troyer), is a cynical realist who comments sarcastically on the follies of his friend and other members of the company. Tom Waits is a hail-fellow-well-met sort of Devil, always willing to take a bet but never quite offering the stakes he seems to be; a quintessential con man. Waits' performance is masterful.Heath Ledger, Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell play a mysterious stranger named Tony Shepard, found hanging beneath a bridge and rescued by Valentina, Percy and Anton (Andrew Garfield) a boy from the streets who has become a sleight of hand expert and barker for Parnassus' traveling show.Heath Ledger established Tony as charming, seductive and a smooth talker who takes over Anton's role in cajoling customers to step right up and threatens to sweep Valentina, who Anton loves, off her feet with his greater sophistication. Depp, Law and Farrell extend and expand Tony's character as he enters the Imaginarium three separate times. All four performances are very fine; despite his changing face, Tony is believable as the same man. Depp gives a speech which could double as a eulogy for Ledger, Jude Law did a nice job of his encounter with Anton and Colin Farrell was darkly convincing as a man who has lost his moral bearings in his drive for fame and success.Andrew Garfield is new to me, but I'm very glad to have been introduced. As Anton, the innocent young man with a crush on the boss's daughter who becomes jealous and suspicious of the stranger he rescued, I found him charming and intensely real. The greatest surprise is that Lily Cole is not just a beautiful face; she may be inexperienced, but she did a fine job with her part. And as my husband said, "I could watch her for days."Because I expected to love the film, I decided my husband's reactions would give some balance to my review. In the past he's found Gilliam's style okay in small doses, but he's no devotee. He knew the back story on the making of the film, but not what the movie was about. He told me that he enjoyed it, "much more than I expected to." Beside Lily Cole's scenic value, he thought the performances were good and the photography was beautiful. He had no trouble at all following the plot. He was a little distracted by wondering "Who's Tony this time?" and thought knowing why four actors are playing Tony was helpful; "I wasn't as confused by the changes." The only real problem he had was with the police skit in the Imaginarium: he felt it didn't make sense. All in all, he thought it was good and that he would have to see it again to really analyze it?"so I'll go with you when it comes out." I can't wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Nothing is permanent, not even death."...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of many haunting lines^ uttered in this true oddity of a film. Terry Gilliam's obviously been on the wacky weed again (but then, to be fair...when's he ever *off* it, really?). Suffice to say he offers up yet another visual feast for the eyes...but not much else. In typical Gilliam fashion, nothing's simple (or is it?). It's actually a very basic premise, but told in the most convoluted way possible. Turns out centuries-old Dr. Parnassus (a very mumble-y Christopher Plummer) has something of a gambling problem, making deals with the Devil/"Mr. Nick" (an extremely odd-looking, tufted-eared Tom Waits) - one of which being that he'd hand over his daughter, Valentina (Lily Cole), on her sixteenth birthday. In an effort to save her, Parnassus enlists the help of an amnesia-suffering stranger named Tony (Heath Ledger). The trick is to gain five souls before the Devil does, which involves sending people through a mirror into the "Imaginarium" of Dr. Parnassus (it has something to do with his mind). Sound simple enough? Okay, not exactly...but as odd as it may sound, it's even more curiouser to behold on screen.To say the film starts off slow and makes little sense is quite the understatement. I'm surprised no one left within the first half hour. Having said that, the film *does* pick up once Heath Ledger's on screen. The first shot of him in the film is unfortunate - as it is of him seemingly having hanged himself underneath a bridge. On more than several occasions, it is uttered how he's "dead!" and this has to rival the shot of The Joker in a body bag (from The Dark Knight) as one of those truly haunting shots of the late actor. Once he's rescued and joins the gang - which consists of Parnassus and his daughter, along with Mini Me actor, Verne Troyer, as Percy and Andrew Garfield as Anton - things start to move along. Ledger does not disappoint after his Oscar-winning performance as The Joker. While the role of Tony is something completely different, it still shows off the talent and versatility of Ledger, reinforcing what a tragic loss his death was to the acting world. As Tony, he manages to instill this character with depth and complexity, and makes you actually grow to *like* him (despite his less than noble qualities). One line uttered by him "Don't shoot the messenger." (which is repeated later by the same character, but played this time by Johnny Depp) is given a lot more meaning than what it would've originally had (especially knowing that it was the last line he spoke on set before his death, and that Depp had made the suggestion of using this line, without knowing Ledger had already spoken it).You will cherish every moment Ledger's on screen, as he is clearly the stand-out in the film. That's not to say the other actors are good - they all are (some more than others). Lily Cole, for example, is very good in her role. While perhaps not being a "conventional beauty", she has something far more important: presence. What could have been a very flat/annoying role is made into something far more solid, with much more substance. Her scenes with her father, Anton and especially Tony are really quite good. She certainly conveys a lot of emotion on screen. Christopher Plummer, meanwhile, was hard to understand half the time, and I wasn't particularly fond of his character much (Dr. ParnASSus more like it). Andrew Garfield was good as Anton, but at times kind of annoying also (there were several occasions where I wished Tony would simply punch him in the face). He does wind up being the unlikely "hero" of the story, in a roundabout sort of way by the end, though.Kudos have to be given to Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell - who took over as Tony after Ledger's passing. Not only are we treated to three new/different physical embodiments of Tony, but we also get to see three very different 'sides' to Tony. Each time he passes through the mirror, he resembles a different person (first Depp, then Law, and lastly Farrell). Depp brings the charm, Farrell the sleaze and Law the child-like wonder when inside the Imaginarium. Each actor really suited the aspect of Tony that they were portraying (Depp especially. Given what a short amount of time he was on screen, it's a real testament to what a great actor he is - the fact that he gave such a memorable performance...but then, would you expect anything less from Depp? His performance is mostly eye work, and very little dialogue. What few lines he *does* get are immediately memorable, though, thanks to his delivery). Law features in a truly bedazzling ladder sequence, then gives us some insight into Tony's supposed back-story, delivering an apparently heartfelt speech. Farrell, meanwhile, portrays a real scoundrel of a character. We learn that Tony's not all that he seems, and it's actually probably for the best that Farrell ended up playing this version - as it would have been hard to watch (given how he winds up at the end), had the role still been played by Ledger. Thankfully, it's easy to pretend the Tony we get to know in 'the real world' is someone else, totally different to the Tony/s in the Imaginarium. The way these actors were worked into the story around Ledger was really quite well-done, and nowhere near as jarring as I'd expected.This film is baffling on many levels, needlessly overlong and complicated and I feel the same way about it as I did with The Brothers Grimm (ie. I both 'liked' and 'disliked' it at the same time). There's good and bad aspects, but some really neat ideas that just unfortunately didn't reach their full potential. What you should come away from this film remembering is the wow-factor of the visuals, and the bittersweet final performance from Ledger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing it as it was Heath Ledger 's last film but it is not worth seeing, Ledger or no Ledger at all, after all, his acting is pretty much only some kind of babbling and stammering away and hanging around without making any sense at all - like this whole movie, unfortunately. Heath was a great actor but do not waste your money or your precious time ON THIS !!!! Bear him in mind as Joker or the cowboy in Brokeback Mountain and that would do just great for you.... I have to admit I like some of old Monty Python flicks and 12 Monkeys was not bad either , but what is this supposed to mean ? If Terry Gilliam wanted to show us the old battle between Evil and Good - well why did he add all that indecipherable rubbish to it - including the incomprehensible style of clothing the actors wear or what they do ...well Christopher Plummer with eyeliner and in a kind of Dalailama hat well - that one tops probably all of those incomprehensible and incoherent scenes included...and the way the Devil ( ? ) Tom Waits gets souls for himself - well even in Devil himself and his main field of business ( getting evil souls to hell ) has to be be some kind of system , does not it ? Well this portrait of Devil - and of God - both lack coherence - why that fight over 5 souls - are those people bad or good ? Why go they with the Devil ? Just because ? What the hell did they commit to deserve hell after all ? Incomprehensible - for Gilliam it seems that this does not matter at all - but it eventually should and if it had been really so - good old story about God and Devil with strict rules and without unnecessary rubbish - in that case it might have been even quite good....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another turd from Gilliam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Ledger dead, don't expect Gilliam to be able to con anyone into forking over this kind of money again. The film is the typical mess--wild visuals, zero storytelling, viagra-like zaniness from the Python days. Except Python was funny.I don't care if it's Ledger's last performance. He looks bloated and sick, and his character does zero. Not even any great lines. He's just some d*ck named Tony who (with the usual Gilliam lack of coherence) escapes fate/a crowd/Russian mobsters by swallowing a magic flute and hanging himself (or being hung). Make sense to you? Yep. Did to me too. Yeah, oooh, spooky because Ledger himself died while filming it. So what? Does it make the movie any better? No.His replacements roll in and ham it up (Depp, who can't play anyone other than Depp), Jude Law (being a piece of lumber with one facial expression) and Colin Farrell (don't these people have real jobs?). The fantasy sequences are nice to look at, but, again, as always in a Gilliam movie, do nothing for the story other than illustrate how drab the "real" parts are.Plot, you ask? Parnassus makes yet another bet w/the Devil (Tom Waits can't act, sorry, he's a smoked ham) to score five souls. Why five? Who cares. Does Parnassus actually go to work on this? No, of course not, he sits around in the remains of what looks like a GM factory in Detroit and proceeds to bore the living sh*t out of us. Then there's something about his daughter and Tony Ledger and some kind of poignant ending then Gilliam goes on for another 10mins and ruins what little emotion he managed to generate. Again, like he always does.Obviously, someone was able to look at this digital brown splatter and realize it didn't belong in nationwide release. Released on Dec 25 (funny, that) it's realized 3mil at the box office as of Jan 18, 2010. Meaning it's another gaping hole in someone's spreadsheet and the most persuasive argument yet for keeping Gilliam out of a director's chair. He can write all the screenplays he wants in his spare time--no one's going to greenlight them because when you take away the big names and computer-generated crappery from a Gilliam movie, you have another Tim Burton stinker, and we have plenty of those, thank you very much.So why did I give it a "3" instead of a "1"? a) The girl has legs that go all the way up b) The opening scenes had some promise, so I could imagine a better movie based on them c) It didn't go on for 45mins past the end like the insufferable Brazil did.RstJ</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about an immortal man who can enter another person's mind. He uses his special ability to earn a living, but little people are interested in his theatre show in the modern day world."The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" may be imaginative and visually delightful like a Tim Burton film, but it is simply too confusing. The story starts off with little explanation, so viewers are left to wonder why the theatre act seems 100 years old and yet the pedestrians are modern day. Or why the amnesic man they saved is so interested in their show. Or what really happens in those dream like sequences. The plot jumps from here to there without explanation, so the film ends up being a disjointed collection of unintelligible scenes. After watching it for two hours, I still don't know what the plot is about. If "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" was not Heath Ledger's last film, it would have been panned by critics and viewers already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Boring, Annoying Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm giving this a 3 out of 10, only because the CG visuals in the fantasy sequences were cool looking. The majority of the movie is a nonsensical mess that goes from "interesting," to "boring" to "annoying" during the course of its very long two hours. If someone had had the sense to cut out all the boring parts, and the screaming and bitching that these cardboard characters did, then we might have had an amazing 60 minute movie. But studios think movies need to be at least 90 minutes, and Gilliam is apparently incapable of coherent storytelling, so we end up with a turd on the screen. We will remember Heath Leger for much better roles, movies where he played actual characters. In this tedious turdburger he shows up about 20 minutes into the movie hanging by his neck, left for dead. As distasteful as this is, it is not by far the worst thing about the movie. I really wonder where Gilliam, or anyone who greenlit this script thought the drama would come from. I'm assuming they looked at this as a drama, because lord knows there's no humor in it. There's no real drama either. The bogus "bets" between an old drunk and a devil are so ill-defined, and of so little interest to the old drunk that they can't generate the slightest dramatic tension. It's really a shame when a lot of talented people put a lot of time and money into something that is such a stinker.</fullReview>

Well, I guess evil won.If you are old enough to remember Eraserhead, the same disjointed fantasy type of layout seems to be apparent in Imaginarium. The one part (of one scene) that was very poignant, I thought, was when the camera focuses on Dr. Parnassus (God) then backs out and you see... he's really a beggar on the streets of a large city. Everyone is passing him by. He can't even be a part of his own daughter's life because he's not good enough.Perhaps this material would be much better read - or much better written about than viewed on screen.

		<shortDescription>Heath Ledger's Final Send-Off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" tells the story about a theatrical carnival wagon passing through the city of London luring the curious and the obdurate to be a part of their world. Christopher Plummer is the titular character as dispirited, whiskered old sage claiming to be a thousand years old. He has young daughter named Valentina (Lily Cole) who's a young sprite at 16 and like a flower she's blossoming out. He is also joined by a young assistant named Anton (Andrew Garfield) who happens to be smitten by his daughter. Joining the traveling theatre is the feisty, diminutive multi- talented Percy (Verne Troyer). Hidden esoterically in the wagon is a colourful world filled with vibrant landscapes and for each guest, a nasty moral decision.Like you would expect from all Terry Gilliam films, the imagery is magical, the pacing is enthralling and the outcome is entertaining. And granted this movie is a convoluted mess, but a mess with a meaning encrypted behind the fantasy images, which might disturb some, but not me. If anyone who can give send-offs better it has be Gilliam. Though ironic at the time the deceased character depicted here dies as a way to metaphorically say goodbye to one of Hollywood's great that left us too young and too soon. Haunting image of sheer irony hangs on as we see the late Heath Ledger dead from choking on a noose located at the Thames Bridge. If that won't get a lump into your throats I don't know what will. His character Tony may look dead, but that might be an illusion, he may have had a generous side to him, but even that might even be superficial. We do know that he's been brain-washed. Ledger plays his role with charm and inventiveness and looked like a man who's heart was clearly not leaving this Earth too soon. I'm sure if was here with us today Ledger would look back and laugh all the theme- park ironies this movie makes up. But whether you liked or hated him, no one can deny that Mr. Ledger had a sly sense of humour and was never afraid to take risks. When Tony decides to be a part of Parnassus' theatrical gang, things start to heat up a bit which has been dormant for the last few centuries. When the Devil himself who know goes by the name Mr. Nick (Tom Waits, the only man who's played both God and the Devil in cinematic history "Wristcutters: A Love Story" from 2006), arrives on the scenes chaos is not too far behind. Let's just say that the good Doctor has made a deal with the Devil in that whoever can conjure five human souls to the the side of the Imaginarium will get the soul of the Doctor's pride and joy, Valentina. Tony seems to have the talent for gathering people into his dimension, and this is where Gilliam's magic stats to run amok. Though the atmosphere looks high-budgeted, but that's a misnomer. Even though Gilliam's surreal visuals are overwhelming, they do kind of remind you of the animation that was used prominently during the Monty Python days. When it came time for the Imaginarium sequences to start filming, Ledger sadly passed away and it left Gilliam to contemplate on some revisions to the script. Every time Tony steps the Doctor's Imaginarium, he changes through each appearance. An early scenario indicates that through every passage, Tony becomes a physically different person and the three Tonys played by Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law showed their enthusiasm for playing such a role very poignantly. If Gilliam had his way he would have turned this awesome trio into pallbearers, but through each sequence they respectfully picked up what Ledger left off. If that's not a proper burial, I don't know what is. Although Ledger left us, but the film lives on and it kind of reminds me of the more recent films that Gilliam has been making; clunky, half-baked ideas, and over-saturated with visual eye-candy to give your pupils diabetes. I will say this though at least Verne Troyer is not utilized as an Austin Powers prop and here he's actually showcasing great acting to actually be taken seriously (no Mini Me here). The intention of this movie is that Gilliam is trying to prove that even in our modern life where reality is top priority, "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" proves that we can still embody imagination like our ancestors did more frequently in the past. Gilliam truly directed this film with heart and rightfully so. This movie truly states that it's all right to shut down our reality and let our imaginations take over even if it's just for two hours.

		<shortDescription>A magical, poetic and beautiful movie / Heath's last wonderful performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is the opus magnum of Terry Gilliam and, tragically, the last performance of Heath. It started filming on December 8, 2007. On January 23, 2008, one day after Heath's death, the production stopped until February 17. Everybody wanted to finish the movie, to show Heath's last creation, so on February 18 filming begun again, and Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law came along and finish Heath's performance (later they donated all their salary ?$ 20 million? to Heath's daughter Matilda). In the movie there are 2 worlds: the real world and the imaginary world. Fortunately, all the scenes of the real world (which were shot in London) were already finished when Heath died. The scenes in the imaginary world were going to be shot in Vancouver. Tony, Heath's character, appears different every time he enters in the Imaginarium. Depp, Law and Farrell, apart of having some physical resemblance in the movie with Heath (same hair, same moustache, same goat beard, same make-up), copied Heath's mimics in the movie, and the film does not get affected by the fact that there are "4 Tonys". The sadness is that Heath does not appear much. The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is a magical, poetic and beautiful movie, with an incredible art direction (Caroline Smith), beautiful cinematography (Nicola Pecorini), brilliant costumes (Monique Prudhomme), theatrical &amp; melancholic music (Jeff &amp; Mychael Danna) and an amazing cast (Heath ?who improvised half of his dialog?, a superb Christopher Plummer, Andrew Garfield, Lily Cole, Verne Troyer, Depp, Law and Farrell, and Tom Waits shining in his amazing &amp; funny portrayal of the Devil). Although the movie is beautiful, to watch The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is painful, because I feel it to be the real and artistic prove of Heath's death. When Johnny Depp appears instead of Heath we really feel Heath's loss. At the end of the movie, instead of writing "A film by Terry Gilliam", Gilliam wrote in the credits: "A movie from Heath &amp; friends". According to Gilliam, that was what the movie was. The film is in memory of Heath and of producer William Vince (who died 5 months after Heath). / Antonia Tejeda Barros (Madrid, Spain).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprising Spark to Your Own Imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I came into watching this film with a biased opinion. I love this cast hardcore. I mean come on, Heath Ledger straight out of Dogtown clean of the white makeup that caked his face and made him an icon in the DC universe. Andrew Garfield,(whom I must say is my favorite in the film) being goofy as hell and showing us the natural ways of his foreshadowed Peter Parker. Even the somewhat confusing roles of Mr. Depp, Law, and Ferrell all have their moments. No disrespect to Verne Troyer, but I do have a slight fear of little people lol. Anyways, the meshing of their characters put a band-aid on the critical mindfuck that was the plot. It was very enjoyable, and understandable, but you really have to strap in your seat belt and thinking cap to see the movie for the pure dopesauce that it's worth. Forget the flaws and questions you might have, and open up your IMAGINATION. You will love this movie just like me, and if you haven't done so already, you will start speaking with quite the English accent out of respect. Loved it.</fullReview>

But this is one of the best fantasy movie I have watch. I like something mystery like this movie. The movie is full of mystery that will prevail in the end of the story.I like the camera angle and the audio effect of this movie. even the movie is kinda boring they make it alive through there sounds and the very colorful visual effect of theirs. The movie is full of humor. Between light and darkness. The weakness of the film is, there are some scene that makes me confuse. The story has a deepness that many audience ask. Why? what happen? The Strength of this movie is the plot and the characters. I recommend this movie to all movie addict</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From ridiculously unbelievable to unbelievably ridiculous !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love (Terry Gilliam). He's crazy. And the best part is that he can be always crazy, while maintaining finding producers for his craziness. I don't think that he ever abandoned his craziness, or was lazy about it. In this paroxysm, while he's talking simply about the eternal fight between good and evil, he got so fathomlessly imaginary. The mind of Doctor Parnassus, its world, and images are nearly matchless. Endless details fascinate you, like it's a ride in many ultra-creative dreams. Visually this is stunning experience, which forces you to re-watch it time after time. (Christopher Plummer) handled no less than great performance; as the tired of immortality, drunk and desperate Dr. Parnassus. The younger gifts (Andrew Garfield) and (Lily Cole) did a wonderful job too. Though, what really, and sadly, poisons all of that lies in the script. Firstly, I fell in love with that script. It's fresh, quirky, fervent, and entertaining. You have to ask eagerly; what's the whole story of Parnassus ?, what's the fact behind his daughter's 16th birthday ?, what's the story of Tony ?, and how Parnassus will going to win his last bet ? It provides agitating event every now and then, along with very interesting characters and deeds.The character of Parnassus gives many readings. Maybe he, as originally a monk, represents religion in our devilish, or ? in best cases ? spiritually empty modern days; to be like an old wonder act that nobody cares about. Or maybe that character abbreviated all the human beings into one human, who keeps responding to the devil's unceasing seductions. Or maybe he's the artist who publicizes the eternal pure values in the face of the evil values. Anyhow, sure he's an inspired inspiring fellow, and has the benefit of being intellectually exciting. However, things get weird in the third act; whereas the characters behave in a way that don't suit them, and the end is yes happy, yet without much logic or meaning !To elaborate : suddenly Tony is an evil man, and the movie's antagonist (despite how he was the romantic, good, hero of late !). And suddenly the devil is Mr. nice guy, who while winning the daughter, twice by the way, left her to live a restful life ??!! (otherwise, how she could win this life ?!). And if that's that, what could be the lesson of the movie ?, or what could be the thing that Parnassus learns at last ?! According to that very third act : Evil is kind. Some humans, like Tony, must be dead, despite their possible goodness. Good, embodied by Parnassus, is damn weak, hence created to be beaten. And good fates, like the daughter's one, happen unexplainably !!! I rather say that it has no meaning than saying this if you asked me !Apparently, something went wrong with the script's third act. And most probably the reason has something to do with the unexpected death of (Heath Ledger), the movie's original lead actor, while shooting. Therefore (Gilliam) resorted to the trick of the lead's changing face, cast (Johnny Depp), (Jude Law), and (Colin Farrell) as Tony's other faces, and ? unfortunately ? altered something in the script, which made it run irrationally, hallucinate dramatically, and ? worse ? transform the movie into just dense surreal images of which you forget right after the viewing !Moreover, I hated the matter of the changing face. Despite how lovable the used stars are, and how talented in copying (Ledger)'s style they could be; it lost the emotional unity with (Ledger), as the first lead we've seen, if not confused many viewers as well. (Tom Waits) is the worst devil ever. He's by any chance no peer to (Plummer) to play his opponent. Imagine someone like (Gene Hackman) in such a role; that could have been more effective, fertile and memorable. And I thought that the movie spent a long time to start its conflict, or maybe its second and third act weren't much satisfying for that matter.The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is a non-stop roller-coaster in a unique wacky world. So sorry that it didn't develop appropriate meaning out of that unique wacky world, to end up as just an amusing roller-coaster. That itself is more ridiculous than any disharmonic third act !My Verdict : It directly goes to my list of "movies ruined by its third act" !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the strangest films ever...yet, it's quite enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wildly strange and twisted film, but also wickedly deep and thought provoking. Terry Gilliam's wild and strange mind has given us one of the strangest but insanely brilliant films I may have ever seen. The plot is super thick with symbolism, each character is necessary to advancing the plot and the overarching character archetypes, and the beautiful and strange world of the imaganirium. Where as most movies have scenes simply to just break up the plot or action, TIODP is truly chock full of important scenes and mostly the entire film adds up to the overall message that Gilliam is trying to portray. (I won't go into specifics). The Imagniarium is also sometimes too incredibly strange and bizarre, and some of the acting is off. But the performances of Plummer, Ledger, Depp, Law, Ferrel, Garfield, Troyer, and Waits all add up to something significant and important. Not to mention this is one of the greatest casts ever put together for such a "different" film. It's a dark, thinking man's fantasy film; one with atypical characters, muted plot points and emphasis on portraying an important moral story. It begs to be discussed afterwards, as The Imagnarium is chock full of symbolism, metaphors, morals, and thought. What we're left with is a wildly original film, an imaginative mess of a film, and a brilliantly crafted and original tale of good versus evil that doesn't feel bloated, cliché, or pointless. This is a movie with a message. Whatever that may be is left up to the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A film from Heath Ledger and friends"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam is into magical and yet realistic style of movies and this one clearly has his trademarks. And what drives this movie is Gilliam's imaginative visuals and originality to it. Since this movie is not a adaptation or anything like that but his original work. And will go down as Heath Ledger's final movie before his unfortunate passing. He just got his big break and this had to happen. But for some reason he was filmed in just the right scenes to still be able to make a movie with him in it before he passed away. Which lead Gilliam to fill in those gaps with other actors who wanted to take the role in the honor of Heath Ledger and even donated their wages to Heath's daughter. Which I thought was cool. And those three other actors is Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell. And these other actors come in when Heath Ledgers Character Tony enters the imagination land and they fit the roles and look quite well for each of the imaginations. The plot is this, so there is this guy named Doctor Parnassus'(Christopher Plummer) who is this old guy that reminded me of Dumbledore and has the power to control minds and can let people that go through the magic mirror to enter the imagination land. And travels around in this magic tour bus looking thing that opens up and turns into a small theater and they do some sort of circus act or a play. And the crew on the bus is composed of his daughter Valentina. A guy that is crafty with his hands named Anton played by Andrew Garfield who will later play Peter Parker in the new Spider-Man reboot and Anton has the hots for Valentina. And a midget played by Verne Troyer also is part of the traveling theater troupe. But like a Faust like character Doctor Parnassus makes a deal with the devil, the main conflict kick in when the devil comes back to claim Parnassus's daughter's soul and Tony(Heath Ledger) get into the picture. What is interesting is the fact that Tony, Heath Ledger's character is actually very likable most of the way through. He is charming, slick and cool. In fact he sort of reminded me of his role as Casanova in the movie "Casanova". Except he is more likable than Casanova most of the way through in this. And his type of character in movies starts off unlikable early on. And Anton(Andrew Garfield) is the one that starts off unlikable. When in most movies with this type of scenario going is the opposite of that. Which makes the ending not all that likable because of underdevelopment. But that has to do with the Passing away of Heath Ledger about half way through shooting. But yeah I didn't like the ending and how Doctor Parnassus and the devil's situation played out at the end. But one thing for sure is that Heath seems to enjoy his work in movies. Overall it's a great magical and yet realistic film that has a bit of humanity in it. And it's very imaginative and wouldn't be shocked if movies like "Inception" got some ideas from this film. But wonder how this film would have ended up if Heath Ledger played his role in this all the way through. Anyways rest in peace Heath.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite the Oddball Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is a movie that will polarize the opinions of most viewers. You will either hate this or love this. I'm more in the latter because I just love how quirky this movie is and I love how Terry Gilliam used all the fantasy elements to achieve that quirkiness.This movie is about how some old magician makes a deal with the Devil and this deal includes handing over his child to Satan himself when the child turns 16. But now as this is about to come true, some mysterious person enters the lives of the troupe and possibly save the family.This is Heath Ledger's last performance, obviously. I think he did a great job in the scenes he filmed. His voice kind of reminded me of his Joker role at times though. The other actors led by Christopher Plummer were very good. I was kind of annoyed with Andrew Garfield, but then I realized that I despised his character.Overall, this is one quirky, oddball fantasy film. I also must give out a heed of warning. If you're watching this film because this is Heath's last film, don't. I would watch this film if you're more of a Gilliam fan. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

Those who don't get it are probably those who don't have the understanding of the fact of reality that you create your own world (reality) with your imagination and you are free to imagine whatever you choose. The doctor wants the world to rule the world. The Tony character switch was well thought out, except the part done by Jude Law. I am not sure of the necessity of the switch (did I missed something about that?), perhaps it was more about the production side of things. Too bad that it didn't receive the recognition that it should have gotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heath is great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>However, this film deserves to be discussed as a piece of work on its own. Like many of Terry Gilliam's films it is both complex and imaginative. The titular Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) operates a mostly unsuccessful travelling show where he hopes to send members of the public through a magic mirror into the Imaginarium where they will ultimately face a choice between giving their soul to Parnassus or the Devil (Tom Waits). Those two are having a contest for the soul of Valentina (Lily Cole), the Doctor's daughter. Helping the Doctor's show are the lovelorn Anton, the dwarf Percy and Tony a mysterious stranger who can draw punters.Initially all these plot points work well. Doctor Parnassus is a desperate man who has almost given up hope, whilst the Devil is entertaining to watch, yet evidently devious. The heart of the film lies with Valentina who wants a normal life but is it unaware that it is far more complicated than just the raising of money. Unfortunately, the film runs into difficulty in the last third as the plot lines all come together and even more are added, creating a overly complex ending where nothing gets resolved properly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Messy and muddled, but in a loose, playful way. It's an enjoyable romp, especially considering the circumstances. It was fortunate for the production that the tragic loss of Heath Ledger could be solved with a gimmicky casting decision that entirely suits the story. It does tamper with the emotional core of the film, but as far as a solution goes, it's pretty clever. It's the other cast members who I was more taken with, anyway. Plummer's character is wildly uneven, but Tom Waits is a delight, Lily Cole is charming (and utterly fetching), Andrew Garfield is... well, he's okay, and it's great to see someone use Verne Troyer as more than a mere prop. Some of the spectacle on display is stunning, but also the most problematic area of the film. Gilliam's predilection for visual overload can be headache-inducing, and far too often the frame is far too busy with dizzying set design and flashy camera moves. Restraint is not his strong suit... sometimes in his favor, but sometimes not. Despite the flaws (and really, Gilliam without flaws wouldn't be Gilliam) I had a fun time with this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing in cinema should be more praised than an imagination rooted fully on a visual world. Films whose purpose is to create images, where images are the the medium and the end to it. Emotion? Meaning? Metaphors? Yes to all that, but embedded in the images, all those things As images, and not supported by them. If you start thinking in those terms, than Terry Gillian will stand high in his attitude towards film. Practically every concept he throws at any of his films is eminently visual.The problem is that layered on that, he seems to be most of the time unable to overcome technical or practical limitations, and so the execution almost every time fails to achieve the success the concept promised.Here we have a very interesting and visual thing: the idea of one's imagination nested inside another man's subconscious mind. The crossing of a visual portal leading to your own mind. Bounding as a deep buried thing, happening on the other side of the curtain. Two worlds separated by a thin curtain, like the old abandoned facade separates London from the refuge of our characters (magnificient space, that old emptied quarter. Adding to that, the tragic death of Heath Ledger and the subsequent solution found to the problem lifted even more my expectations. Now we were going to have 4 of the most interesting actors today playing the same character in the same film! That was truly exciting when you think of it. And although I admit that in terms of continuity the writers did a very good job in overcoming the lack of the footage Ledger didn't shoot, The way they placed the 3 volunteers was really far from what i was hoping to see.Depp just makes fun of his "casually sexy" persona, something he's been doing a lot lately. Jude Law is innocuous and only Colin Farrell does something mildly interesting, but only considering his own performance, not Ledger's and the possible connections between the faces of the character. If you consider that the visual worlds inside Parnasus's mind are simply not interesting, mere digital deviations over banal virtual sets, that you get with a bad taste in the mouth. As in some other Gillian films, you know you could be watching a powerful film, but something just suffers from severe shortcomings. And in this case it's not just the execution, although that helps.We're left with Lily Cole, a very intriguing actress, truly remarkable in her own personal awkwardness.My opinion: 2/5</fullReview>

The scenes set within the imaginarium itself are fantastic; dream logic-dominated landscapes on par with Michel Gondry's best work, they encourage viewers to celebrate the fact that nothing is static and chaos is king. Unfortunately, the real world scenes do nothing to tether the film to the ground in any way, a function which was desperately needed. It's basically a moving painting.

Well was this movie good well....before I answer let's go back in time and review Gilliams repitour. Holy graile perhaps the greatest comedy of all time, time bandits a magical adventure, Brazil perhaps the best "weird" movie of all time, fisher king simply well done kudos, 12 monkeys pretty awesome, fear and loathing my namesake do I need to say it well o.k loved it you bastards. So why mention these well they almost all share one major characteristic and that is you need to see the movie multiple times to both fully understand and fully enjoy the brilliance. So I have just seen imaginarium just once and currently have an ehhhh.. Going which is neither a thumb up or down. I love the director but no matter what this seems to be a weak effort on many fronts. The story is very choppy, and the world he creates is fascinating at times and boring at other times. He bridged this gulf well in fisher king but failed here. I have to watch this movie again to see if like his other films I need that multiple view to fully appreciate the film, but the base measure is not strong. Sorry sir I love you but you did make that damn Grimm movie so the word suck is not unfamiliar to you.</fullReview>

I was impressed by the story, all of the performances were excellent, and the father-daughter relation had me in tears at one point. I thought that Heath, Johnny, Jude and Colin were all very good as separate aspects of the same character, and they all had a strange resemblance to each other. The fantasy world created by Terry Gilliam was familiar but not as dark as the one in Brazil, and I found the plot to be easier to follow than in some of his earlier films. I like Lily Cole and although Andrew Garfield was annoying, he was supposed to be. Christopher Plummer sometimes disappoints me but not here - he gave a wonderful portrayal of a world-weary old man.Another thing I liked was the locations - London featured heavily and I recognised quite a few places. I almost felt that I could have come across Dr Parnassus and his troupe one day in London, who knows maybe I will?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heath Ledger's last film, worthwhile viewing for its novelty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been well publicized, Heath Ledger was making this film when he died. But what to do? Enlist several other name actors to play his part and finish the film, which is precisely what they did. And, they apparently re-wrote the script in subtle ways because, at times when that character sees his reflection in a pool or a mirror, and it is a different actor, he makes mention of the fact that he looks different. It becomes part of the story and it works.Christopher Plummer is Dotor Parnassus, he and his daughter and a couple of others travel around London and it surroundings in the very large and tall (relatively) rolling building that doubles as their living quarters and unfolds to provide a stage for their show. Parnassus looks to be in his 60s, but we find out he is actually over 1000 years old. Seems he had an encounter with the dEVIL who promised him eternal youth, but in exchange for Parnassus' daughter when she turned 16. She is only a few days away from that.Parnassus really does have an Imaginarium. When patrons go through the mirror, they enter not a back room, but a visually fantastic world which is a product of their imaginations. But he has to figure out a way to break the deal with the dEVIL and that won't be easy. They make a bet, the first one to win over 5 souls will win, and if Parnassus can do it first his daughter is safe.But in final analysis the story isn't that important to enjoying the movie. The "real" world is dark and dirty, but once we get into the world of the Imaginarium everything is bright and colorful, with fantastical happenings only limited by imagination. It is a superb viewing experience.Heath Ledger is Tony who they find hanging under the Tower Bridge. They save him and his journey begins with them. Johnny Depp plays Imaginarium Tony #1. Jude Law is Imaginarium Tony #2. And Colin Farrell is Imaginarium Tony #3.It was nice weeing tiny Verne Troyer (of Austin Powers fame as mini-me) as Percy, one of the traveling troupe with Doctor Parnassus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has the visual imagination and weirdness one expects from Terry Gilliam. Telling the story of an old man who, with a few others, runs an "imaginarium" that patrons can enter to see their own imaginations (like living dreams), the film has a lot of opportunity for strange dreamlike sequences and elaborate, very cool special effects.Unfortunately, the movie never quite gels. The storytelling is rather murky, with unclear sequences, unexplained oddities and a main character whose significance is played up but never really proved.A bigger problem, though, is the movie doesn't really feel like it's *about* anything. According to wikipedia, Gilliam describes this as a very personal film about aging and about imagination, but I didn't get that. What I got was a film with a bunch of striking images that didn't really have much of a point to it. I never had any emotional attachment to the characters, I saw no intriguing themes ... it's just pretty and aimless.Not a bad movie, but not near Gilliam's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Other than hearing about this being Heath Ledger's final performance I knew very little about the strangely titled film. So I went in rather blindly but my eyes were quickly opened to what just might be one of the most under rated adventure fantasy films out there. Brilliantly they manage to work the story around Ledger's untimely death and you will literally not even think about and you get to see some really terrific Hollywood stars in small but amazing performances. The special effects and brilliant fantasy world created by Terry Gilliam is unique and breath taking and does all of this without a single hint of having to put on campy 3D glasses. The film will pull you into an imagination like very few films can do. The entire creation is remarkable. The setting for the film has an old England vibe to it and yet also hints at being modern day. It has the dark mystery of a travelling carnival, and the adventure of a drug induced colour show. Best of all the cast is huge and each person adds their own take to this incredible adventure. An Imaginarium is exactly what the film gives you.The incomparable Christopher Plummer is the mysterious Dr. Parnassus. As the story unfolds we do feel like we get to know more about this past without ever actually understanding his origins. In order to be successful Dr. Parnassus had to be an old time great actor and Plummer is superb and perfect because he can do dark and mysterious but quirky and eccentric in the same breath. A future up and comer Lily Cole is sure to turn heads in her future career. Certainly this can only help as she plays the daughter of Parnassus and is absolutely darkly stunning. Her performance isn't stand out and yet it grows on your quickly in a more subtle fashion. She has terrific chemistry with Plummer and also the rest of the cast. Andrew Garfield (recently crowned the next Spiderman in an unrelated remark) plays Anton, the young sideshow assistant who loves Cole's character deeply. Garfield is terrific and has his best chemistry with Ledger when they share time on screen. Heath Ledger is the mysterious drifter Tony who is suddenly thrust into the Parnassus party with the most unusual results. Ledger shows in his last performance the kind of on screen presence he had and would have. Although I still think his over hyped Joker performance wasn't as good as even this role where he really shines and brings you into the world. Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell got a lot of press for taking the role from Ledger after his death and reportedly gave up their pay cheques to Ledger's daughter. Even with that aside the three men are absolutely terrific and one of the most brilliant things to be said for the film makers is that the transition between the four men who all play the same character is absolutely flawless.Terry Gilliam is an incredibly talented director and is NO stranger to fantasy films. He truly knows how to handle a cast and create a brilliant world and tell a story. Coming from Monty Python (although sadly I have never seen any of the infamous films) he can balance comedy without ruining the serious fantasy world he creates. I can't emphasize enough how this story is so brilliantly told. It combines modern day with an old feel and is truly one of the most unique films you will see. Dr. Parnassus and his incredible world is a must see for anyone!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Farewell Heath Ledger.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visionary director Terry Gilliam returns with The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus, Heath Ledger's final performances. The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus is really like nothing you've ever seen before. It's one of the weirdest,trippiest,and craziest movies i've ever seen. Though very strange, it works.Christopher Plummer plays Dr. Parnassus, a gypsy who has a traveling show with his daughter and a few other people. Their lives turn upside down when they meet Tony(played by Heath Ledger,Jude Law, Johnny Depp, and Collin Farrell).Unfortunately, the rest of the plot is not for me to describe. I can't do it. It's a little confusing. Though Gilliam knows what he's doing. The film is dazzling. It's very interesting,and very well acted.I know that I didn't tell much about it. I can't do it. I bet you're wondering why four people are playing one role. Everybody knows that Heath Ledger died while making it so three others replaced him. But why was it three that replaced him? That's another part of the story that I can't explain.Sometimes I don't think of that as a bad thing. Because at least there is a lot of plot. Won't deny it, there is a lot of plot. But Gilliam knows whats going on. He knows. Kind of like when P.T. Aderson made it rain frogs in Magnolia(my favorite movie)and nobody knew why(though I actually do know why). It's not a bad thing necessarily.The acting is good. Heath Ledger is delightful. Though I didn't see the twist coming. Which is also a good thing. If you're on acid and you watch this movie,you'll love it. Even if you're not you will too. Heath Ledger's final performance is a good one. Gilliam does a good job with this movie as he does all the time. The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus,on the whole, is a visual thrill.The Imaginariusm of Dr. Parnassus:A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A beautiful, mesmerizing "story" that makes you simultaneously feel young and old, innocent and remorseful. Gilliam has not delivered such a unique and personally, stylistic film since Time Bandits (not that I have not completely enjoyed every other film that he has made). I was never really sure where the plush and unpredictable, conflicted natures of each character would lead them and that amounted to a film possessing depth, sincerity and tension. I felt he was digging deep within himself, as was the cast and many of the symbolic/ metaphoric (Gilliam-centric) roles from past projects return again and are brought to fruition. The characters, all wanders combating the outcomes of their past actions or lack there of, occupy the peripheries of the everyday and nomadically populate a child-like, phantasmagoric landscape of abandoned dreams and hollow fantasies and walk paths that cross and lead them on journeys that both conclude and start again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" should have been a layup for director Terry Gilliam, who by narrative design essentially gave himself free reign to create the sort of incredible dark fantasy worlds he's known for, but the film is as rickety as the thousand year-old doctor himself, with flaws that reach above and beyond the loss of star Heath Ledger, who died halfway through the production. What really kills "Parnassus" is, ironically enough, a lack of imagination.Maybe chalk it up to a folly of the digital age, but seeing Gilliam, who animated the charming collage sequences for "Monty Python's Flying Circus" way back when, and crafted the practical models, sets, and effects for "Brazil," resort to CGI feels flat out lazy. The truth is that the physical set design for Dr. Parnassus' circus trailer, a sort of large scale pop-up book, is far more imaginative than the world that exists on the other side of his magic mirror. These dreamscapes generally feel empty, with giant, computer-generated symbols of their visitor's subconscious floating desolately in a brightly colored vacuum. The environments lack tactility, giving everything the rounded, plastic look of recent Tim Burton films. Really the only thing that would have made the sequences interesting would be to have seen them achieved practically.But what really makes "Parnassus" a disappointment is its plot, which begins subtle, minimalistic, and intriguing, and spirals into talky, convoluted, and boring. Gilliam structures the script not in the traditional arc, but rather in an upside-down pyramid, piling layer upon layer until the story can't help but topple. To begin, there's the traveling imaginarium, run by the titular Dr. Parnassus (Christopher Plummer), his daughter Valentina (Lily Cole), his barker Anton (Andrew Garfield), and the diminutive Percy (Verne Troyer). Then there's a romance between Valentina and Anton. Then Parnassus makes a wager with the devil (Tom Waits, in a standout performance). Then the gang comes upon the amnesiac Tony (Heath Ledger-- though Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell complete his unfinished scenes). And that's only the first forty minutes. The plot lines coalesce into a volatile stew, eventually boiling to a fever pitch that all but sinks the movie.As with even the greatest of Gilliam's failures, however, "Parnassus" offers something unexpected, which in itself can't be undervalued. The director's sense of ironic timing and bourgeois satire is still very much intact, and setting the film in present-day England makes for an often striking juxtaposition of skyscrapers, supermarkets, and sideshow chic. Gilliam opens strong, with a raucous fight scene between adolescent drunkards and the mysterious imaginarium crew. Unfortunately, the more he tells us about the characters, the less interesting they become.The end result is a film that will be fortunate to find an appreciative audience. There were a few walk-outs during the screening I attended, and I honestly couldn't cast much blame. "Parnassus" is a film to recommend to Gilliam fans alone, only some of whom will likely come away with a positive impression. Like with 2005's "Tideland," the director alienates viewers from inception through his defiant strangeness, which is a welcome and unique trait compared with the marginal creativity of Blockbuster X, but only when backed by assured storytelling. Gilliam's writing has never been his strong suit, but his last two films in particular have felt under and overwritten, respectively.It's tough to beat up on Gilliam though, whose repeated misfortunes and singular artistic voice make him a compelling underdog, and "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" should not be outright dismissed for the risks it takes and successes it enjoys, equal as they may be to its failures. It's not brilliant, but it's different. And for some, that'll be enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly don't know how to rate this film! I could only try to rate it against it's aim, and that escapes me entirely.There is a thin line between subtle and incomprehensible, and that line lies in different places with different people. This film makes the line invisible to the naked eye, wavy, dotted, thick, thin and bound in knots.Another line is the one of placing meaning versus letting viewers put in their own meaning, here the movie excels at the latter, it's an imagination trip, full of symbols, full of ideas and settings, but not for it's own story, but for the story you want to put in it.If the aim was to confuse, then it masterfully did so, if the aim was to send some sort of message then it dismally failed.Again I say that I don't know how to rate it as I haven't got the slightest clue as to what it was trying to achieve. It was entertaining and annoying in parts, it was interesting and boring, it was imaginative and flat, allegoric and silly... Fantasy gone wild.I saw most of Gilliam's films and loved them, with this one I'm not sure... I liked it, it's definitely interesting, captivating and his touch is unmistakable. On the other hand it seems incoherent, inconsistent, leading nowhere fast...I am sure I missed tons of details, red herrings, subtleties, plot elements, things that would clear much of the confusion, but in contrast to other of Gilliam's films, I'm not looking forward to seeing this one again. I'm not sorry I did, but it hasn't managed to make me want to put my detective hat on and dive back in to look for the bread crumb trail...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Step Right Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Mention to me that Terry Gilliam has a new film and I can't help but chuckle and wonder what his mind has dreamed up this time. His past films include Brazil, The Fisher King and the underrated Adventures of Baron Munchausen. One thing I know, he will challenge beliefs and remind me that my imagination pales in comparison to the master.Even Mr. Gilliam was challenged this time as filming was halted due to the death of Heath Ledger. A very imaginative tweak to the script allows Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Collin Farrell to sub in so the film could be completed. The solution is a bit odd and disjointed, but of course, fits right in with the rest of the film.Christopher Plummer, smack in the middle of a career re-birth, plays Dr. Parnassus, the spiritual leader of an oddball traveling sideshow. Dr. P's mirrored portal "invites" guests to discover their own imagination in a wicked choice of morality and greed ... a twisted good vs. evil that exists in us all. Of course, all this comes after Plummer struck a deal with the devil (terrific Tom Waits) over his immortality and the soul of his first born child ... played well by Lily Cole.Plenty can be interpreted from all that occurs inside the mirror. It is a fascinating world and has some touches of Mr. Gilliam's Monty Python roots. Don't expect a traditional Hollywood film, but enjoy the visuals and the many messages offered ... even if some are presented in a somewhat messy format.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE IMAGINARIUM OF DOCTOR PARNASSUS ? CATCH IT ( B ) The movie will always be remembered as Heath ledger's last movie. I was excited to watch the movie though I never found the story intriguing at all. The movie started off good though I was stunned to see that Christopher Plummer is the Dr. Parnassus not Heath ledger. The movie story line isn't that strong it's the typical devil's bet which we have listened and seen hundred times in children's book but what makes this movie unique is its setup and characterization. The magicians traveling in a horse cart was interesting. Though at times it becomes quite immature during special effects sequences but nonetheless the strong presence and performances of the actors makes it watchable and enjoyable. Heath ledger is a legendary actor though it's sad that he never was able to finish his work on the project but still it was fun to see him one more time. Director did a smart move by putting Heath Ledger in real world and Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell in imaginarium world. Johnny Depp and Jude Law were good but it was Colin Farrell who truly did a great job in the ending, he was charming and cunning and gave a perfect ending to heath's Character "Tony". Christopher Plummer was amazing as always. It's so good to see Andrew Garfield's talent one more time and that makes me more and more excited about the Spiderman Reboot project. He is one hell of a talented British Lad. Lilly Cole is astonishing, she looks like a doll and very graceful. I really wish to see here again in upcoming movies, her performance and whole look was one of the best parts of the movie. Overall the movie is a good time pass, it's imaginative and silly at times but still you can see the director's vision in it. Watch it, its enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high expectations for this one,, very high!! If I had a ladder and it would represent my expectations it would reach into the skies! I have always loved Terry, ever since I was 16 year old kid, going to the cinema to see 12 Monkeys! and then I got to know all the other work the good doctor Gilliam had made. and where to put this on the list of fave Gilliam work is nut that hard 3 or fourth after Brazil at the number one slot, then Time Bandits holds in at second! 12 Monkeys and Fisher King are pretty close! and then this marvelous adventure. An adventure unlike any other one have seen!! And people are screaming for original material, and one remake eats up the other. Michael Bay thinking wow it's been nearly 30 years ago since I was a spoiled little brat who could go to the cinema and see Elm Street Horror, now that must never happen again, so I will do a remake of that so we spoil all the fun for the kids. Here Comes Gilliam, sadly the man is not given enough work, but here he is with a movie that will lighten up your imagination. That will dare you to use your brain! If you have a hunger for that, I admit it demands Braincells, and a broad view on religion, and a broad view on life. Of Course Heath fans will watch this movie and think what they will! But us Gilliam fans will have some new stuff to discuss, some new worlds to conquer! What a Great Movie, Loved It Loved It Loved It!! 9/10 Hurra. David.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parnassus personifies Gilliam, and the Imaginarium IS the film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film could have only been made by a Monty Python. Namely, Terry Gilliam, director of the sensational "Monty Python and the Holy Grail". Do you remember that scene in the cave, with the many-eyed monster? "The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus" was like that unforgettable scene in an otherwise not absolutely bizarre comedy film. It was up and down and topsy-turvy and quite in a league of its own.Ah, where to begin? First and foremost, I'm sure everyone remembers the buzz regarding this movie around Heath Ledger's untimely death. Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell were cast as replacements for his character, and I recall many many interviews with each of these fine actors where all of them essentially spoke about what an honor it was to be a part of Ledger's official last film. There were also a number of skeptics out there who were sure that this couldn't possibly be pulled off without making these three actors look out of place and as mere stand-ins for the unfortunate Mr. Ledger.I'm pleased to say that this change of face was not only spectacularly seamless, but also added to the film itself. If each of these transformations had been played by Heath Ledger himself, the sense of deception and surrealism would definitely not have been as remarkable as it was in the finished film. Johnny Depp ends up with the closest resemblance to Heath, but it's definitely Colin Farell who steals the show. For Gilliam to have changed his story and to have created subtly out of tragedy is something that anyone who watches this movie needs to understand and appreciate. It's often hard to distinguish what "good direction" really means, but Gilliam hits the bullseye.The acting is pretty much superb all around. I'm surprised that Christopher Plummer hasn't had much recognition for this film, since he truly melds into his character to the point where the veteran actor is hardly recognizable. Tom Waits is suitably eerie and kind of hilarious (in a nervously chuckling way) as Mr. Nick, a.k.a the Devil, preying on poor Parnassus with some sly wit and even a little bit of debonair charm. Verne Troyer (better known as Mini-Me) lends more than a few silly laughs as Parnassus' tiny bastard of an assistant. (The guy is 2 feet and 8 inches!). Lily Cole also plays Parnassus' (rather strange, as expected) daughter well, but it's Andrew Garfield's performance as Anthony, Parnassus' young apprentice, that truly stands out. He was able to be the audience's connection to reality, as a believable character among the idiosyncrasy around him.I also think that I'm going slightly insane. Maybe. I've been noticing lately how much auteur directors make films that ARE themselves. Scorsese's "The Aviator" is as much about Howard Hughes as it is about himself?the ambition, the early wunderkind mentality, the downfall. Spielberg's Elliot from "E.T." and Luhrmann's poet from "Moulin Rouge!" go without saying. In this film, Gilliam uses the venerable Christopher Plummer as his muse. Dr. Parnassus himself is Terry Gilliam, a dreamer at heart, disconnected, worn and world-weary from the numerous production he's helmed in the past that have been unfortunately thwarted. The old man's desperate attempts to woo modern audiences into his daunting traveling show in order to show them wonders needs no explanation, nor does the Doctor's wistful resonance of times when people had listened to him. Parnassus' desperation to save his daughter from the clutches of the devil, is then, Gilliam's own struggle to stay afloat, to recant his glory days as a Python, as a successful director?with this film as his final wager.The CGI for this film (God, am I sick of talking about special effects since those blue dudes) is as lavish and ridiculous as one expects, but Gilliam does a great job of rooting the audience in the reality of the modern-day world that he doesn't lose us completely with enormous lolling tongues, Anubis gondolas, ladders that turn into stilts, and people dancing on lily pads while surrounded by many exceedingly large and colorful pairs of high heeled shoes. This is such a relief considering my severe disgust/disappointment with Peter Jackson's tawdy use of CGI in his recent film, "The Lovely Bones". While the fantasy world is obviously littered with imagery and busy visuals, the real world is similarly full of detail that the audience isn't left baffled and without transition. That's all I really want to say about this, I've overused the letters "C", "G" and "I" during this last month. I apologize, it's just a thing. Anyway? I have to admit that the story of "Parnassus" is a difficult one to follow. This is strange because once I finished the movie the story seemed very simplistic, but the fantastical nature of so many other-world sequences paired with gritty modern-day London scenes left me very overwhelmed. I guess the best metaphor for how this movie flows would be to compare it to the literal Imaginarium itself?a monster of a carriage, rickety and close to falling apart, but filled to the brim with eccentricity, anachronism, and overall wonder. The audience is bounced along from idea to idea to idea. Some parts hurry along at such a fast pace that it's difficult to even focus on the images being thrown at the screen, and other scenes are almost painfully slow, causing the audience to drift in and out of concentration, which is an issue with a film that requires realism to be thrown aside and temporarily forgotten.The perplexing thing about this "fault" of "Parnassus" is that the quirky pace and jumbled storyline is also a highlight of the film, as it truly does become its namesake, the Imaginarium itself. Maybe I'm just being wishy-washy and indecisive here, but I have the nagging feeling that Gilliam wanted "Parnassus" to leave a peculiar aftertaste. What would a movie about alternate realities be without such bipolar controversy, anyway?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magical but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus places style far ahead of substance, and the film obviously suffers because of it, but when the style is this stylish, and when you have such a talented cast, the film still remains worth seeing. The worlds inside Terry Gilliam's mind are truly awe-inspiring. Even within the real world, there are lots of exciting details and colorful costumes. But when the characters head through the mirror into a world shaped by their imaginations, the movie becomes almost unbearably beautiful. The visual effects tend toward cartoony and exaggerated, appropriate considering their context, and the resulting scenery is jaw-dropping.Unfortunately, the focus on creating these stunning fantasy worlds leads to a lack of narrative strength. There is an underlying plot (a few, actually), but the threads are all terribly tangled and cut up, leading to a sense of babbling incoherence. The pacing isn't consistent enough; when Heath Ledger's character shows up, the film falls into a vat of narrative molasses, and it takes a while for the pace to pick back up. Too much time in the real world, when we know what's waiting on the other side, is hard to tolerate.The performances are consistently good. Christopher Plummer is especially impressive as the titular doctor; the torment of what he's done, the guilt and loss of hope, show in every line of his face and in the blankness of his gaze. Heath Ledger is spirited in his last role, but what makes the part more interesting are the interpretations by other actors. Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell all make appearances within the dreamworlds, and the results are fascinating and eerie. They all look quite alike and play the character spot-on while still retaining their unique identities as actors. It's a fun viewing experience, to be sure.Despite the narrative woes, the great cast, rampant imagination, and beautiful art direction make Doctor Parnassus worth seeing, especially on the big screen. I have to imagine the wonders would lose some of their power on a TV.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tony: "Nothing is permanent, not even death."The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus is, well, imaginative as should be expected from the master of hard-core creativity, director Terry Gilliam, whose Monty Python franchise and Adventures of Baron Munchausen defined the wild musings of an impish mind bent on bending the mind to his exuberant visions. This outing is not up to the previous adventures despite the last role for Heath Ledger and Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell standing in for Ledger, who died during filming.Dr. Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) heads a rolling side-show act in modern London where audience members can pass through a mirrored portal and change their visage and lives. It helps that Parnassus is thousands of years old, having made a Faustian bet with the Devil (Tom Waits) that requires the sacrifice of a daughter (Lily Cole) to the devil at her 16th birthday in exchange for Parnassus's immortality. Now that the wager is due, Parnassus makes a new bet that requires 5 more souls for the Devil before daughter Valentina's birthday in 3 days. Much repetition reigns as the five prospects are guided through the mirror with the major interest possibly the way Gilliam completed the film without Ledger (ingenious method).Although the film can be enjoyed as a medieval allegory of greed versus charity, good versus evil, or an extended Twilight Zone tale, it feels labored, disjointed, and clichéd. If you consider the lovely little wagon of Bergman's Wild Strawberries, which contained only the magic of a baby Jesus, you might see how disappointing that Gilliam couldn't have told the same kind of story simply and lyrically.As it is, Imaginarium is a Gilliam mind gone wild, leaving an audience in the wagon's dust.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Beauty That Shouldn't Be Ingnored From Modern Society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It saddens me that movies with shallow story plots and great visuals like Avatar or Transformers get great recognition worldwide while great films like this get squat. The Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus is simply not getting the recognition it deserves and yet, it truly excels in all that we generally want to see in a movie such as imagination, creativity, and originality. It is the ultimate storytelling experience about the evils that will inevitably judge our characteristics.After watching this movie, I have felt like I have gone through a test that tested my own weaknesses like Christopher Plummer's character in the story. Essentially, Dr. Parnassus is the Greek Sisyphus character that we all have sympathy for because he of how he constanly hopes to beat the Devil in a betting game he seemingly can never win. Many films incorporate Biblical concepts of good and evil but this film is unique for having gone in depth within the Sisyphus myth that French philosopher Albert Camus struggled to present within our society. Although it may not have been intentional, this film brings out the best of Camus's philosophy in a creatively visual manner. Life is hard when we are on "the right path", almost like climbing an eternal flight of stairs or an infinite long ladder. Although we are likely to fall, we have to resist the temptation to give in to our desires (or make seemingly good bets with the Devil).A story with such an in-depth meaning on life choices through the fantastically artistic perspective of Terry Gilliam makes this film worthy of a "Best Picture" recognition not just for 2009, but for many years in the future of cinema. I'm positive that Heath Ledger wouldn't have wanted this film to be thrown aside so please don't ignore great work like this, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Terry Gilliam's better films. Christopher Plummer, Tom Waits, and Lily Cole give stand-out performances. It's Heath Ledger's last film. He died during the film's production, and thanks to some inventive storytelling Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrel capably filled in to complete the film. While this may cause some film goers difficulty I found it rather simple to suspend disbelief as their appearance only occurs during those moments when the character resides within the Imaginarium.Gilliam is clearly fascinated by the act and art of story-telling, a theme he has addressed in nearly all of his films from "Time Bandits", through "The Brothers Grimm." Here that act is essential for life itself and the Universe as a whole to continue. The film moves fluidly back and forth from a grim but real world and the fantastical world of dreams.Christopher Plummer uses every trick he's learned over his very long and distinguished career to present a very complicated and difficult to completely pin down exactly who Dr. Parnassus might be. Surely we are presented some very clear possibilities, but with the number of layers Gilliam uses as the over-arching story progresses it would be very difficult to assume any one is definitive, and that is not at all easy for an actor to successfully achieve. Plummer shows us a loving parent, a drunken fool, a wise man of letters, a charlatan grifting for souls, a mystical priest/prophet, a homeless, penny-less bum. Opposite him is Tom Waits' creepy and devilish Mr. Nick. Once again showing us that this musician song-writer has some acting prowess that deserves to be used and seen more often.The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus is a film (or story) about choices. Ones we make, ones' we wish we'd make, and knowing right from wrong. It's not clearly black and white as I just made it sound, and the film ends cryptically enough that we know the story continues. Dr. Parnassus made a bargain many moons ago with an unsavory character, and must make amends, that's the film we see before us from Gilliam, and like Shakespeare he reminds us that the world is a stage and we are but actors rounded with a little sleep wherein we dream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry, Gilliam fans!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, PARNASSUS isn't necessarily a bad film.It's certainly visually pleasing, for the most part, and I was surprised that--especially after seeing the trailer at last and only recently--master filmmaker/hellion Gilliam went for more than the stock video-game VFX you see in everything from SPIDERMAN to the SPY KIDS movies. No, I will admit, the effects worked relatively well here.However, it's clear the problems with Ledger having died during production caused more difficulty in the script realm than you'd think, and that, in the end, the rest of the script itself is rather shoddy and filled with far too many holes to enjoy falling in and simply allowing oneself to give in to the tumbling descent down the rabbit hole.As with most people who would bother to see the film, I am indeed an adamant Gilliam-ite, and in fact find what everyone can agree to be his finest film, BRAZIL, to indeed be perhaps one of the best American films ever made. 12 MONKEYS, F&amp;L, FISHER KING, etc. all break new grounds in American cinema and are each: watchable, artistic, masterful, and wholly entertaining.TIDELAND was a bit of a let-down, though the story was simple enough to follow if not somewhat dull and at times melodramatic. I was worried after watching it, and wondered if Gilliam has not fallen the way of the likes of Woody Allen: someone who has been, is, and always will be an American master craftsman... but also someone, frankly, growing old and out-of-touch with his audience (at least as a screenwriter). PARNASSUS hasn't quite confirmed this fear/suspicion (we certainly need the Gilliam of yesteryear now more than ever, what with the slew of treacle they foist upon us in the theaters these days)--Gilliam is no Tim Burton--but, I will simply conclude by saying: (1) That I really hope DON QUIXOTE is the masterpiece we've all been waiting for; and (2) That you really needn't waste your time on PARNASSUS... unless, of course, you're interested in seeing a semi-nude Lily Cole briefly. Personally, if I were you, I'd opt for your BRAZIL box set and Redtube instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me tell you outright, I'm a big fan of master Terry Gilliam. He's in my top 3 favorite directors. I'm almost an unconditional fan but when I walked out of his latest film, I thought it sucked. After a night's sleep, I'm more conflicted about it and I'm much less extreme in my judgement. You can see several of his signature touches and themes in Imaginarium. How society can be alienating and cruel, the difficulties of being creative and finding an audience, how imagination can free you, big giant heads, to name a few. Gilliam shows dazzling imagination and showers us with inventive visuals. Those visuals sometimes look more or less computer generated but they're pretty amazing nevertheless. Those flawed, unconventional and surreal "worlds" could also be explained in story by their origin : the imaginations of people.The eccentric characters look interesting, wear fabulous costumes, but they're not particularly well developed or showing much personality. I didn't care much for any of them although I was fascinated by the looks of redhaired Valentina. My main problem is that the story felt disjointed bordering on incoherent. The pacing seemed wrong provoking boring moments instead of quiet interludes. Certain big revelations were mishandled losing much dramatic impact. Heath Ledger character's motivations remained obscure, changing and seemingly illogical even by the end. The tattoos on his forehead were never explained unless I missed it. Regarding Ledger, it's his last performance and it's enjoyable but not great. His famous replacements in the imagination worlds (Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrel) are fine but the two first ones make rather short appearances (especially Depp). However, to be fair, the change of actors is not too jarring. Most of all, the acting struck me as theatrical (yes I know they're supposed to be a travelling theatre troupe) : just a little too much here, not enough there. It was as if the actors were lacking direction.Often with Gilliam, you don't catch or understand everything right away but you're still fascinated or think that with another viewing, you'll understand better. I have my doubts it would be the case here. The story is not very complex yet it feels muddled and incomplete. Not even the clever ending can save it. I wished to be entranced by the wonders of Gilliam's imagination. I rarely was and was distracted by the CGI. I wished to be absorbed by the intricacies of a gripping story. I was left wanting and sometimes even bored. I wished to be moved or at least touched, I just wasn't. Unfortunately, this has been Gilliam's big problem for his last few movies, he directs like a god but he fails to involve the viewers emotionally in his character's ordeals. It's esthetically pleasing but it feels somewhat hollow. You have moments of wonders yet the atmosphere and soundtrack are lacking. These days, he's more like a great cinematographer in need of a better script. I love the director, it's an accomplishment he finished the film despite the death of Ledger but unfortunately the Imaginarium didn't ignite my imagination. I'm very conflicted about it and writing this review (just my own opinion which you may disagree with in certain parts yet still find useful) was quite difficult. Rating: 5 out of 10 (might go up with another viewing perhaps)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never appreciated Heath Ledger until I saw this movie. In addition, the performances of Christopher Plummer, Lily Cole, etc. -- remarkable. Some critics may have misjudged this film. It is at once understated and visually-stunning. The music isn't overly dramatic which makes the film even more powerful. Too many dramatic films rely too heavily on their scores. Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell are the icing on the cake of the movie. I can't imagine what it might have been like without them. I realize they filled-in for Ledger after his death but their performances are seamless and fit perfectly into the storyline. I suspect this will be film more appreciated in the future than today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Minor Masterpiece from Gilliam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I appreciate that Terry Gilliam's movies are not to everyone's taste but I really admire him for daring to be original. Not that original is enough in itself, there obviously has to be something gripping, entertaining or wonderful on the screen to justify the investment of time and money (mine and yours) but for me, this movie typically has those magic ingredients. It has an amazing cast (obviously including the late Heath Ledger), a plot that makes sense (but you have to concentrate a little at times) and some ravishing fantasy scenes. Gilliam paints on a large, colourful canvas and his imagination is skilfully translated on to the screen. I'm sure that anyone with a real interest in the cinema will find this movie as impressive as I did, please give it a try if you get the chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my 50th film this year, and by coincidence I decided to watch a film that has intrigued me for some time. There was a lot of talk about this one due to the unfortunate death of Heath Ledger. I know it didn't get a rapturous reception, but I have been keen to see it ever since. I'll give you my thoughts later, but here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please attract some punters for the show while I write the next paragraph).Doctor Parnassus is a very old man, over a thousand years old, and he runs a travelling show, The Imaginarium. Putting himself in a trance-like state, he can make the dreams of anyone that walks through the magic mirror come to life. He is helped by his daughter, Valentina, a young man, Anton, and a man of small stature, Percy. One day they come across a man who is not in the best of situations, who they rescue. It turns out his name is Tony and he offers to help them with the show. Meanwhile, Doctor Parnassus is keeping a secret from his daughter, a secret involving the mysterious character known as Mr. Nick. Valentina will soon be sixteen and the Doctor is getting more desperate to get more people to try his show. I will leave my short summary there so as not to upset the spoiler police out there.I always enjoy the visual spectacle of a Terry Gilliam film, he has such wonderful vision and always comes up with something both spectacular and utterly crazy at the same time. The scenes inside the Imaginarium and certain other key scenes are truly spectacular, a great feast for the eyes. Unfortunately in the real world it doesn't work quite so well. Decent performances all round, Heath Ledger did a good job as Tony, as did Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell who all took turns with the part of Tony when he as inside the Imaginarium. Christopher Plummer was good as Doctor Parnassus and Andrew Garfield was great as Anton. Lily Cole did a fine job as Valentina and Verne Troyer was also good as Percy. Finally, a mention for Tom Waits who I thought was excellent as Mr. Nick.I know there were problems with the production of this film, not least the loss of one of the leading men, but it did, unfortunately, fall a little short of the mark. As I've already said, certain parts of it are visually stunning, but this doesn't make up for a script that was not all that great. I could follow the plot OK, but I found some of the dialogue sounded a little "off the cuff" and some of the characters were not fully developed enough. Over all though, I did quite enjoy it, and I will probably watch it again someday? Recommended for at least one viewing.My score: 7.1/10</fullReview>

A show with drops of childhood's books and pieces of chaos. The action is only door to dream. The cast - slices of strange novel about another Faust or Rigoletto. A great film? More a house in tree. Heath Ledger in last testimony. And his death - shadow of a baroque drama. A form of anesthesia. The rules are broken and the wind of soul spring is only reality. Masterpiece in new definitions.

		<fullReview>Here is an example of a film-maker with a "name" being given the latitude (and evidently a ton of cash) to do anything he pleases. Unfortunately, the result does not please.I'm sure the splintered and derivative structure of the film was not accidental, and had nothing to do with the re-tooling following the loss of Heath Ledger. (Such a weak and confused role for his exit, BTW.) Gilliam's self-indulgent mash-up of Baron Münchhausen, Time Bandits and Fisher King can safely be given a miss. Even the fever-dream imagery comes across stilted and uninspired, and the folksy parable he flogs as a frame for his opus is thin and goes nowhere. It's not enough.Alas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strange and oddly sick puppy of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was weird. Normally I love weird. I've seen Brazil, and Baron Munchausen, which was apparently the theme they were going with, and both movies ROCKED and were way superior to this mishmash.The really creepy thing about this movie though, other than the gratuitous sexual exploitation scenes with the 15 and then barely 16 year old girl, is that THE OPENING SCENE OF HEATH LEDGER IS OF HIM HANGING BY THE NECK FROM A BRIDGE.Then the fact that this was fortold, by the hangman card from a Tarot deck, further enforces the creepiness that this movie fortold of his death. Very weird! The movie details the very murky plot of an immortal monk and his centuries old battle with the devil over stealing souls. Both appear to be devils actually, with the monk driving his giant carnival 'people eater' around, inviting unsuspecting strangers into a nightmare world of their imagination where they will be forced to choose some path, one choice being their immortal damnation and another soul for the monk's soul jar. Rather creepy, and this made it difficult to sympathize with the old guy.Then we have his uber-nubile 15 year old daughter, who likes to roll cigarettes and seduce older men. Are some of Gilliam's secret fantasies slipping out onto film? Totally over the top INAPPROPRIATE, and really uneccessary, all they had to do was make the devil-pact for age 19!!! Then we'd all be breathing easier over her slutty seductive moves and scanty costumes (I believe she was completely NAKED in the mall scene) Heath demonstrates just how much he kinda looks like Jonny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell, which was really confusing, considering we know the guy dies during filming, and your not sure if the other guys are stand-ins for him or it's part of the plot.This movie really didn't do it for me. The fantasy scenes were odd, contrived, and unbelievable for the most part. The murky moral lessons were lost in the crazy antics of the over-acting going on from all involved, and the drearyness of their hobo existence only served to drag the movie down into trashcan fires and open sewer mains of despair.The one saving grace as a bizarre return to his Monty Python days with a dancing conga line of UK police'men' in fishnets and heels. I guess that was truly what was IN the trailer, a Monty Python world of giant heads, tongues, blue meanies and dancing policemen. No yellow submarines but there was lots of Anubis gondolas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an imaginative film with some impressive acting. That said, imagination alone doesn't guarantee a film will be worth your time. Likewise, great acting could never save a strange film that is destined for mediocrity. Such is the case with 'The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.' The landscapes are out-of-this-world beautiful and unique, and the acting is brilliant. The story, however is very disjointed and jumps around frequently, leaving the viewer utterly confused. The movie might be worth seeing once, if only by accident. It could be a film that needs several viewings to truly be appreciated, but I will never know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautifully-made quasi-surrealistic film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all miss Heath Ledger. We remember him as one of the most charismatic and endearing Hollywood actors, one whom, despite his many forgivable flaws wowed audiences with some of the most memorable performances in recent years (including his legendary turn as the Joker in Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight"). He passed away more than a year ago, and the posthumous release of his last film, Terry Gilliam's "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" earned immediate buzz. Just like every other person in the world, the main attraction to the movie was seeing Ledger one last time and little did I think of any other motive for doing so. Now that I've finished watching the movie I come to say that even though the film IS memorable because of it being his last work, it's bound to become much more memorable simply because of the wonderful story and incredibly imaginative production design...so let me deviate your minds from Ledger a bit and focus on the film itself, which has made my mind swim in a boundless sea of imagination and creativity.You know Terry Gilliam. Ever since he became know to the world as one of Monty Python's ingenious members, he has never failed to come up with imaginative, quirky, WACKY films that spur viewers minds; from the perennial "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" to the not-so perennial but equally surreal "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas", we've come to expect only the best stories from him. This latest movie tells the story of Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer), a wise, old man who once made a deal with Mr. Nick (Tom Waits), the devil, and earned immortality. Tired of life he asks for mortality again, and Mr. Nick grants it to him provided that his daughter is given to him once she turns 16. Parnassus accepts, but as the girl, Valentina (Lily Cole), draws to the doomed age, Parnassus is in turmoil because he loves her too much to hand her over to the devil. So he strikes one last bargain with the devil: Parnassus owns an imaginarium, a circus-like contraption through which people can walk through and live out their wildest dreams for a short period of time. Inside the imaginarium, the very root of their souls comes alive and, should he wish to, Parnassus can tamper and coax their wills to change. To save his daughter, Parnassus must win over five souls before Mr. Nick does and do it before Lily's 16th birthday is over (which in the film is two day's time). But even with such a wonderful contraption, Parnassus seldom manages to get people to go into his imaginarium, so when a mysterious young man named Tony (Heath Ledger) appears and is willing to help him with his task, the riotous race against the clock begins as we, the viewers, are taken into a surreal, unbelievably creative ride into the imagination of this wacky old doctor.That's the general (or initial) plot, actually. But the film is over two hours long and so wildly-conceived that, like many other surrealist films, it eventually loses track of the plot and becomes nothing more than a rapid fire of quirky, magical events and interesting sort-of camera shots into dream sequences and fantasy. The characterization starts out wonderfully, with a certain depth and background given to each of the characters and with some emotional build-up...but as the quirky imagination of each of them start controlling the events on screen, the film forgets its depth and chooses to engage our imaginations only, NOT our minds. This is the film's downfall, and it's the reason why many critics condemn it. And those who praise it simply do so out of respect to Heath Ledger. But I must insist, we shouldn't be too harsh on the film. After all, it IS surrealism, and did we condemn Luis Bu?uel and Salvador Dalí for not injecting depth and intelligence into their splendid "Un Chien Andalou"? No! Surrealism should never make sense because our minds and imaginations rarely do so and, let's face it, we do NOT live in a world with entirely round characters and where all ends meet at the end of the story.Besides, an intelligent story has never been Gilliam's strongest appeal. He's well known for his quirky brilliance (possibly rivaling that of Tim Burton), and this film is, by all means, the most imaginative thing I've seen in a long time. It's also one of the most entertaining and pleasing films I've seen this year...which made me think of something: I'm usually a critic who demands depth, intelligence, wit and well-developed characters in his films, but have I forgotten the principal point of cinema? It is an artistic medium through which artists let their souls loose, it doesn't ALWAYS have to make sense. And besides, it is meant to generally entertain audiences and give them new experiences and that IS something "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" excels at.The technical aspects of the film are very good to. The score (by Mychael and Jeff Danna) is pitch-perfect, the costume, production and art design are simply superb, and the acting is very good too. Just as a side note, I recently learned that since the film wasn't completed before Ledger's death, the plot was modified to incorporate three other actors in his same role (Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law), a physical change which Ledger character goes through whenever he walks into Parnassus' imaginarium. I tell you, the way Terry Gilliam saved the film by his inventive plot change still marvels me...and, needless to say, it helps the surrealism and imagination of the movie.See it. It's not THE best film of the year, and it's not like it will spur you into deeper thought and neither will it move and touch you, but I guarantee you won't be disappointed. Rating: 3 stars and a half out of 4!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Imaginarium Of Doctor Parnassus is a showpiece reminding that the Gilliam of old could just be in line for a timely resurrection.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can an old man whose curse is being immortal take you to faraway lands where imagination meets surrealism, where the mere sight of otherworldly yet familiar symbolic representations of reality is able to make a grown man squeal in orgasmic delight? If your believe so, then take a peek into the looking glass as created by one of the old masters of "fantastical artisticism" ? Terry Gilliam.Gilliam, whose film credits include masterpieces such as Monty Python And The Holy Grail (1975) and Twelve Monkeys (1995), is also capable of unspeakable duds such as Tideland (2005), and The Brothers Grimm (2005). His new film, The Imaginarium Of Doctor Parnassus, sees the auteur back in fine "auteur" form. It is the kind of film which reminds us that no matter how frustratingly bohemian some of his pictures are, the fierce dedication to his unique filmic vision of the above-mentioned "fantastical artisticism" is often understated and not fully appreciated.Heath Ledger's death made things difficult for Gilliam. However, he benefited from the goodwill of Ledger's friends ? Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell, and Jude Law ? who volunteered to take over the role of Tony in different parts of the film to complete its production. Ledger's acting is less showy here than in his Oscar-winning turn as the Joker in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight (2007). This allows Ledger's acting substitutes to adequately portray Tony without the fear of unevenness in performances.The screenplay is somewhat of an "organized mess". It moves the narrative along, but some parts are incomprehensible (not that I really bother). In one scene, a black river turns into a huge serpent-like creature with the face of Mr. Nick a.k.a the Devil (as played by Tom Waits). It surveys two characters in the scene before morphing back as the black river again. Is there significance to this action? Only Gilliam knows.The core story involves Doctor Parnassus' (Christopher Plummer) dealings with Mr. Nick. A pact is made ? if Parnassus manages to seduce five souls into their world of fantasy before the latter does, then his daughter, Valentina (Lily Cole), will be freed. Tony's involvement becomes a little more than a sideshow. His friendship with Parnassus is questionable, and his motives are never always revealed. Though his love for Valentina is obvious, the ambiguity of his character makes things more complex than they appear to be.Gilliam has (old)-fashioned a tale consisting of oddball characters set in an urban landscape. He does it to varying success. The narrative may be occasionally weak, but the director's one-of-a-kind filmic vision teleports us to his world of beautiful and grotesque imagery with the level of skill associated with a master craftsman. The Imaginarium Of Doctor Parnassus is a showpiece reminding that the Gilliam of old could just be in line for a timely resurrection.SCORE: 7.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to Terry Gilliam's mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, this is really a great movie. But this is also the movie of all lunatics. You have to understand Terry Gilliam, the crazy world of Monty Python, to see this as a brilliant movie. I believe it takes a lot of imagination to love this, but if you have the right imagination, this is just a lot of fun.Of course, we've all seen better, but I kind of like the plot. As a Norwegian girl, I often feel that absolutely everything in a movie made by an American, turns out well. So I really love the fact that Tony wasn't who he seemed to be, and that Dr. Parnassus sort of looses his daughter in the end. I really love it. I love that Gilliam has made a dark, tragic and crazy story, without the typical cliché ending.And beside that, I have to say the costumes and the sets are really wonderful. It's colorful, it's funny, and it's impressive.But the best with this movie, from my point of view, are the actors and how they did their job. They make the movie come alive, and I don't believe anyone else would have done it better. It's the perfect cast for this movie. And there's also the death of Heath Ledger. Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell stepped in to finish what Ledger had started. And of course, they're great, no doubt. But Farrell's Irish accent should have been hidden more, and both Depp and Law have done better. It's still quite fun to watch Jude Law like this. But in the end, it's the Australian prince who does best job on Tony. I might take a huge risk, by saying I think the movie would have been better if Heath Ledger finished it.But the conclusion is that this is very funny. It's fun to watch. It's not the best, but absolutely good enough. There's actually just one thing to say, and only five words to describe this movie: Welcome to Terry Gilliam's mind.</fullReview>

Conceived by Terry Gilliam, TIODP is a return to form for the quixotic director, who weaves a surreal tapestry that will perplex and polarize viewers.As for losing your soul during a live performance, I thought that only happened at Disney on Ice.

		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam takes us on another fun ride, this time into the imaginations of both colorful and dark characters. Dr. Parnassus (Plummer) leads a traveling theatre troupe and has also made a deal with the devil (Tom Waits). Heath Ledger passed away during production, but filming continued with some clever rewrites, having Depp, Farrell and Law sharing the remainder of Ledger's unfinished scenes. The costume design is spectacular, as expected from a Gilliam film. Special effects are great, but not excellent. Gilliam seems to be becoming a bit self-indulgent in his later years ? a stretched out story, with a short climax and the film, honestly, is a bit too ambiguous and deep for what it is.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

The dad asking/allowing her to pose naked onstage also creeped me out.Other than wishing they had made her 18, the film was interesting. I was worried there would be too much CGI, but it was't too bad. All the actors were good though I feel like Anthony wasn't fleshed out very well. I was wondering how they wold handle Heath Ledger's death part way through filming and they used a clever device to deal with it that I don't think detracted from the film at all.As with all Gilliam films, don't expect a coherent plot, just enjoy the journey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To remember Heath properly watch The Dark Knight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Doctor Parnassus leads a travelling show around the streets of London, where he invites people to step into their own imagination.Unfortunately I think the film will always be remembered for being Heath Ledger's final film, but his performance is nowhere near as good as in The Dark Knight, that said it is not a criticism of him the character he has is not the same as playing the joker which you can do so much more with. Personally I thought the stand out performance was that of Andrew Garfield, who we will see in the forthcoming Spiderman reboot in which he will be the title character.The visuals of the imagination are fantastic, the occupier must always face the choice while in their own imagination to go with salvation or damnation, salvation and they will come out a better person, damnation and they will lose their souls to the devil. The loss of Ledger forced Terry Gilliam into some inspired improvisation, while having completed the real world scenes before his passing the imaginarium scenes were left unfilmed, step in Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell to save the day, surprisingly this works really well, showing different sides of the Tony character and maybe exposing him as the person he really is.Good that is was, it wasn't quite the trip I was expecting from the director of Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas.I give this film 3 out of 5.</fullReview>

Because Heath died before it was finished Jude Law, Collin Farrell and Johnny Depp shared his roll. The movie was funny,romantic and had some action and mysterious in it. But still not a typical romantic movie. I thought the end was pretty surprising but good a ending ad everybody i know thought it was good too so i really recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is a fantastical morality tale, set in the present-day. It tells the story of Dr. Parnassus and his extraordinary ?Imaginarium?, a traveling show where members of the audience get an irresistible opportunity to choose between light and joy or darkness and gloom. The movie is full of fantasy, adventure, a bit of suspense, comedy and some adventure. It is visually amazing, from the CGI, passing through the very nice makeup, the photography and ending with the excellent costume design. The direction of Terry Gilliam is very good, he manages to transport us to a world full of magic and color. The cast is simply awesome, Christopher Plummer is Dr Parnassus, his performance is excellent, Heath Ledger is his last movie appearance is very good and alternating on the same role as Ledger we saw Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell, all three very good and very different as well. Lily Cole performance as Valentina is good and Tom Waits as Mr. Nick was excellent. In conclusion, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, is a movie that will entertain you with its fantasy. Very recommendable to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lavish Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>See this movie for the eye candy and the actors. It failed to involve me. Heath Ledger was too good an actor to portray his character as shown. The personality change (as required by the plot) when Colin Farrel takes over made me regret having watched. This character becomes worse than the Devil (Tom Waits)! I suspect that the ending was radically changed after Ledger's death. If you are a Heath Ledger fan, you might want to stop watching when Colin Farrel appears (no disrespect to Farrel; I blame Gilliam). The Fisher King and Time Bandits I have seen several times, and these are his films which I would recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite all the images - boring...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A story about good and evil - okay, most every story is, this explicitly so. I was strongly reminded of "Spanish Train" by Chris deBurgh - listen to it and you'll know why...So where's the conflict in this story? Can pop save his daughter? Yeah, but that's a common thriller storyline, and this was no thriller...--&gt; conflict missing - no story....Message - yawn - "god"'s way is the way of choices, yet even he gets tired of them (well, he should be dead then..!!).No-one wants to listen to "god"'s stories anymore is one statement...well, last time I looked, they were pretty bloody and unforgiving, about a jealous omnipotentor scaring the hell out of everybody (ooh I like the double meaning...lol), trying to dictate everyone's life, where's the choice in that??? I think religion's a bore...no actually it's quite dangerous (so power hungry and self-righteous), but still a bore - intellectually.I guess I'm too old for this film. I watched Brazil in my teens and was fascinated by it, I still love it and maybe I'm wrong, but I seem to remember a conflict in there and a storyline next to all the wonderful things going on...So, this is for teenagers maybe, to open up their minds and eyes about what film can be. That it carries a boring story is unfortunate, surely not very appealing to teenagers - but what do I know, I could be wrong...And it was a bit much seeing Heath Ledger fall to the floor choking, sorry, but it was...I was mostly disappointed that Anton didn't somehow save Valentina, he was fun, I liked him very much (plus, he had a conflict going on...lol).Nice acting, nice pictures, boring story. There is no devil. There is just us. And conflicts, of course. And choices. I choose to give it 5 stars, because it isn't a BAD film. No conflict whatsoever...:-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gilliam is a Genius./ I am glad he finished movie after Ledger's Death.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May 30 2010 I guess I am the last person in the world to see this movie. I hate living in a rural area and not getting to see films on the big screen. I miss all those 25 years in lived in Dallas. Working tonight on full 2000 character review of this movie will post tomorrow. wow is all I can say. I would love to see this on big big screen or IMAX. I found interesting link tonight http:// vigilantcitizen.com/?p=3486 linking this movie and Heath Ledger to the Occult!! hahahha but it makes interesting reading. I think I would have preferred the entire movie done with Johnny Depp in the lead. I don't think the 3 stand ins worked as changes in his character in the imaginarium. This is a personal preference my gut feeling Johnny Depp can/could/would/did out act Heath Ledger any day of the week. Of course I hate it that Ledger Died and I am sure the film and producers were in great disarray for a while and I am sure it took a lot of gumption and determination just to get the film finished. Its such a visually splendid magnificent film. I guess one of the best I have ever seen. Looks like it would have won all the awards except in strange year like 2010 when Avatar would be released. I guess all pale in comparison to Avatar. I am watching avatar tonight on my big screen as part of my Memorial Day weekend movie fest!!! I hope I get to see Avatar in 3 D soon before it disappears forever to DVD. Plummer and the rest of the cast get big big 5 stars also. Gilliam is a genius. I wonder if there is a making of dr Parnassus? I wonder how they did it all.. Excellent very original unique fantasy movie. One of the most interesting films I have seen in many years. It is hard to believe it was nominated for only 2 Academy awards and did not win. It did not win that many awards either in worldwide film festivals. I guess it did not play that much in the festivals since it premiered out of competition at Cannes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're well aware of Terry Gilliam's movies, then you'd know what to expect from his own Imaginarium of stories that get translated to film, stopping short of saying that they're fairy tale fantasies for adults. No doubt the main draw of the film would be that it's Heath Ledger's last working film before he passed away, and with a clever rewrite of portions coupled with Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell all stepping up to the plate to take over (and bring along their own legion of fans), I'd dare say this film had benefited from its own near death of being shut down, and probably exposed writer-director Gilliam to a wider audience.As the story goes, Dr Parnassus runs a sort of circus troupe with his daughter Valentina (Lily Cole), and together with Anton (Andrew Garfield) and Percy (Verne Troyer aka Mini-Me), their selling act is the Imaginarium which is a portal that will allow those who enter it, a glimpse into and to live out their dream life, for a short while at least, before emerging with that orgasmic satisfaction. That's the plan at least, because they only attract the wrong crowd of troublemakers and have difficulty in making ends meet. Not to mention of course having the devil Mr Nick (Tom Waits) always around the corner waiting for Lily's 16th birthday to whisk her away, as the prize to an agreement with Parnassus.A new wager got bet between the devil and Parnassus, and as if told through Fate, Parnassuss and his team would rescue a man found hanging from a bridge (Ledger), who would turn out to be their saviour as he joins their troupe while trying to figure out his own identity, and things start to look up for them all as the new teammate seems to relish in working the crowd and yielding an audience for their act.In some ways I can't help but to chuckle at the character of Tony, being the shady hero here with the coming up of a scheme to help Dr Parnassus, drawing on his own personal background as a charity fund raiser. This of course ties in very well to the local context, where there has been a fair number of smooze scammers or wayward individuals who had started off with good intentions ony to find themselves faltering, and in many ways Tony reminds us of them. His plan to help Parnassus involved the jazzing up of their troupe, the telling of white lies, and then selling them through charisma and sideshow acts in order to draw in the funds, and souls of course as the ultimate objective to prevent the devil from exacting the agreement.Despite having three other actors covering for him, there is still a lot of Ledger in the film, having each of the others helm just but a segment of the Imaginarium sequence when the character Tony steps through the magic mirror. Which of course worked wonders since each segment touches on a different aspect and facet of the character, with only good looks being the constant here. I couldn't have imagined how Ledger would have carried the role in its entirety, though it does give good reason that this was something of a perfect follow up to his Joker role, something which was balanced between comedy, drama, and the high jinks.Those who like their fantasy films full of colour, and fantasy drawn from pure imagination, would find them bountiful in this movie. Terry Gilliam scores a fantastic winner here, and despite not thoroughly liking his earlier films, I found this one thoroughly enjoyable, and am looking forward to future tales that come from his imaginary worlds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Experience From A Powerful Mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus... can't really figure what to expect. Watch it- and accept it for what it is. The mind is a powerful thing, as such is this movie. In the imaginarium one tries to be purified in mind-- but in a rather trippy fashion to say the least. This movie is an adventure to another world teeming with creativity and complex theme, like other Terry Gilliam films. The acting is great, especially Christopher Plummer and Tom Waits-- the two major extremes of where the mind can end up. And the idea that stories can make the world go round is absolutely brilliant, as well as the impact of choices... with Parnassus swirling among the intricacies of time-- through bets and more importantly the decisions he made within his life.Using the mind and picking right and wrong with the choices one is given is difficult and impacts our lives in more ways than we realize. This film is ultimately original and a new favorite of my own. I have to say that for what it is-- it is an acquired taste and needs multiple viewings, but it will leave you thinking... about the world Gilliam has single-handedly created. Generally the mind has inner beauties and abilities that everyone in our world today takes for granted. It's really quite ashame.After watching "Imaginarium" I have bestowed a definite likeness among Gilliam as a director and a writer. Overall he definitely has one of the greatest imaginations I have ever seen through cinema history."Imaginarium" is truly a beautiful trip.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is to be said about this? It's the Faust legend. It's Spinozas' deterministic god. It's Tom Waits as the devil. To start with.And it's also about the most incredible visual fantasies, but before it becomes pathetic, it turns over into slap-sticks. The doctor here can master people's minds, but that's a danger, because such things interest the devil. He tempts the doctor to make certain deals and there's a duel of souls.There's a main philosophic thought in this very entertaining film and it may be a cry for a god who doesn't give us the so called freedom. The freedom which makes us rule the world and all people in our fantasies. That curse isn't easy to live with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Splendid; Gilliam in fine form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam has not lost his ability to write an engaging story with more twists and turns that are not predictable but work within the universe he creates for the movie. The actors can act, the special effects work to provide sufficient but not overdone eye-candy, and the story feels like it came from a classic novel (e.g. The Princess Bride) or a well-known fairy tale (The Brothers Grimm on a particularly grim tear). Heath Ledger performs admirably as the flawed protagonist, Christopher Plummer as the doctor almost at rock-bottom, and Andrew Garfield as The Forlorn Suitor, but it's Lily Cole as The Daughter who really is the bright star among stars. Because Ledger died during production, parts of his role are aptly played by Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Ferrell. Tom Waits had a a strong performance as Mr. Nick.The story is the main draw though. It's bright as the morning star and as packed with Gilliam's own imagination as one could want. There's no place in the imaginations of the main characters that it doesn't go, and it's always two steps ahead of the viewer. Like the dialogue in a Mamet play, Gilliam's plotting is tight and energetic, going helter-skelter when it makes sense and converging to a needle-point when needed. At no time did I feel like it was too long or going somewhere that didn't ultimately make sense, and never anywhere that wasn't engaging or moving. I'm looking forward to the director's commentary, to hear what was going on in his mind at some of the turns in the plot. Highly recommended for in- theater viewing; the visuals will suffer when transferred to the small screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say I was a little bit confused as to why this is supposed to be a good movie. Am I missing something? I thought the movie lacked an interesting story, interesting moments, good characters, well-written dialogue, and just didn't do it for me.Yes, the visuals were OK, but nothing that truly stunned me. Nothing that makes me go "wow." In fact, I don't think I'd recommend this movie to anyone... maybe Terry Gilliam's hardcore fans... however, I thought I was such a fan. Maybe not, after all. I love his other movies, but I give this one an "almost failing grade" and admit if it wasn't done by Gilliam himself, I could even give it a score as low as 4 or 5. But my bias, and love, for Gilliam, makes me give this one a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is better than one can expect, although I want to see it again just to make more sense of it myself....This is the most unique movie I have seen in a long time. There is no similarities in this to other movies that have come out in a long time and for me it was refreshing and nice to have something different come my way.It was definitely different and sadly I think people will not get into it like other movies that are coming out or have recently all because of how different it is.For myself and my daughter (she is 17) we liked it very much. To see Heath Ledger in the movie more than we thought was great. He finished more of it than we knew and it was wonderful to see his character morph into Depp, Law and Ferril and come back to Ledger.Ledger's character is more devious than I thought and that was what was great for his part. I am truly glad it was finished.Christopher Plummer was awesome as well as Tom Waits..... good v. evil in an artistically different way......The movie was great and I am sad to think it will not do well because of how different it is.Thank You Terry Gilliam for this movie. I am glad to see it came through and in such a brilliant way!! And YES, while the first scene of Ledger brings back the reality of his loss, it helped make it that much more interesting to watch him.Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caricature Of Himself!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, Terry Gilliam has finally done it and become a caricature of himself.All of his trade-marks are clear for everyone to see but enhanced with the lifeless palette of computer generated effects.Yet the production design is not the problem with The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, it is the loose narrative and rather inept performances. Terry Gilliam's weakness has always been in the direction of his actors. Christopher Plumber is always reliable and he gives a solid if unremarkable performance. Lily Cole is stunning to look at and captivates the screen but she is absolutely lacking in any acting talent. Andrew Garfield is totally without any charisma and Heath Ledger complete with dodgy accent, is playing for laughs. Strangely, the film lifts up a gear when Johnny Depp appears in a short sequence.With all the bombast thrown at the screen, Doctor Parnassus is a boring movie. I think it is time for Gilliam to stop trying to prove to us that he has an unfettered imagination and concentrate on the more basic requirements of good movie making like script and performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's funny; it's insane, but it does have its tragic moments...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As this is the last film of Heath Ledger's performance and he died without completing his role, I did have my doubts as to how this film can ever be completed. As an avid admirer of Terry Gilliam, I knew that this film is on my top list of 'must-see'. Having seen it, I'd have to say that it's a cool, grand, grand and wonderful tribute to Heath Ledger. If you are a fan of Gilliam's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, TimeBandits, and Brazil, this film is certainly for you! Yep, the scriptwriters - Terry Gilliam and Charles McKeown ? have reunited to write the script for this film. Set in modern-day London,, the colorful scenes do bring to mind the Charles Dickensian days as well as of the Medieval times. The story plays out across two different worlds as we follow the characters -- the real world and the magical dream world and fantasies that transform from reality. Indeed, the Terry Gilliam deliriously kinetic expressions frequently juxtapose the screen! The story begins with Christopher Plummer's Dr. Parnassus, an elderly and mysterious traveling and seemingly meditating in horse-drawn theater. With him is Andrew Garfield's Anton who hosts the show to attract the attention of the passersby. Dr. Parnassus' daughter, Lily Cole's Valentina, and Verne Troyer's Percy, play their parts to draw the audience to the show. It promises a lucky participant an 'experience of a lifetime' if he/she is willing to step up to the stage and enter the Mystical Mirror. Dr. Parnassus, as suggested, has the talent to enhance and guide the person's mind! Like those watching, we, too, would be finding it difficult to assess whether they are performing a magic show or play. And like them, we are anxious to find out what happens when anyone enters the Mystical Mirror! As the story continues, the most interesting character in the film emerges as a hanged-man, left as dead. I was mesmerized by this Tony character from beginning to the end as his character is transformed from Heath Ledger's Tony to the Tony, performed fascinatingly by Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell. Indeed, multiple actors playing one role is not unknown as Todd Haynes had applied that formula in his 'I'm Not There.' All four actors deliver a very mysterious and charmingly handsome Tony before the audience's eyes, keeping the audience guessing who Tony really is and whether he really means well in his dept to the troupe. Indeed, all the Tony characters are amazingly captivating as we watch Tony pass through his realms of imagination. It is the final face change of Tony going through his last dream sequence that finally exposes his true color and motive. The story has a love triangle gist to it; it is magical and stylistic in its appeal, and it swoops up mystery, fantasies, thrills and suspense. Dr. Parnassus is a very complex character. He relies on his tarot cards and never rejects any high-stakes bet. And the last tarot card he has is the card of the Hanged Man, or the Traitor. Who is the Hanged Man in this film? Ha, can Dr. Parnassus ever learn from his grave mistakes and judgment or from his moral missteps? Will he risk his daughter's fate with his third bet? With the appearance of Tom Waits' Mr. Nick, how Dr. Parnassus has sold his soul, and the consequences thereof, begin to unravel. The fantasy scenes do remind me of Sam's dreamworld in Gilliam's Brazil. Any character, passing through the Imaginarium's magic mirror, would encounter his/her dreamlike scenes that range from landscapes with very dark tones to those with soft-muted pastel palette of colors. In all, the color schemes are immensely extraordinary! Every dream composition, with its twist and turn, is phenomenal to perceive and experience. In a strangely effective and striking way, all the characters in their dream-phases feel like they exist in various forms of Wonderland. It is these scenes that separate them from reality. challenging the viewers to look closely at their personalities, inner-selves, and inner-motives. The sound scores of Jeff and Michael Danna flow well with the scenes. Director Terry Gilliam has, indeed, created a very sophisticated film with an amazing aesthetic appeal, without sacrificing his storytelling. The special effects are spectacularly impressive; the role played by every member of the cast is interesting and very memorable The themes of imagination and its importance, indebtedness, moral judgment, and the consequences of excessive alcohol-intake, are so brilliantly and interestingly conveyed, at the same time leaving us with a reminder that stories will outlive everything that dies. Every scene and every character in this film does bring surprises a heap of surprises to the story. Indeed, I was totally entertained! The film's 122 minutes passed quickly for me last night, and though it was past 11:30 pm when the film ended, people were still hanging around the theater lobby, and on the street, talking and discussing the film. I learned that Gilliam had contributed to some fragments of a few of the songs in the film. And that the Tony character may be based on Tony Blair, and that the Dr. Parnassus character may be autobiographical of Gilliam.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It just didn't gel. A lot of the scenes feel extremely clumsy like a monstrous giant trying to do origami.The plot is incoherent. One moment the girl is trying to kill "Tony" - the next she is seducing him. Finally, it made no sense that the devil after outwitting "the Doctor" chooses to release his daughter by getting him to help kill Tony.Its a stupid and shallow Deux Ex Machima idea - and makes no sense, as the daughter was the one who helped saved Tony at the start.Some good points. I liked the idea generally speaking. I thought the characters were marvelous drawn up. The costume, set design was fantastic. I thought Jude Law gave a great performance. And Plummer did a good job as "The Doctor".But Heath Ledger's performance was not so great. The character of Anton was irritating and his eventually fate so clichéd.Some people will say this movie is very clever or try and gild it with existentialism or some other mumbo jumbo clap trap philosophy. I'm going to call it for what it is - "The Emperor has no clothes." Now that's a laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Odd Movie From Terry Gilliam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! I have to watch it three times to get the idea from thiz movie. Usually, it's very very rare that there's movie that I couldn't understand right away. If you haven't seen thiz one and would like to watch thiz movie, my suggestion is you better read the synopsis first. Thiz is ultimate Terry Gilliam's movie! Terry Gilliam as we know him before, he is a visionary and peculiar Director at the same time. His previous movies are the sensational "Twelve Monkeys" (1995) and "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" (1998). Even for thiz time, Gilliam arranges all scenes in strange perspectives. He doesn't seem to care whether or not the audience will be able to understand, he just keeps putting all of his scenes and tells it boldly without proper explanations. Even more, most of the dialogue is extremely poetic. A long time ago, Dr. Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) who is the leader behind the travelling show, bargained his immortality and youth with Mr. Nick (Tom Waits) who is the devil in human form, in order to marry a woman he loves. On the exchange, he must give away his daughter Valentina (Lily Cole) when her age reaches sixteen. Now the time is near, how he retrieves his daughter's soul from the devil. Lily Cole's performance as the daughter is surprisingly adorable able to represent all the emotions very well. The most interesting part is that thiz movie is starred by the late Heath Ledger. By the time of his tragic death, thiz movie was not finished yet. So Gilliam creatively changed the storyline and replaced Ledger's character with three other Actors all at once, they are Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrel. In the end, I actually like thiz movie, because it has shown that Gilliam is brave enough to keep his unique characteristic and makes all directions are unpredictable. But in the same time, I have doubt his survival for the coming years, if he's still going to make thiz kind of movie. How talented Director like him hasn't broken Box Office records yet? Or maybe he even isn't interested to do so at the first place. Like Heath Ledger's character once said, "The Imaginarium does not cost a thing. We're not here for the money"?!

		<fullReview>The Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus : The story explained This film, by some critics, been described as a film of little substance but amazing visuals, I have to disagree? I fear those critics fail to pull out thestory from the imagination of a drunken Parnassus. Yes. Dr Parnassus is a drunk, whose vivid imagination blurs the borders between fact &amp; fiction. The true plot of the film reads as follows: After the death of his wife (whilst giving birth to his daughter, Valentina) Parnassus spirals into depression, a hopeless drunk &amp; an addicted gambler he becomes a homeless con-man taken in under the wing of his dwarf friend Percy. Chased by volatile crowds &amp; constantly being moved on by 'filth' (police) Parnassus wonders the streets of London with a traveling show.As fate may have it, the unlikely bunch; Parnassus, Percy, Anton &amp; Valentina meet Tony. Tony, on the run from the law (for embezzlement) &amp; hunted by loan sharks, seeks anonymity in the traveling troupe.Valentina's admirer Anton, is slowly pushed away as Tony's seductive character hauls her into a romantic whirlwind affair. However it's not long until Anton discovers Tony's sordid past &amp; his criminality is revealed! Valentina's illusion is shattered &amp; Parnassus seeing the pain of his daughter seeks murderous revenge upon Tony. Whilst in a drunken stupor Parnassus collapses into a state of unconsciousness - Valentina fearing her father is dead &amp; blaming herself, flees with Anton to start a new life.The paramedics cart Parnassus off to recovery but as soon as he leaves their care he is back on the bottle &amp; to the streets, a life of homelessness &amp; handouts which he knows so well. For years he searches for Valentina &amp; whilst begging in the streets he catches sight of his daughter - Parnassus follows her and sees the new family which she has created? Enlightenment hits as he sees how he has held her back &amp; without contact returns to the streets to wander with Percy. Well without a dwarf he would have to find a midget!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would of gave this movie a 10 out of 10 if there wasn't for a few problems. But i must say this is a great film and must see for all open minded people who believe in magic. Heath ledger once again made it but the other 3 Tony's have problemsEven though i think it was very clever how they finished this film without heath ledger i think they could of got better actors for the role of the other 3 Tony's.Johhny depp was fine and put a smile on my face but Jude law and Colin Farrell ruined it for me as they just seemed too different and i felt the magic disappear.The plot was a little twisted and i wasn't sure what was happening from time to time but you had to much to look at to care what the story actually was.a must see by everyone at least once wherever you like it or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very strange but overall boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen most of Terry Gilliams movies, so i knew what to expect, but after watching The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus it really left me somewhat disappointed and, well, uninvolved.The main problem for me was that i couldn't relate to any of the characters. The performances of all actors where quite good, but the movie was so fast paced and the character building scenes so short and unimaginative that there wasn't any room for character development or even proper introduction. The unveiling of Tony being evil also seemed badly constructed and backed up. I also didn't at all get the good/evil choices which the characters had to make in the imaginary world:"Shoe lady": Evil: Having sex with the man of your dreams. Good: Becoming famous in order to be remembered and thus gain "immortality".Russians: Evil: Coming home to your mother. Good: Live out your violence and aggressions as a brutal beating policemen.That movie was strange on all levels (visually, story wise, characters, pacing, underlying messages, ...) and quite boring.6/10 for the good performances and somewhat interesting (bud badly executed) concept.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that you could certainly tell that this movie came from the same mind that brought us the likes of Brazil and Time Bandits.Certainly not a "feel good holiday movie" by any means, and mind-altering substances are not recommended as the plot is hard enough to follow stone sober.That said, I'd have to agree that this is a movie that will take more than one viewing, and likely some discussion to properly digest. It purposefully leaves quite a bit up to your imagination, and forces you to think -- which can be distasteful to most North American movie-goers.It would have been nice to have a little more back story on Tony and Dr. Parnassus, and perhaps some explanation of Tony's whistle, Dr. Parnassus' powers, and why such an accomplished monk would make a deal with the devil in the first place. Was Tony a good guy or a bad guy? How come the devil used modern day language and was smoking a cigarette at Dr. Parnassus' monastery 1000 years ago?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching Dr. Parnassus was, for me, like drinking apple juice. You're sitting there thinking "Wow, I'm really enjoying this great apple juice- but you know, it could be CIDER." To give a short synopsis, Parnassus is trying to be a quirky, symbolic film, one that revels in its own weirdness, a film with magnificent ideas and imagination.Well, the film's ideas ARE brilliant. The way those ideas come together, however, is messy and flawed. The things that should be immediately clear are not, and a lot of things that should have been left unclear aren't. To explain, the normal, ordinary facts of the story are unclear and confusing, while the quirky symbolism- the bit that's actually meant to be unclear- leaves nothing to the imagination.Example: In one symbolic scene, a character is shown climbing a gigantic ladder into the clouds. "Ohoho, it's a metaphor for the ladder to success!" I chuckled to myself, feeling smart for getting it- Until a booming narrator voice chimed in. "CLIMB THAT LADDER TO SUCCESS! SEE, IT'S SYMBOLISM! GET IT? GET IT!?" Example: The main character makes a bargain- eternal youth in return for his soul- with Mr. Nick, a shifty, mustachioed'd figure dressed all in black. Having trouble figuring out who this villain is? Well, no need to worry, because the film immediately clears it up- He's the Devil, for your information. Duh.In comparison, the things that we SHOULD get immediately- the details of the plot- are often muddled or misjudged. Example: I am still not sure where one of the characters is meant to have come from, or where exactly he went.It's small things like these that made me cringe at the wasted potential of the film. But, below its potential, it's still a great film. The films ideas are brilliant, and you can still see them shining there in the film, even if it's through glass that's a bit muddy. There are scenes where it really does fully rise to its potential, and the symbolism becomes delicious and satisfying.So, go see it. It's not perfect, but it's wonky, unclear, muddled, greatness. And I think I might prefer that to a movie that aimed low and made it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My daughter wanted to see this movie so we had a girl's afternoon out. Also I had heard that it was pretty good. Well maybe a few people liked it cause it came into theaters without fanfare and the seats were mostly empty where we saw it (also there weren't many showtimes to choose from). The story, at least in the beginning, had a certain real appeal, especially for those of us who miss the HBO series Carnivale and wish it could have gone on longer. It has similar themes as that great series and I sat in anticipation that I would like this as much. But alas the story deteriorated from what could have been a wonderful morality tale to nothing. The changing appearance of Heath Ledger was done well and didn't detract from the movie; the story just didn't fulfill my expectations. Too bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2:02, PG-13) ? Fantasy: Supernatural, 2nd string, original, OSIT cynicsThis movie will inevitably be known as Heath Ledger's last rather than as Terry Gilliam's most recent. Too bad, because Ledger died during the filming, and his influence on the final product was severely curtailed, whereas Gilliam's hand is visible everywhere.We open on a horse drawing what appears to be a huge 4-metre-tall wooden shipping crate down a cobblestoned London street. Our initial impression of the Victorian Era is quickly quashed as the focus shifts to a digital wristwatch on a street person in the immediate foreground. And we soon realize it's no crate, either, as it stops in front of a tawdry neon-lit bar and creaky clockwork unfolds it into a shabby performing stage. It's the traveling wonder show of Dr. Parnassus, clearly fallen on hard times. But he keeps plugging because, as he says, "You can't stop stories.".The haggard Parnassus (Christopher Plummer, 45 years removed from his most famous role as Baron von Trapp and looking every bit of it) is assisted by his barker, Anton (Andre Garfield), dressed as the god Mercury; his pretty teenage dotter Valentina (Lily Cole), known as "Scrumpie" (short for "scrumptious"); and general factotum, cynic, and Greek chorus Percy (Verne Troyer). But this is no ordinary carny sideshow. It turns out that Parnassus has struck a deal with the devil, Mr. Nick (Tom Waits), and become immortal. We gradually learn that his half of the bargain is to part with his 1st-born child when she turns 16, an event due up any day now.Also, somewhere along the line, he's developed the ability to facilitate the creation of wondrous worlds from the imaginations of his customers who pass thru a mylar-film mirror on his wagon into physically impossible huge spaces on the far side. What they see there depends on who they are. The 1st patron, a young drunken guy, is initially plucked into space by giant jellyfish, then ends up in a wilderness replete with empty bottles; later a high-society matron finds herself in a Wonderland-like landscape populated by giant high- heeled shoes; and there's more.The troupe rescues the white-suited Tony (Heath Ledger), whom they find hanging from a noose under a bridge. Tony claims to have amnesia, but it's soon apparent that he's got a knack for sales and promotion as, apparently out of gratitude, he shows the gang how to appeal to a wealthier clientele.That's as far as I'll go describing the plot, which just gets weirder and weirder. But the story is really secondary to the intricate and bizarre worlds beyond the good doctor's mirror, prominently featuring the giant body parts Gilliam is so fond of.Tony accompanies 3 clients into the Imaginarium, and he magically assumes a different aspect in each case, 1st of Johnny Depp, then Jude Law, and finally Colin Farrell. These substitutions were forced on Gilliam due to Ledger's death, but they actually add to the generally off-kilter feeling of the trips.I can't give this movie a very high rating, because the plot just wandered wildly all over the map, and the characters kept changing attitudes and motivations for no apparent reason, but the settings were certainly intriguing. I think producer-director Gilliam (who co-wrote with Charles McKeown) would be better served if he stuck to his strengths in directing and production design and got a real writer (or at least an editor) to firm up the script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gilliam's late career masterpiece finally arrives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been literally years since I've seen a movie in the theater that gave me the kind of joy that this film has brought to my life. This is it -- the movie I've been waiting for since "Adventures of Baron Munchausen." All the other films Terry Gilliam has done in the meantime -- some good, some indifferent, but mostly just not 100% Gilliam -- are swept aside and it's as if we're picking up where we left off with "Brazil" and "Munchausen." This is both his most personal and his best film since that time, and with this film and "Tideland" Gilliam seems to be entering a late career peak that's just as impressive as his heyday -- less purely entertaining, but even more challenging and beautiful.For the time being, "Dr. Parnassus" is known as Heath Ledger's last movie, and the few people who have actually heard of the film (the promotion has been non-existent, reminding one of "Munchausen" in more ways than one) are asking me how his performance was, I'd be amiss to not talk about that right off the bat. Mr. Ledger is as good in this film as he's ever been in any film. It's only a disappointment that he didn't get to follow the character all the way through to the end -- basically this character is like the mirror image reverse of the Jeff Bridges character in "Fisher King," and the role is performed equally brilliantly. Ledger's death necessitated replacements for the effects sequences of the film, and of the three performers I'm surprised to report that Jude Law was the most effective in my opinion. Where Depp is effortlessly suave in his short scene to an extent that almost rubs off as lazy, and Colin Farrell runs about with more of an air of anxiousness than true panic, Law totally nails the confusion and projected illusions of his character in the one scene that I think holds up to what Ledger would actually have done with it. Law shares this scene with Andrew Garfield, a performer I've not seen before but who contributes some of the very strongest moments in the film. His relationship with the Ledger character and Lily Cole's ingénue is one axis of the movie, and the good/evil dichotomy between Chris Plummer's wizened and weary Dr. Parnassus and Tom Waits' equally weary devil is the other. Verne Troyer is really amusing and gives a good performance as Parnassus' omniscient assistant, a character who presents mysteries that the film deliberately leaves unexplained. And Lily Cole is a vision of 19th Century beauty rare to behold; she seems promising as an actress as well.Visually the film is very unique, while at the same time reminding one at times of Fellini and Bergman as well as other Gilliam films, particularly "Baron Munchausen" and "The Fisher King." For while Ledger's Tony spiritually resembles Bridges' disgraced radio DJ, he physically represents the homeless lunatic Robin Williams in the same film. And our Good doctor is very close to the good Baron, a ruined idealist always stopping halfway through telling a wonderful story. It's impossible not to read some autobiography into this after all these years of following the frustrating but glorious career of Mr. Gilliam himself.I wasn't thinking about Mr. Gilliam while I was watching the film though, and I wasn't really thinking as much about the characters either as about myself. It was a movie that for me I found impossible not to take personally, to look at it and relate everything immediately to experiences I've had, am having, or hope to have. I've always been attracted to stories about worlds-within-worlds, breaking the fourth wall, reaching through the medium and transcending it. And that's what "Imaginarium" is all about -- taking you through the looking glass because just like the imaginarium, you're always going to see a bit of what you bring in yourself in a good movie. I think that's always been part of Gilliam's problem with certain audiences, because a lot of people only want to go to the cinema to be distracted, to forget about themselves and to become interested in characters going through involving drama. This film is basically the epitome of the best of what Gilliam has always done, because it remains above any one particular character and always keeps us thinking about life, the world, ourselves, the worlds within our minds, and it's not a film that will make you forget the "real" world despite all its brilliant fantasy imagery. Gilliam, ever the puppet-master like Parnassus, manages to create a film that goes right through fantasy and into a deeper aspect of human reality than any "realistic" film can convey.This film represents a monumental achievement in the career of the great expatriate Gilliam's already legendary career. I will cherish it and enjoy it for the rest of my life. It was instantly one of my favorite movies, like something that could have been made just for me. I'm actually angry right now that they're not promoting this film and nobody seems to have heard of it. I haven't felt this way since Lynch's "Straight Story." Audiences are being done a dis-service here, and a lot of people are going to miss this film and wish they had seen it on the big screen, just like so many people have told me they wished they saw "Fear and Loathing" and "Brazil" in the theater. Thank the cinema gods for home video... but mostly thank them for films like this which seem to justify all the stupid and worthless films we have to sit through to get to a wonder like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Review on Opening Day in Australia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam, co-wrote, co-produced and directed this masterpiece of the imagination. Doctor Parnassus is running an imaginarium where ticket paying people enter through a mirror into the world of his mind and their imagination. He runs his show with Anton a harlequin like clown, Valentina his daughter and Percy a vertically challenged super intelligent person. One day they save Tony who has been sent to his death on London Bridge by the Russian mafia for not repaying their loan to him that he has conveniently laundered in his children's charity organization. The show of Parnassus is underpinned by his mortality and an earlier agreement he made with the Devil. Which if he loses the wager will see his daughter fall to his control. Everyone who enters the imaginarium is able to make a choice for good or for an evil end. In this way Parnassus can continue in his immortality without wishing to change the world or control it as a powerful figure. Gilliam imparts layers of history to the film, comedy del Arte, the renaissance, the industrialization of the west all sit juxtaposed with the modern 21st Century in which our characters find themselves caught outside time along. This film asks more questions than it answers. It will leave you with imagery and moments that can be retrieved from your visual cortex for years to come. Rated PG it is nevertheless a reasonably dark film best suited to adults. Heath Ledger acts in his role with grace and certainty. The sequences filmed with the co-actors of Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Collin Farrell are all edited to his footage and storyline in a seamless and plausible way. Lily Cole is ethereal but real as Valentina. Her beautiful style is made great use of by Gilliam's direction however her acting delivers punch after punch as Valentina makes do with a home living magazine in lieu of the life she really leads as a traveling showgirl in her father's imaginarium. The imaginarium is a unique idea made up of gypsy trailer, self contained theater, side show alley trailer and simply an effortless portal for the characters to be transformed by.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>between the worlds of the real and the imagined</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam has made a directorial career out of the surreal: "Time Bandits", "Brazil", "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen", "The Fisher King", "Twelve Monkeys" and "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas". Now, he adds "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" to that number. This one made news partly because Heath Ledger died while it was in production, and they had to rewrite the script. But there's a lot more to the movie.Christopher Plummer plays the titular character, a centuries-old monk who made a deal with the devil (Tom Waits) to stay young in exchange for letting the devil have his daughter Valentina (Lily Cole) when she turns 16. Parnassus and Valentina, along with sleight of hand expert Anton (Andrew Garfield) and diminutive Percy (Verne Troyer) run a theater troupe in which people get to go behind a mirror and enter Parnassus's mind, thereby experiencing their greatest fantasies. One night, the group rescues a man (Ledger) whom they find hanging from a bridge. As it happens, their acquaintanceship with this man will completely change the outcomes of their lives.It should go without saying that "TIoDP" contains some incredible visuals. To be certain, some of the most interesting scenes involve Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell. But overall I really like how it deals with atoning for past mistakes in one's life. And only Terry Gilliam could pull it off like this! This movie was definitely a good end for Heath Ledger, and I commend Depp, Law and Farrell for donating their earnings to Ledger's daughter. A really good movie. Maybe not a masterpiece like Gilliam achieved with "Brazil" and "The Fisher King", but certainly one that I recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was well-produced, and the storyline is intriguing. I like the continuity of black and white throughout the film. However, it has a few problems: it is unclear what happens to people who make the "wrong choice" in the imaginarium. Some come out OK, and some are never seen again. Also, the switching of actors for Tony is a cool trick but unnecessary for the plot, and I can't quite figure out why they did it. Did Tony really sell children's organs? Or was it just the money laundering? Also, Valentina's role is unclear. Why does she characterize herself as a "selfish b*tch" and try to damn herself? Too many loose ends left for my liking.All in all, entertaining, but not something I'd watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dr. ParnAssus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam has always been a visionary, anyone that knows his history knows that a lot of his animation started with MAD MAG. and other underground Comics. He has ALWAYS had a askewed view of Art whether it be T.V., Comedy, Comics or Movies, and he just keeps getting better. He has proved that he can work in ANY genre and I believe that ParnAssus is his latest Crown Jewel. He does NOT depend on CGI the way most do these days(see Brazil where the end scene was actually shot in a Nuke reactor and ALL the way back to "Holy Grail" where the "Bridge of DEATH" was barely holding on by a couple of screws on each end). Terry simply puts his Vision out there and does it the way he wants to, and that is MORE than OK by me and I think OK by him as well, cuz he has had some "Stinkers" past, but not many if you understand the person. He has NEVER sold himself out and Dr. ParnAssus is PROOF of that. The simple fact that he was able to FINISH this movie is a TESTAMENT to his resolve and the Friends that respect him and the actors he trusts. Thank you Colin, Jude and Johnny for stepping up to help your friend in completing this project, and MOST thanks to AMY. She told you to get up off your ASS Terry and complete this and I cant thank either of you enough for doing that. I know it must have been hard, but you SEE the friends that Heath had and Ill be DAMNED if they didn't put on there BEST for Him and for you Terry. This is most assuredly one of your BEST works, but I still think "Brazil" is the BEST, I've only watched it 1000 times(Criterion Collection of course), but I am VERY much looking forward to watching Dr. ParnAssus 1000 times as well!! VERY WELL DONE SIR.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus is one of those "Emperor's New Clothes" movies, where you are "supposed" to like it, but there's nothing there. It might be an Oscar-nominated art-house film and the "last film that Health Ledger was in," but that doesn't rescue this claptrap of a jalopy ride. I will say that people that like Broadway shows and vaudeville might like this. The acting by Andrew Garfield is refreshing and that of Christopher Plummer is solid. However, despite this, the film suffers greatly. Let's start with: what was the point? In some ways, we don't have a dynamic character shift, what we have is a temptation thwarted at the last moment. Anton and Tony are vying for Valentina's hand, no surprise there. But for Dr Parnassus, who "made a deal with the devil" "centuries" ago, there's no lesson to be learned (he must have figured out he made a mistake a very long time ago). As for Valentina, it's just another typical "woman screams at men" because they're "jerks" "acting" job (similar to the woman in the movie Young Victoria). This cliché' has been worn thin.Was this movie about "moral" values? There's a hint about taking the "high road" (working for an honest living) or the "low road" (cheating people out of their money) but what kind of "high road" is letting someone be hanged? Making deals with the devil? There is no high road. Yet the devil himself seems too sympathetic, letting Dr Parnassus off the hook and letting him have his daughter back (if he can find her). It might be the "right" thing to do, but's out of character. It also tells me that there is no serious underlying message here; this movie is just about "fun". It's a parody of theater, is what it is.In the end, there is no real plot, no dynamic character transformation. There are some funny scenes (and Anton does well as a showman and as a drag queen), with Verne (the little guy who played mini-me) representing the intended humor (slapstick/vaudeville). Most importantly, the idea of the mirror being a gateway to another world and that world being a fantasy world seems to be what this movie is about. But it's not made clear WHY if you get killed in fantasy land/in an imaginary world, you end up DEAD in real life.The bottom line is this movie combines a self-enshrining elitism with an off-the-wall fantasy that doesn't take itself too seriously, makes little sense, and doesn't have much purpose. There is no emotional wellspring to be had here, but there is a feel that this movie is intended to represent the "imaginary worlds" that some persons tend to inhabit when in an induced state. Need I say more.</fullReview>

I adore the man, and would spawn his children if it were physiologically possible ( and we got on) but I can't defend the complete lack of cohesion and narrative structure in this movie. Some of the effects are spellbinding, so it's safe to assume that a fair few million has been ploughed into it. Why wasn't some of this diverted into developing the script?The acting was also terrible, but then you can't make a Prada handbag from a sackcloth. Or something. Even Heath Ledger, God rest his soul, couldn't rescue a script this bad, and it's lamentable that this is his last feature.The vast majority of the film passes without the introduction of a storyline, and when it does it is almost as an apology. It felt to me like I was watching footage from the cutting room floor, from disc 2 of the DVD, and that somewhere out there is a really good movie from the stuff that actually made it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot is a bit confusing and requires imagination and deduction to be understood. The cast from the film has a few known faces as well as some others that are not. It is rather simple, but it is told in a very dynamic way, with very good special effects and excellent camera shots that defy reality. This includes the scenes actors Johnny depp, Jude law y Colin Farrell completed. To be the last film from Heath Ledger, it is not his best. It's slow, with little action and it practically falls under the drama category. Comedy is a great element specially coming from Verne Troyer's character. If it were more dramatic, it would have been near The Fountain. Fortunately, the producer's creativity kept it being an enjoyable film. In general, this is a 6.5 from 0 to 10.</fullReview>

But in all honesty Gillians work since Brazil has been shady. There's been books and cartoon character puppets and various other schemes hes been involved since Brazil and of course the odd film or two but none of it has been worth a tuppence bubbly. Its like, hey Im Terry, Im just so wacky so even if I make something bad Im really just wacky and kind of cool. Its all in my wacky cool mind. Yeah, that may wash with the fans, but not people like me.The overall performances were decent all be it a little over acted in areas. The midget who was in the Mike Myers Spy spoofs makes an appearance here and his lack of acting ability is totally apparent just in case you hadn't noticed he couldn't act even when he had no lines to speak in the Myers Spy Spoofs.Well thats it really, a bad actor midget, and another Gillian failure. There is much room for this type of genre and I do like them very much. But its time to move on Gillian and I'm afraid I don't hold out much hope for your next venture The Man Who Killed Don Quixote set for release in 2011. DO us all a favour and withdraw from the production gracefully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this movie, I usually love movies that aren't the usual everyday predictable script, but this movie were just bad.It's as if the author is trying way too hard to hide a secret message, and the audience are supposed to watch the movie and then unravel his secret mystery which will makes us all see the truth.IT fails, because the movie just turns into a huge freak show, of unbeliable characters and actions taken.It's obvious that the first message you'll see is a fight between good and evil, however the last scene is where reality is, and we've all been on a trip inside the dear doctors brain and his crazy thoughts and nothing is real except for maybe the fact that we're dealing with a mad man.Regardless of the morale and true story, the movie should have been remade without heath, it's obvious that it suffered from his tragic death, and you get the feeling that they released it to show Heaths last movie.Yes I was bored, I'd like to quote another reviewer inhere, he said it as it is, and what you feel the director is trying to push through the screen ""I HAVE A MESSAGE, IT'S IMPORTANT, BUT YOU HAVE TO FIND IT OUT YOURSELF. IMAGINATION. WHOOO""</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK Film Despite Lacking A Good Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this film has been strongly anticipated, what with the death of Heath Ledger, and his replacements (Depp, Farrell and Law). Like most Gilliam films i've heard of, it received mixed reviews, but i still did want to see this.When i did see this... well... i thought it was pretty on-and-off.The first act was just an introduction to the story: Dr Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) is part of a travelling magic show, which consists of a slight of hand expert (Andrew Garfield) and a dwarf (Verne Troyer), plus, his daughter Valentina (Lily Cole), who, as we find out, will become the property of the devil, Mr Nick (a brilliant performance from Tom Waits), after she turns 16, which will be any time soon. It's an OK start to the film, but it's quite slow paced, and has no real feeling to it that Ledger gives to it in the second act, which ultimately saves the film.Tony (Ledger, Depp, Law, Farrel), a stranger, is rescued from death by the group. Meanwhile, Parnassus makes a deal with Mr Nick: the first to claim five souls will gain ownership over Valentina. Parnassus claims the souls through sending them inside his imaginarium. This is where Ledger's character comes in: he joins the stage group, and successfully begins to take people into the imaginarium. This was the kind of thing i expected from the film. A witty performance from Ledger and Johnny Depp, plus nice CGI visuals of the dream world inside the Imaginarium, which have obviously come straight from the mind of Gilliam.Unfortunately, however, the third act just didn't quite work for me. The film takes a twist, as Tony and Valentina escape through the Imaginarium to get away from her fate. Suddenly, the whole film gets really serious and complicated as the devil tries to claim her, and we just lose interest in the characters.All in all, i rate the film 7 out of 10, for some good acting by Heath Ledger (plus Johnny Depp, Colin Farrel and Jude Law), Christopher Plummer and Tom Waits, despite some weak scripting and conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Tim Burton than Terry Gilliam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We should look upon the work of Terry Gilliam with some measure of gratitude and kindness. He has given us "Brazil", "Twelve Monkeys", and "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" after all. But "Dr. Parnassus" isn't on a par with these masterpieces. It brims with ideas, but there's too much of everything: a traveling burlesque show headed by a boozing magician. Levitating monks who keep the world in balance by talking it over. A deal with the devil that's half "Ghostrider" and half "Spanish Train". Each of which might make a fine story, but this movie doesn't tell any one of them. No doubt there are many fine moments: A quick stop at Mr. Nick's bar in hell going terminally wrong. A platoon of power shoppers converted to purer pleasures in a London shopping arcade. Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell taking turns climbing a ladder to the stars. But it's simply too much for a single movie, like a stew that's too rich or a cake that's all icing. In effect, "Dr. Parnassus" is really more Tim Burton than Terry Gilliam. But Lily Cole, as Valentina, is a diamond in the coal. Her off-beat beauty and singular grace outshine all the glitter and the gold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've been pwnd by Parnassus.The excitement you just experienced is more than you'll get from this film, and at the same time pretty much sums up this cliché expanded into a film.For Heath Ledger fans, skip. It's more like imagining a giant spitting on his grave. Stick with the works he's completed.What other great clichés come from the imaginarium? A grumpy, amusing midget. How imaginative. No one has ever imagined that before. Let's not forget the alcoholic gambling addict. That certainly adds wonder and surprise. Don't worry smokers, it even includes several cigarette breaks.I highly recommend imagining buying a ticket to a different movie.

Nothing made any sense, there wasn't even a decent storyline. The plus point was the special effects were rather good, but apart from that...awful. First movie I've been to at the cinema, when not one or two but about a dozen people walked out. After an hour, I couldn't bare anymore of it. Its such a shame because I'm sure it could have been made into a good film if they had only done a better job of it. I don't blame the actors, who did a pretty decent job, I blame the director, producers and writers who really should hang their heads in shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hated this crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought I'd do me a favor going to the cinema today. My friends were busy so I thought "Let's have some fun!". And obviously "The Imaginarium" was the best film to choose among the other abominations that run in German cinemas at the moment. At least that's what I imagined. But I wasn't in half an hour and I already hated this atrocious movie. Not to mention that unfortunately I forced myself not to run out of the movie the moment I realized what I was sitting in. And I came out and felt mind-raped.My problem with this movie - and with a lot of other movies - is that the writers and the directors (fail on both levels, Mr. Gilliam) obviously don't understand the nature of human beings as no character in this flick is the nearest conceivable. I cannot imagine that anyone in the real world could be - and here's the point - could be like any of the characters in the movie. And yes, I mean the main characters and I mean the supporting characters as well. Oh my god, even the spear carrier were horribly fake: If you focus on one of them waving their arms unnaturally maybe you'll know what I mean.Of course I could alternatively believe that this is intended and that in this apparatus - or whatever I don't care - there's just the visible magic, but in the world outside there's the magic of the movie you can't see, but just feel. But holy crap that doesn't make sense!Then about the characters themselves. I didn't like them, because they had their moments, but then THE AUTHOR STRIKED BACK and they got horrible lines that made me hate them. Example: I didn't warm up to the main characters, but I liked Verne Troyers "Percy" character when he did two funny jokes (or at least they poked out of the rest) about Heath Ledger's character hanging under a bridge. But BAM! The next moment he has to say stupid lines like: "Man, don't you understand a single thing. It's about the doctor and the ..." blah blah blah. I have to admit, I really didn't understand and I don't understand now.I mean I do understand what this was about maybe. But if this was a battle between Evil and Good, it was the most wimpy battle I have ever seen. Parnassus is a hobo I could be really sorry for if he wasn't so In-Your-Face dramatized by the story. The devil or 'Mr. Nick' has obviously some powers - at least when he mutes monks using Photoshop - but isn't threatening or believable at all. The feeling I have about him is more like "Man, stop annoying me or I'll kick your face to the Moon, I swear!".Also, I really could have found Lily Cole somehow really hot, but if I think about her character there's absolutely nothing that makes me wanna look for nude pictures. - Sorry for that, just kidding ... there is one scene :D OK, but really. This joke is way better than any joke in the movie, even the visual jokes. For example there is one scene where a woman has an imagination about damn high heels. But those are the size of a house! I mean how cliché is this? And besides, I can understand women buying nice high heels or other shoes or I have respect for that however. But I don't think the writer respectively director has a damn clue about what he's talking about here. But the best thing is that this "snobby" woman is later attracted by the devil's fantasy of a motel where she obviously wants to get ... together with this Heath Ledger - or in this case Johnny Depp - character.The last thing - just because I remember it right now - is that even on the metaphorical level this and several other scenes are screwed up: Because the movie some when states that the fantasies are those of the people entering. But if that is the case this woman wants to have high heels, wants to "get taken care of" in a motel and wants to be famous I guess. And this getting famous is obviously the right choice, as Parnassus scores here.Yeah, I could interpret some more and of course I would go horribly wrong. Thatswhy I'm stopping here. I'm running out of anger.The movie is just stupid. I felt like the author screamed at me for 2 hours - something like "I HAVE A MESSAGE, IT'S IMPORTANT, BUT YOU HAVE TO FIND IT OUT YOURSELF. IMAGINATION. WHOOO". And no I just wanna go to sleep now. Shut the f... up, Mr. Gilliam. And I want my money back. But I still like Monty Python.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trips up once or twice, but overall a great film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, this isn't the sort of film that I would normally go to see at the cinema: fantasy isn't my thing. However, my girlfriend wanted to see it, and I was drawn to it for two reasons: the film was Heath Ledger's final role, and it was written and directed by Terry Gilliam, the man responsible for classics like Monty Python's Life Of Brian. Also, I didn't want to watch the Michael Jackson cash-in! So I gave 'The Imaginarium...' a go.I was pleasantly surprised. There is something of a coherent plot to the film, although it did lose me on a few occasions. There are some parts of the film that I loved, and others that I hated: the scene with the policemen in drag, for instance, made me cringe. They should have got rid of this.I found the beautiful Lily Cole to be sexy and hypnotic; and it was interesting to watch Verne Troyer after his dalliance with the UK version of Celebrity Big Brother. Heath Ledger's performance was great, but the real star, for me, was Johnny Depp, who played the character of Tony with his usual charm and presence.I think that had Ledger not died during the filming, then this would have been a better, more-coherent film, with less annoying bits, like the aforementioned dancing policemen.That said, it is still a fine movie, with a certain charm, and there's no denying the special effects and the writer's impressive imagination. It's better than most the other films that have been produced this year, and if anything it's nice to watch a film that doesn't resort to clichés or tired plot devices.In short: I recommend that you give this film a go.</fullReview>

It's very simple, we are all Parnassus, and all of us want to believe in a "Tony", but we always choose the Nick's way.Ps: Tony=God, Nick=The Devil, Parnassus=Human race, with our chance to choose to be guided by Tony or by Nick. great film and, of course great message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A weird but satisfying film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me this film was a new one. I've never seen a Terry Gilliam production before so I didn't really know what to expect but had the urge to see something different. The film was recommended by a local arts centre that only showed a select few of the current films so I was encouraged, and I wasn't disappointed.This film is very much a British independent movie, but with some big names in it, however this doesn't diminish the point of the story or the entire quirkiness of the production. It is described as fantasy film and that is very much what it is and I believe it's important to approach the movie with an open mind. The content is not meant to be believable but it does draw you into the story, which is at times hard to follow and you may be left at the end wondering - 'Well what has the film really achieved?' The film is very much of an 'in the moment' thing and shouldn't be pondered over.The film definitely doesn't fall down over production quality though. Despite being an independent movie with no big Hollywood backers, the set design, location, costumes and overall screenplay is very good. My only fear with type of film is the worldwide reaction to the story. As I said it is very much a British film with many local cultural revenues that may just not be understood by 'non-Brits'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no doubt of the visual imagination of the director. This is clear and impressive but it is unfortunately not matched by similar moral or narrative abilities.There is a weak and meandering storyline which seems to twist and turn and random with no direction. It is obvious that there was a disaster with the casting and the story-line reflects this.The film hints at serious themes : religion, choices and moral dilemmas but delivers none of these. But instead it serves up a mish-mash of visual icons : tarot cards, god and a rock &amp; roll devil, eastern mysticism, a homage to Hitchcock, you name it, it is probably here.It is like a large bow festooned box of chocolates, with bright colours, shiny papers, crinkly wrappers but lacking sweets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to watch this movie because it would have been the last one with Heath Ledger in it, not because it's a Terry Gilliam movie. I am not a fan of Terry's movies. To be honest, I don't like them at all. This movie did not change that fact a bit.The movie had a simple story, it was very boring. Even Labyrinth of 1986 had better special effects. I had to watch this movie in 5 times, because this movie could not catch my attention. After seeing this movie, I put The dark knight in the DVD player to watch a real Heath Ledger movie.So the story was boring. The star cast had little space to act very great. Special effects were stupid. After seeing twelve monkeys, Tideland and other crap movies of Gilliam, I wonder why I still want to watch his movies. Maybe because I hoped for something good, especially because of the famous actors who are in this movie. I wasn't amused.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This ambitious project is often remarkable to look out but is ultimately muddled and ostentatious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nobody makes a movie like Terry Gilliam. For better or worse, the director of Brazil, Twelve Monkeys and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas puts on screen whatever happens to be in his head. You can't expect coherence, plausibility or realism to enter into the proceedings; they are pushed aside for weird and wonderful images, fantasy sequences and warped stories. Imaginarium follows this trend. Too much, in fact. Gilliam's embellishments come off feeling self-indulgent and pretentious. The term 'overbearing' is synonymous with Gilliam at the best of times, but it fits the bill more than normal here. Nobody is asking for a sacrifice of artistic integrity, however a straighter line every now and then would serve him, and this film, well.Gilliam's faults begin with his screenplay. Superfluous and bloated in many parts, it can never really find its feet due to extended scenes which are really just not necessary. The moral of the story is not only metaphorically hammered home but by the midway point becomes boring and monotonous to boot. We understand that regret can be a heavy burden to carry; is it necessary to remind us every minute of the entire 122 minute runtime? Repetitiveness aside, Gilliam at least manages to make the twists and turns unpredictable and fun to watch, the final reveal about Tony is a corker and most definitely unexpected.Witnessing the final performance of Ledger is emotionally confusing. You desperately want this to be a turn worthy of remembering him by, the ultimate swansong to match The Dark Knight, yet deep down it is apparent this is nowhere near his best work. Perhaps if he got to finish the role things might have been different, as it stands Depp, Law and Farrell admirably flesh out the remaining of his role. Playing the eponymous Doc, Plummer is solid and reliable, if never overly outstanding whilst newcomer Cole is intriguing as the porcelain-like heroine; should be interesting to see how she fares with roles that require more than just reacting. The absolute standout is Waits, his smooth and arrogant Devil is worth the price of admission all on his own.This ambitious project is often remarkable to look out but is ultimately muddled and ostentatious.2.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're impressed with Gillam's colourful imagination, and his ability to splash it across a two hour movie, then you'll love this. If you regard it as a poor substitute for a compelling story, as I did, then by the half way stage you'll be looking at your watch. This film has everything in it except a decent story. It is indulgent nonsense. I have sympathy with the director, and admire him for completing the film regardless, but for pete's sake, where is the story ? It starts off interestingly, and then meanders off at a tangent, never to return. I haven't a clue what happens to the main characters. Nor do I care. It is hard to fault the set design, effects, costumes and overall production values, and the acting on show is of a high quality, but as I write this review I just wonder what the point of it all was, except to showcase, for the umpteenth time, what a vivid, wild, unrestrained imagination Terry Gilliam has. Much has been made of the mid-production casting of Jude Law, Jonny Depp and Colin Farrell, but such was my boredom, I found myself appreciating some smaller cameos; in one scene Mark Benton appears briefly, reminding me that there is more entertainment in his building society adds, than there is in this film. Next to Benton was Simon Day, in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance ? the legendary Fast Show comic. What I wouldn't have given for Day's inspired creation, Dave Angel, to make an appearance in this dreary film. I would only give this film a four out of ten. I have no desire to see it again, and I'm afraid I can't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam has a wild imagination and when restrained by a coherent plot and decent scripting the results can be stunning and deeply affecting (eg Brazil.) Without these restraints the result is a farrago of pointlessness with some visual highlights dispersed in 2 hours of dross. The acting is uniformly poor (even Maggie Steed, if that was her uncredited as the rich woman) and when the cast has such talented members it must be assumed that their uniform failure to convince is due to directorial willfulness (or maybe "won'tfulness.") The scripting is flabby, probably partly due to improvisation, which is not an appropriate choice when the story-line is based on fantasy (surely better for kitchen-sink dramas.) Crisper dialogue may have helped to provide a solid base from which to propel into fantasy. Deeply disappointing.</fullReview>

This has fully affirmed that I should NEVER see a British movie unless it's by Guy Ritchie. This was complete and utter drivel. Nothing happens during the whole movie except for random scenes of weird objects. You might want to be high during these scenes, as it certainly seems to be made for that realm. The story however does not seem to have any substance until the last 30 min when the true plot is revealed. When it is, it's still not worth it. This was the worst movie Heath Ledger could have picked for his last movie. I think he's a great actor, and I don't think I've really seen a horrible movie with him except this one.

The FX and imagination on show is impressive but there's just nothing to gel it all together. An hour into the movie I found it so excruciatingly painful to watch that I left. From the trailers it looked like Gilliam had gone old school again and given us a memorable fantasy along the lines of Baron Munchausen but alas it wasn't to be.

Although this is a fantasy film I felt this story was both confusing and lacked the depth and attention it deserves. It is quite a long film and I was left wondering exactly what the whole point of the film actually was? The acting was great but even if Heath Ledger managed to finish the whole film, it would not have saved it. I felt that the film needed to be a lot darker and really needed to build on the background of characters. On the plus side the visuals were superb. If you are a huge fantasy film fan, you might like this film. If not, be warned this film will probably disappoint. Quite a few people walked out halfway through this film, which shows the mixed response this film is getting. I just feel that this film had so much more potential but fails to deliver at so many levels. If I had to use 3 words to sum up this film...

		<fullReview>I saw this movie at a late preview and I have to say if it wasn't for the stunning visual effects I think I would have been asleep by halfway through.What do you get if you put a ton of famous actors into a Terry Gilliam movie? Apparently, nothing at all! Visually this movie is very clever, but at the same time also very creepy (not in a horror movie way, just unpleasant, you'll have to see it to understand what I mean).But once you get past the visual effects and the costume and set designs (all very clever too), what is left? Absolutely nothing. If there WAS even a screenplay of this movie, it must have been butchered to death because there is no story - there's no lead up to the final scenes. Even a novice director would have made the story better than this, I didn't even think Terry Gilliam would put out a piece of work this flawed.So, my advice to all of you out there, don't waste your $10, wait for this to come into the Redbox machine (sorry to anyone outside the USA who doesn't have these DVD machines to rent a movie for a $1 in their grocery stores).I think maybe they should have started from scratch when Heath Ledger died, perhaps they could have made a more cohesive movie then, but even then I would have my doubts this story would appeal to many people!</fullReview>

The effects were goodish, but nothing spectacular - most averagely good films these days have great SFX anyway, so we've come to expect a lot more. But there was so much wrong with this film it's hard to know where to start. OK, 1) plot - this was badly conceived and badly executed. We should have started with Valentia's birth and gone on from there. 2) acting - as mentioned above, truly excruciating in parts: Lily Cole is NOT an actress (Charlie Brooks from EastEnders would have been a better choice), Andrew Garfield has never been more annoying, and Verne Troyer can only play Mini-Me (shame, 'cos I loved him in Celebrity Big Brother). And as for Ledger, I thought he was great as The Joker, but here he was treading water, and yes, as other posters have written, it's not his fault he didn't know this was his last screen performance. 3) the script: it was lamentably unwitty and undeveloped, like a first draft scribbled on the back of an envelope. Failed to deliver any of the magic or drive that the film so badly needed. Altogether, a massive failure, which despite its adversities, momentously fell short of its promise. Gilliam has always been a patchy director (Time Bandits, Fisher King good, Brazil, Twelve Monkeys OK; Baron Munchhausen, Brothers Grimm execrable) but this was bottom of the pile for me. Sorry Tel, 'cos I loved your Python animations...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the typical movie you want to love, but you fail to. We have to face it : the last achievement of the loving Terry Gilliam is not as high as the respect we have for this unique director. The movie as a lot of assets : a great director, great actors (Heath Ledger is like the James Dean of the 21th century, and is "doubles" are the best you can dream of), and good SFX. But great ingredient sometimes are not enough...First of all, digital universes are not common today. We've seen a lot of time lately, of all kind, from everywhere around the globe : beautiful ones(Avatar), sad (9), poetic (Tears for Sale), cold (Avalon), artificial (Star Wars Ep. I-III), "comics" (Sin City)... The competition is tough, and eerie landscape are not a convincing argument anymore.The actors have top fight against the sets and make-ups : dirty, covered by dust and filth, they live in a new version of the dumpsters we saw in the great Fisher King. They all look like ghost we can't connect with, and the many "transformations" of Heath Ledger don't help at all ! But that's not Gilliam's fault, I have to admit that...The central flaw of the movie is that script too complex for no reason, that story of a girl we don't really care about and a boy we just have to despise...This is just a new - and beautiful - dream of a director with a great imagination. But not a good story.</fullReview>
