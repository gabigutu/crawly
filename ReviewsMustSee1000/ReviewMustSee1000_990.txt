		<shortDescription>Reading these comments is as interesting as watching the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the joys of seeing "foreign" films is catching a glimpse into other cultures. What do other people consider funny? Ordinary? Terrifying? "Cure" puts a Japanese spin on an idea that several American directors have touched on: that evil is something that can afflict perfectly ordinary people. David Lynch's "Twin Peaks" television series explored a similar idea to Kurosawa's: ordinary people afflicted with evil, rather than evil people, as such. The difference between Lynch and Kurosawa is that Lynch saw evil as some sort of independent force, whereas Kurosawa sees evil more as an idea. "Cure" presents us with a world in which words and ideas are a kind of virus that passes from person to person, leaving destruction in its wake. A carrier who doesn't fall ill himself, but who infects others with murderous instincts. For this reason, some of the comments here surprised me. Frequent complaints about how elliptical the film is, and how the characters need to be better defined. In particular, several complaints that the film never explained who the drifter was or where he came from. Surprising, because that, to me, was the point: he was nobody special. He didn't come from anywhere special. Viewers brought up on a diet of American cinema will find "Cure" frustrating: American thrillers always explain who the killer is, why he kills, and, most importantly, why he is different from you and me. This last point is to comfort the audience, to let them know that they could never be like the killer, that they are outside the drama, watching. Kurosawa presses the opposite point: this could be you; there is nothing special about these men. You should not be convinced that you are different from them. I will admit that if you dislike slowly-paced cinema, a la Tarkovsky, or if you don't buy the hypnotism "mumbo-jumbo" on which the film is based, then you will probably find "Cure" tiresome. I enjoy Tarkovsky, and I found that it wasn't a lot of work to suspend disbelief on the point of hypnotism. Finally, this film is an intellectual thriller; it's more frightening for its implications than for what actually goes on. The point is not to scare you and then wrap it all up neatly at the end (like most American thrillers), but instead to show you a possible world and then scare you after you leave the cinema with thoughts of what might follow.

		<shortDescription>Possibly the spookiest movie I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only time I can recall being as spooked by a film was when my parents took me to see "Hangover Square" - a gothic Jack the Ripper thriller - when I was 8 years old. I guess they couldn't find a baby-sitter. That took me about a year to get over, a low-key, all-too-realistic chiller about the banality of insanity. "Cure" is such a perfect depiction of madness that just about every shot could be framed &amp; hung in a gallery. You can't analyze this one, it doesn't follow a cartesian line of logic; nor does it blast you with halloweenish surprises in the style of Elm Street &amp; its knock-offs. This has far deeper &amp; subtler impact. I found as I relaxed into this film that images of recurring dreams &amp; nightmares I've had since childhood arose &amp; blended into what I was watching. Can't get much creepier than that. That said, the images &amp; emotions that this film evokes are on a very high level of poetic art. One of the most impressive elements of "Cure" is the director's ability to convey the magnetic manipulative appeal of Mamiya - surely one of the scariest things in real life &amp; very difficult to convincingly convey on screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a simple premise and a simple story that is nevertheless explored in an incredibly delicate and talented way. Kiyoshi Kurosawa is an extremely talented individual and perhaps the only writer/director who is able to simultaneously scare and mentally challenge me at the same time (note that very few are capable of doing one or the other). Although the writing is very good (story and dialogue), Kurosawa's real strength is his ability to represent visually the progressive denouement of his story. He rather subtly show you and let your imagination and intellect figure it out for you than to spell out bluntly what the straightforward storyline should be. It does not, however, get to the point of chaotic untidiness or pointlessness, for he is able to guide you slowly along the way (I would then say that he is slightly easier to follow than David Lynch is, but then again who is not). He uses here a strikingly effective technique where he shows you a room from one angle and later lets you discover that room more and more as the movie advances. His camera shots are always well planned and he is thus able to draw you in the movie bit by bit-quite an eerie sensation.The acting is generally good and believable. The camera-work is a stand out.There are many scenes where you will be able to appreciate this superior artistic and technical quality. The music is good and tenseful, but it is sparse and what is used instead is a contrast of minimalist and grossly amplified everyday sounds that vibrate through the movie. When there is no sound, you often find yourself holding your breath. This is not used strictly as a ploy, but rather creates a mood and further pulls you in the general atmosphere of the movie. Most of all, again, the directing is top notch. The pace which is slow enough for you to have the time to both think and be afraid is not slow enough that it gets boring, although you should not expect a North American expeditious run through the film. Everything is there, but it comes to you in slow, meticulously chosen dosage. Only, at the end can you truly see the masterpiece that has been drawn stroke by stroke in front of you.One of the reason this movie actually works is that it is designed to play with your mind and trigger fear and reaction based not only on emotion, but on reason. People are dying, but everything is calm, rational. The tone and story are pretty much realistic and, at the end of the experience, you may feel beyond your volitional control that you are actually convinced of the "strange" things in the movie. Hopefully this feeling will subside...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The serial killer movie has by now been done to death (so to speak), so it's especially rewarding to see this assured film that takes a truly ingenious approach. Kurosawa's protagonist is a seemingly dazed young man who, in spite of his aimless demeanor, is a master hypnotist. To reveal any more of what happens would be to give a bit too much away.The subtlety and fluidity of this film is remarkable. The main character can be charming and simultaneously irritating when he speaks. He turns his speaking partner's question back on the speaker; he answers with vague phrases that nevertheless, over the course of the film, gradually bring out the complexity of his psyche. Pitting him against a cop whose wife seems to suffer from something like the hypnotist's 'brand' of mental wanderings underlines the thematic context of the film: what we know is almost certainly only what we think we know. And what we think we know is almost certainly based on someone else's 'knowledge', derived the same as ours.That knowledge is a collective phenomenon, a shared and critical feature of the 'hive' is not a novel concept in film. But its presentation here is bold and original. To link that idea with a person who destroys life is a master stroke; it says that what we know vanishes in a suddenly extinguished flame, or a tiny stream of water that appears, runs, and then is seen no more.This is a film that should definitely be added to the great films of the 90s. Since it was not released in the U.S. until 2001, I vote for it being one of the great films of that year here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enigmatic hypnotic and disturbing meditation on self control and the fear of losing it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not easy to give yourself over to this film, for like the unwilling victims' it portrays, it rather slowly and methodically casts its spell, whisking you farther and farther away from the comfortable rhythm and conventions of the crime thriller it appears to be on the surface.Kyua's austere landscapes are in fitful turns picture postcard beautiful, mundane and mysterious. Much of the story unfolds in master shots, keeping you at a distance from the characters and affording the illusion of a comfortable intellectual detachment which it meticulously strips away scene by scene.The plot is deceptively simple; a weary Japanese Homicide detective is investigating a series of grotesque murders. Each murder seems to have the same ritualistic pattern, yet in each case the culprit turns out to be an ordinary individual, dazed and unable to offer any motive for their horrific crime. Nothing seems to connect the murderers to each other, until the Detective picks up the trail of an amnesia afflicted drifter who seems unable to answer even the simplest questions about himself, yet displays a disconcerting ability to reflect any line of questioning about his own identity back upon the questioner. Time and again he returns to a question at the core of the mystery:"Who are you?"It seems more and more, as the drifter is passed from detective, to guard, to clinician to pyschiatrist, that this question is far more dangerous than anyone might have guessed.Kyua is a model of subtlety and restraint. Although there's a significant amount of implied violence and several shocking scenes of murder, these aren't gratuitous. Kyua's particular genius is it's ability to transform it's urban Japanese landscapes and even the most common objects from familiar to suspect and eventually sinister: a length of piping, a flashing traffic sign, a blast furnace, the sound of ocean surf at night, a flickering lighter, a dark apartment lined with academic tomes, a puddle of spilled water, the letter X smeared on a wall, a deserted rundown building.There are few filmmakers with the audacity and imagination to venture into the places Kyua wants to take you. Fincher, Lynch and Cronenberg come to mind as those who time and time again have shown their willingness, and perhaps compulsion to return to the unsettling territory of perception, identity, and the boundary between normalcy and psychosis. If the director's first name were only David (it's not, his name is Kiyoshi Kurosawa) we'd have the makings of a good conspiracy theory here.The film was released in 1997 but only recently has made it's way to western shores, and US distribution by Cowboy Pictures, and has wound its way inevitably to cable networks like Sundance. It's cast includes Koji Yakusho as the detective Takabe. Fans of Japanese cinema will recognize this fine actor from his award winning roles in "Shall we Dance" and "The eel".Kyua isn't the type of visceral immediate drama that the average suspense film provides. If you can put aside your preconceived notions and allow it to unfold in it's own time, I suspect you will find the questions it asks and secrets it reveals to be all the more disquieting, problematic and in the end profound. Many critics have lined up to call this film a masterpiece, and pegged Kurosawa as one of a number of japanese directors worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unsettling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the wake of the sarin-gas attack mounted by the Aum Shinrikyo cult on the Tokyo subway system in 1995, horror films enjoyed a sudden spurt of popularity in Japan. Many of the films focus on hypnosis or media-induced violence, the fragile normalcy of modern life, and grisly deeds committed by seemingly ordinary citizens. This unnerving 1997 thriller, which seems like a direct response to the Aum Shinrikyo incident, offers a glimpse of how our own national cinema may absorb the blow of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. A rash of senseless murders wracks Tokyo; the victims have deep X-shaped gashes across their throats, and the killers (often their loved ones) are found in a daze. The only connection appears to be a mysterious drifter (Masato Hagiwara) who gets into random strangers' heads with a single, oft-repeated question: "Who are you?" What makes this subtle, quiet shocker so unsettling is the idea that everyone has secret resentments that render him or her hypnotically pliable--that everyone harbors some glimmer of murderous rage that can be exploited, whether by a drifter or by religious extremists. The writer-director, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, a prolific Japanese filmmaker who's developing a large cult following here, heightens the unease with buzzing soundtrack noise and eerie long takes that leave us consistently unprepared for the violence to come. And the last sequence will leave people arguing--it requires close attention, culminating in an ending even more disturbing in its implications than the conclusion of SEVEN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kurosawa has created a masterpiece here. This film is more than a horror thriller. It's a look at our modern society, and plays upon our innate fear that there is a monster hidden inside of us - even worse, we cannot control it.It begins as a typical detective story, film noirish in its execution, and like typical film noir, the detective finds more to the story than originally anticipated. But this film, just like its storyline, begins to transcend the genre it purports to be a part of midway through.More and more, we realize that it is telling the story of people today, boxed in, with our darkest desires oppressed. This theme of containment is heavy throughout, if one pays enough attention. For example, the usage of water as a symbol for the subconscious is useful for understanding many key parts of the film.Everything is superbly framed and shot, with more than a few very long shots (a testament to the high caliber of the cast). Sound and music are used sparingly but effectively.This film may not be very accessible to those who are only familiar with Hollywood-style film-making due to its slower pace and subtle conveyance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cure: impressionistic portrait of a serial killer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it is important to distinguish Cure from the avalanche of white-face-ghost-girl Japanese horror flicks that followed in Ringu's wake. Purely because it's a different beast and lumping it in a convenient J-horror niche is doing it a disservice. I won't go into plot specifics because it's only a skeleton for Kurosawa to hang his atmospherics. That said, I can understand the complaint many viewers seem to share ("man, it doesn't make sense") but without having any claims on solving Cure's riddle, I'm satisfied with letting wash over me, one watch at a time. Kurosawa wisely doesn't attempt to explain his plot. He's content to lift the veil just enough for us to sneak a glimpse in before he disorients again. The plot slowly builds through little tokens that are never followed by an orchestral crescento to signal their arrival. They just happen. A small photo in a book, muffled words on a phonogram, an old video, the ramblings of an amnesiac, theories on 18th century Austrian doctors. In the course of the film, everything seems to be coming together only to remain elusive in the end. In that aspect I find Cure to be closer to Last Year at Marienbad than your average Ringu clone. It's not about making sense, it's about pushing limits within which you can. It's about soaking in the impression it makes. When muffled words come through a phonogram, they're more incoherent ramblings than a telegraphed plot solution; but they contribute just as well to the overarching feel. This elliptic mentality is abetted by Kurosawa's choice of a slow, deliberate pace and many long shots, entire scenes covered without any cuts. The gritty and rundown aspect of Tokyo is photographed like a more naturalistic version of David Fincher's work and does the job well.It's my impression that a surrealist air hovers above and at the heart of Cure, at times reminiscent of a more languid version of Lynch. It is undoubtedly a horror movie so don't be put off by my Resnais comparison, but it's as much bleak as it is subtle and leaves enough to the mind's eye to make you carry it out with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subliminal to Visceral and back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A delicate, yet exceptionally gorey murder mystery from Japan. Truly so psychological, that I'm still not sure what might have been real and what might have been a Jungian chase through the house of a man's mind. The images bleed from the mundane and sterile to the nightmarish with such subtlety and grace, that I began to question the reality of the simplest scenes.The film is as dreamlike and subliminal as the villain it chases. Not really a thriller, though I had no clue what might happen to who next. Not really suspenseful, though I couldn't look away in fear of missing a detail. It is DELIBERATELY PACED, which might put off the typical murder mystery fan. However, if you just sit back and stare into the light, as do the hapless victims of the film, you will find it to be an unnerving experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>weird, confusing, BUT very fulfilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was recommended to this film by a 19 year old film student,who gave it ecstatic praise &amp; raved about the director Kyoshi Kurasawa( no relation to Akira).I will say this when I was 19 &amp; would see a film like this (different than most that I have seen) I would have been just as thrilled.Today being just past 79, I was not that enthralled as he &amp; some others were.That being said CURE is a very well made &amp; acted film, telling in a unique different style about some unexplained deaths,&amp; the subsequent police investigation &amp; an arrested young man who may be involved in these deaths. This young suspect has amnesia or does he now,he exasperates the Doctor &amp; the detectives questioning him to the point of our wanting to do the same, &amp; then changing our minds,This is a modern tale set in modern Tokyo,but using an old camera style of cinematography, Most interesting.There is also a very old building from the late 19th century, that may hold the clue to solve this tale. We do learn certain things BUT left in doubt at the conclusion.OH yes, Mesmerism play a vital role as well.This is a near brilliant film &amp; should be seen,Of course, the US run consisted of no more than 4 theatres in 1997.I do not know if it was ever on Cable or TV. It is available for rent in libraries (this is where my friend rented it from) I got mine from NETFLIX &amp; am glad I did. It is a most thought-provoking mystery drama, It is deliberately slow paced so we can hopefully appreciated every scene. Final Warning It is confusing at times, BUT always interesting.Rating *** (out of 4) 89 points (out of 100*) IMDb 8 ( out of 10)* 89 points is 1 point shy of a ***1/2 rating</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting and gripping film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wave of murders has recently hit Tokyo, each victim having a large 'X' cut deeply into their chests. The interesting this is, each culprit is a different person. The case goes to a detective named Takabe (played by the brilliant Koji Yakusho), and he must investigate. During his investigation, he finds Mamiya, a man who seemingly has no memory of his life. Takabe realizes there's something strange about Mamiya..."Cure" was Kiyoshi Kurosawa's first major success. It's a complex and dark film about hypnosis, which is at times, pretty unsettling and chilling. This is a little different than Kurosawa's later works, but all his signature methods are here: the unsettling atmosphere, the suspense, the unusual complexity of the characters, and slow pacing. Still, if you liked any of this director's other movies, this is highly recommended.My rating: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW!!!! Now THAT was an EXCELLENT ending to a GREAT movie. It stuck with me for several hours after first watching it and the second time was no different. It had slow methodical pacing, but it was never boring. I, for one, appreciated the elliptical editing as it's just a filmmaker doing something different and being creative. Actually, it added to the hypnotic arc of the story. It didn't bother me whatsoever, although it wasn't nearly as effective in Kiyoshi's other great movie, "Kairo." Koji Yakusho was brilliant as troubled Detective Takabe and the mysterious drifter with hypnotic powers was very convincing as well. The use of hypnotism to get others to kill and rendering themselves soulless, was a refreshing take on the serial-killer subgenre, of which I love. Someone commented here that only people who "buy the mumbo jumbo" hypnotism storyline would like this film, and comments like those always bother me. Narrative films are not REAL LIFE, even the ones based on true stories. They are works of art, and try to tell us entertaining, comedic, frightning, and dramatic stories to keep the audience interested. I don't have to believe in the subjects their stories are telling me, nor do I believe they need to solve the world's problems. All I care is that they give me an interesting idea, an interesting story, with well-written dialogue, and if it ends with a bang. These, blended with great acting (now that's an area that needs convincing in film), great camera work, and an engaging score. Those are what make films interesting and "Kyua" aka "Cure" has all those qualities. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wild and weird--but in a good way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is certainly one of the stranger Japanese movies I have ever seen. It's a sort of horror and crime film rolled together and will probably be of interest to lovers of both genres--provided they have a high tolerance for a very unusual and, at times, vague film. The plot involves a sick freak that has devoted years to investigating an older, forgotten form of hypnosis where you CAN make people do things against their wills and moral code. For kicks, he makes them commit horrendous murders and for a while the police are at a loss for why all these seemingly senseless murders occur. Well, about midway through the film the perpetrator is caught. From then on, it's a bizarre and at times surreal exploration of his demented world. The ending is very unusual and a tiny bit unclear, but overall the film is very good and sure to make you think.NOTE--there is some nudity and very explicit murders. This is not a movie for kids!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>#POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW#I agree with BusterB's comments (below). As in Tarkovsky's movies there were Christian overtones: the 'cross' and the transmission of original sin as the 'evil' elicited and spread by the drifter. Philip Pullman said that religion alone has the power to make good people do bad things and this movie helps us to see why (think of the hypnotic power of its bin Laden's, Shoko Asahara's, Koresh's and so on). I watched this movie partly to humour my Japanese wife and was duly 'suspending disbelief' as they say when about 2/3 of the way in it suddenly dawned on me that the film was working on a number of different levels. I also loved the final scene. It will be interesting to see whether Kurosawa's other movies turn out to be as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unusual pattern of murder.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People are turning up dead, and the murders are connected by a similarity in the mutilation of the corpses. However, each murder seems to have been committed by a different person--a person who, in some cases, was a close relative or acquaintance of the victim. Eventually the police discover that an amnesiac man has turned up at many of the murder sites. This man, though, seems to have neither long-term nor short-term memories; he often cannot remember a question long enough to answer it. A certain police detective Katabe follows a trail to uncover the man's dangerous secrets, and he risks getting far more involved than he should."Cure" treads similar psychic territory to "The Cell" and "Paperhouse" while avoiding the shared-dream phenomenon and relying on imagery which is much more subtle and often more effective. The director, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, is consistently elliptical in his methods--meaning that he leaves certain gaps in the film and invites the audience to fill them in. Well-considered ingenuity is good, but abstraction taken to the point of chaos is bad. When it comes to imagery, Kurosawa's elliptical method compliments his audience, assuming that people can make certain necessary logical deductions, associating visual cues with their psychic equivalent. But when this technique is applied to plot, things get a little messy. Something is definitely wrong when, even after the film is finished, the audience has to wonder: When did this particular event occur? Who did it? Did it really happen or not? Such questions plague the film's ending, and confusion in a plot-dependent film is, quite obviously, bad.Regardless of its flaws, "Cure" is a welcome addition to the genre for its spare use of graphic imagery and for the attitude of intellectual respect Kurosawa shows his audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disconcerting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kurosawa masterfully plays with the human psyche and its inherent need for explanation....Although I'm a great fan of the way Japanese filmmakers tell stories , this movie was still quite a brain-teaser! In 'western' story-telling there's always a clear distinction between the good side and the evil side. In Japanese stories,this distinction is often more vague, which makes the story behave more like the real-world. If you seek simple amusement and a puzzle that is gradually but surely solved by the detective, this movie is not for you. The movie begins like a straight-forward serial killer story, but soon changes from a 'whodunit' to a more enigmatic 'HOW-dunit'.The sometimes apparently random introduction of characters, events and clues to the story, and the way the personae subsequently derange from their expected behavior in the course of events, adds to the shock and never gives you any solid ground to identify and sympathize with the characters or to get a grip on the story. You have the feeling you're constantly put on the wrong track. You're brain is desperately trying to put the puzzle together but it's no good. Sometimes they find a clue that might solve the puzzle, but a moment later you realize they're on the wrong track, leaving you completely clueless again. 'Kyua' leaves you with mixed feelings: amazed, unfulfilled, puzzled, scared, disgusted, and everything in between. All you want to do is to watch it again and make sense of it all, in spite of the fact that you know that it's no good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is like a Japanese "mate" to Se7en, although in many ways I think it's superior. The ending is rather enigmatic but if the implications are as I see them (no spoilers) then it is the ending I wish Se7en had gone for. Like many Japanese films I've seen, I get the impression that I'm missing things (cultural outlooks, social relationships) that the Japanese must see. But even knowing that it was a very disturbing film and the director knows how to add to it. It's an extremely dark film (in many ways) and near the end it sounded like something the entire movie was "breathing", like a demon close to your ear. A very eerie effect. Worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CURE is not the average serial killer movie. There moments were the movie sits far atop SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, but of course, this is a Japanese movie so if you are not ready for unexpected twists and unexplained things you will be probably lost (or even bore). The horror of the movie is focused not only on the killer itself, who by the way is so smart and (apparently ) powerful, but in the madness surrounding the investigation. We have an obsessed cop with mentally ill wife, an sceptic shrink and a lot of common and kind people who get involved (and most of them killed). Telling the history will not make the movie justice, but it is important to mention that this movie plays part on the story (or screen) level but another part on our own minds and imagination. An excellent movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think this movie is especially gory. It's less gory than say Seven and much less gory than the average Yakuza picture. There is some pretty shocking brutality at the beginning, but by the end the threat of violence from the serial killer is so overwhelming that it seems for the last hour that a massacre is just around every corner.I actually went back to see it again the next day cuz I wanted to be sure about a couple scenes. A lot of people probably would find this irritating, but I love it. Like Brazil, Cure begins to blend scenes of dream, fantasy and reality so freely, that you have a hard time sorting through them. Given that this movie is about hypnotism, insanity, and power fantasies ripping the detective apart, I thought it was utterly appropriate.Simply amazing soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First time I saw this, thanks to an otherwise fine festival director obsessed with Eastern Europe to the exclusion of most neo-eiga, I'd seen nothing by Kiyoshi Kurosawa and, though I realize now I'd seen him in his 1979 debut for Gosha as well as in "Tampopo" and "Kamikaze Taxi," I was incognizant of Koji Yakusho's range or his stardom. "Shall We Dance," I'm pretty sure, played here after "Cure's" festival debut. The festival buzz on "Cure" was scream flick, not director matures, crowds Tarkovsky.Early in "Cure" Kenichi (Yakusho) comes home to find the clothes washer spinning, stops it, looks inside, finds nothing. A little later his wife Fumie stops him doing some chore: "Let me do it. I feel good today" She means "I'm sane today," but we don't know this, we haven't quite understood her chat across a table with a bearded man in a previous scene. Those words, this line, "I feel good today," to the exclusion of other or even most days, are uttered in pretty much Fumie's tone, one time or another, by nearly any wife. My mother's spoken them countless times, far back as I can recall. Now she's 85, mobile, sane, with a couple of decades likely still in her. Though "Cure," a film of words as much as images, works linearly, it's really a circular film. Repeated viewings pay. You could start at any point within it and watch full round. It's not a suspense film, though it's full of suspense of the moment, of where the camera will go next, of where a gaze will fall, a hand will go, of where and whether a character will turn or pause or not pause.Because both actors have Koizumi hair, when we first see, at distance, a trench-coated figure walking a beach, we can't be sure it's not Kenichi. The camera won't zoom in on the incessantly questioning amnesiac until after we've placed his voice as new to us. No-Name, later Mamiya, functions as a semantic, a near totally verbal catalyst. If you must, he's "Ringu's" tape, but I kept thinking of the "What Was It You Wanted?" track on Dylan's "Oh Mercy." It's no accident that No-Name's nothing but voice at first. The beach scene's school teacher later babbles introspectively, analytically, tangled up in words, amazed, "Yes. I killed her for no reason." Mesmer makes an okay MacGuffin, but as I say about rope and knots in my comment at "Undo," don't see hypnotism, spell, or trance. See (hear) just words, just questions. Even Mamiya's lighter needs to be named, spoken. The Aum weren't hypnotized. Suicide bombers aren't. Atta's Al Qaeda crew weren't. Zero pilots, willing and not (because it's an infinite world, there have to have been both as well as every gradient in-between), weren't. Whatever was done to any of these was words, language.Later, in "Séance," Yakusho plays a sound man. Devoid of music, "Cure"s' ambient sound is sometimes so pumped it backgrounds the images. Try closing your eyes for a few film minutes, and only listen. (If you know no Japanese, all the better.) What's there? Rhythms? Randomness? Oddity? The mundane? Tradition? Modernity? I could go much longer than allowed here, but skip to the very last scene, for not a spoiler but an alert. Yakusho/Kenichi's seated in a cafeteria. You MUST see, small, backgrounded, in an obscure corner of the screen, a glint of metal, traveling. Seeing it completes the loop, thrusts you into the beginning of the film. Your instinctive struggle to leave the loop, to understand the glint or even not to have seen it, is Kurosawa's design. Your struggle, his design. That's why I say crowding Tarkovsky. At best they spiral. They turn back or turn in. Kurosawa's "Kairo" works a similar loop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In many ways this movie has one of the scariest villains in horror movie history. He is so cunning and emotionless and he has tremendous powers that he could use at will. I wouldn't call this movie scary but it really got under my skin.Certain scenes were really effective because they come out of absolutely nowhere. The hanging scene or the scene with the nurse murdering the guy came out of nowhere. The movie moves really slow with absolutely shocking moments at frequent intervals. The mark appearing at various points was also effective. I have often mentioned that payoff is important, at least give me something! And this movie delivers that in spades. Koji Yakusho gives a stunning performance as Takabe. His frequent bursts were incredible to watch. A detective, as he explains, is not supposed to show any emotion. Takabe, at various points, is almost losing it but he manages to compose himself at the last moment. He tries to be the dutiful husband to his ill wife. He tries to do his job despite dealing with scumbags. Yet towards the end, he finds that he might be losing the battle to Mamiya.And that's what this movie is all about. It is about the battle between Takabe and Mamiya. Despite trying his best, Mamiya manages to get into the mind of Takabe after getting a few details about his life. That's all Mamiya needs to manipulate someone. Few people are immune to his hypnosis techniques. The way in which the movie details the crimes of Mamiya is a treat to watch. It is just fascinating to watch how he manages to talk to those people and understand their issues quite easily. Most probably he knows their story even before they told him. Even the calm and composed Sakuma becomes increasingly erratic towards the end.As in many movies of this nature, the lack of music (or minimalist music) works so well. It lends a documentary feel to the scenes. But some scenes suddenly switch to a surreal nature and that is disorienting. That's why this movie works so well. The concept itself is interesting. What is Mamiya exactly doing? Is he manipulating people to commit crimes or is he just removing the inhibitions? It is even scary to see how otherwise normal people seem to lose it. Even people like that friendly officer. The movie is incredibly atmospheric and the creepy concept and the execution elevate this movie to classic status.The ending is disturbing as well and it gives a satisfying conclusion to his excellent horror film.One of my favourite Japanese horror films and I rate it a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cure (1997)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cure is an intricate puzzle of a crime film written and directed by cult filmmaker Kiyoshi Kurosawa. It has been compared to David Fincher's Se7en, but I think Cure is darker even though it's very minimalistic and doesn't rely much on gruesome imagery in order to create an unsettling mood.Cure is a metaphorical story of crime and hypnosis that heavily uses mesmerizing imagery in order to suck you into it. The shots of raindrops putting out an ignited lighter and of water dripping from the table are beautiful even though the storyline itself is rather grim.Kurosawa's intent was, as I see it, to portray a society of repressed people whose outward personalities are simply masks they use to cover up their destructive, savage selves. The antagonist of the film uses hypnosis in order to bring out their murderous instincts, therefore hypnosis is the "cure" from the title. He admires the detective for being unusually strong-willed, and in the end, the hypnotist's skills are transferred onto the detective, the movie ending with him hypnotizing a waitress.Cure has brilliant performances and an incredible atmosphere, but really it's one of those films you get more out of on your second viewing. It'll probably be regarded as a masterpiece in a few years' time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skilled practitioner of hypnotism creates a deadly series of murders by others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cure" is a very scary movie. A series of apparently disconnected and unmotivated murders is occurring. There is, of course, a connection, and the police detective, Koji Yakusho, discovers it. He then focuses on the man responsible behind the scenes, Masato Hagiwara. Hagiwara plays a young student in psychology who has dropped out of college. He has become a expert at hypnosis, managing to implant suggestions that overcome a person's moral inhibitions and gratify their desires to exert deadly violence or satisfy some other deeply-held desire through murder.The ways that Hagiwara does this to people are very unsettling because they're so effective, and the story capitalizes on his capacity to hypnotize police and captors. We are uncertain just how far he might get Yakusho or the psychiatrist he works with under his control. Furthermore, the director has ramped up the spooky feeling by, at times, mixing in the imaginings of key characters and by using dark sets and sometimes decaying kinds of interiors.Those who do the murders are victimized. The director adds to the overall tension in the variety of serious ways in which he shows them, before, during and after their deeds. They don't play this for cheap thrills, laughter, or surprise effects. They play it serious and straight, and it's all the more frightening."Cure" is a fine neo-noir film. It's mystery for awhile, but turns more into a battle between the two principals. It becomes more psychological and, as said, with a strong horror element, achieved not with monsters, not with excessive gore, not with surprise thrills, but a bit more as in "The Shining", often by images and camera movements that unsettle us, such as a face behind a clouded window pane, or subjective movement into an unknown dark room, or merely by a flickering light that is known to be hypnotic and therefore dangerous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Detective Takabe (Koji Yakusho) is called upon to solve a group of inexplicable murders.The sights and sounds of this film encompass an odd sense of foreboding and despair. I watched this DVD four separate times as it had such an effect, as did several of the performances.Takabe is saddled with the additional burden of a wife with emotional problems, she has an amnesia of sorts and also is at times depressed. We see his frustration as he comes home from a long days work merely hoping to engage in conversation with her.There is a young man roaming the city who is eventually hospitalized, who incites various people to act out, or kill in a ritualistic fashion. It comes to bear that Mahimi was at one time a medical student studying the occult and hypnotism as taught by Austrian "occultist" Anton Mesmer ("Mesmerism").In Japan it is revealed this technique was called "soul conjuring" and suppressed by the Meiji Government during the late 1800's. The events unravel in a domino effect, taking you into a bizarre scenario.Overall this is an excellent film with good performances, do not mind the subtitles. I will be looking for other films by this director as well. Excellent suspense here, in American film we do not have similar, except maybe for Hitchcock. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kiyoshi Kurosawa is slowly overtaking Takashi Miike as my fave current Japanese director (sorry, Ryuhei Kitamura). I waited a long time to see Cure and now that I have, I realize how brilliant Kurosawa really is. This movie is so dense, so packed with subtext and subliminal detail, you might not get it all in one sitting. I will admit I had to watch the ending about 15 times in a row, because it is extremely cryptic. There is plenty of ominous and sublimely creepy imagery, not to mention a Kubrick/Lynch meshing of style here. Don't be mistaken though, because Kurosawa's signature jet-black humor and obtusely enigmatic storytelling is in rare form here. If you enjoy just soaking in a well-structured story and not worrying about who the killer is or if there's some contrived twist ending like most Hollywood movies, then Cure will satisfy your need to be entertained and use that thing in your head called a brain at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cure - a great movie, but with qualification</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw CURE at the San Francisco Film Festival in around 1998, and like many, I found the concept and craftsmanship arresting. A number of audience members stayed around afterwards to discuss it - it's a psychologically complex tale of hypnotism and the seductions of altered consciousness. Koji Yakusho (DORA HEITA, 13 ASSSASSINS, etc.) is at his acting peak as a detective who tries to solve a series of murders that don't seem to relate to common logic.Recently, I saw the DVD version of the film - and it's clear that the film had been cut severely. Most viewers have only seen the US DVD version, so they're not even aware of the problem. A few of the more graphic sequences were cut, important portions of the narrative set in an old sanatorium were excised, and the violent finish was excised entirely. (The US DVD concludes with the suggestion of a further killing; the theatrical Japanese version is more powerful and unambiguous.) In some cases, a later, recut version may be better than the original; however, that's not the case here. There's scant online text relating to the differences between the two versions. It speaks well for director Kiyoshi Kurosawa that he took a low-budget police procedural and made an innovative thriller out of it. Most of the scenes are under-edited and shot at a distance, to extract the most from the hypnotic storyline; the longer, hypnotic sequences are several minutes long, with no edits. Because the film uses medium-distance shots to give a sense of hypnotic disassociation, viewers with larger screens will gain an advantage.I strongly recommend seeing it - but would suggest you seek out the original, uncut theatrical print if you can. The differences are striking. I'd rate the original print as 10/10; the cut/domestic DVD is maybe 7/10. This film would profit from a Criterion reissue, but that doesn't seem to be in the works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The evil that men do lead to many questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is another very good psycho thriller from Japan that convinces with a weird and intriguing story and a strange and haunting character that is closely related to brutal murders that are happening where seemingly normal people kill in the most brutal way and don't remember anything before their crimes neither the reasons that made them do them.The special thing about this mysterious movie is that the murderers are not evil but that something inside them made them evil. Is it a demon? Is it a conspiracy? Is it the money? The main question of the movie is what made people commit the crimes and the next questions are: What is the strategy beyond those murders? Why do people kill or are forced to kill? The final question is also very interesting and leads us to a once again disturbing ending of an extreme movie: How can one stop the murders? How can one control the evil that men do? Is there a "cure"? Beyond those thoughts, one could ask: If it can't be stopped, to what kind of conclusion does that ultimately lead? All the movie long you keep on guessing and you get slowly prepared for a haunting conclusion.In many ways, this movie reminds the works of Cronenberg and especially of David Lynch's great "Twin Peaks" series that ask the same kind of questions. While those series convince with a slow development and very charming characters, the personalities shown in this Japanese movie are not always completely convincing and the main idea is nothing really new but those two points are the only ones that I could critic negatively as the movie has a dark drowning atmosphere and is always filled with suspense and mystery and entertaining until the very last scene. I can only recommend this weird and haunting movie and any other Asian psycho thriller I have reviewed before if my review is intriguing enough for you to check this movie out and you happen to like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wave of bizarre murders are taking place in Tokio. The only thing that seems to connect the killings is an 'X' being carved out on all the hapless victims. Even the murderers themselves are unconnected and to each case a different suspect is being held responsible. Detective Kenichi Takabe (played by Kiyoshi Kurosawa's favourite actor Kôji Yakusho) is responsible for piecing this mind-warping puzzle together.Gritty, dark and immersed in shadows "Cure" is arguably the best serial killer thriller of the 90s alongside the much more widely recognised "7even". Initially a mysterious and captivating detective story unfolds into a dreaded voyage in the depths of the human soul. The amnesiac main antagonist constantly repeats the lingering question "Who are you?". Well - who are you? What defines you? Which sides of your life are the real you? Initially the question seems simple and straightforward and only as we reach the culmination do we fully understand the diabolic depth of Kurosawa's script. Evil in this movie is almost like planting an inception. It isn't something surreal or given at birth, but something that is planted into seemingly normal people. The idea of murder is not the work of outside forces, but a gist, a phase, a thought. And as such the horrendous reality of this simple concept will grip you more than a devil possessing your soul. Simply because their is so much truth in the seemingly obvious discovery.And unforgettable experience, that you won't want to repeat anytime soon. The movie lingers with its confusing finale, but further analysis just makes you focus on the true meaning of what just transpired. Like a psychiatric session gone awry it may be hard to quickly gather together after such a watch. Recommended watch following such a mind-numbing movie: Any romantic comedy, that will loosen up your soul and is guaranteed to offer a happy end.Dark and profound this mesmerising story is not one that will quickly dissolve from your memory. Probably by far Kurosawa's best movie, which is fortunately devoid of skin-deep social commentary of most of his other movies. Recommended watch for any Asian movie fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly dark movie that works both as a horror film and as a film for the 'thinking sort of person'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cure (1997) (By Kiyoshi Kurosawa)This was a good forerunner to the films of the modern Asian horror bloom. A bleak and creepy detective horror. Sometimes it's a bit odd, with seemingly happy music playing in scenes you would associate with deep sadness or pain. And the director has a certain feeling for details that you would not expect to find in such a film, at times giving what would otherwise be very ordinary scenes a special meaning. For example when our main character takes a simple buss-ride to visit the mental hospital. It is subtle, but the way the clouds are made, as seen in the back windows of the bus, among other things, perfectly conveys the feeling of a soothing, almost a tad dreamlike journey - as a momentary break on a doomed and hopeless day... But most of the time it plays like any Asian horror film, only this one is very dark. When you watch it it's like you are helplessly confined within it's universe and there is nothing to do but submit to it and follow the story. This is why it's uncomfortable even though it's relatively light on horror or true dread, and it reminds me a lot of Kairo for this reason.In passing, the ideas and themes that it explores poses questions about our inner nature, and not least the nature of morality. It's intriguing and creepy at the same time, even if things can get a bit confusing - and i find that the film plays a lot in the dark so that can contribute to that effect as well - but hey, what Asian horror movies doesn't get a little weird? Anyway, you always roughly understand what happens however so it's no big deal.The murders are gruesome but pretty schematic. Without them it would hardly be the kind of film it is, but I feel that most of the tension in the movie derives from its main character (the detective) and his inner frustration, as well as from the "psycho"(really the mysterious Mr. X) which is the suspect he interrogates. The detective's life is a mess, his wife and love suffers from mental illness, and his job doesn't make it easy for him as it is. Be sure that the overly intelligent, illusive bad guy takes advantage of as much as he can of this. He frustrates and manipulates, but with a power over people that even Hannibal Lecter cannot compete with. But the film isn't about getting someone convicted. It explores the inexplainable, incurable evil that cannot be undone. The ending is ambiguous and we don't exactly know if things will sort out now or what will happen.A very good, dark crime horror from Kurosawa. Maybe you could call it horror for grownups? Very recommended, but expect a very slow-paced and meditative film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"..builds an intriguing cross between David Fincher and David Lynch while questioning our buried impulses..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a much more divided critical base than his much revered namesake, Kurosawa either draws ire or much respect for his genre twisting mindscrews of Asian cinema. I stand somewhere in between because even while I recognise and applaud his intentions and sheer nerve in bending the genre to the extent of esoterica, there's just something hollow left behind. With "Cure", he adds to an oeuvre of stringently erudite horror/thriller by quite obviously referencing the 1995 Sarin gas attack on Tokyo's subway system.He dithers around the subject of cults and finds that searching for identity in a (dys)functional society a much more clamant aspect of a person's descent into GroupThink and susceptibility of persuasion. Deliberately coy and abstract, Kurosawa is an auteur of surrealism and builds an intriguing cross between David Fincher and David Lynch while questioning our buried impulses and slowly pulling back the layers of detachment in a country that's gradually supplanting it's own identity with nothing of note.Arguing that the diegetic murders are related in more ways than a mysterious amnesiac and a curious X carved in the victims' neck, Kurosawa links the cause to the alienation from our contemporary lifelessness by way of allegory. With no discernible soundtrack aside from the electronic droning, ambiance and permutations of desperation in the lone protagonist's voice, Kurosawa demands attention through arduousness in minimalism but relents a caveat before long in its subtle ambiguity.Rating: 3? out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Single Greatest Film in the History of Japanese Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Kiyoshi Kurosawa perfects the concept of hypnotic villainy in this film, which features a battle of wills between a detective and a genius who uses the power of suggestion to set in motion a series of killings throughout a city. Showcasing innovative suspense sequences, plot twists, and rich psychological/philosophical concepts, this film will have viewers pondering well after it ends. Kiyoshi again manages to elude the pitfalls of popular cinema to contribute not only a chilling masterpiece, but arguably one of the most awesome villains to ever grace the big screen.Of the thousands of films I've seen, few have floored me to the point where I've wanted to grant them the honor of being the "Best Movie Ever." The only other film that comes to mind is "A Tale of Two Sisters" (2003), which is easily the most impressive motion picture of all time. Since that distinction is taken, that leaves "Cure" (1997) with the runner-up spot in terms of world cinema, but the medal for "Best Japanese Movie Ever" is still for the taking. This film takes it. I've seen 1,328 films from that country, and I can tell you that even Yasujiro Ozu and Shinya Tsukamoto have failed to match the brilliance of "Cure." This is quite possibly the most engaging slow-paced film in existence. The tempo moves slower than molasses in January, but the introduction of the lead antagonist a mere 8 minutes into the film sets the seemingly endless array of intriguing moments into motion from the get go. Masato Hagiwara's character of Kunio Mamiya is spellbinding with his hypnotic technique that starts off with seemingly trivial dialogue but slowly progresses into an ingenious psychological trap. This provides for a number of memorable moments, my favorite of which is the mesmerizing water enchantment of the hospital nurse. In addition, the identity of this character is expertly crafted as a sort of ambiguous soul/personality whose essence is only truly revealed during the very last frame. No other film has created an antagonist so uniformly dangerous, sublime, and interesting as Kunio Mamiya.Kiyoshi Kurosawa is easily one of the top five directors of all time. This guy made three perfect films that no one talks about ? "Cure" (1997), "Kairo" (2001), and "Charisma" (1999). What's really interesting is that he follows a rather unique art-house style that's almost never applied to the horror/thriller genres. Kiyoshi uses long shots, deliberate pacing, and ambiguity in moderation, which is unlike most art-house directors who have no sense of discretion. Despite the mindless ramblings of mainstream cinemaphiles, Kiyoshi rarely (if ever) indulges in pompous, self-congratulatory filming techniques because his choice of lean running times (under two hours in almost every instance) helps him to avoid the bloated, masturbatory pretentiousness that rears its ugly head in other art-house style films. Think Andrei Tarkovsky with more interesting and refined philosophical content and you'll have an idea of just how special Kiyoshi Kurosawa is as a director.Whenever possible, I like to point out the high content levels of Kiyoshi's films in an attempt to counter the nonsensical claims of some who feel that he practices a form of style over substance. Take the seemingly trivial dialogue that the Kunio Mimiya character engages in during his hypnotic acts of terrorism. The exchanges are an odd mix on a superficial level, but one comes to realize their importance when the victims are subjected to police interrogation. Only then does the viewer understand why Kunio fakes his amnesia (an attempt to elude his victims memories) and engages in circular question-begging. Also note the attention to details in other situations. Within the final 20 minutes we see Koji Yakusho in a quaint diner, but only upon further inspection do we realize that in one case his plate is filled with leftover food while in the other case it's licked clean, an important revelation of his essential change in character for the finale. And how about that final shot? This is just awesome cinema people. Magnificent.In retrospect, "Cure" was the true beginning of the Japanese horror phenomenon that has followed it's release. While lacking in industry influence that has helped to establish Japanese horror in general (that nod goes to Nakata's "Ringu" of 1998), it provides a ground zero date for the turning of the tide so to speak. For all intents and purposes, Japanese horror has kicked everyone else's backside from 1997 onward. That said, I am truly unhappy that Kiyoshi chose to leave the genre for more dramatic fare because we're already inundated with enough art-house dramas to keep us busy. How many expertly crafted art-house horror films are there floating around today? Whatever the number, it's not nearly enough.It's really too bad that good taste in film is practically extinct, because "Cure" should be one of those movies that everyone under the sun raves about until they're blue in the face. Kiyoshi isn't blessed with the lunatic fan base that follows guys like Akira Kurosawa or Andrei Tarkovsky. (Maybe I count as the first big fan of Kiyoshi.) It's a shame that he has established himself as an upper echelon filmmaker but somehow hasn't won over the majority of paid critics and film snobs who so easily drive the "emperor with no clothes" tide to coerce and guilt people into riding the bandwagons of lesser filmmakers.In any case, "Cure" is the pinnacle of exceptional film-making. It's also Kiyoshi Kurosawa's best film, and that's saying something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CUREThis is the review of the movie called Cure directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa.This is a Japanese horror movie ( J-horror genre)Kiyoshi Kurosawa is a famous and very -well known Japanese film director and screenwriter, film critic and a professor at Tokyo University of the Arts. He contributed much to the J-horror genre (Japanese horror).Plot:Cure movie begins with a scene showcasing a lady patient in a hospital who suffers with mental illness and also happens to be the wife of Kenichi Takabe (Koji Yakusho) who is an emotionally repressed police detective.Takabe investigates a series of bizarre murders , in which each victim is killed the same way by and X-mark carved into their necks.Ideology:The basic ideology behind the movie is about Hypnosis and what lead a person to take himself the decision of killing people which is a crime , Hypnosis is a psychological state with physiological attributes superficially resembling sleep and marked by an individual's level of awareness other than the ordinary conscious state. Hypnosis is usually induced by a procedure known as a hypnotic induction involving a series of preliminary instructions and suggestions Conclusion:Cure is not a tale of the supernatural. Rather, it is a take on the serial killer film, and a revisionist one at .Cure is an unnerving and unsettling film. Many subtle elements are combined to powerful effect. Locations are cold, run-down, deserted and dilapidated, characters are enigmatic and painted in shades of grey rather than black and white, the acting is understated and the unique use of sound thoroughly unnerving</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An elaborate psychological labyrinth, with no definitive way out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Kiyoshi Kurosawa constructs a captivating, complex universe in "Cure," and one that cannot be reduced to simple answers and established truths. On the surface, Kurosawa has seemingly constructed your standard procedural police thriller, but as the story slowly unfolds, it develops into a fascinating, perplexing psychological mystery. From the startlingly violent opening sequence, it's clear we're in the hands of a gifted director in complete control of his medium, and who focuses on heightening the senses to create an atmosphere of trepidation. Kurosawa pulls his story in the opposite direction of a typical detective story, and brilliantly turns a routine thriller into a vehicle of social criticism.The first half of "Cure" unfolds as a police-procedural. A wave of gruesome murders is sweeping Tokyo, and the only connection between them is a bloody X carved into the neck of each of the victims. A variety of unlikely killers are responsible for the slayings, all of whom have encountered a disoriented young man named Kunio Mamiya, played by Masato Hagiwara. He possesses a hypnotic effect on people, but has no apparent memory of it. His lack of memory appears contagious, and the eventual killers succumb to it as well. Detective Takabe picks up bits and pieces about hypnotic suggestion, a theory he tosses out early in the film, and it is also rejected by his psychiatrist friend, Makoto Sakuma (Tsuyoshi Ujiki). The trail of dead bodies, however, eventually leads to Mamiya, who's been held in a mental hospital.The second half of the film involves Takabe dealing with his own emotional issues, and his wife who has a deteriorating mental condition, whose symptoms include an inability to recall recent events, and in this way she and Mamiya appear quite similar. This increases Takabe's frustration with Mamiya, as the boy's refusal to respond to simple requests reminds him all to well of the issues at home. Takabe would most likely be Mamiya's next victim, however, he does have one advantage that Mamiya's other victims didn't: his growing knowledge of Mamiya's abilities.Just as Mamiya is hypnotically manipulating his prey, Kurosawa is also skillfully manipulating the audience, taking us into a world of uncertainty, and a slow descent into pure madness. Kiyoshi Kurosawa deserves credit for his unique visual approach, and his evasive approach to storytelling. He establishes a pervasive sense of detachment by utilizing barren landscapes, and filming scenes with isolated frames. Almost no music is present during the movie, adding to the feel of extreme isolation, and instead amplified everyday sounds create the tension.Inevitably, the indefinable cure for the unconscionable murders serves as a tragic allegory for the emotional disconnect of our society. The film eerily presents the impersonal nature of our contemporary existence with extraordinary direction. Mr. Kurosawa constructs an elaborate psychological labyrinth, and then strands us in the middle of it, with no definitive way out. A master of disquiet, Kurosawa touches on the forbidden zones of our existence, exploring the unseen, and probing the unspeakable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Homicide detective Kaji Yakusho (Kenichi Takabe) is pitted against evil in the shape of a sinister amnesiac who may be the link between a series of seemingly motiveless and gruesome killings where the victims are carved with an X. Kurosawa is confident with his material, skilfully framing and lighting each scene with exquisite attention to detail. Sound is used to great effect in this movie, and provides a constant cue as to the mood of each of the protagonists. Yakusho's ultimate encounter with his nemesis is handled with great effect. Not quite a murder mystery, not quite an existential horror, but rather, something unique in the genre, a genuinely thoughtful examination of identity and free will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cure is the greatest movie ever made.If you haven't already, watch Cure by yourself and give yourself some time afterwards to think it over. You will never, ever look at life the same way. It does exactly what movies are meant to do - give us a window into ourselves, and Cure does that better than any other film has ever done. No word of dialogue is unnecessary, no character exaggerated, everything is perfect...but if you have seen Cure you should know that already. Once you look closer at this movie, and see Cure in every frame, it becomes so much easier to look closer and see Cure in everything around you. You think I'm waxing poetic? Then you must not have seen the movie. Every character is a part of each of us: the Kenichi Takabe of change, the Kunio Mamiya of uncertainty and failure, the rebellion of Makoto Sakuma, the defeated Fumie Takabe, the false control of Dr. Akiko Miyajima and the Colonel, and the real control of Fujiwara. To me Fujiwara, not Kenichi Takabe, is the center of this story; he somehow controls or sets in motion the heart of Kenichi Takabe's rebirth and downfall. There are several parts of this movie where I lose control every time I see it, and none more so than the lit zippo scene. To me that scene is simply the greatest monologue ever written.I listened to the message of Cure - look closely and you can find Cure in anything - and it changed my life. I rose out of a long, deep depression and started out into the world. Sometimes there is so much Cure in the world, I can't even stand it, and it feels like my heart is going to burst.This is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subliminal to Visceral and back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A delicate, yet exceptionally gorey murder mystery from Japan. Truly so psychological, that I'm still not sure what might have been real and what might have been a Jungian chase through the house of a man's mind. The images bleed from the mundane and sterile to the nightmarish with such subtlety and grace, that I began to question the reality of the simplest scenes.The film is as dreamlike and subliminal as the villain it chases. Not really a thriller, though I had no clue what might happen to who next. Not really suspenseful, though I couldn't look away in fear of missing a detail. It is DELIBERATELY PACED, which might put off the typical murder mystery fan. However, if you just sit back and stare into the light, as do the hapless victims of the film, you will find it to be an unnerving experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting supernatural thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things that keep this well made film from being anything more than that is the vagueness of the main character. This unknown amnesiac with hypnotic powers. The film is extremely well photographed and edited and has a good pace but who is this person? Very interesting subplot with the detective and his sick wife that I thought was used well in the relationship between the amnesiac and detective. The ambivalent ending doesn't help matters either but Kurasawa is a terrific and busy director who has many better films in him that remain to be made. This is a good film but it clearly needed character definition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Split Feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have very split feelings when it comes to this film:First, the film is full of long, dead moments of film that I did not find incredibly entertaining or even vital to the story of the film, and I found this to be annoying. Second, I felt as if the parts of the story that were truly interesting they did not delve into -- so much more could have been done if the focus of the story would have been centered in different aspects of it. Third, character development seems to be weak; other than sharp interest we have in the villain, I felt that the hero of the film was not sufficiently developed to cause me to sympathize on major levels; in fact, a lot of the essentials pertinent to the hero only came out when it was far too late in the story. However, with that being said, it is a decent watch simply for the fabulous bits thrown into it; the content of the story is interesting, and it is certainly the basis for a film. I enjoyed the way the film began and ended, but the middle portions could have been done much better, and the focus of the film could have been more precise. A lot of the cinematography and story was very good, and enough to make up for the aforementioned flaws, but still I walk away with split feelings. Overall, worth watching, but far from flawless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cure Worse than the Disease</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hunt for Japanese serial killer. Heavily indebted to, openly derivative of American noire. Stale with alienation. Revels in shock value of disfigurement of corpses (c.f., De Palma's "Body Double," etc.). Unfortunately, the audience knows the answer to the mystery (who and why) long before the dick does, and then there's still two thirds of the movie left to sit through. Nice visual touches and pacing, though studied and self-conscious (Japanese=anal control freaks?). Observation: the Japanese have this thing about ritual, suppression of self before the mask of the past and all that's "holy," evocation of eternity by repetition. But little more than Cult grows out of this forced selflessness, all that deadpan self-control, repression. Zen meets Boston Blackie. The Ultimate/Absolute here isn't much more than hollow pretension, mystical froofra. Hint: serial killer executes his mayhem not unlike Freddy, through mind control. A movie overtaken by itself; hypnotic, soporific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay but long, repetitive, and rather trite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting is good enough, the direction good enough, but the film has no new idea in it and no payoff apart from an obvious climax, and so it seems too long by a half hour at least. Especially, there is too little information on the one question that interested me, which was: what is this guy exactly? The movie drops a hint (or near-hint) of supernatural abilities but does not enlarge on it. His character, that of the detective, and their continuing relationship needed more variation, more detail, and more meaning. But hybrid crime-horror films of this type tend to encourage lazy writing: the police investigation supplies an automatic structure and an excuse for continuous exposition, and usually, as here, the horror idea is only half-developed and the crime story unsatisfactorily resolved. To me the best elements of the film were the performance of the actor playing the detective and the treatment of some of the interiors, particularly the hospital room. But then I am probably opaque to perhaps the largest topic in this and other recent Japanese horror films, which is the skewing of behavioral norms in extremis: a quiet, normal-seeming person maims or murders and doesn't understand why that's not okay. In other countries' horror films, I think, the destroyer generally stands outside society: he is an unreasoning monster, or an obsessive, or a genius who regards himself as beyond ordinary standards of conduct. From this and other Japanese films that come to mind (I haven't thought it through far enough to see if it is true predominantly), I wonder if the difference in Japanese horror is that it arises out of someone part of society, who follows its conventions and then shatters them, so that for instance in this film the police are infuriated to the point of irrationality by the character's baffling indifference to order and to their authority as the keepers of order. I can think of similar examples in British films, e.g. Brimstone and Treacle, which also stand as counterpoint to a norm of highly mannered behavior. In Japan behavior is, or used to be, fixed to the point of ritual. So perhaps to spectators like me who have never absorbed such a norm into ourselves, the shock of its violation, as in this film, just doesn't ring the bell. Similarly, in one Latin American horror film, the villain eats meat on Friday, and the act is presented as comparable in heinousness to his physical atrocities. It all depends on where you're coming from, I guess--literally as well as figuratively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Cure for Confusion?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high expectations for "Cure", partly because I'm intrigued by serial-killer stories and several people had claimed this one was even better than "Seven" and "Silence of the Lambs" (ahem!) but mostly because this movie was released shortly BEFORE the Asian horror/thriller hype forever broke loose with "Ringu". Maybe this still was an Asian thriller that is genuinely good and/or earned its cult reputation in an honest way, rather than because everyone praises it blindly? Well, the answer is yes...and no. The basic premise of "Cure" is truly compelling and Kiyoshi Kurosawa's filming style is definitely impressive, but eventually the exaggerated complexity ruins the whole lot. Just once, I'd like to see a Japanese occult-thriller that doesn't leave me scratching my head after the final denouement. Anyway, let's just focus on the first hour and the atmosphere! Fatigue copper Takabe is tormented by a mysterious series of killings in Tokyo. The culprits are always caught immediately at the scene of the crime and, even though they're seemly unrelated, they're all highly unlikely assassins and mysteriously marked their victims' bodies with a large "X". The one thing they all have in common turns out to be a brief encounter with Mr. Mamiya; an odd drifter with amnesia and a dubious past involving the study of hypnosis. "Cure" features a high tension level during the first hour (when the murders still are a giant riddle) and you also definitely sympathize with the main characters. Detective Takabe is a good man with noble ideals, the unfortunate "murderers" truly evoke feelings of compassion and Mr. Mamiya has a fascinating personality, despite his malicious (?) intentions. The acting performances are amazing and Kurosawa patiently gives his cast the opportunity to show their versatile talents. There's few explicit gore but several highly disturbing images of mutilated corpses and suicides that really aren't for the weak-hearted. The music is excellent and Kurosawa's directing is solid up until the last sequences, when he regretfully leaves too many questions unanswered and relies too much on the supernatural aspect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual and intriguing mystery about murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Koji Yakusho stars as detective on the tail of a murderer who uses other to do his deeds.Mysterious killing is going around Tokyo, the method are similar but the suspects are all from different walks of life. Detective Takabe (Koji Yakusho) is on the tail of the suspect who he suspects is using hypnosis to make others kill. Him and his psychologist friend Sakuma begin to profile the suspect. Investigation reveals that the suspect used to be a psychology student and was studying about Mesmer.Koji Yakusho won the 10th Tokyo Movie Festival Male Lead award with this movie, and has become a regular in director Kiyoshi Kurosawa's movies since then.The movie has no punctuation point which makes it weak. There's only gruesome killing and unusual suspect to carry the whole story. There is nothing behind the motive, or why the suspect became what he is. This makes the movie fizzle without a bang that should have been there for such a mystery. A very dark movie that could have been lot better if the motive and the cause was better fleshed out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How much you enjoy "Cure" will depend on how well you can overlook the hokum and psychobabble which is the basis of the plot. A horror-psychodrama, "Cure" tells of a young man with Svengali-like powers who hypnotizes his victims and leaves them with a post-hypnotic suggestion which will have them horrifically slash others. At issue is: will the detective who is hot on his trail, on the verge of burn-out from overwork and a mentally ill wife, be able to win a battle of psyches with such a artful practitioner? Soooo, if you can buy into that kind of nonsense, you're in for a slick, plodding watch which might just do a number on your head. Good for horror film buffs into foreign films. (C+)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gore or Bore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cure is not a gore movie, despite how other reviews compare this to Se7en. There are some gore scenes but they are very minimal - to try to get the movie going.Essentially, this is a psychological thriller to explore the mind of the "sophisticated" criminal, at the same time, it is the story to explore the life of a weary detective.I've found many problems watching this movie from a logical mind. There are too many open questions that never get answered. At least for Se7en, the movie nicely ties up all the loose ends in the end, such is not the case for Cure. It is one thing to talk about the sophistication of the criminal mind, but it is another thing when the mind just does not make sense - and then cause other people not to make sense as well.I also find the "shocking end" less than satisfying. More can be done to explain why it happens versus it just happens. The transformation of sanity into insanity is complex, the movie does not do justice in presenting this topic well.A 2/10 in my book. For better movies on the same topic, I suggest Se7en.</fullReview>

If only it looked as good on celluloid as it does on paper as this movie has about 3 minutes to keep you awake where all the rest of the movie we see poor acting (in fact so poor that you see no differences in any of the personages), there is no emotion in it (seeing the news is more thrilling than Kyua), there is an arty atmosphere that tries to uplift this above an average copmovie but it all gets so complicated that you give up trying.
