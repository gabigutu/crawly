		<shortDescription>A film that hits close to home....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"October Sky" is a film that will steal your heart, fill your mind with vivid imagery, and lift your spirit. The tale of Homer Hickham and his dream of creating a rocket seem so simple at first, especially when the film is set in a mining town, where the future is as clear cut as the lumps of coal in the mine. But Homer cannot follow in his father's footsteps. With the encouragement of Miss Riley,(a friendly teacher), members of his father's staff, and his friends, Homer attempts to make his dream a reality.Yet as in any true to life story, there are many stops along the way. Director Joe Johnston lowers us into the coal mines, where we witness the chilling plight of miners stooped beneath a ceiling of rock. With lit helmets and bent posture, they resembled alien insectoids more than humans in the darkness. The hacking coughs of the miners and the blackened faces were a constant reminder of the danger the miners faced in their work.Contrasting the mine shaft's lugubrious load are the images of Homer and his friend's rocket launches. Underneath the blue bowl of sky, rockets are placed upon a pad and launched into the stratosphere...And nothing can match the scene when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time.Yet what makes the film so endearing is the relationship between the characters. Homer's father is a classic hardened man...but he has a soft side as well. We see that he does love his son, despite their many arguments. The love and support of Miss Riley is evident as well. Best of all, the film is uncomfortable. It doesn't tie everything up in a nice bow. It tears at you, lifts you up. It keeps an air of reality, which is important in a film like this.This film can be considered a complete work. At first, I was disappointed that the film did not continue with Homer's life. I didn't want it to end. Then I realized...that's what a good film does to a person. If it has done its job, you won't want it to end. And "October Sky" accomplishes just that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1.) This movie was amazing! I watched it while I was in the town next to the one where he grew up! I went and saw the buildings that the story took place in. Overall, I loved this movie, One of Jake Gyllenhaal's best!! Also- my favorite parts were the science fair, and all the times with his father. They were so sad, it seemed. Homer wanted to follow his dream and his dad didn't seem to care one way or another. That tag line is true. "Sometimes One Dream is bright enough to light up the sky." 2.) The way this movie was shot was impeccable, it was all so believable that it could have been recorded during the 1950's. Dress was accurate and they had their slang down too. Definitely recommend this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It is one of the few movies that I have consistently recommended to friends to rent and have had all of them thank me for the referral. The film has some powerful themes that are beautifully scripted. The acting is superb all around (Chris Cooper has never turned in a bad acting role in my opinion!) The message of this film is so well delivered, so powerful, that it moved me to tears the first time I saw it. Not sad tears, which are easily solicited by cinema formula, but tears of joy--a rare thing.Although I did not grow up in the 1950's, I believe this film honestly portrays the mood and setting of the time. Given today's harsh world with all its complications, watching this film is a welcome escape to a time of innocence, wonder, and discovery. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have yet to read "The Rocket Boys", the book upon which this film is based, but this situation will not continue! I did read a short story by Hickam which was apparently the seed that started him on the novel. It grabbed me even then.I am one of those fortunate enough to have lived adjacent to Cape Canaveral during the Mercury program, where my father worked, and this childhood situation no doubt fostered my lifelong interests and hobbies. I also met Werner von Braun, and one of the other German rocket scientists repaired a rubber band driven model plane I had (I WISH I still had that plane!) I mention this because I went into the movie with serious expectations and very much desired to see a film with authentic treatments for the nostalgia and emotions of the period.I was not disappointed. While there were superficial flaws here and there, the movie came together like so few Hollywood films do. Good storytelling, authentic emotions and period atmosphere. As others have experienced at this excellent film, I was choked up at the end and had to wipe away the tears. The father of the family next to me asked to borrow my spare paper napkin to wipe his tears. About half the audience applauded at the end, and most everyone stayed through the credits. It's just one of those films.Not the greatest movie ever made, but one of the best family movies in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb film, based on real people and real events.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was 1957 and Russia had just launched Sputnik. I was almost 12, and I remember my father pointing up into the October sky as we tried to catch a glimpse of the Earth's first artificial satellite orbiting overhead. Thus the title "October Sky". In West Virginia the son of a coal miner became intrigued with rockets and space travel and, in spite of his father's urgings that he accept his fate and become a coal miner too, eventually won the national science fair competition, and a college scholarship, ultimately became a key member of the space exploration team of NASA. A wonderful and inspiring story, and a superb film of that story.Everyone was good in the film, but Chris Cooper as the miner boss and stubborn father was far and away the best in "October Sky." Although "rockets" is the theme, the film is primarily of the struggle of children trying to break out of the cycle and become more than just another coal miner. As an epilog we learn that all four of the "rocket boys" went to college, the father died of mining-related disease, the teacher of Hodgkins disease, and the whole town and mining operation was sold and shut down in the next decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Takes One Back To A Childhood In The '50s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fine drama and a nice change of pace from today's more hectic and loud films. It is another solid based-on-a-true store, which still means much of it could be made up for dramatic purposes. Frankly, I don't know but I liked the story.The story is about a young man back in the Fifties who gets interested in rocketry and wants to enter that field instead of working in the coal mines as everyone else, including his father, does in this West Virginia town. The big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father, which I think was overdone. I would like to have a little less tension between the two.The young man, still a boy, is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, one of his first staring assignments, I think. He's likable, as are his school buddies in here. It's nice to see nice kids in a modern-day film. The two other key actors in the movie are Chris Cooper (the dad) and Laura Dern (the kid's teacher who encourages him all the time.)The cinematography is decent the 1950s soundtrack is fun to hear. Once again: I wish there more of these kind of films made today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real piece of Americana, not for cynics!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a gem, a real piece of Americana for all that this implies. If you are self programed to resist "life-afirming" stories, just stay away and leave the pleasure to the rest of us who still believe. And what makes the frosting on the cake truly delectable is that it is fact based on a real rags to riches story, no need to nit-pick what details were changed to make a compact story. Chris Cooper is one of the greatest living actors, and the complex, self-conflicted, bottom-line good at the core father he portrayed could only be pulled off successfully by someone with his skill and insight. The simple minded comments, refusing to accept a father who tries to lay down the law all the while sensing that he may possibly be off-track, expose the limitation of the commentator, not the writers or the acting. This is not for the cynical, or the simple minded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was watching this when my wife called to inquire from the other room as to my choice of fare. My comment? "I am watching my Life!"Though younger, but only by 5 years or so, than the "Rocket Boys" I remember the absolute urgency with which Sputnick was greeted by our administrators of education and how the whole Science Fair thing gained momentum and took me and others into the competitive whirlwind. My own tornado landed me in my own State's Science Fair, in Physics by '62, though our group was less successful in gaining the support of, for example, firefighters we approached for guidance and counsel until after a tragic event, our city went so far as to allow us to tour the Nike missile site on Chicago's lakeshore.This movie brought it all back for me and I will bet that it brought it all back for a bunch of us "UberNerds" of the late '50s and early 60's.We are in a similar science brain drainage period now and really need this movie as a country. See It!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocket Boy's Life Soars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I resisted seeing this movie and I understand why it was not a big hit in theatres. "October Sky" feels and looks oh so familiar. And it is. All plot contrivances and emotions have been explored before in other films -- and possibly even better. But despite it's familiarity and resistance to all formulas Hollywood, this movie is winning and likeable at every turn. Sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of the heart, mind and soul. Just as the characters from Steven Sondheim's musical MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG stood agape atop their apartment roof hoping it would launch their new generation ("What do you call it? You call it a miracle."), Sputnik has a similar affect on the young rocket boys of this true tale. While jaded townsfolk of their 1950's coal town dismiss the event, Homer Hickham sees Sputnik as his ticket out of a life in the mines.Masterful direction and casting make the journey of rocket boy Homer and his pals seem fresh and new. Especially affecting are subplots concerning Homer's ailing young school teacher. Remarkable restraint is shown in depicting their delicate relationship. Also remarkable is the father / son supblot that anchors the film. Perfectly played all around. Even Homer's mom gets her moment without cliche or intrusion. Her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and heatbreaking. "Myrtle Beach" says it all. A major video chain I despise has a sign next to this film stating that you'll love this film or they'll refund your money. For once, I agree with them. You'll never look at the October sky quite the same again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first great film of 1999. *** out of ****.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an old saying that relates to the rousing new film by Joe Johnston that goes something like this: "The man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he can't are both right." That is a highly presumptuous statement referring to self motivating and belief in an individual, which, in this movie, stand true even after road blocks and family trouble stand in the way."October Sky" is about a young man who believes in himself named Homer Hickam, growing up in a strict, traditional family in the 1950's. Homer loves in a small coal mining town where nearly every man grows up to be a miner. All of his friends, Quentin, Roy, and O'Dell all think that their life after high school will be like everyone else's. Homer is not exited about that future.One night, while everyone stares at the sky, a Russian space craft called Sputnik passes overhead. This is something new for Homer, and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming. From this point on, his look at life will never be the same.First, he tells everyone that he wants to work in the rocket scientist area for an occupation. Flabbergasted at what he says, his family passes that idea over their heads and continues with life as usual His friends, however, think that this idea may have some potential. After all, Quentin is a very smart individual when it comes to this kind of thing.When the four friends start to test model rockets, and blow a white picket fence to smithereens, then what seems to be a forest fire is scared by them, they're forced to end their progresses.The performances in this movie are absolutely riveting from start to finish. All of the actors give performances as if this is the real mumbo jumbo here. Standing out in all of the glory: Laura Dern as Miss Riley. This very well may be Academy award material if the judges can remember back to the beginning of the year when this film is released.The characters are also extremely well developed. Not only to the filmmakers give clear, apparent reason why Homer is interested in the subject, but they also explain to the audience how they are succeeding in their studding of rocketry. We clearly understand all of the characters' motives and beliefs, especially the father, who is bent over on everlasting tradition.The film, unfortunately, loses some of its momentum at mid-point because of a silly, recycled romantic sub-plot involving Homer's love interest and how his brother stole her from him. This type of this is becoming so awfully common in high-school movies, not that this film is aimed at high-schoolers. The actors stare at each other mindlessly, like the are in a trance. I put up with it without complaining in 1997's "Inventing the Abbots," but I have had just about enough this.But that is just a minor complaint. With an authentic looking time period, cinematography worth an Oscar and clips of the real life Homer and friends at the end, whom all hit it big with their dreams, especially Homer, this is the first great film of 1999.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent family movie, and a fine story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) a little while back and, since then, I've been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has an intensity (and he even resembles Owen somewhat) that just oozes from the screen. I feel sure that, if he lands some meaty roles, he'll crack an Oscar one day...That's not to denigrate this film at all.It's a fine story, with very believable people (well, it's based upon the author's early shenanigans with rocketry), a great cast ? Chris Cooper is always good, and Laura Dern is always on my watch list ? with the appropriate mix of humor, pathos, excitement...and the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tapping.But, this film had a very special significance for me: in 1957, I was the same age as Homer Hickham; like him, I looked up at the night stars to watch Sputnik as it scudded across the blackness; like Homer also, I experimented with rocketry in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel; and like Homer, I also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster! What fun it was...I didn't achieve his great (metaphorical and physical) heights though. But, that's what you find out when you see this movie.Sure, it's a basic family movie, but that's a dying breed these days, it seems. Take the time to see it, with the kids: you'll all have a lot of good laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was hard to choose your future in the 1950s for a worker's son.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A simple and effective film about what life is all about, responding to challenges. It took a lot of gall for Homer and his friends to be able to grow into manhood without falling in the trap of a prefabricated future that runs from father to son, to be a miner in the local mine and never get out of that fate. It took also three different challenges for Homer and his friends to conquer a personal and free future. The challenge of the first ever man-made artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, a Soviet satellite, a milestone in human history, a turning point that Homer and his friends could not miss, did not want to miss. Then the challenge of science and applied mechanics to calculate and to devise a rocket from scratch or rather from what they could gather in books and order in their minds. Finally the challenge of a world that resists and refuses and tries to force you back into the pack, even with an untimely accident that forces you to get back into the pack for plain survival necessity, and even then Homer proved he had the guts to accept the challenge that was blocking for a while his own plans and dreams. But there is another side of the story that the film does not emphasize enough. Homer is the carrier of the project but he is also the carrier of the inspiration he and his friends need. If he is the one who is going to get the university scholarship, because his friends gave him precedence, his friends will also be able to get on their own roads and tracks and step out of the mining fate, thanks to the energy his inspiring example sets in front of their eyes. It is hard at times not to follow the example of the one who is like a beacon on a difficult road. But the film is also effective to show how the father resisted this dream because for him science was not the fabric of a true man, like mining or football. The working class fate that was so present in those 1950s and 1960s and still is present in some areas is too often enforced by the traditional thinking of the father. If the mother does not have the courage to speak up one day, the working class fate I am speaking of becomes a tremendous trap. Here too the film is effective and it should make some parents think. This might have been the fourth challenge Homer had to face: the challenge of taking a road that was not the one pointed at and programmed by his own father.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine &amp; University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better late than never! GO SEE THIS FILM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have recently seen this movie due to Jake's recent success with Brokeback Mountain. I figured I would see the movies that I missed. I had no expectations going into the film so was astounded that I had missed this movie at all. It's a gripping father and son tale, and it is also an underdog story. I even shed a tear at the finale of this wonderful tale. This movie appeals to all ages. The only reason I give it a 9 out of 10 is that it slows down a little in the middle, but it comes back strong in the end. The acting was great, the story was magnificent, and the cinematography was captivating given the setting of the film. GO SEE THIS MOVIE! Rent it, buy it, watch it, LOVE IT!

		<shortDescription>Reason that the movie is named October Sky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I read this someplace: Joe Johnston (director of the film and also one of the guys who founded Industrial Light and Magic for work on the first Star Wars film) and one of his producers or something were racking their brains for a title for the movie, "Rocket Boys" (I guess) was lacking something.One day they were messing with a PC program that forms words from other words (ie: you type in a word or series of words and it mixes the letters up and forms other words) I think the technical term is an "anagram"Anyway, they typed in "Rocket Boys" and sure enough what comes back is "October Sky". They were shocked to say the least. The title summed up everything in the movie since the movie revolves around Sputnik. At first Homer Jr did not like the idea, but he warmed up to it after the "movie poster paperback novel" came out and took off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was incredibly well done and thought out. The only reason this thing has a 7.6 out of 10 is because critics hate the space program. This movie rivals Apollo 13 and is highly under-rated. Its a very inspirational film that at the end ==Spoiler== I nearly cried seeing STS-1 liftoff with the absolutely well done film score that makes you want to fly into Space. ==End Spoiler== Jake did a great job on this one.I remember seeing this back in 1999, I wasn't expecting much and I was extremely surprised and it caused me to go into rocketry myself.

		<shortDescription>A Sky for All Seasons- Touching American Piece ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A true wholesome American story about teenagers who are interested in launching their own rocket in a rural West Virginia coal mining town, after the launch of Sputnik in 1957.Through trial, tribulations and perseverance beyond belief, they are ultimately able to achieve their goals.Jake Gyllenhaal, as the leader of the group, is excellent in the title role. As his motivating science teacher, Laura Linney is quite good but her southern accent is over the top.There is a standout supporting performance by Chris Cooper, a head miner, who wants his son to follow in his footsteps, but gradually comes around at film's end.What makes this film so unusual for our times is that there are no bed-hopping scenes and no profanity whatsoever. It is the epitome of an American story that is well done.Besides the science angle, we have the father-son disagreement, football scholarships as a way to escape coal mining, and the loving spirit of family.Why aren't pictures like this recognized more at award times?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a bit of trivia which should be pointed out about a scene early in the movie where Homer watches the attempt of December 6, 1957 (at least that was the video used on the TV he was watching) which showed the Vangard launch attempt, which failed.He is next shown reading or dictating a letter to Dr. Von Braun offering condolences about the failure.Von Braun was at Marshall space flight center in Huntsville working for the Army. The Vanguard project was by the early Nasa team which was at what soon became Goddard Space flight center.The army rushed the Jupiter-C, which was essentially a US made V2 technology, but worked to launch a satellite in response to Russia's success with Sputnik.This error may have actually been made by Homer, because of the notoriety of Von Braun, but his team didn't have their attempt fail. In fact the underlying Redstone was flying from 52 and was the first US man rated booster, used for Shepard's sub orbital flight, as well as Grissom's.This is why this sort of movie is so good, as it hopefully will inspire people to read up and spot these bits of trivia, and in the process see what has been done, and be inspired to do more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up in Southern West Virginia; I'm about the same age as (or maybe a year older than) Homer Hickam, author of "The Rocket Boys," the book forming the true-story basis of this heart-warming film.And so I relate closely to the West Virginia coal-mining theme, and to the stunning effect Sputnik had at that time (October 4, 1957) on all of us. The Rocket Boys went on to make great lives for themselves. I went on to get my degrees in Physics and Computer Engineering. All because Sputnik woke up a lot of young people to the "Science Gap" the U.S.S.R. had on the U.S. in those Cold War days...This is a wonderful film for everyone, of all ages. But if you grew up in West Virginia in the late 1950's, it'll touch the core of your being.Everyone: Get it; watch it; recommend it to your friends... who'll thank you many times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just accidentally stumbled over this film on TV one day. It was aired in the middle of the day on a channel not exactly famous for airing good movies. This one, however, was nothing less then good.October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a boy inspired by the Sputnick launch to become a rocket scientist. He and his friends begin to build rockets. His father is not to happy about his sons new found hobby and would rather see him become a coal-miner as himself or go to college on a football-scholarship like his brother.The story is well written. A bit too predictable maybe, but that's OK cause it doesn't focus too much on those parts of the story. It's important part, but where this is obvious the inner action, the action between the characters is focused on. The story is good. It has some clichés, but that's OK. It's based on actual event's so you kind of can't just drop out these clichés. The characters are really good. Where the story is on a downhill the characters are brought out and manage to keep the action and the quality of the movie high. You get to know these characters and you get sympathy for them. They are well written and believable.This is a good looking movie. The sets and the 50's style is thorough and the pictures are well composed and well lit. This all sets the mood of the film very good.The acting is really good. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a great performance as Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper is good as John Hickam. As for the rest of the cast they are good too. All together this makes out a pretty strong cast.All in all I'm glad I caught this movie. It was first after seeing it I learned that it was based on actual events. If I had known that when seeing it, it would probably just be even more interesting. October Sky is a good and interesting movie. It's a movie I believe everyone can enjoy. It's kind of a feel-good movie. Not bad at all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OCTOBER SKY is a great, great movie. I would consider it to be one of the best dramas ever made. Perhaps even one of the best movies ever made in any genre. This is the true story of four boys in a coal mining town that, instead of growing up to become coal miners like their fathers, they want to do something more. They want to make something of themselves. Inspired by the launch of the first Sputnik, the four boys set out to create their own rocket and win the county science fair to win themselves scholarships. OCTOBER SKY wins on every level. Humor, drama, a little action, some romance (not very much). I really enjoy movies of this caliber. While it wasn't a very big hit in theaters, it was still one of the best movies that I have ever seen so far in my life. I saw this movie in science class, because we are learning about the creation of rockets ourselves, but I didn't really pay much attention to the building of the rocket, it was more the feel and sadness of the film. It is truely a great movie to watch with or without your family. It is good either way. After I am done writing this, I am going to watch it again. I just thought it best to write my review before I see it in friggen wide-screen format on my DVD. I seriously cannot see how people can enjoy watching movies on wide-screen. It takes away half of the screen! What the hell is up with that? And people say its better? Some people are just really stupid. But, here's hoping that the great feel of the movie will keep me happy and keep me from not moaning about it. If you like this movie, I also recommend THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, THE GREEN MILE, STAND BY ME, THE MAJESTIC, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE,and HEARTS IN ATLANTIS. 5/5 for all of those including OCTOBER SKY.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly refreshing, a film with pure heart and no pretensions...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the premise, I thought the movie would be similar to VARSITY BLUES (without the sports, of course)...somewhat cheesy and predictable. However as the story develops, one will notice that Joe Johnston actually had a well-thought out plan for this feature. The story is moving and compelling, and will affect you emotionally in ways movies like these rarely do.The reason? It's a simple movie, with a relatively familiar backdrop, but it's done very straightforwardly with no hint of pretension. At times there is some degree of predictability, but then the story takes rather unexpected turns. Just when you think you know exactly what will happen, the movie will prove your alleged clairvoyance wrong.The standout in this movie for me is the interaction between Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. This interaction provides one of the more complex and layered father/son relationships you will see in a movie of this nature. Laura Dern also has a small role but manages it quite effectively.Moreover, much has been done to recreate the 1950s ambiance; from the costumes to the art decoration to the architecture, this movie looks and feels like it is based in the 1950s, adding to the overall viewing experience.I would recommend this for anyone looking to see a (much) better-than-average film about belief in oneself and achieving one's dreams in the face of adversity, although this movie is much more than just that. Not for those who think cheesy special effects and mind-numbingly lewd comedy are prerequisites for a good film.3.5 stars (out of 4). 8/10. Should warrant a place in my Honourable Mentions list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i voted it 10 as it's my most loved movie of all time. It was one of those rare moments and rare feelings you get when something great comes to an end. It was never a movie which was grossly advertised or hugely popular. Very honest and real account, non of this typical Hollywood falseness you get in so many movies.. It's certainly got the x-factor in my books. I was surprised this movie didn't do a 'shawshank redemption' thus becoming hugely popular years after the movie was released. I first watched this movie years after it came out at the cinema on the back of a coach on a 6hour journey to the everglades in Florida i was with my family and we balled our eyes out. Not many people really knew about this movie and its precisely because of this; it wins my heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best inspirational movie i have ever seen. This is an amazing story of 4 boys from the countryside mining village who takes on building rockets with the help of the local people and show that nothing is impossible. The story line is really amazing and th background music is highly touching. The performance of Jake Gyllenhaal is one of a kind and had tried the best to depict the mood and mindset of Homer Hickam as said in the book. Well scripted and some dialogs are powerful and makes you melt along with the statements. It a delight to see this movie.. Really an Inspirational, Motivating, Enthusiastic, and also a fine Family drama. A must see..I really believe that if we have teachers like Miss Frieda Riley, no doubt that people can come up with great things. Don't think all requires is right things at right time to achieve is what you want. This movie shows thou is great who achieve great things among odd things.TOTALLY SUPERB MOVIE!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Courage can change destiny: a true story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a little town where the neighbourhood is made up of mines and all the villagers are miners, your destiny could seem to follow in your father's footsteps, especially if he is the head-miner. In this Johnston's masterpiece, Jake Gyllenhaal is Homer Hickam, a student that warmed to astronomy, dreaming of build a rocket. His father is against him: his family needs money and he would like that his son will contribute to the maintenance in stead of spending time with frivolous projects; what his father doesn't understand is that the rocket means the way to have a possibility to pick out his own life and to not accept what other people have preordained to you. No need if your project will not realize, no need if you will have failed: what's important is to try; with determination, something will be stand to you: the fear and the courage to say: "I'll ever attempt!". This is what the movie shrieks: "Keep your chin up! Go on!".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Against the Odds!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Homer and company have the cards laid out against them. Having driven through Coalwood WV where they grew up, one quickly can see how the odds are favorable for working in the coal mines. Being raised in a similar situation where the principle income was coal and refractories while graduating from high school in the 98th percentile in the nation in science, I can identify with these boys challenges, desires, and purpose driven objectives. Many a child in similar situations simply take what is laid before them and turn from the challenge to break the mold and move out into a bigger and more broadened world. Homer struggles with this challenge and even finds family obstacles and academic hurdles to overcome should he and his friends decide to break on through to the other side.Will Homer and his friends make it? Should they try to make something better of their lives? The director, cast, and crew work hard at making you part of that decision process. Expect to find points where you want to scream "do it" but also expect to be saddened when the chips fall and the challenge grows to greater summits then the boys have courage. Will they succeed? Will they meet the challenge and rise above it? Or, will they join the rank and file and become just as their fathers and their fathers for generations? You have to see this one and have your children see it too. I give it a 10 for content, life impact, and personal growth . . and . . the directing, acting, and setting aren't bad either. Actually the latter set the pace for an exciting and enjoyable flick that will leave your heart filled with desire. DrD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I have seen the cynics comment on this movie and their eye for details...just one word for them what ever u say is "hogwash". What is movie making all about?? In my opinion its about bringing things to life to inspire not to be pin point accurate, but to give a view which some may agree and some may not. I saw people commenting about the whole town coming to see the rocket launch well i think its a symbolic gesture, as those rockets stand for hope and belief and thats what this movie is all about. If you can see Forrest gump with the same eye it's without sense but that movie also depicts the victory of human spirit over all overwhelming odds to have faith when everyone looses it. The only people who can be cynical about this film are those who have given up and in their despair see everything beautiful as a threat,, pity them. Its a shame that the movie didn't even achieved a Oscar nomination, goes on to show how banal and frivolous these awards are.</fullReview>

Each person has strengths and weaknesses. And in using strengths, overcoming weaknesses, and working towards a perhaps unachievable goal, each person contributes just that much more to the group as a whole.Merging model rockets, coal mines, football scholarships and the fifties into a coherent film can't have been easy. But excellent direction, superb performances (most notably by young performers Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Owens and the less young Chris Cooper), marvellous cinematography, a great soundtrack and beautiful script make OCTOBER SKY one of the finest films I've seen in years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those feel-good films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'October Sky' is a film about a group of young boys in a troubled mid-western coal-mining village who have the dream about creating rockets. This hobby leads them on to some exciting and wider events and recognition. It is ultimately a film about an unsung hero and his troubled family life with an over-bearing father who wants to make a better life for himself. It's a film about hope and dreams.Although the story itself is engaging and emotional, the film is too full of clichés for my tastes. It is one of those films that gives you hope and makes you feel good. It teaches that people who put their mind to something can achieve some important recognition. This film makes life seem so simple, which is great if you enjoy films like that but annoying if you were hoping for a little bit more. There are many films that follow a similar mold, and one of these is Field of Dreams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>October Sky is one of the most average films in recent memory. It moves from cliche to cliche without a care in the world because the film itself is a cliche: if you work hard enough, you will be rewarded. You get all the elements that work against our unlikely hero, such as a tough father and skeptical friends, as well as some unexpected advantages, like a helpful teacher and a resident genius friend. The movie stumbles through these situations and banks that the audience will buy it because it is based on a true story. And it seems like it has worked because most viewers seem to like the film.There were some fine elements in the film. Chris Cooper is Hollywood's most underrated actor. His performance as the father could have been very flat, but instead he allows him to be a three dimensional man. The development of the relationship between the father and son is nice, if not a little Freudian. The other performances are nice too, but nothing special. Laura Dern, another underrated performer, is given a terrible, underwritten role, but she does the best she can. Also, the film does end much better than it begins. The first 75 minutes have a lot of silly setpieces, like "let's play on the train tracks like in Stand By Me" and "let's find our lost rocket even if the relevance to the plot is no longer clear". The end of the film really comes together, though, by focusing on the father-son relationship and the futures of the boys once they get out of that dreadful town.One final note is in order. I believe that the film was completely unfair to unions and intentionally tried to make them look evil. Why is everyone associated with the union leadership portrayed like a wild, snarling animal? Could it be that the entire film is a quiet piece of right-wing propaganda? Does anybody really believe that if we just follow our dreams that everyone has an equal chance in America? These are just a few final thoughts, and they ultimately do not impact on my overall appraisal of the film, which I give a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved October Sky. The thing I loved most had to be the music. It worked two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives the viewer a time-frame. This is done by playing songs from the late Fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. The music now fits the mood of the film perfectly.I did not only enjoy the music, I also quite enjoyed the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a surprise for me. He gave off a first-class performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam).I've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now, and both times I thoroughly enjoyed myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Uplifting Period Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal). He is a high school boy from a coal mining town in West Virginia. Unless you were able to get a football scholarship the chances of getting out of Coalwood were small. Homer does not fit the bill of a football player and refuses to become another miner. Instead he sets his sights on what's above the earth rather than below it. In the wake of the first Sputnik launch Homer decides to take up rocketry without the approval of his coal miner father John (Chris Cooper).This film is a small slice of life depicting the perseverance of Homer and his friends to make something of their lives. They receive little support from the majority of the town members who believe that there's not much else to life besides mining coal and playing football. October Sky takes the dreams of four high school boys and inspires those who believe that you can become something bigger than the life society deems for you.The screenplay is well written, the acting top notch, and the story is bigger than the setting. This small period piece is amazingly uplifting and can touch a wide audience. It is a family movie and is one that all can enjoy regardless of age.I first saw this film in theaters when I was eight. Over fifteen years later I still find this movie as inspirational as the first time I saw it. I keep it on my shelf under movies that will lift me up. It is simple but extraordinary at the same time. This little gem should be on everyones list to watch. I think it is a movie that will never be outdated and one that will stay with all those that have seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>October Sky (1999): Dir: Joe Johnston / Cast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper, Laura Dern, Chris Owen, William Lee Scott: True story about the freedom to dream and avoid tradition. Jake Gyllenhaal dreams of going to space and builds miniature rockets. After he and his friends wreck his mother's white picket fence, he turns to the unpopular book worm for help. The rest consists of rocket launching tests to enter the science fair. Filled with stereotypes including the unpopular class nerd, the supportive ill health teacher, the hard nose principal, the popular girl, and Chris Cooper with the dreary role of discouraging father. Director Joe Johnston establishes the 1957 setting with fantastic rocket launching footage but unfortunately he launches a screenplay full of clichés and stereotypes. This is a different type of film for a director known for Jumanji and The Rocketeer. Gyllenhaal basically goes with the flow playing the boy who must prove himself and gain his father's approval. Cooper's role is equally xeroxed as his father. Watching a sitcom father and son is far more interesting than anything these two do in this film. Laura Dern plays the teacher who is ill yet encouraging. Chris Owen completes the stereotypes as the nerd. The film is well made on a technical level but fails on the story front. Theme regards dreams within a screenplay that doesn't fly so high. Score: 5 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the pleasure of working in this part of WV a few years ago. The values and the personalities depicted still exist 50 years after the period the story is set in. The story line is one that I saw play out on a daily basis making the movie very true to life. The interactions and relationships between Homer, his parents and friends struck a chord in me.I never noticed this when it came out. It caught my attention while staying in a hotel and Showtime has it on heavy rotation. Hearing Welch, War and Bluefield caught my attention from having lived in the area for two years. The area is beautiful to travel thru, if you avoid the coal trucks. Some of the towns don't look like they have changed since Roosevelt was president. Having been there and knowing people who live there today brings the movie to life for me.This is one of the movies that can make you nostalgic about your own past while teaching you some history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Coming Of Age Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>October Sky is one of the best coming-of-age films out there to watch. It has the theme of kids should do want they want to do, not what their parents decide for them. My favorite part of the movie is how the relationship between father and son was depicted. In most movies like this, the father is often depicted as the tyrant. But, while he is strict here, he is not as bad as most of these fathers. The film is boasted by lovable, relatable characters, a very strong screenplay, and great direction.Joe Johnston's film is about how four guys including Homer Hickam in a coal-mining town decide to create a rocket against the will of everyone in town besides their encouraging teacher.The acting is very good. Young Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Homer and he is a very good actor, much better than other child actors. Chris Cooper was really good as his father and I didn't hate him as much as I thought I would. Laura Dern is pretty good as the teacher, but I believe she over-acted just a little.Overall, this is a fantastic film for all ages to see. I'm sure this film could hit notes with the older generation who grew up in the 1950's. The movie inspires everybody that they can be who they want to be, and they must not let anyone get in their way. I rate this film 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreams And Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't around for the 1950's, at the height of the Cold War, but I've read enough to know the sense of fear and even paranoia that those days inspired in people. Perhaps the height of the Cold War came in 1957, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik - the first artificial satellite to orbit the earth. "October Sky" opens with the launch of Sputnik, and that opening captures very well the sense of fear that overtook one town - Coalwood, West Virginia as news of the launch spread. But it wasn't all fear. To some it was inspiration. Coalwood was exactly what the name sounds like - a coal mining town, whose people were basically expected to live and die in the coal mines, with few opportunities to get out. But watching Sputnik soar through the sky overhead inspired high school student Homer Hickham (a wonderful performance by Jake Gyllenhaal) to want something more. He along with several friends become rocket enthusiasts, dreaming of escaping the dreary little town and of doing greater things, with the support of a sympathetic high school science teacher (played by Laura Dern).I wouldn't call this a riveting movie. It is - once again - the classic formula of the underdog striving to overcome. Coalwood isn't expected to produce rocket scientists. Aside from the odd football player, it produces coal miners, and Homer has to overcome the doubts of many in the town, and especially his own father (Chris Cooper), who is the boss of the local mine, whose life is dedicated to mining, and who naturally assumes that his son Homer (who, unlike his brother, has no football talent) will simply follow in his footsteps. The inspirational story aside, it's probably the uncomfortable relationship of father and son that's the centrepiece of "October Sky." The relationship of father to the two sons who are so opposite in so many ways reminded me of an almost identical scene in "Stand By Me" as Homer strives for his father's attention, while his father is only concerned with talking about his brother's football games. That all takes place within the backdrop of a dying town completely dependent on one industry, whose people are scared - because they see the end coming and they see no future once the end comes. So, inspiring though it may be, there's also a sadness to this movie - a sadness at a way of life that's dying, a sadness for the people who have spent their lives and sometimes given their lives (or at least their health) for the sake of that way of life.It's impressive to see the dedication that Homer and his friends showed in the face of doubts and opposition from those around them, as their rocket science experiments finally take them to the National Science Fair, and gives them the opportunity to break free of what had seemed to be their destiny. And yet, while one understands that the story is the inspirational story of these boys striving for something bigger, one also gains respect for those in Coalwood. They're hard-working men, who give of themselves and who risk a lot for the sake of their families. Sometimes the dreary life overcomes them, with sad results, but there's still a measure of respect for them. So I thought this represented a good look at both sides of the question - those who dream of bigger things, and those who may have lost that dream, but who still do the best they can with what they have.In the end, it becomes a bit of a tear-jerker in a number of ways. It may not be a riveting movie, but it represents a good slice of life movie, and it seems to depict the thinking of the era and that particular environment quite well. (6/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Overlooked Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Science Teacher let me borrow a film for the past weekend and I picked October Sky. I of course looked at the reviews of IMDb to see if it was any good. After seeing the many positive reviews I decided to sit and watch it.The film is about Homer Hickam played by Jake Gyllenhaal and his 3 friends Quentin played by Chris Owens, Roy Lee played by William Lee Scott, and O'Dell played by Chad Lindenburg who witness the first artificial satellite named Sputnik go into orbit in October of 1957. This prompts Homer and his friends to build a series of rockets and try to launch them into orbit. However his father played by Chris Cooper wants him to work in the coal mine much to Homers dissatisfaction.This was really good. The film is not your normal '50's movie like Grease(1978) this one takes a more serious route. The things I like about it: I love the performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper, The plot captures what the real Homer Hicam did and yes this is based on a true story. I love how the movie is not to serious and how it does have humor in it. The only thing with this movie that I have a problem with is the Language. Yes I know I watch a lot of films with strong language but this is rated PG. Just because a movie has a PG Rating doesn't mean you have to use a ton of language once in a while it's fine, but not in every scene. I still say it is a very fun movie to watch.Rated PG For Language, Brief Teen Sensuality And Alcohol Use, And For Some Thematic Elements.1hr 48min/108min.****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We can also be the next Homer Hickam.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** This is my homework** October Sky, a film woven by the odds between father and son, and the dream of living oneself's life. Homer Hickam, the protagonist of the film, had an 'impossible' dream since he witnessed the launch of the first man-made satellite. Because of this dream, he befriended with the weird yet smart geek Quentin, and started the journey of rocket making with Quentin, Roy Lee and O'Dell. In Coalwood, high school graduates usually could not further their study in college, the only opportunity going to college is getting the football scholarship. But Homer did not surrender to his fate of being a coal miner. Of course,Homer's father, who was the leader of the coal miner and expected his son will be a coal miner, did not support him making rockets.There were many obstacles on the road of Homer's goal, he and his friends was accused as arsonists as they could not find all their rockets back, therefore, he was suspended. During that period, his father was injured as he tried to save the miners in an accident. The family could not afford the charge of surgery, so that Homer decided to work as a coal miner to provide for his family instead of his brother, who got the football scholarship, and would not be able to go to college if he dropped out at that moment. I think it is very responsible of Homer to prioritize his family , yet, it is upset to see him giving up his dream. There is a scene where they ignited the gasoline bomb and hurled it into the hut on there experiment site, it symbolizes the end of their dream.'Sometimes you really can't listen to what anybody else says, you just gotta listen inside.' The words of Miss Riley evoked Home's enthusiasm of rocketry and the passion buried deep inside the heart of the audience as well. I as an audience member, instantly asked my self, ' what's my inside voice's telling me? What do I want to achieve?' Similar to Homer, my school does not produce many graduates who can go to university, but I will not be tied and I know I will and have to outshine others so that I will have the chance to further my study in University and that I can fight against the fate I should supposedly live.Homer was determined to devote in rocketry after being inspired by Miss Riley. He studied very advance Mathematics twenty-four-seven, at lunch time in coal mine, at night on bed. He eventually figured out that the fire was not started by their rockets, they were not related to the arson! This is the twist I love most, as when I was watching the movie, I felt like I was walking in Homer's shoes. It gives me strength to move on. Finally, the Rocket Boys got the champion of the county science fair, both four of them got the scholarships to go to college. Still, they are proving nothing to others, they are just being themselves, whom they knew do not belong here or work in coal mines.Along the plot of Homer chasing his dream, there is another line of plot of the father-and-son odds. 'Father love the mines more than Jim, even more than you!' Homer groaned to his mother. Because of the pride of his father, he did not want his son to see coal miner as a not so classy job and expected his second son to be like him, a coal miner. 'Coal mine is your life, it's not mine. I'm never going down there again.' Homer confronted his dad, I believe his dad must be broken hearted at that time. It was harsh for Homer to say things like that, but I figure telling the true feeling would be better. After Homer came back from the science fair, there is a scene where Homer showing his medal while his father going down the mine elevator, we can see the eyes of Homer's father, the way he looked at his son, he was proud of his son. Homer was also jealous of his brother, as his dad never missed a game of his brother, but he had never come to watch him launching the rockets. In the very end, Homer's father was there to launch the rockets, the smile on Homer was sweeter than you have ever seen. This also credits to the actors, they did an incredible job on playing the roles. I have already expressed my appreciation to this superb film, another fact that impressed me most is that this film is base on a true story. I do not see why you and I cannot be the next Homer Hickam! What's your inside voice telling you?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Living on a dying Space Coast, this movie is a reminder about the motivation to go into space. The desire to explore. The story is about 17 year old Homer Hickam living in a coal mining town that's going through many crises's, including deaths, strikes, and ultimately shutting down. But Homer, the one kid who used to be the laughing stock redeems himself by bringing a dying town together on one dream, to go into outer space. Sadly I wish it could be the same for the Space Coast. I wish this movie could bring back the inspiration to these people here. But this movie is at my #1 spot. I don't care how epic "Transformers Dark of the Moon" was, or how awesome "Armageddon" was, October Sky, the movie that's not epic, the movie, that is my all time favorite. It's theme's, it's lesson exceeds all things EPIC and creates another level of EPIC it's self. Even though there isn't meteors or robots or explosions. I highly recommend this movie to anyone of all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of "October Sky"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmm. . .well that was refreshing. I can honestly say that after watching Joe Johnston's "October Sky" I feel a whole lot better about everything. Truly just an overwhelmingly inspiring and uplifting film. I mean you could take the most cynical, mysanthropic soul on this planet, have him watch "October Sky", and he'd have a healthier outlook on his life. I swear, during the last 10 minutes of this movie, I had the biggest grin on my face - one of those endings you just can't help but get caught up in. The film features an abundant amount of fine performances. Namely, Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Homer Hickam, and Chris Cooper's compelling turn as his father, John. Other great performances came from Laura Dern, Chris Owen, William Lee Scott, and Chad Lindberg. The movie is shot to a magnificent degree. For instance, Cinematographer Fred Murphy really uses dismal lighting to magnify the miserable atmosphere within Coalwood, West Virginia. The movie is also edited to a tee. "October Sky" also possesses a brilliantly written screenplay that effectively tells the story with emotion as well as convey the narratives heartwarming themes. Overall, I feel that "October Sky" is an awe-inspiring coming-of-age tale of perseverance, respect, and hope. It's a movie that everyone can learn something from ? I know I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Jake Gyllenhaal in a Joyous Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>October SKY is a film that is sorely needed right now, a film to buoy our spirits and re- launch our sense of wonder. Based on a true story - ROCKET BOYS by Homer. H. Hickam, Jr. - it is everything young people should see to remind them that dreams are indeed possible. The story takes place in the little mining town of Coalwood, West Virginia in 1957 when all eyes were focused on the seemingly unreal launching of Russia's Sputnik. Homer, Jr. (Jake Gyllenhaal, with all of his innate charm intact even then!) longs to get away from his presumed destiny of working in the coal mines upon graduation from high school. But Homer's ideals are higher and with the aid of his friends he designs and launches a little rocket that at first angers his miner father (Chris Cooper) but excites his teacher (Laura Dern), who assists Homer in his dreams of rising above the frustrating level of his life in the little town to accomplish dreams he never thought possible. There is just the right amount of tender humor, status resistance, and recreation of a period of time in our history when suddenly everything was possible if a rocket could place a satellite in orbit and transmit signals to the earth. For those of us who lived it this film is an enriching memory, and for those who didn't witness it, the film offers a true sense of the possibilities of the open human spirit. It is a delightful little film. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Believe in yourself and follow your dreams.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this true-life, inspirational movie, Homer Hickam is faced with many challenges and adversity, while trying to follow his heart and dreams. He became intrigued with space travel and rockets when Spunik crossed that October sky of the late 1950's, but no one in the coal mining town supported him. With his father's pleads to accept his future in the mining society, Homer does everything he can to follow his dream. He gets the help of his classmates, teacher, and other town members and goes on to win the national science fair competition and many scholarship offers, which eventually lead him to work at NASA.This movie should inspire all who watch to follow their dreams, even if it seems like the whole world is against you. It also shows that you can overcome any challenge life throws at you and to trust and believe in yourself.The cast in the movie, to me, were all pretty amazing. They portrayed their characters very well and they showed their emotions throughout the entire movie. The actors made it seem like you could feel their pain, excitement, disappointed, etc. when needed.Overall, this movie is truly an inspiration to all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>October Sky is an excellent movie. In addition to having great common themes, i.e., don't give up, don't be afraid to pursue your dreams and don't be a victim of your circumstances, October Sky is an excellent example of what many fathers and sons go through together.I sat down with my son to watch this movie. He loved the pursuit of the dream, the adventure of the boys and at the end, when Homer's father comes to watch the final rocket launch and put his arms around his boy, my son turned and looked at me and understood exactly why I wanted to watch this movie with him. Not many movies can entertain and teach at the same time without being heavy handed. The Director's handling of the father/son relationship was right on.I also love Natalie Cannerday as the mom.

		<fullReview>I like how the movie shows some of the (pun?) granularity to the coal business; clearly these men that worked down there were not a pack of mindnumbed dolts. Homer's father John (Chris Cooper) advances quite high in the company as a shift supervisor/foreman, and he loves his work. He's good at it. The film provides enough footage to educate us to a minimal level that working down here wasn't Hell, rather it's a job requiring hard bodies, tougher minds, and constant focus on what the flock one is doing. Slipups are easy, but teamwork and dedication bring success. (Kind of like a good football team.)Anyway, Homer's dad is a comparative VIP in this working-man world, and none too happy when Homer?who is athletically challenged?announces he's going to build a rocket. ...For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2009</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A real charming movie based on fact and history. Homer Hickam(Jake Gyllenhaal)was not the typical boy in mid 1950s West Virginia. He dared to not follow in his father's footsteps into the local coal mine. Homer's father John(Chris Cooper)stayed very agitated with his son's indifference. Football scholarships were the ticket out of the small coal towns. Homer knew there had to be another way; and when he saw the Soviet satellite Sputnik fly through an October sky...this dreamer's dreams exploded. Homer with the help of three of his friends would build and actually launch home-made rockets. Frequent misfires would land the young rocket builders into trouble; but many trials led to enough successes that the whole town of Coalwood, West Virginia found inspiration in a young man's dreams. A feel good movie that does your heart proud.The cast is rounded out by: Laura Dern, William Lee Scott, Chad Lindberg, Chris Owen and Natalie Canerday. There is a wonderful soundtrack featuring sounds of the time by the likes of: The Platters, Buddy Holly, Fats Domino, The Coasters and Elvis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>October Sky flies high</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the Russians launched Sputnik in 1957, it was something the world viewed with great trepidation. If they had the ability to put something man-made into space, it didn't bode well for the future of the free world. The Cold War was still very much in effect, and most people thought of Sputnik as something to cast a shadow over their freedom.But Homer Hickam saw something different. He saw Sputnik not as an end in itself. But a beginning. A whole new chapter in human history was being written right before our very eyes. The people just couldn't see beyond their own fears.October Sky is one of those surprisingly charming films that even when you sense the film is tugging on the heartstrings, it doesn't feel like manipulation. Perhaps because I'm a sucker for films about the space race. Or maybe because October Sky comes from one of my favourite directors, Joe Johnston.Johnston is a filmmaker best known for rousing action/adventure films like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and The Rocketeer. In fact The Rocketeer could almost be construed as the same film but in a slightly lesser developed form. So OS comes as a nice change of pace. Its more leisurely than Johnston's norm but that's OK. The film has excitement alright. Just of a different sort.When Homer first spots Sputnik gliding through the night sky, it is a sight that will change his life forever. Up until that point, Homer's future was very clearly mapped out for him. Once he graduates from high school, he's supposed to work in the local coal mines. Like everybody else.The mine is the town's main source of income. So its very important they get as many workers down there as they can. And for Homer, the pressure is on him especially because his father happens to be the pit foreman.John Hickam (a flawless Chris Cooper) doesn't want his son wasting his time building rockets. Homer knows his future is tied up in engineering, but John thinks the needs of their town are more important.Homer refuses to accept a life in the mines, and convinces a few other boys at school to join together and build a rocket. But the Rocket Boys (as they come to be known) face stiff opposition from just about everybody. The school principal. Their peers. And especially John.October Sky, based on the manuscript by Homer Hickam Jr is one of the nicest films you'll catch on TV. Its slightly underrated, even if its no classic. But it has a really excellent cast. And it does a surprisingly good job of sidestepping the clichés inherently buried in the narrative.There does seem a slight predictability to the film. Things like the stern, traditionalist father. The idealistic young man who dreams of the future. Opposition from all sides. The helpful teacher who's more enlightened than the rest.But surprisingly, the film succeeds more often than the above paragraph would suggest. Johnston has chosen a fine cast to remedy any possible uncertainties. Although Jake Gyllenhaal didn't make public notice until Donnie Darko, he more than proves his worth as Homer. October Sky was Gyllenhaal's first starring role. And already he shows his budding talent. Gyllenhaal always projects a fierce determination hidden behind an amiable expression. In Donnie Darko it was particularly startling. Homer of course is a complete opposite, but Gyllenhaal channels it into his ambition to prove his worth, and make a life for himself outside of a coal mine.Joe Johnston is always notable for drawing out strong, gracious performances from children, and he seems equally at home directing teenagers as well. Any scene with the Rocket Boys is thankfully devoid of over-sentiment and slush. Sometimes it threatens to. But it never boils over.And in regards to the adult cast, they do their part as well. Laura Dern is always good value and so she is here as Miss Riley, the schoolteacher open to Homer's ambitions. Her terminal illness does seem to emerge too quickly though, given a curious lack of buildup by Johnston.But its Chris Cooper who steals the show as John. He does wonders with the role of a father set in his ways. He never seems a one-dimensional tyrant. There are subtleties in his acting if you look hard enough. He may disapprove of Homer's activities, but I think hidden in his words is a grudging respect for Homer. And Cooper shows all this with a prolonged silence or a casual glance.Don't forget, John never outright stands in the way of Homer. He could have done any number of times and refuses. I think John is concerned Homer may be setting himself up to be disappointed. And wants to spare him that. John may have had ambitions at a young age too, and circumstances robbed him of that dream. Perhaps he wants to save Homer the same fate. Its all very fascinating when you think about it. A quite faultless performance on Cooper's part.There is the inevitable happy ending. And a few inevitable bumps in the road to get there. But October Sky is a fine, unpatronising film well worth your time. Plenty of 50s tunes to enjoy. And a nice consideration for the plight of the working man, and achieving what may seem hopeless dreams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the most brilliant family movies ever made. My dad and I saw part of it on an eighth grade trip to Washington D.C. I later watched the trailer for it on this site and that alone was enough to move me to own it. This was definitely a great way to launch (no pun intended) Jake Gyllenhaal's career and one of the best movies, if not THE best, that he will have ever done. If you look at Gyllenhaal's profile and click on the genre section, you will see that "October Sky" is (so far) the only family work he has ever done. To me that is a sad but true illustration of the choices that some actors and actresses make these days and they should do these more often. The movie doesn't entirely feel like a family movie due to a bit of rough language, so I am taking away two stars.</fullReview>

The true story of the 4 boys about whom the story is written, is the essence of the American spirit to find a way to get where you want to and perseverance to accomplish your goals.Another aspect that was very valuable was the example of honoring your parents when you can't necessarily believe the same and sometimes even obey them.

		<fullReview>I think that we can now say that Jake Gyllenhaal's troika of great roles are "October Sky", "Donnie Darko" and "Brokeback Mountain" ("The Day After Tomorrow" was also worth seeing). In the first one, he plays 1950s West Virginia teenager Homer Hickam. In their small town, the men work in the coal mine and it's assumed that all the boys will go into that line of work - or become jocks.Then, in October, 1957, the Soviet satellite Sputnik glides across the sky. Homer realizes that he wants to go into that line of work, so he and his friends start making test rockets. Needless to say, Homer's family is shocked at this, and the local jocks don't like it either. But Homer knows his desire, and he and his friends keep at it.If Jake Gyllenhaal was relatively unknown when this movie came out, then it surely cemented him as a talented presence on the silver screen. Equally great in the movie are Chris Cooper as Homer's coal miner father, who is nervous about his son doing this, and Laura Dern as Homer's teacher, who encourages him. All in all, very well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwarming and inspiring blast off from the 1950's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My son, now a college science freshman, has been fascinated with space exploration for over a decade now and always dreamed of watching a blast off from Cape Kennedy. He now views NASA's space program a little more realistically and perhaps not quite as positively, but this film was a true inspiration to him and a great hit with our entire family.It tells the true story of a West Virginia coal miner's son, Homer Hickam, who dreams of rocketry after seeing the USSR's Sputnik lighting up the October sky...very dramatic scene here, truly conveying his awe and wonder at the spectacle. To the consternation of his mining dad (who disapproves) but encouragement of his science teacher, Miss Riley, Homer puts his dreams into practice as he, the school nerd, and a couple of pals experience a series of failures and successes (mainly failures) in their trial and error rocket building attempts. Will Homer succeed in time for the county science fair and win the much needed scholarship awarded as prize?I won't give the ending away, but this film is a tribute to dreaming big dreams, pursuing those dreams despite obstacles and opposition, and especially persevering. It should serve as both an inspiration to all young people, whatever form their dreams may take, as well as a tribute to man's ongoing curiosity about our galaxy and methods for space exploration.The characters are well drawn, especially the interactions between Homer and his father, who finds himself in conflict with the son he loves, having planned for him a traditional coal mining career. In light of the recent West Virginia mining disasters, the dangers inherent in that particular career choice have been sadly brought to the forefront of public attention in a way much less meaningful to me when I first viewed this movie.As for the love interest to which other reviewers have made reference, it must indeed be a sub-plot as I have absolutely no recollection of it now. Obviously not crucial to the main drama, though the whole movie had a real and rather refreshing nostalgic, old fashioned 50's feel to it. It made me wish I was raising my child back in that era.Wonderful heart warming and uplifting tale that will surely put a lump in your throat and encourage you in your own way to reach for the stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a real sleeper. It is a portraiture of an extremely significant time in America. We have people leading their everyday lives (in this case, in a coal mine), and the incredible threat that the Russians have created with Sputnik. Enter Homer Hickham who has been inspired. The whole town sees him as a nut. He gets some of his nerdy friends to help him realize his dream. it's a modest dream. To send a small rocket a fair distance into the sky. During this process he must deal with metals, heat properties, and mathematics. He also must face the dismay of his father, played by Chris Cooper (could have been an Academy Award), who expects Homer to naturally move into the world of the mine without a single thought. We all know what happens, but it doesn't matter. It's the wonderful series of failures and regrouping and, at one point, giving up that makes this movie. The people are real people. All Homer wants is a chance to get out this place and realize his dream. He has watched the football playing brother get all the attention. There's nothing for Homer. I could watch this movie over and over. It really works. It should have had a lot more attention.</fullReview>

In particular, the actors playing the family of (Jake Gyellenhaal) are very good indeed, Chris Cooper (as the father)reflecting in particular the dynamics of a father-son relationship so typical of the '50's and '6o's. Laura Dern, as Miss Reilly, the teacher who believes in, inspires and stands up for the boys, is excellent. The music is good, conveying the period well.

Was not too impressed at first until I learned it was a real life story of a man named Homer Hickam from the coal mining area of West Virginia who was more interested in rockets after he saw Sputnik. At that period of time I had just gotten married, stationed in the D. C. area and was watching the sky like everybody else, but saw nothing. Here's the chill part!! I never heard of Homer Hickam until 24 hours ago. On the news tonight, 1/15/06, there was a memorial service for those miners who died in the mines early this week. A man was speaking to the crowd..a name came on the screen, Homer Hickam! 1/16/06. After seeing the movie again, I was moved by the story and really enjoyed it and it brought back memories of that period. Had to change to a 10. I must say, a very wonderful movie, hated to take it back. All were new actors to me except Homer Sr, and Laura Dern. They were all just great and I'm usually critical of new faces.</fullReview>

I think that I'll always like "October Sky" unless Jake does a film better than this but I don't know if he could top this film but I don't doubt it.

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We saw October Sky when it first came out in the theaters. My family all thought this movie was excellent. My teen didn't want to see this movie, but she went with us anyway...and she loved it, too! This is a wonderful film for a family to see together.October Sky is inspirational, uplifting, touching, and humorous. The movie also has a very positive message about the benefits of a good education. Education was the way out and the way up for the boys in this town, which is a good message for all teens.This is the first time we saw Jake Gyllenhaal in a movie, and we were so impressed with him. I am not surprised to see how well his career has progressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feel good movie that delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on fact, this is the story of a teenager named Homer Hickam, growing up in a coal town in West Virginia where a boy's usual destiny was to "end up in the mines." But Homer had his eye on the sky and a love for flying rockets... to the dismay of his mine-foreman father, and the consternation of the townsfolk generally. A misfit for sure, he and three of his equally outcast buddies begin making rockets, which they fly from a patch of barren land eight miles out of town... so as to no longer terrorize the community with their oft-times errant rockets. However, the people become intrigued and soon start coming out in droves to watch the 'Rocketboys' send off their homemade missiles, and with the enthusiastic support of Miss Riley, their teacher, plus a signed picture from Wernher Von Braun in response to a question Homer had written him, they finally are entered in the National Science Awards competition. But none of this was all that easy, especially for Homer, as problems much more dire than flying rockets seemed to push the young man toward maturity, as well as to his eventual destiny... as an instructor of our shuttle mission astronauts.The movie makes you feel good and leave with a smile on your face. Its not for everyone, some may find it boring at parts but in the end its worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie!!! The story is lovely, and the soundtrack it so emotional. Homer Hickham personal oversaw the construction of this film, so the "based on a true story" must hold it's own weight.Chris Cooper's performance in this film is just breathtaking. I don't think anyone could have played it better. The producers even said he was the only person they thought of for the role. But at first he turned it down! He said he didn't think the relationship between father and son was tough enough. He wanted to portray the character the way he remembered his own father. So in the end, they ended up rewriting some of the father/son scenes just so Mr. Cooper would accept the role.Brilliant family movie. Not just for kids. But a movie all ages can relate to in some way and enjoy. A+++++++++</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3 movies rated 10 in my life this is one of them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I have to say I love moving movies and October Sky rates very in this category. I first watched (Rocky) in 1977 and thus began my #10 rated list that would fail to find an addition until 18 years later (8-Seconds). One night in Atlanta in 1999 I felt very lonely (being I was on a 6 month job that took me 600 miles from home) so I decided to go see a movie. I wasn't in the mood for an action type so the display of October Sky grabbed my attention. I watched in amazement as the stories events unfolded. I actually got lost in the movie to where my loneliness had left my senses. I liked it so much I paid to see it 2 more times the same week. I find it best to watch unknowingly what it's about. I hope you may find it on your own rare 10 list as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming-of-Age Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who describe this movie as trite or filled with emotional cliches, in my opinion, don't have a clue as to what this movie's about. This is a film about emotions and how to guide one's passions with conscious, responsible decisions. Following one's dream and, in the process, becoming a man. Leaving what's old and heartless behind. With a title like "October Sky," should that come as a surprise? Thomas Wolfe would be proud.The feelings Joe Johnston elicits aren't artificially affected and that's what those nay-sayers have a problem with - they actually do feel a sense of humanity while watching this. Even for me (a film fanatic), it came as a surprise what this film contained: good script, great acting, beautiful cinematography (from the Charles Sheeler opening montage to the Conrad Hall inspired scene with the rain-on-the-windowpane-symbolizing-pain from In Cold Blood). It's intentionally and successfully moving.So for those who grew up in dying rural America or for those who ever had a dream that others scorned or for those who ever had a beating heart, I recommend this movie highly. Much like The Last Picture Show, it deals with coming-of-age in a dying setting, but unlike Bogdanovich's film, it doesn't leave you cold in the end - it makes you feel ALIVE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a hero's quest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story told by this movie would seem romanticized, if not for the fact that it is closely based on the truth. The film is surprisingly true to the book, down to the details of Miss Riley's illness and subsequent death. Homer Hickam and his friends really did escape the coal mine to pursue their dreams. They suffered setbacks, took many detours, and endured the scorn of their peers. In the end, they prevailed. The hero's quest is often a lonely one, but can end in success. The film portrays both the adversity and the triumph well.In reading some other reviews, I was saddened to see that people have become so cynical that they cannot imagine that the events happened as they were depicted, that the story was embellished with corny Hollywood cliches. To those individuals, I recommend the book.</fullReview>

The rockets in this movie were so cool and I thought it was so interesting the way the teenage boys made it possible to do something that extraordinary!

		<shortDescription>The best father/son movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"October Sky" is alot of different types of movies rolled all together. It's a coal-mining movie. It's a "follow your dreams" movie. It's a period piece. However, at the heart of the film is the most accurate and poignant portrayal of the father/son dynamic that I have ever seen in a film.Homer Hickham is a son who has been told since the day he was born that he was going to grow up to work in the coal mines. That is what everyone before him has done and all of his contemporaries have resigned themselves to the fact that that is what they will do. However, Homer wants to build rockets and he seesa first prize at the national science fair as a ticket out of Coalwood and straight to college. Homer's father has worked in the mines his whole life and sees nothing practical or worthwhile in Homer's fascination with rockets, but, more importantly, he sees Homer's desire to leave as a huge insult. He thinks that Homer wants to get away from the town so that he doesn't have to follow in his father's footsteps.The interaction between father and son is at once frustrating, hurtful, loving, insightful and bittersweet. There are always kind words that can't be spoken and harsh words that can't help but be shouted. This realism is at the core of this incredibly moving screenplay, which is only made palpable by the equally moving performances.If you are looking for a great drama that is family appropriate, smartly written and inspiring, I highly recommend this little-known gem!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything about this movie is wonderful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie for the umpteenth time, I'm once again impressed by how wonderful a movie this really is. From the very opening moments to the very end, it's just beautifully done. If you're looking for dangerous, heart-pounding, shoot-em-up action, don't rent this movie; this isn't a film of that genre. That's not to say it's boring -- far from it. But this is a movie about life, specifically the true-life late 1950's story of a high-school boy named Homer who, inspired by world events and his teacher, found that his dreams were bigger than the tiny West Virginia town he grew up in. Those dreams were sparked by something that appeared in the October sky of 1957.Interestingly, rearrange the letters of the movie and you get the original title of the book the movie is based upon:"October Sky" &lt;===&gt; "Rocket Boys"This is not a video to rent. This is a video to OWN, especially if you have kids. You'll watch it several times, forget about it for a year, pull it out again, and then enjoy it just as much when you dust it off. If you're going to be watching it with younger kids, be advised that the film does contain some of what we in our family call "rude language" (nothing your kids aren't going to hear sooner or later anyway, or have already heard if they go to public school -- but a bit of parental discretion with younger kids advised)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-----ONE OR TWO SPOILERS AHEAD------Looking around the comments index and this film gets deserved praise. Inspirational is the best word to describe its main theme: small town boy and friends rise up against their pre-ordained careers as coal miners to pursue rocket science. Gyllenhaal does a wonderful job as the seemingly not so bright daydreamer who one day looks up in awe at the vision of the Russian satellite 'Sputnik' (the first space 'vehicle' to be launched into orbit by man) and decides to reach for the stars. The townspeople are also fascinated and yet scared of this new thing streaking across the sky which some believe to be of imminent danger to them. But as they look up, a wonderful comment comes out from the crowd which to me sums up the hard pressed, struggling yet somehow joyous spirit of this community. A man says 'I hope they don't drop a bomb on this place.....it'd be a terrible waste of a bomb!' There must have been thousands of small yet spiritied communities like this in the US during the 50s. And it's from this essential ruggedness, and perhaps innocence, I suppose young men like Homer Hickam were launched into the world. Hickam's father's initial relutance to support his son's 'crazyness' is understandable considering the great sacrifices and suffering he and his colleagues down the mines have given in order to give their children a decent living. Gradually though, the barriers are worn down and perhaps the gifts of Homer inspire something different in his father as we are drawn to the inevitable conclusion.One thing that puzzled me throughout though was the attitude and respect given to a certain Wernher von Braun. Fair enough, the man was a rocketing genius but his full scale participation in and innovative designs for the V1 and V2 rockets of Nazi Germany led to the deaths of thousands of innocents (both rocket victims and the actual slave labourers). Perhaps one of the morals of the film is that greatness in human advance and technology can ultimately be born from the more malignant and terrifying aspects in our nature. Thus Hickam embarks on a career as a rocket scientist and his inspiration is a former Nazi rocket scientist! The other aspect to the film was moving too. The irony of a Soviet satellite inspiring a 17 year old American to go out and design rockets to launch into space. There's a profound lesson here for cooperation amongst different peoples and nations. Great film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every ten years or so, a movie comes out that eclipses the thousands produced in the decade before it, and helps to define movie making at its best. I believe wholeheartedly that 'October Sky' is one of those movies. Like the best before it, 'Casablanca', 'The Third Man', 'Moonstruck', 'Amadeus', 'Almost Famous', this movie sits like a restful beacon of light in an otherwise bleak horizon of cinema. What well separates it from those that have gone before, is that 'October Sky' resides in the heart like postcards from your favorite aunt, or memories of Mom's apple pie or taking a trip back home. It stirs and then settles deep within and promises life anew and hope for the future. One can say that it is, after all, just a movie. But I believe that it is more than that. Its a movie that promises that when we reach beyond ourselves, and hope when hope fails, that our tomorrow beckons us with opens arms, and calls us warmly home. I gladly, unreservedly give 'October Sky' a 10 out of ten stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie for everyone with a brain (provided you enjoy using it). The story follows a teen through his experiments in rocket building, and the hardships his working class town imposes on him while he tries to expand his mind to follow his calling to science and engineering.Being a scientist who broke out of a working class town myself, I instantly related to this movie. But the movie is more than that - it's a message to all Americans: if you work hard at something you want, you can achieve it; furthermore, people will eventually respect you for being good at what you do. But, whatever you do, don't quit.A great movie to sit a pre-teen (or a teenager) down with, and an even better movie to watch as an adult for its amusing and heart-warming scenes, not to mention its endearing plotline.It may look pretty dull in the video store, but it is well worth it!Oh, and if you like the movie, check out the book ("Rocket Boys") too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had no idea how much this movie(and the books alone) would do so much for me. I've also loved the space exploration projects, and rockets, and stars, and everything that goes along with the Universe and our Solar System. One day, when my grandpa rented this movie, I knew it was something I had to see. I was 12 years old(now I'm 14. Almost 15) I sat there on the carpet, barely blinking at every scene. Of coarse the stunning good looks of Jake Gyllenhaal(playing as Homer Hickam Jr.) caught my eye, but the story outline was terrific. Amazing. Perfect. Well, not perfect. Mr. Johnson could've made it like the actual Memoir the whole way through instead of 70% true.... After I finished watching the movie, I knew I had to meet Homer Hickam Jr. someday, somehow, some way. I rushed to the computer, went to the Internet search bar at the top of AOL, and asked my grandpa on how to spell Hickam. I got a hold of Mr. Hickams official website...... One year later. The day is October 26th, '00. The day of my life I will forever remember. I had finished reading over "Rocket Boys(aka October Sky)" and Mr. Hickam was coming out with a new, "equal" Memoir. "The Coalwood Way." I WAS GOING TO MEET HOMER HICKAM!! My insperation. My mentor. My favorite author. When I met him at his book signing, got my books sign, my life felt complete....until another year later.... I GOT TO MEET HIM AGAIN! His newest Memoir "Sky of Stone" Had just come out this past October. I was going to meet him again. Have him sign a book, well actually books, this time...again. I had just bought Back to the Moon, and hadn't got a chance to finish it. I got my picture taken with him. Mr. Hickam is truely a God_given-gifted, talented man. He's my hero. Ever since I read his books, I've wanted to go into Rocket Science myself now. Just need to fix my Math and I'm ready for anything....</fullReview>

The young actors playing the Rocket Boys showed talent beyond their years, especially young Homer. Homer's father inspired that eternal love/hate relationship between a father and son so that it felt real.

My favourite scene was where Homer is going down the mineshaft and looking at the sky, going down, as all of his dreams were, it was beautiful.

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, if not too ideal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure things didn't exactly go the same way in the real life of Homer Hickam as they did in the film adaptation of his book, Rocket Boys, but the movie "October Sky" (an anagram of the book's title) is good enough to stand alone. I have not read Hickam's memoirs, but I am still able to enjoy and understand their film adaptation. The film, directed by Joe Johnston and written by Lewis Colick, records the story of teenager Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), beginning in October of 1957. It opens with the sound of a radio broadcast, bringing news of the Russian satellite Sputnik, the first artificial satellite in orbit. We see a images of a blue-gray town and its people: mostly miners working for the Olga Coal Company. One of the miners listens to the news on a hand-held radio as he enters the elevator shaft, but the signal is lost as he disappears into the darkness, losing sight of the starry sky above him. A melancholy violin tune fades with this image. We then get a jolt of Elvis on a car radio as words on the screen inform us of the setting: October 5, 1957, Coalwood, West Virginia. Homer and his buddies, Roy Lee Cook (William Lee Scott) and Sherman O'Dell (Chad Lindberg), are talking about football tryouts. Football scholarships are the only way out of the town, and working in the mines, for these boys. "Why are the jocks the only ones who get to go to college," questions Homer. Roy Lee replies, "They're also the only ones who get the girls." Homer doesn't make it in football like his older brother, so he is destined for the mines, and to follow in his father's footsteps as mine foreman. Until he sees the dot of light streaking across the October sky. Then he wants to build a rocket. "I want to go into space," says Homer. After a disastrous attempt involving a primitive rocket and his mother's (Natalie Canerday) fence, Homer enlists the help of the nerdy Quentin Wilson (Chris Owen). Quentin asks Homer, "What do you want to know about rockets?" Homer quickly anwers, "Everything." His science teacher at Big Creek High School, Miss Frieda Riley (Laura Dern) greatly supports Homer, and the four boys work on building rockets in Homer's basement. His father, however, whose life is the mine, does not support him. John Hickam (Chris Cooper) believes that Homer shouldn't waste his time on the rockets, that the coal mines are all that matter. The coal from the mines is used to make steel, and without steel, the country would be nothing. The difficult relationship between Homer and his dad is one of the most poignant relationships I have ever seen in a film. Miss Riley introduces Homer to the idea of entering the local science fair, with a chance to go the nationals and win a college scholarship. "You can't just dream your way out of Coalwood," she tells Homer. Homer and his friends act upon their dreams by working constantly on the rockets, improving the models with each attempt. Despite the many attempts, the boys do not lose their determination. "What are the chances of us winning that science fair," O'Dell asks Homer in one of their more despairing moments. "A million to one," answers Homer. "That good?" O'Dell replies, "Well, why didn't you say so?" The music, composed by Mark Isham, conveys sadness and hope at the same time, especially sad at a point when Homer descends into the mine shaft and loses sight of the sky and his dreams of getting out of Coalwood. Rollicking 1950s' rock and roll, including songs by The Coasters and Buddy Holly, occasionally pushes the instrumental pieces aside to create a light-hearted mood that contrasts the teenagers' lives with the lives of the miners. The film, photographed by Fred Murphy, also uses colors to set moods and symbolize. The town of Coalwood, actually filmed in Tennessee, is washed with blues, grays, and browns. It's as if the grime from the coal sticks to everything- faces, clothes, houses, and roads. When a couple in a gleaming red convertible stops to ask for directions from the boys, it is obvious that they are from the world outside of Coalwood and the Olga Coal Company. The book on guided missile design that Miss Riley gives Homer is red. The red stands out enough against the blue-gray world of Coalwood to symbolize "getting out", but it is still subtle. The reds are fleeting hints of a world that Homer only dreams of. Jake Gyllenhaal expresses such zeal, hope, and pertinacity as Homer Hickam that it is hard to believe he isn't the real Homer we see in actual footage at the end of the film. Chris Cooper is also extraordinarily believable as Homer's stubborn father, who doesn't recognize, or just doesn't want to admit, that the mine is not producing enough to keep the town alive. Homer, and everyone who encourages him in his rocket-building, is aware that the town is dying. With the community disintegrating, the only way they stay together is by gathering for the rocket boys' demonstrations. Again, I'm sure things didn't happen exactly as the movie portrayed them, but what would a movie be without a bit of idealism? "October Sky" has just enough of that to make it a great motion picture and enough rawness to keep it real.</fullReview>

Jake Gyllenhaal does an excellent job in Homer Hickam's shoes. The supporting cast is great, as well.Science, coming-of-age, family quarrels, a great train scene... This film has it all. The soundtrack is good, although the score is presented quite choppily. The 50s music kicks the movie over the edge of greatness.The DVD is definitely worth its weigh in coal. Replay value is great - I've seen it quite a few times already.</fullReview>

This shows a big wish come true trought happiness and sadness, hopeless and failure. But if you are strong enough and your heart really belongs to something that you love you can make things different and be happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspirational, and true to life ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this movie, I'm very surprised and disappointed on the negative comments already posted about this movie (albeit, only a few).I grew up in a town not far from Coalwood, but I no longer live anywhere near there for many of the same reasons Homer had for getting out of Coalwood. Although my years near there occurred later than Homer Hickam's, I can see so many things in common with his experience in Coalwood and my own growing up.When an earlier comment about his movie said that it was just another movie about adversity and overcoming odds, I don't think they quite understand the point. Homer Hickam grew up in a place that was far away from anything -- even the math book he needed for building the rockets had to be ordered because although it wasn't stated, I assume that at that time there was no library around that carried such a book. Just think about that for a moment. It's very difficult for young people in that area to see anything more in their lives than what they see outside their windows. I'm sure the same could be said for some urban kids who live in depressed areas. But, I would be less impressed with this story if Homer Hickam grew up in suburban New Jersey or urban Chicago, for example, where so much of the world is just a few minutes away and finding people to help you is so easy. Remember, Homer had to walk 8 miles just to leave coal company property, and the men at the coal company who supported him did so even though they risked losing their jobs (and there were no other jobs to be had).Luckily, Homer had a teacher who recognized a student with a dream and potential. Homer was a student in the middle of the pack (academically and socially) who dared to defy the odds. Even Quentin, the brain, needed Homer. In fact, one of the things that clearly separates this movie from so many other stories of achievement is that it was done academically.While sports achievements are great, why do so many movie makers shy away from other achievements? Many people in Coalwood didn't care too much for academic achievements, but tackle somebody on the football field and you are off to college. Too many people glamorize sports, and as time marches on we have more and more examples of exactly how unglamorous (and felonious) some sports figures are. It's impossible to compare a touchdown with a rocket going to the moon (at least aimed at it). Homer didn't make a touchdown, but if he had it would just mean a trip to Disneyworld. Instead, Homer built rockets and there is no end to where he can go except in his dreams. Truly, an inspirational movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I avoided this movie for a long time because it was more or less sold as an inspirational-type film, which made me think of saccharine Pax-TV fare. Then I wound up renting it one night on the suggestion of a friend. I stand corrected.I wound up watching it about 10 times and enjoyed it more and more with each subsequent viewing. It *is* an inspirational-type film, no lie there ... but it's also well-made, well-acted, and beautifully photographed, and has a great soundtrack that combines some great early rock 'n' roll classics with a nice fiddle score. I also thought it was a nice to see a film in which a bunch of young men use their brains instead of their brawn (if any) ... that's what'll get you further in life than anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must disagree with all the viewers who say that October Sky repeated a familiar theme. Some of it was predictable, to be sure, but you expect that in this type of movie. Did anyone for a moment expect Rocky or the Karate Kid to lose at the end of those movies? Yet they are respected as classics.What makes October Sky special is its quality treatment of intellectual triumph. We live in the days when children attend designer pre-schools and billionaire nerds outshine even professional atheletes. Homer and his friends are role models for our new American culture. October Sky is the first of a new type of movie, a type whose time has come.I highly recommend this movie for these unique qualities, and I hope to see more like it in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwarming slice of life in rural West Virginia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I also grew up in a small town in rural WV, about 3 miles from where this movie is set. Although this movie takes place some twenty years before I grew up, many of the mores still exist. For instance, in the 70's and early 80's coal mining was still a dominant market force in southern WV. Both of my grandfathers were coal miners who worked much of their life underground. Children were primed and expected to work in the mines if they intended to continue to live in southern WV as adults. This movie strikes an interesting and true-to-life account of a typical southern WV coal mining family. While watching this movie, I felt transported back to my childhood days, remembering what it was like to wonder if I would be relegated to working in the coal mines. But, like Homer, I too was able to choose a different path except that I had my father's blessing. Needless to say, I was moved and touched by this movie, however, I do believe there were great things about growing up in the WV mountains that were not explored in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is there anyone who appreciate the films of Joe Johnston as much as me? Since he made "Honey, I shrunk the kids" I have been following his filmography, and he is my favourite director now and then. I´ve seen "October Sky" and I don´t change my mind. He´s the best whatever he do, and I wish the best for his future films ("Jurassic Park 3" and... a remake of "Them!"?). I don´t mind what say critics, I don´t mind what say people. He´s a more complex (excuse my English) director than it seems, and I feel lucky to know it. All what he do is pure cinema, and he is one of the few directors that know combine "quality" and "spectacle" in a movie.I saw "October Sky" a few time ago because I´m from Spain and it opened here a week ago, but I knew since a long time it would be a GREAT movie. It has something special that also have "Honey...", "Rocketeer" and "Jumanji". Well, I only wish I can go to Anselmo in the future to tell this to Johnston personally. But I think it is a little difficult! Maybe in the future I will make a film that become me a famous director, and then I will be like a Homer Hickam who wants to know Werner von Braun as much I wish to know Joe Johnston.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a movie that I rented recently and the first thing that struck me was that it was a very unassuming movie. Even when it was in the theatres, the commercials and ads did not jump out and grab your attention like the other movies did. For this reason, I was not compelled to watch it right away until recently.October Sky is a true story about a small town boy's dreams and his father's hopes. Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a young man in a small mining town that faces the very real possibility that he will grow up and become a miner just like every other young man in town. After the launch of the Soviet satellite, Sputnik, and witnessing it pass overhead one night, Homer becomes inspired to build his own toy rocket and have it successfully launch. Together with his friends and a local school nerd that he befriends, the group set out to build this rocket despite the ridicule from the rest of the students and town people. His biggest opponent of this little project is his father, which has aspirations of Homer becoming a miner. To his father's dismay, Homer decides that mining is not his future and with the encouragement of his school teacher, Miss Freida Riley (Laura Dern), he sets out to learn everything he knows about rockets to enter a science fair.Although the storyline sounds rather simple, Homer's personal plight is quite complicated. Throughout the movie you see the growing rift between himself and his father (and occasionally his friends) and there is a point in the story that he must make the very difficult decision of continuing this project or trying to please his father. The appealing thing about this movie is that this is a story that many people can relate to and understand.The acting in this movie was very well done, especially by Jake Gyllenhaal (Homer Hickam). The rest of the actors add a real genuine feel to it and throughout the film you get a real sense of the surpressive atmosphere of the father. This is also one of the few movies I've seen where there were very few slow spots. It is by no means an action filled movie but the story is told in such a way that you do not get a sense that there is information being given to you that you don't need. Laura Dern plays the role of Miss Riley fairly well although her involvement in the movie is relatively minor despite the way she's portrayed in the advertising (ie. her picture on the poster).The one thing that I do have to point out is that, throught this story, you get the sense that Miss Riley has a very large role in Homer's life yet the director never quite develops this relationship. In the end I felt the story was lacking a little in this aspect and you are left making assumptions to fill in the gaps that you sense.Overall, this is one of the best films that I've seen in a long time. It doesn't have the spectacular special effects or the complicated action sequences but the story is very well told. This is especially the case when you consider the fact that this was a true story. The director wraps up the end movie very well by showing you photos of the real people that the actors portrayed and detailing what each of them went on to do in their lives. This is definitely a movie you should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie SOARS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really does soar. I was one of the few people lucky enough to catch this jewel in the theaters. It is pure joy to watch Jake Gyllenhaal (CITY SLICKERS), Chris Owen (AMERICAN PIE, SHE'S ALL THAT), Chad Lindberg (CITY OF ANGELS, MERCURY RISING), and William Lee Scott (THE OPPOSITE OF SEX, GATTACA) overcome the dragging small-town thinking to succeed in reaching for the stars. These young actors more than hold their own against Laura Dern (CITIZEN RUTH, RAMBLING ROSE) and the always superb character actor, Chris Cooper (AMERICAN BEAUTY, LONE STAR) who plays Jake Gyllenhaal's dad. Director Joe Johnston (ROCKETEER) has managed to take the autobiography of Homer Hickam, Jr. (aka ROCKET BOYS) and made it into a living, breathing organism of a film. For younger people like myself, the concept of the Hoovertown/mining town (and its oppressiveness) portrayed in the film has always remained somewhat dead on the pages of history books. Mr. Johnston, through his cast, crew, and through Mr. Hickam's words, has breathed a life in to it. This film belongs in the canon alongside such other modern classics (in the overcoming-adversity-and-generally-uplifting genre) as John G. Avildsen's ROCKY. Rent it, read it, buy it (the DVD is gorgeous), but above all savor it with all in your family.</fullReview>

It's a touching father son story set in a mining town in America during the 1950's, the film lifts you up and makes you cry.

Their dream is to win the state science fair with a rocket of their own. The film has a remarkable sense of time and place using music of the period and the superb production design of Barry Robinson. It's hard to believe that the film was filmed entirely on sets. The mining town is grittily realistic.Jake Gyllehaal gives a fine performance as the leader of the quartet of youthful scientists. Chris Cooper portrays his father, foreman of the coal mine. Their scenes together are moving and emotionally satisfying. Although the outcome is predictable, the finale has that lump-in-the-throat upbeat climax.This is a fine film for teenagers and young people. It's a shame they would probably rather see something like "The Waterboy". It shows a lovely film can be made for only 23 million dollars.</fullReview>

This movie was one of the best movies in 1999, as review aggregator, Rotten Tomatoes, reports that 90% out of 72 critics gave the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.6/10: "Rich in sweet sincerity, intelligence, and good old-fashioned inspirational drama, October Sky is a coming-of-age story with a heart to match its Hollywood craftsmanship. Also this movie won Critics' Choice Movie Awards for Best Family Film from the Broadcast Film Critics Association in 2000.It beautifully illustrates the biography of a teen Homer who is ambitious towards rocket science and ends up to be a scientist at NASA despite of all the mishappenings he faces in life. The story is a gem for the teens who are often led down by their dreams and dear ones. Full of emotions and zeal, the movie buys one a lot of encouragement to follow ones dreams.It proved very helpful to me and as it would be to all the people who have been facing a very hard time in life and not been able to do what they want to. The plot and the acting of the cast starring Chris Cooper, Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Owen is great and hence this movie easily and beautifully connects to people who got mind-stuck in teenage. As one would expect from Universal studios, the production house of the movie, the scenes combined with the acting is so real that it will take oneself back to the teen life of 1950's in America, which in itself is a wonderful experience. I would strongly recommend this movie to all the people reading this review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, but historical errors got in the way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the fall of 1957 when I was 14 (like the book) I and the late Mike Falkenhain experimented with building and launching rockets in his backyard at Trevose, PA. I became a chemist and he an engineer. I loved the movie, but the errors got in the way of enjoying the film. The cars were all wrong for the time period of 1957-58. The 1952 Fords and the 1953 Chevys had wrap around windshields, ending the split windshield era. With the exception of a quick passing tail of what I think was a 57 Chevy, every car was 1952 or older. People like my Dad with union jobs traded in their cars every three to five years. In a coal town in W. VA half might have been split windshields, but 100%, I don't think so.Dieselization began in earnest in the 1940's, and was largely complete by 1958 (1953 for the Southern), although there were a few steam locos around on some lines. No std gauge train lines in the US ran exclusively steam engines in 1958. I rode on the Pennsylvania Railroad to school everyday from 1955 - 1959, and was fascinated with trains. One in the movie would have been nice, but exclusively steam in 1958 on a major line - impossible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Where there is will, there is a way". This movie is a beautiful illustration of this old saying. This movie released one of the best movies on 1999. It beautifully illustrates the biography of a teen Homer(Chris Cooper) who is ambitious towards rocket science and ends up to be a scientist at NASA despite of all the mishappenings he faces in life. The story is a gem for the teens who are often led down by their dreams and dear ones. Full of emotions and zeal the movie buys one a lot of encouragement to follow ones dreams.It proved very helpful to me and I would recommend it all the people who have been facing a very hard time in life and not been able to do what they want to. The plot and the acting of the cast is great and hence this movie easily and beautifully connects to people who got mind-stuck in teenage. Further the acting is so real that it will take oneself back to the teen life of 1950's in America, which itself is a wonderful experience. Please give it a shot, its worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Follow your dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having a dream is normal and that is part of human behavioral science. I always felt that western societies are receptive and children have a freeway in searching and seeking their career path. This film was an eye -opener, that all societies mirror each other with slight differential. Further, it was revelation that your dormant mind dream can trigger with a slight spark. That spark was 'Sputnik 1' circumnavigating miles away in the orbit following its own trajectory. It is an old age tradition that children follow their parental profession. The parents lay the groundwork so that the children do least struggle, as it is a well-scripted route. Therefore, Homer's father was no exception. He prided his profession and earned the respect of his peers, sub-ordinates and management not a normal feat given the circumstance of the terrain he is working (coalmines). Any accomplishment is impossible without a stable schooling supported by enthusiastic teachers who make the student learn (Ms. Freida J. Riley). Childhood friends though having distinct mindsets but helping the crucial purpose (Rocket boys) and of course the society, that inhabits us. Their support system permeates allowing impossible tasks to be within our grasps just by perseverance. Except his father always, the small town people cheered him at each unsuccessful rocket launch. What really moved me was pain portrayed by Father and Son. They both have strong conviction and unable to convince each other. Their love distilled and filtered through the loving and caring wife/mother trying to mend each other to keep her family knitted. After winning, the competition when Snr Hickam taunts that he was unable to recognize even his idol Wernher von Braun (scientist). The reply given was very emotional explaining to his father that he wants to be a good human like him and though Mr. Braun is indisputably a great scientist but he is not his idol. In a very subtle message, he conveyed whom he wants to emulate in life. Father pressing the button for the final rocket launch was the icing that success with effort and pain is worth only with family, friends and society. This real life story teaches us some vital lessons for life. We should be affirmative in want we need in life. Our life circumstances provides us tussle that make us withdrawn in what you need most. We need to change those failures into opportunities and take 'baby steps'. Age should never be a factorial probably everyone can never be as blessed as 'Homer Hickam' but gets closer to your dream.</fullReview>

Maybe that is fair, given how well she is known. But now (2015), it seems worth noting that Chris Cooper is just as big a part of this film and has really gone on to become a name of his own. Maybe not eclipsing Dern, but not far behind. Updated releases ought to reflect this.The film is strangely obsessed with the idea that people cannot get out of their small town or escape the coal mine. Was this true in the 1950s? Being from a small town that lived or died based on its paper mill, I understand the concept... but never thought of it as so stark or inevitable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a wonderful film. Inspiration and feel-good done right. Jake Gyllenhaal was really impressive, like, shockingly so. Infuses so much into his character in ways sometimes he didn't later on in his career. All of the supporting turns were quite good. I watched it for Dern (who was great in her role, so much warmth and compassion despite playing it so broadly) but got a really great cast all around. I strongly recommend it, especially because it really does feel like it comes from a lot of undeniable passion, a lot of true inspiration and a true interest in the subject, in a way that doesn't ring false or comes across as contrived or trying to garner emotion or sympathy that isn't warranted at all. There are films like that, but this isn't one of them and needs kudos for that.</fullReview>

His commanding father John (Chris Cooper) is the mine supervisor and expects his son to join him even though it's dangerous and the mine faces layoffs. Science teacher Miss Riley (Laura Dern) tries to raise interest in Sputnik but the only kid excited is class nerd Quentin Wilson. After seeing Sputnik in the night sky, Homer decides to build a rocket. With the help of his two friends Roy Lee Cooke and Sherman O'Dell as well as Miss Riley and Quentin, they overcome obstacles to do the unexpected.This is a fine inspirational based-on-true-story movie.

		<fullReview>The true story of Homer Hickam, a coal miner's son who was inspired by the first Sputnik launch to take up rocketry against his father's wishes. In a 1950's mining town called Coalwood, Homer Hickam played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is a kid with only one future in sight, to work in the local coal mine like his father. However in October 1957, everything changes when the first artificial satellite, Sputnik goes into orbit. With that event, Homer becomes inspired to learn how to build rockets. With his friends and the local nerd, Homer sets to do just that by trial and a lot of error. Unfortunately, most of the town and especially Homer's father thinks that they are wasting their time. Only one teacher in the high school understands their efforts and lets them know that they could become contenders in the national science fair with college scholarships being the prize. Now the gang must learn to perfect their craft and overcome the many problems facing them as they shoot for the stars. Roger Ebert recognized that the film: "doesn't simplify the father into a bad guy or a tyrant. He understandably wants his son to follow in his footsteps, and one of the best elements of the movie is in breaking free, he is respecting his father. This movie has deep values." October Sky is an inspiring and moving film that will warm the hearts of the viewers. October Sky is a great and interesting film that will stir emotions in the viewer. It's a film that I believe everyone can enjoy. It's a really superb feel-good film.</fullReview>

He dares to dream and live his dream, going against the odds to achieve what seems to be a remote possibility. He sets a great example and thereby inspires young people who follows. Jake Gyllenhaal's boyish and nerdy look in this film suits his character well, he does look convincing as a boy who is different. The ending is poignant and very touching.

		<fullReview>I can't believe it took me this long to see this movie, especially since I like Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. Cooper is a miner in a mining town in West Virginia and Gyllenhaal, who plays his son doesn't want to go into the family business. He wants to be a rocket scientist. It's based on a true story. It's no academy award winning movie, but it's very charming and so is Jake Gyllinhall. He's very young in it. The acting by everyone in it is adequate. Everything about it technically is adequate. There's a fun little montage of them shooting, or trying to shoot of their rockets and failing over and over. The sound track was all 60's music which was enjoyable. Although a little predictable and a little derivative it was still pretty entertaining and enjoyable. Maybe because it's just so disgustingly feel good. I cried despite myself at the end. It's also just one of the most family oriented movies ever. If you have the whole family over and don't want to offend anyone, this is the perfect movie for that occasion. There's footage of the real people at the end of the movie. It's pretty fascinating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look at it go, Homer. This movie's gonna go for miles. October Sky is just a beautiful movie. You don't need to be a Rocket scientist to get that.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the memoirs of real life NASA engineer Homer Hickam, October Sky (an anagram for the novel 'Rocket Boys') was indeed a great family film. October Sky also stands for the date, Oct. 4, 1957 where Soviet satellite Sputnik 1 spark the Space race, and Homer Hickam's dreams of building rockets. The reason why October Sky was chosen by the studio over Rocket Boys is because they thought it wouldn't sell with women. Universal Pictures changed the title to be more inviting to a wider audience and thus it did work. Indeed, the title, October Sky has a little more feel to it, than Rocket Boys anyways. In the film, Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), a coal miner's son sees this as an inspired to take up rocketry against his father's wishes played by the great actor Chris Cooper as John Hickam. Only Chris Cooper can load that much dignity in silence and fire off like rocket with his body language. Amazing. Just the way, that Jake and Chris's characters butt heads in this movie is intense. Both have fears and reasons to do what they do. Homer's father wasn't cruel, he was old fashioned. Homer was trying to break the mold, John had been in coal mining for his life and he came from a generation grounded. Homer wanted to fly and get out and John couldn't see it. Both characters love each other, father and son wise, but with careers, it was father VS son indeed. This movie is a capable-enough movie on its own right, and it's really serve as a great father's day movie as well. The movie teaches parents to be more open to their children's own plans for their lives, while also the world that is ever so changing. The scene where Homer tells his father who his hero is, is very emotion. Great scene, indeed. The supporting cast was great as well. Homer gets help building with his friends, Quetin (Chris Owen), Roy (William Lee Scott) and O-Dell (Chad Lindberg). It's weird in the book, Homer was more the nerd, and Quetin is the all-around kid and in the film, they change parts and looks. All likable charming American character with some background sub-plot story arches for themselves as well like Roy Lee's abusive foster father. Lot of laughs and smiles to go with their small scenes of their wacky high-jinx. Laura Dern is pretty good as the Miss Riley, the teacher that get them on the right track by helping with their math and science. However, the film does have some drawbacks. I don't think the film capture the joy and triumph of Hickham's original memoir; as it changes things up to make them more dramatic in the film such as Homer going into the mine to work, Homer meeting Wernher Von Braun and the issues with Miss Riley's health. In real life, she actually lived several years after the movie ended. It tend to jazz up the real life events way too much. There was also the fact that the boys were 8 to 14 at the time not 17. Parents would be complaining that the film is showing young children playing with rockets if they show 8 year olds. Also, Homer was more well-known by his nickname 'Sonny' in his hometown, but I think the movie change it for the better. The movie also has this predictable flat formulaic flow to it that you knew was going to happen. Still, you have to have a hard heart, if you're not moved by the film ending. You knew deep inside from the beginning that this will be a good feel movie with uplifting themes. There is great symbolism of how grounded, the community was in the beginning and how rockets change this area for the better. The movie was such a big hit, that an October Sky festival was host in the town, every year since then. One thing I love about October Sky is a warm, evocative soundtrack. Mark Isham did a great job with the main themes. The violin at the beginning gives me goosebumps every time. Also great use of 1950's to early 1960's songs as well to set the mood and settling. These songs just gives me chills and makes me happy and reminds me that from the humblest of beginnings come the greatest of men. Overall: Joe Johnston's film would inspired others to look into their dreams, while also entertain them with the rich intelligence subject matter mixed with the coming of age story drama. October Sky will continue to help launch new dreams for children and adults wishing to become future rocket scientists for themselves. It's a good watch, and worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful film that will lift your spirit and steal your heart. A young boy with what would seem be a predetermined future in a coal mining town decides to dream big and tries to change his destiny. With the dangerous nature of coal mining the injuries and after effects Homer Hickham (Jake Gyllenhaal) he knows he cannot follow the path his father took and what he wants for him. The way the director captured the lives of the coal miners and the plight of being under a ceiling of rock. The black faces and constant coughing of the miners constantly reminding us of the danger they are put in. What makes this film more captivating is the relationships between the different characters. The dad a classical hardened manly man, with a soft side deep down. We have a father who truly loves his son even with all there fights. The support and encouragement of the teacher is very important as well. After seeing sputnik launched homer sees it as a opportunity to get away from the town tradition even as he has resistance from people in his life. After he experiments on building his own rockets with friends and ends up winning the school science fair. Years later he ends up actually working for NASA which makes this even a more endearing film. Since there were some superficial flaws as with other true story movies the movie still came together where others have not, with good storytelling and real emotions and a period piece. When I saw this years ago when it came out I still remember the applause at the end and almost everyone staying to the end. It was just one of those films that stays with you. Even seeing this movie again it still got me choked up. Seeing how this kid with a predetermined future having a lot against him, showing nothing but his faith and desire to change his life path ends up making his dreams come true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>October Sky is an inspirational movie of a young boy and his friends who are passionate about their dream of making rockets at a time when the Russians had just launched Sputnik. It is about perseverance of a boy in the midst of all adversities, misunderstandings, hardships and challenges. His desire to pursue what his real calling is and realise it. It is about inspiration and courage.Initially not a very bright student, his new born passion of building rockets sees him take on subjects that weren't his cup of tea (maths and calculations). When faced with lack of financial resources, he along with his friends take up to stealing old unused railway tracks. (That scene where they have just unlinked a rail from an unused track - or so they thought - and then they hear the train coming, is quite hilarious!)The most poignant part of the movie is his strained relationship with his father who wants to see him take over his job as supervisor in a coal mine and thinks his running after rockets is a waste of time. In spite of the animosity and difference of opinion, Homer acknowledges to his father that he is his real hero. At the end, his father understands him and appreciates his talent.The friendship among the four of them, each one of a different kind, is quite warming. All driven by the passion to build rockets together. Thus they earn the name 'Rocket Boys'. The role and inspiration of their teacher Miss Riley too is aptly portrayed... her desire to see them go to college and become someone in life!Worth watching it every now and then! http://vcastilino.blogspot.in/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They mostly left out the mother. Unfortunately.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't see how they could have put the whole of this fabulous reminiscence, "Rocket Boys," by a man close to my age, into a movie without making it into a mini-series for young-adults and above. Having just finally read it, I had to re-watch the film, which I'd seen over ten years ago. For those who don't like the movie, read the book, and watch the Bonus extras on the disk. You'll find they did an excellent job of extracting and displaying on screen perhaps 25% of this non-fiction story's elements. What you get is a sweet (not necessarily saccharin, rather "sweet" as in well-crafted), feel-good family fare flick, but not the gritty and far more real complete story, which included more characters and conflicts, and especially the interaction between the boy and his mother, and how she balanced out the tough-love family equation.In real life Homer's mother did a lot more than cook, wash, and gripe a bit about the company coal mine as June Lockhart from "Lassie" might have done. She could be, and was, scathingly, bitterly, ironically funny in the face of the daily potential for disaster, of the mine killing her husband and setting the family adrift. If the father was a force to be reckoned with, wait'll you meet Homer's actual mother, not the Mrs. Cleaver version they depicted in "October Sky" the movie. This is one jumping off place requiring a mini-series, and where the incomparable Laura Dern could have really done some serious work, had they cast her in that role playing opposite Chris Cooper but, this is an inspirational family flick, not reality.In the book, Elsie's got a husband devoted more to managing a deadly company town operation than his own family, an occupation thousands of feet underground, on call 24x7; an eldest son devoting himself to a potentially crippling sport which might or might not get him out of Coalwood WV and the inevitable life underground; and a youngest son who decides he wants to experiment in the basement with potentially deadly projectiles fueled by violently volatile chemical mixtures, testing them in the furnace of the coal-fired hot water heater and drying them out for days underneath it. Her sardonic, ironic response to him when he announces he wants to do this (and a few times thereafter): "Don't blow yourself up." As she continually paints an idyllic beach scene on a canvas hanging on the kitchen wall...for several years.Homer could've blown the house up. Brother Jim could've been permanently disabled. Her husband faced death daily (either from black lung or a mine disaster) in which case the company would've given her two weeks to move the family out of Coalwood, who knows where.They didn't hit that one hard enough in this Disney-like film. I give it an 8 for taking a far more serious work and pulling together enough elements to create a good family flick. A movie the whole family can watch together...just not Homer's real family, who were if anything, more dysfunctional than most. Fabulous job of autobiographical writing, great job of movie-making based on it. The one is not entirely the other. That's okay, the movie stands on its own.</fullReview>

He worked in the space industry from it's inception in the 1950's to his retirement in 1979. He has been referred to as a "space pioneer." Among his last projects were cryogenic designs for the space shuttle orbiter, ground support systems for the shuttle and preliminary designs for the international space station. He authored several magazine articles and a manual that is still used by today's aerospace engineers. His shuttle designs are still used on every shuttle flight more than thirty years after his retirement. One could say that he was a "Rocket boy" himself!

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a great movie, look no further, because this one fits the bill.The year is 1957, and the Soviet Union has released Sputnik into space. One night, the citizens of Coalwood, West Virginia, watch the sky to get a view of the satellite. The event has a significant impact on young Homer Hickam.After seeing Sputnik, Homer becomes fascinated with rockets. He strives to learn everything there is to know about them. Joining forces with three other students, production begins on the first rocket.As time passes, the quartet's prowess in constructing rockets improves, and with the encouragement of teacher Frieda Riley, the boys work hard to earn a chance to go to the National Science Fair in Indianapolis.While Homer and his colleagues develop a popular following, there are some who oppose their work. The biggest critic is Homer's father, John, who is a supervisor at the town's coal mine. His belief is simple: Rockets are a waste of time, and Homer should go to work in the mine, which ultimately becomes the career of virtually all of Coalwood's male citizens. As one of the characters says at one point, it's either the mine, or possibly college thanks to a football scholarship.Since Homer cannot play football, it's either the mine, or rockets. He definitely does not want the first option. What will it be? The film has some solid performances, including Jake Gyllenhall as Homer, and Chris Cooper as John. The script is good, and a lot of the scenes evoke the right emotions. You cannot help but cheer for Homer, who has a dream and wants to achieve it.This film is an uplifting drama, and does show that if you believe, you can follow your dreams. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

Very good set of events and smooth developing of characters as from the old Hollywood school, I would say. Carefully ignored political background of that time has been done extremely smart and in favor of the plot: first human satellite in space is the greatest world achievement, even though Soviet, and most of the Americans that weren't scared of that new Russian space power were cheering it, or even being proud of that world accomplishment.

		<fullReview>The film has everything a perfect movie should have. The movie has a sort of magnetic feel in it which can pull you right from the first minute till the end. A few scenes are a bit over acted (like the one in which Homer goes to the classroom to prove that his rocket didn't cause the forest fire) but for the rest of movie the acting was PERFECT. Jake's caliber as an actor is proved here, and Chris Cooper was simply superb as his father and a dedicated miner. The rocket sequences are fun to watch and the ending is simply touching. I didn't want the movie to end but once the ending credits came, a tear rolled down my cheek for reasons unknown.A perfect movie for all those lovers of sensible cinema and all the 'Gyllenhaalics' out there!Enjoy! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American Billy Elliott</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Audiences could be forgiven for confusing "Billy Elliott" to be a remake of "October Sky." Both films take place in coal mining towns, both concern young boys who yearn for something more than going down in the mines, both boys have tough fathers who are disapproving of their career choices, both boys have tough older brothers, both boys have supportive female teachers, both films involve strikes, and both films are exceptionally well done and emotionally uplifting. With the success of Elton John's musical version of "Billy Elliott," how long can it be before "October Sky" hits Broadway.Like Billy's tale, the story of Homer Hickam is based in fact. Captivated by the launching of the Russian satellite, Sputnik, Homer wants to launch his own rocket, and Werner von Braun becomes his hero. Teaming with three schoolmates and encouraged by his teacher, Homer learns all he can about rocketry to achieve his goal. Well written with conviction and heart, "October Sky" has a fine cast that seems to have realized the special nature of the project. A young Jake Gyllenhaal is fine as Homer, a role that obviously gave a boost to his career. Laura Dern is excellent as Miss Riley, the cheer-leading teacher. However, Chris Cooper is the standout as John Hickam, a man who has spent his life in the mines, risen to a leadership role, and does not comprehend that his son wants more than that. Cooper is a master of repressed feeling. For some unknown reason, Cooper was overlooked at awards time for this and his later roles in "American Beauty" and "Breach," which makes his Oscar for "Adaptation" all the more deserving.Although filmed in Tennessee, Fred Murphy's cinematography captures the gray bleakness of a West Virginia mining town. The use of popular songs from the 1950's and early 1960's adds a nice period feeling, and Mark Isham's haunting original score aches with nostalgia. However, Gyllenhaal and Cooper are at the core of the film, and their scenes together capture a strained father-son relationship that evolves over the course of the film into one of mutual respect. Again, this parallels the dynamics of Billy and his father. Elton John, are you listening?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film that can show us all that our dreams are never out of reach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie touched me in so many ways. As a very proud West Virginian perhaps it meant more to me than to some of you. Watching "October Sky" made me feel every emotion possible. I ended up crying several times, however. This is one of my favorite movies. There are so many lessons here, about friendship, being determined, and not letting anyone stand in the way of reaching your goal. It may not have been a big budget blockbuster, but that doesn't mean its not a good movie. It may not have been exactly like the book (which is also very good) but then again what movie is? There is enough there from Hickam's work and own words to get the point across. In conclusion,this is a great film,it's well acted and tells a wonderful story of triumph and achievement. I highly recommend it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>October Sky is about a young man who had a normal life, until the broadcast of a radio station caught his attention about Sputnik. And how the satellite just got launched into space. And how Sputnik will be visible to the naked eye by dark or by early morning the next day. When morning came, the town gathered to look for the satellite that would be passing by. When suddenly Homer saw the satellite, at that moment his whole life changed in an instant, for he wanted to be an astronaut. When Homer got to school, he found that the library had no strong or accurate information on rockets. During lunch, Homer was desperate to learn about them, and to accomplish this he asked for help from Quentin who know everything there is to know about rockets. Homer asked for Quentin's entire knowledge on that subject. After school Roy Lee and O'Dell caught up will Homer to see what was going on. Eventually his friends all decided that the idea of building rockets together was plausible and decided to start building and testing their rockets. Unfortunately, Homers father didn't approve of these actions, for all he cared about was his coalmine. And with him constantly getting in the way Homer and his friends didn't get very far. While Homer, Roy Lee, O'Dell, and Quentin continued to walk eight miles to their launch pad in Snake Wood every day to test out their rockets. Something happened right after they fired their rocket; a fire broke loose in the woods. The next day at school the sheriff came with bad news about the rocket boys, and took them away. Things kept getting worse after that. The miners injuries kept increasing, including Homers father, which the family didn't have enough money for the medical expenses. So Homer had to quit school and work in the mine to pay off the medical bills. While doing so, Homer still dreamed about space. After working in the mine for a while, Homer paid off the dept and starting thinking more about space and suddenly felt like reading the book his teacher gave him. With some sacrifices of sleep, Homer figured out more advanced ways to build a rocket, Homer also discovered that he didn't start that fire. With his discovery, he needed to talk to Quentin. The next day Homer went to school to prove that he was innocent of starting the fire, even though he wasn't welcome there. Homer managed to prove his case with some help of his book and the evidence the sheriff brought in. Now, Homer had nothing preventing him from winning the science fair except his father's support. With his teachers help Homer and his friends managed to win the science fair, and get the scholarships. After winning the fair, Homer, and his friends decided to launch one final rocket to dedicate all of the town's support, when launching time came Homers dream came alive when his father pressed the launch button. While Homer, Coal wood, and his father watched the rocket fly. Homer not only watched a rocket but watched his dreams go up with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most inspiring and touching film I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has been around for over six years, but I never wonder I would watch it someday. Several days ago, I went to the DVDstore, I found it. I recognize the actor starred Holmer, for I've seen him play a role in the arguably famous Sci-Fi movie, The Day After Tomorrow, and the recently Brokeback Mountain. To fulfill my curiosity of this versatile actor, I rent the move.Spending almost 2 hours watching the movie, I found myself really touched by its plot. Not only Holmer, I really appreciate all his friend who devoted themselves to realize their same goal, to win the science fair, so that they can get into college and change their fate to be the miner. Beginning with the love of the universe, Holmer and his friend worked together to make the rocket. Although they're miner's son, they eventually believe themselves can do something more than fooling around all day. In October Sky, The importance of Miss Rally, I think, can't be overemphasized. She encouraged her student to do their best, and always supported them. The movie successfully described an ideal teacher, and a group of young boy eagering to pursue their dream.Aged 17, like the rocket boy, Homer, I have my own dream, too. I hope I could have the perseverance to overcome every obstacle, though it will be tough. All in all, if you feel confused about your life, or often feel depressed, rent October Sky right away. You will get inspired and have the power to move on in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Homer was a smart student. After watching Soviet Union successfully launched the rocket, he decided to make his rocket. But that is opposed to his father's will that wished him become his successor in the mine. Under warm encouragement from Homer's teacher, he kept on making rockets. To win the prize in the national science festival would be his last straw.A child should have the right to choose his future. As parent, they should not interfere. Even failed, that is only the price for growing or regret for life.Chris Cooper and Jake Gyllenhaal convincingly played father and son. Their interaction was the most wonderful thing in the movie. Jake also had an impressive show in Donnie Darko (a excellent movie). Although I have not watched Brokeback Mountain, I am sure that he will not disappoint me.A uplifting and touching drama. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>October Sky is an excellent film, and combined with Donnie Darko to turn Jake Gyllenhaal, a talented actor, into a bigtime movie star. The film was beautifully shot, successfully transporting the viewer to a bleak 1950's West Virginia coal-mining town. From the wonder and paranoia at viewing Sputnik pass overhead, to the joy at seeing their rockets proceed from total (and spectacular) failure to fantastic success, to the claustrophobic fear of the coal mine, to the relationships between Homer and his teacher, and with his parents, finally to the satisfaction of the conclusion (spoiler: Homer and his friends escape crackery doom in the mine to go to college to become, among other things, engineers) October Sky is heartwarming, without being maudlin. The possibility that even one person becomes an engineer or scientist due to this film makes it a treasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), a high school kid in a rural mining town, seems headed for the coal mine, just like his father John (Chris Cooper), and is content with that life. This changes when the Soviets launch Sputnik into space. Homer gains the desire to build his own rockets, something his father thinks is silly.Homer and his friends Quentin (Chris Owen), Roy (William Lee Scott), and Sherman (Chad Lindberg) seem determined to build their rocket, failing many times. But their teacher Ms. Riley (Laura Dern) lends some support, believing the boys are onto something.Based on a true story, this is a wonderful little film. It's nice to see some quality family entertainment now, since all the attention goes to things you can't see with the kids and most non-R rated movies just plain suck nowadays. The writing is great, while the directing is ok. The acting is better than in most films, especially Chris Cooper, who is one of the most underrated performers in Hollywood. This is definetly worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on astronaut Homer Hickam's autobiographical work "Rocket Boys" this film features Jake Gyllenhaal as teenage Homer who, along with his three friends, became addicted to rocketry and space-science, ignoring other studies and overcoming his father's effort to make him a mine-worker as himself. This true, refreshing coming-of-age drama is not only fantastic for its outstanding storyline and screenplay, but also for fine performances of Gyllenhaal,Chris Cooper as Homer's father and Laura Dern as Homer's teacher, his favorite Ms. Riley.The story is mostly set in a time in the late 60s. And, through the course of the film, life of the common people in the downtown area is well featured. Good to see that the film contains very little amount of complex scientific details. Instead, the film mostly focused on Homer's life and his determination to fight back. It also succeeded to feature separate points of view of other supporting characters like Homer's father, mother, his friend Quentin and Ms. Price independently. In the end it turns out to be a good film, not only a good story. 4/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warm and heavily inspiring movie based on Homer Hickam's novel where the son (Jake Gyllenhall) of a small-town West Virginia coal miner (Chris Cooper) is motivated to go into rockets after seeing Sputnik and getting endless support from friends around the community despite his father's objections.The movie overwhelmed me with its' never-ending respect and care for the characters here instead of the typical Hollywood methods. "October Sky" pretty much covers all the issues that go on in a small town, especially in the fifties, where the film takes place. Also, the movie makes a great point in how important a high school education can be.Gyllenhall is solid here as Homer, who's dream of being in NASA is really put to the test. And he's not alone, Chris Cooper and Laura Dern also stand out with their moving performances here. If there's anyone is the film who has the toughest and delicate role, it's the father who looks like you want to dislike him, but you can't."October Sky" shows that dreams can come true if you stay committed to it despite the odds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie you can watch with your parents, grandparents, children, and all will enjoy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An inspirational story based on a true story. The movie focuses mostly on a high school student in the early 1950's, who lives in a small, poor mining town, trying to pursue a personal interest in model rockets.The story is sweet, uplifting, inspirational, and mostly predictable. We do know it is based on a true life story after all, and they don't base too many stories on people pursuing an interest and failing horribly.I felt the real focus of the movie was the father, John played by Chris Cooper. He clearly was a "responsible" typical middle American person. I think it showed a person struggling with the responsibilities of his job, and his family and trying to make the best choices possible. His job was dangerous, but he was up every day working hard. He tried to channel his son's interests into areas that he (the father) was comfortable with, but the son was resistant to. The movie captures the conflict of a father trying to guide his son, while still allowing him to grow into his own. Ultimately he allows his son some freedom to pursue his own interests, despite the feeling as if his son may be growing apart from him. In one of the touching moments of the movie, the son lets him know that, that could not happen, when the father says mockingly "So, you met your hero, and didn't even know it." and the son responds "He is not my hero." leaving the implied "you are" hanging on the air. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes one dream is enough to light up the whole sky.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wish that I was born earlier than I was. Not to be able to see some timeless classic movies when they first appeared on the big screen, but to have seen and heard some of the more famous events in our life time. ?October Sky' focuses on an event that I had never heard of, but If I was born in the right era, I am sure it would have had an influence on individual just like me. This is an inspirational story, that can and will leave you stunned on what you can achieve, if you put your heart and soul into it. In Coalwood, West Virginia, 1957, coal mining is king and no one can escape life underground. But when high school student Homer Hickam, Jr. sees the Soviet satellite Sputnik streak overhead, he aims for the stars and a new destiny in this incredible true story of hope, determination and triumph. With the help of his teacher and three buddies, Homer sets out to build his own rocket. How Homer overcomes seemingly impossible obstacles-poor education, a disapproving father and a series of misfires that threaten to flatten his dreams and the town- and fulfills his vision is the launching pad for one of the most timeless, inspirational stories ever brought to the screen.Jake Gyllenhaal was terrific as the main star of ?October Sky'. Homer Hickman, must be an extraordinary personality, and I am sure he would be proud of the performance Gyllenhaal did to this role in a film based on him. Yet I also feel that the boys that backed Homer in his rocketing adventures were also important to the make up of this film. The other young star I know in this movie is who played the character Quentin. He is a good young actor, who has been in the infamous `American Pie' movies. In this film he was completely different, in that he was the nerdy type of guy that everyone avoided at school, yet he also helped pull off what was an amazing feet by such young people.Chris Cooper is the conservative father in this film. In all his films I have found him to be an extremely stubborn character, and he does that in October Sky. He was born to be a very reluctant character. This role reminds me so much of the role he took in the brilliant, ?American Beauty'. The other good role in this film was that of Homer's teacher, Miss Riley. Out of all the hindrance the boys get to there dream, they have a help in a teacher that wants them to succeed. Miss Riley was portrayed well by Laura Dern.I really felt that this story, though it was based on true life events, was a great premise for a movie. Having the real Homer Hickman write a book really helps the story, then to recreate the time that it was set in, was extremely satisfying for me. I believe the director, Joe Johnston, got the whole mood of the story just how it was meant to be. I also like how we get to see what the real characters are up to in the end of the film.To say that October Sky ?is one of the better films that will uplift and inspire everyone' is pretty obvious. Yet this film also shows me that movies based on true stories can be extremely invaluable, as it can show how great some people really are, if they put their mind to it. This film also proves that parents are not allows right when it comes to knowing what there children want. Instead it makes me certain that parents need to help, rather than hinder there children, because if they don't it could result in people never knowing how great some young people can be. CMRS gives ?October Sky': 4.5 (very good ? brilliant film)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>October Sky was a nicely made film about growing up in a coal town with an interest in something beyond mining. The plot was familiar. A boy has an interest in an activity not typically associated with his class. He shows promise and is encouraged by an elder but his family doesn't understand nor support him. A family tragedy occurs that threatens his future success but in the end he triumphs. The story is familiar and success is in the telling. How well do the film makers characterize the participates? Do they seem real? Do you develop empathy for them? In this movie they were successful. Other movies that follow the same formula aren't as successful. Billy Elliot, in my opinion, though of similar plot structure, (substitute ballet for rocketry), was a failure. October Sky is worth seeing.</fullReview>

But hey, there's always room for a well-played and well-written one. On more than one occasion did I feel my throat clutter up and my eyes go all stingy-like.We like seeing people overcoming personal and practical obstacles and succeeding at what they dream of. And it's also refreshing to see one which is n-o-t about the high school football/baseball-team that's at the bottom of the series inching their way up to the final - and guess what - winning it.Having just seen Jake Gyllenhaal in "Donnie Darko" and being blown away by his performance there, I was even more so after seeing this flick. He is a very talented young actor. A word of caution though, Jake. Please embark on more projects like "Donnie Darko" or you might become your generations Tom Hanks. Hate to see yet another great talent loose itself within the boundaries of "happy-ending-land".Chris Cooper does a very good job portraying Jakes father, but he is so typecast in that role that certain scenes almost becomes comical. Damn you Hollywood-people for not allowing actors to grow. Damn you.All in all, a very enjoyable film. A bit too much in the end though when he proves himself to the mining-community, reconciles with his father, realizes which girl he wants (and getting her) AND getting a scholarship. Felt a bit like the ending to the first "Karate Kid"-movie, if y'know what I mean.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple but truly moving movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>October Sky is a highly lauded movie, and it?¦s easy to see why. The story is easy to comprehend and many turning points are gripping, the actors and actresses do fairly good jobs, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper, the hero finally gets what he wants, and it?¦s a true story. Frankly I think the director?¦s achievement is not comparable to the sparks and heat the original story generates. We don?¦t see any special narrative or cinematography; the power of the movie relies much on the riveting plot and tough situation the young hero is trapped in that most audience will find themselves identify with the characters. We feel Homer?¦s desire to earn his father?¦s recognition and create his own future, and his resilience wins our respect. ?§October Sky?¨ reminds me of a later 2001 Japanese production of mini series ?§Rocket Boy,?¨ which might owe some of the inspiration from this movie. Actually these two works shot from two different cultures provide interesting comparison. When October Sky unfolds a story of a young man crying out loud to claim his right over his own destiny, ?§Rocket Boy?¨ offers a more compromised description that could sometimes constitute an acrid criticism of modern society. Starring the outstanding actor Yuji Oda, ?§Rocket Boy?¨ focuses on three men as ordinary as can be: a travel agent who has a dream of becoming an astronaut, a boastful advertising agent who is on the brink of being torn apart by his inferiority complex resulted from the extreme success of his father and older brother (like what Homer feels in his family), and a food company employee who is about to getting married but scared of this idea. The collected social consciousness superimposes its definition of success on its constituents and steps further to force them suffocate their dreams by claiming them ?§impossible.?¨ To compensate for his lost ideal, Kobayashi (Yuji) works in the tour operator because it?¦s called ?§Galaxy.?¨ When his client fails him and his girlfriend decides to leave him, he finally finds strength from his father?¦s words, who had determined to be a sailor but later found life on the sea less attractive as he had presumed. ?§But I don?¦t regret it,?¨ his father told Kobayashi, ?§at least I tried.?¨ It is his father?¦s confession that encourages him to resign his job and apply for astronautships despite the fact that he hurts his legs and needs to move around on a wheelchair. Kobayashi?¦s effort finally fails, and he goes back to the travel agency. But his ?§crazy?¨ courage inspires his friends, and everyone loves him more. Just before the end of the series, Kobayashi is on the job as a guide of a space camp meant to let children learn more about astronauts. After the tour is over we see him leaning against a tree, unfolding a sheet of poster he tears from the bulletin board that says: ?§Astronauts Wanted for 2004.?¨ Kobayashi looks at the piece of paper and laughs and laughs, just like a kid looking at his ticket to Disneyland. Kobayashi may never get what he wants, but he dares his destiny and ?§just does it.?¨ This series is so heart-gripping not because the hero exhibits any heroic deeds, but his ordinariness and unstoppable urge to realize his dream which make us wonder and envy. Unlike Dilbert or other sarcastic writings, this show enlightens us and teaches us something. Homer and Kobayashi both have the dream, and they do what they can despite other people?¦s opinions. I recommend other IMDB users to see the Japanese TV series. If you are a nine-to-fiver, you will feel more touched. I feel sorry that IMDB doesn?¦t have its data, maybe you can ask somebody from Japan to help you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Billy Elliott....but better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it similar thematically to Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based around a troubled father/son relationship. In both films, the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their home town. Both sons face derision by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them.The major difference that I found between the films was that October Sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film. Laura Dern puts in a moving performance and Chris Cooper plays the disapproving father very well as he went on to do in American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with his subtle directing, very different from his other directorial features such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The True Story of the 4 "Rocket Boys", to me this is a Must See movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is about the life of Homer Hickam, a boy who likes to build rockets. The only thing that is stoping him is his father, his fathers is a miner and wants Homer to be one, he says that building and shooting off rockets is a dumb thing to do. But Homer and his 3 friends, O'Dell, Roy-Lee, and Quentin build rockets anyway. The second time there town sees them, they get arrested at school for starting the Forest Fire near by. They dont go to jail. When Homers father got hurt in the mine, Homer went in so his brother Jim wont loose the chance to play football at a collage. Soon his father went back to work, but the next day, Homer quit, in the book his teacher, Mrs Riley gave him he was able to find where the rocket landed to tell his princebal, he and his friends didn't start the fire. Then they entered the science fair and one First Place in there school. Homer went to Indianappolis, where the final fair was and he won! So Homer, O'Dell, Roy-Lee, and Quentin got a scoloership for a college, witch was the grand price. All this is how Homer, O'Dell, Roy-Lee and Quentin got there name "Rocket Boys"! Sadly Homers dad died of Black Lungs, And there teacher, the one who got them into Rocketry, died of the Hocken's Disese at the age of 31. This is a True Story, and i saw this movie 3 times before i bought the movie to keep. To me this is a Must See Movie and i know you guys will like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great film. Truly inspiring and its a true story.I am tired of people saying that this film just a copy of other plays and movies. There is no way this movie could have been copied from a play. This film is a true story. It took place outside of Bluefield West Virginia. Homer Hickam is a real person and he is still alive and well. His experiments in rocketry won him a scholarship to Virginia Tech. He later went on to work for NASA training astronauts. So next time you think a film is just a rehashed play or movie maybe you should do a little more research.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personallly, I dont care that this film copied or had taken no new risk like alot of films. In this day in age of your "American Pie", "Varsity Blues", "Porkys", and just basically all of the teenie bopper films out there. I was happy to see a film that dug deep into the lives of 4 boys who used intellegence and a captivating story line, to make this film good. Unlike most films that have to do with high school, this film didn't bother with popularity and sex. It dealt with the life of Homer Hickam who wanted to make something of his life, and his inspiration was the sattelite sputnik. He got together a team of 4 boys who as well were interested in this feat, and nothing but controversy followed. Everyone in Homers town of Coalwood, usually would go work down in the coal mines and that was that. Even the school principle did not even believe in the value of an education, he sent kids out of school and into the coal mines, and he considered it an honorable trade. Ms. Riley did a great job of keeping these boys dreams alive. What I also loved about this film, is that they didn't completely dwell on one story. They didn't just dwell on the story of Homer and his dad. They incorporated so many other stories in the process that you had to follow. The high point in this film for me, had to be when Homer proved that his rocket did not make that forest fire, and he got up on the chalkboard and used Trigonometry to prove his theory. Most people would have scuffed this idea or at least laughed at it, but people liked it and were happy to see that a film about 4 high school boys used intellegence and not sex. What I didn't like too much about this film though was that it was predictable. I think that in order to make a good film that is predictable, you need a great and captivating story line that you can just get lost in. This film accomplished that well and a good example of that is the film E.T. which had a great story line but was very predictable. This is a great film, and reccomended for anyone who is sick of films like "Varsity Blues" and "American Pie".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>October sky is one of the best movies i have ever seen. It really speaks to my heart. All the boys in the movie demonstrate their distinctive characters through their efforts to defy their doomed fates by winning the top scholarship.The other two major characters are their teacher and the father. It is the teacher who constantly encourages them to strive on in spite of the difficulties, such as the fatal injury of the dad. They would never have accomplished so much without her. The father, who at first disregarded his son's efforts, eventually showed his support for his son by showing up at the launching of their rocket in the end. The movie is acclaimed by the natural acting of characters and the touching story itself. October sky is absolutely worth watching!!</fullReview>

It is really bad that the Universal has taken away the movie's official home page. Jake Gyllenhaal is worth all the praise that he has got, as well as the other actors.

The true story of a group of High school kids from a backwoods depressed coal mining town who are inspired by Sputnick to experiment with rockets.

I bought the book too, and although they changed a lot of it to make it more poignant and such, it was still Homer Hickam Jr. whom I admire so much. Course, I feel like I admire him more now that I know his background... something about the script, the way this movie was made, and probably most of all Laura Dern, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Chris Cooper, makes everybody feel like they, too, can reach for the stars and catch one. The rocket boys were my favorite characters, naturally. They worked so well together it really seemed like they had known each other forever. You can tell that everybody worked on this and gave it their all. I'm graduating school next year, and I hope I can do as much as the laborers here did.

		<fullReview>Much of what has been praised in this movie--the three-dimensional characters, the spot-on historical background, the realistic storyline--can be accounted for by the fact that it is based on an actual story.Given that nearly everything worked so well in this film, perhaps scriptwriters should in future turn more to actual, well-documented incidents from real life, and quit trying to remake fairy-tales, legends, and ghost stories.It is true that the ending was somewhat predictable. In a way, it might have been a more interesting (but vastly more tragic) movie if Homer and friends had not won at the science fair, and they all ended up working in the mine after all. But this perhaps reinforces my point--for there are no doubt hundreds of failures, in real life, for every Homer Hickam success story.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact that October Sky is a great movie is, duh, a given. I'm glad the public sentiment towards this movie is so welcoming. For it to be labeled as a feel-good movie, though, is just a bit disappointing. Its story is so much more than that.I think I speak for most high school seniors in this: We have dreams we want to fulfill, and our biggest obstacle is the fear that we're not able or good enough to achieve it. The accounts of those people who make it against such odds, like Homer Hickam Jr, are necessary for our survival. Otherwise, the majority of us will lose hope and sell out.Oh, and if you want to know the entire story, read the book the movie's based on. Then let's hear someone claim that Homer's struggle to success is "predictable".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than what it seems...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"October Sky" has got to be one of the best films made in 1999. While it seems, on the surface, to be directed towards kids, it is really a lot more. Yes, it shows kids the upside to school, to science and math, and to following your dreams for what you want to be when you grow up. But this movie, as anyone who sees it knows, has more than that one storyline. There is the classic coming-of-age side to it where we see four friends finding out who they are and what they are passionate about. We see one of them defying his father who seems to be heartless, but who later comes to the rescue of another one of the boys. And we also see a true life account of one of the most remembered parts of our nation's history--the beginning of the Space Race. The film opens with Sputnik being launched and seen flying through space over the small town in which the characters live. From there, one boy gets an idea to build a rocket, and soon his two best friends and their brainy classmate join him. We follow them through their greatest achievements and their lowest times. And in the end, we see where their desire to learn and passion for knowledge take them. This movie is an absolute 10 out of 10 for me. If you haven't seen it, go rent it. If you HAVE seen it, see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great film, that is uplifting as a young man named Homer discovers that there is no future in a small rural coal town in West Virginia in the late 50's. All the students either end up in the mine or if they're lucky, will get a football scholarship. Homer is not stupid and knows the mine has no future even though his coal mining dad believes in it strongly.He suddenly sees an opportunity as the Sputnik satellite launch inspires him to build a rocket. After some total bad starts he makes friends with an ostracized brain named Quentin in school in hopes of gaining success. As his experiments start gaining notoriety his teacher tells him that there is a local science fair and that he should enter. If he wins he goes to the State Science fair and winners there get schoolarships. Homer now sees what he wants to be in life and the science fair offers that: the chance to go to college and become an astronaut. This a great film as Homer battles against all odds that seem destined to overwhelm him, his father's disaproval, the fact he lives in a nowhere small town where no-one does anything outside the mine, a principal who feels the communities students only future is shoveling coal, and no resources to gain knowledge.Great based on true story. One overplayed scene prevents perfect rating but you love it anyway (the rocket being seen through the hospital window.)Rating 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although October Sky is based on a true story, the movie's characters all fall into very specific charactures I'm sure you've seen hundreds of times. That said, its important to watch this movie not looking for 2001 a space odyssey, but for something simple and sweet. The movie uses a variety of common button-pushing/sentimental tricks like: good music (both powerful and sad), family stuff, underdog themes, dirty faces, dying young etc. Although these scenes are very easy to spot, its tough to resist they're charm. In particular is the finale which is button-pushing at its most, yet the facial expressions of the characters, especially Chris Cooper (fine performance) got me. My button was pushed!! Good movie, but not provacative or particularly intruiging, but oh well, October Sky is not that kind of movie. Not every movie can (or should) be an Apocalypse Now or an Amadeus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see this movie the minute it came out. Why, you might ask? Jake Gyllenhaal (Homer Hickam) has been a friend of my brother's and mine since elementary school, and I already knew he would be wonderful in it. Sadly, I only got to see it on video, but the effect was still incredible. Jake truly was wonderful in this movie, as was the rest of the cast. The movie didn't get nearly as much recognition as it should have, probably because it didn't have great big special effects or huge publicity. It's a shame when that happens to a movie like this, because it really is a human story that can be related to on many different levels. If you want to be blown away, rent some action movie. But if you want to be moved and made to think, rent "October Sky."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all....I liked it. You might be wondering what type of film is this...well, put simply...it is a feel good movie. It makes you feel good for a few reasons: watching a family grow and struggle as they deal with each other's individuality; knowing that sometimes dreams do come true; and that even the most stubborn person can change. Here is a story of a second child who is lost in a family structure that focuses on the accomplishments of the elder sibling and rewards the younger sibling only when he does exactly what is expected of him (no matter how low those expectations may have been.) This is the true story of a young man and his friends who dreamed they could reach the stars (literally) and someday be the people they wanted to be. The story takes place in a small mining town in West Virginia where only a select few of the youth accomplish their goal of leaving the town's borders to follow their dreams. You will follow four of the town's youth as they learn about rockets, science, and life. The film does lack some depth in the area of seeking emotional ties with the audience, but that doesn't really hurt the film, it just doesn't enhance the quality of it. Bottom line...if you like films like "Rudy", "Field of Dreams", "Lean on Me", and "Stand By Me" then you should see this one.</fullReview>

Wasn't won over by Dark City, was by this. October Sky, like it did for allot of guys, reminded me of the days spent with my rocket kit, carving, painting, building and finally launching. It also held a few truisms about the relationships between fathers and sons (a very nice way to spend a couple of hours with your family).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"October Sky" is a fine piece of film making. The casting is excellent. We believe in these characters (the main ones anyway) because the actors look and feel their part. The father reminds me of many fathers I knew back in the 60s. The tension of the father-son relationship is understandable to any man who has not followed in his father's footsteps. I easily empathized with Homer who wanted to make his father proud (as most son's do) and yet do it on his own terms.This is a classic story. That it is based on real events and real people makes it all the better. Yes, there are some stock characters like the bullying school principal. But these predictable roles do not detract from the plot or the quality of the production. After all, what would Shakespeare be without his stock characters. The director avoided what could have been a sappy story by letting the lives of these characters do the work and not overplaying his hand.This is a winner of a film and one you will want to see alone, with friends, but especially with your family.</fullReview>

Only one word will suffice: Wauwwww....This movie is so real that there is no place for overdrawn romanticism, no love scenes to make it more tasteful. This is about four boys. living in a small mining town in the States who start experimenting with rockets, after one of them has seen the Sputnik in the skies orbiting the world. There are no overdone characters, no special effects, nothing of that kind. Everything is just so real, so real....Brilliant!!! 10 out of 10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good solid film, and an original turn on an age-old theme.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, to cut to the chase, is a 6.5 out of ten, a "coming of age" film which hangs on the aerospace aspirations of Homer Hickham, who is headed to replace his father in the W. Virginia coalmines but who really wants to be a rocket scientist. It is well shot, with an intelligent script, but it is painfully predictable in virtually every way. Worth seeing for the several fine performances, notably Jake Gyllenhall in the lead role, who is absolutely marvelous. But if you are looking for a really great film about a young person growing beyond his limitations, see The Mighty, now sitting lonely on the shelves of your local Blockbuster. This is a stone classic which has been totally overlooked, one of the very finest films of its type ever made.PKL</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But can't say it was original - too formulaic. Sure, you can't expect much from a Hollywood tearjerker, but this one, I have to say, was an exception.Consider the negatives here before we get to the positives. Predictable. (If you know what the movie's about, then you know the outcome. There's a contest. Who wins? That won't take long to figure out.)Some of the confidante/confidants in the story were super nice people and helped the characters get through their mission. Those characters are so nice, that the writers give them an illness or even a death and we're able to feel sympathy. This will defintely dingle with your heart strings, but it's not an original cinematic element. Let's get to the positives. You wanted these guys to succeed.The characters were extremely interesting, and believable. The performances were first rate, and the direction was very good.If you don't look at this with a nitpicking perspective, you'll like it. Just remember, though...no new material, just a good two hours of sappy Hollywood entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was Homer's age when Sputnik was launched. Where I lived at the time, the community reaction was to identify the best and brightest, put them in accelerated science/math learning programs and push to make it to the moon. I got as caught up in that as did Homer. From my perspective, this film has captured the reaction of the public. More importantly, it delves deeply into the soul of those of us who were so inspired by that event that we would do almost anything to send a rocket soaring into space. But, unlike Homer, I wasn't punished for my dreams, I was encouraged. In dreaming his dreams and bringing them into some form of reality, Homer took his modest place alongside so many of those we view as having the genius to change the world. Einstein, Freud, Pasteur, Marx (Karl &amp; Groucho), Darwin and all the others who lived through scorn and ridicule to hold on to their core beliefs, no matter what the consequences. Maybe that's a romantic's view (and I do confess to my romanticism), but it is one I will hold regardless of any ridicule.</fullReview>

In their own way the Rocket Boys of October Sky captured the same wonderful impulse to soar that landed Apollo on the moon and sent Voyager to explore the far reaches of this solar system. For me, one of my favorite touches was Hickham's correspondence with Wernher von Braun, a visionary who took the time to recognize a familiar spirit. I also liked the character of Hickham's father, who set high standards for his sons, but I don't think any hiugher than the standards he set for himself. Funny and inspiring, but without drifting into sentimentality or ersatz fifties schmaltz, this is definitely worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I want to note that I saw this movie by myself one Saturday afternoon because none of my friends were interested in viewing such a "boring" movie. However, being such a film fanatic, I like to give everything a good chance. So, I journeyed down the sidewalk to the local theater, bought some popcorn, and prepared myself for a nice, "boring" matinee on an extremely cold day in Boston.My conclusion...I loved it. Admittingly, I'm a pushover for American dramas, and although this movie didn't involve the decorated war hero or the powerful statesman, it definately gives the viewer a warm feeling upon leaving the theater. Centered around Homer's struggle with his father and a determination to design a rocket, the film does justice in proving that the American Dream still exists. Furthermore, solid performances from a young cast and an emotional, thought provoking musical score added to its appeal.I am looking forward to more films like "October" in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many others who have commented on this film, I had only lukewarm interest in seeing it when it came out. I picked it up out of curiosity at the video store knowing it had received good reviews but suspecting it was the kind of conventionally sentimental movie I would find completely resistible. What a pleasure to find such a strong movie. Sure, it has a conventional basic premise and traditional plotting and is emotionally manipulative in familiar ways. But its strength is in its details--an appealing cast who seemed to have stepped out of life rather than Tiger Beat or Vanity Fair magazines; a dead-on sense of time and place; a respectful attitude toward all of its multi-dimensional characters; a multi-layered and believable story; sure-footed storytelling and solid cinematic technique. This film stands well above the pack and easily won over this cynic. My roommate, who sneered when I started the cassette, intended to watch something else in his own room but was totally caught up. Beautifully done move. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

The true story of four boys, centered around Homer Hickam, who bond together to build a rocket as they try to win a science fair that will give them college scholarships and get them out of the coal mine town they live in. Using a cast of unknowns for the roles of the four boys, and Chris Cooper as the unyielding and demanding father of Hickham, as well as Laura Dern as the teacher who both inspires and encourages the boys, the makers of this film made something more than a congratulatory film about someone who made something of his life coming from less than ideal circumstances.

		<fullReview>"October Sky" is an uplifting, thoughtful family film that can be enjoyed by adults and kids alike. It's the true story of Homer Hickam, who in 1957 bucked the wishes of his family and others in small town West Virginia to aspire to a career in space exploration rather than his father's life in the coal mines. Chris Cooper ("Lone Star") plays the dad, Natalie Canerday ("Sling Blade") plays Homer's mom and Laura Dern is a caring teacher. Inspired by the sight of Sputnik racing across the night sky, Homer begins building home-made rockets, writing to Werner Von Braun and defying his father, who wants him to give up such foolishness and focus on a real working-man's career. A rewarding family drama that should be your must-see list, whether you have kids or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best overlooked movies of '99....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening of shots of October Sky, I knew that I was going to like this film. However, I did not know that I was going to love this film. In a year with stupid and ugly teen flicks that can only give us cheap jokes, October Sky stood out from the rest. Unfortunately, I did not get to see it in the theater because of commitments. Now I wish I had.October Sky is the true story of Homer Hickam (portrayed by Jake Gyllenhall) who dreams of leaving the dying mining town of Coalwood and doing something other than mining like his father. His father, John (portrayed by Chris Cooper) does not take kindly to this. His father spent all of his life working the mines, and as the movie opens, that life is crumbling around him. Homer is given inspiration when he sees Sputnik orbit over his town and he ends up wanting to become a rocket engineer. He gets a lot of support from his friends, mother, and teacher (played by Laura Dern), but almost no support from his father, who thinks he should take his place in the mines. Homer studies hard to reach his dream, but the pull of his father is strong. Later, he must learn that he must do what he wants to do..The acting in October Sky is top notch. The cast is mostly unknown actors, which I think helps in a movie like this. Gyllenhall did a good job of portraying Homer, who spent a lot of time with the real Homer, who wrote the book that this movie is based on. Chris Cooper is also excellent as Homer's dad, who struggles to keep the life he had for so long. The rest of the cast is strong, and they grow on you.This is a movie with almost no special effects. It has no crude dialogue and it retains old-fashioned values. Those reasons may be a reason why this movie was overlooked by moviegoers. They do not know what they are missing. This movie gets a good emotional response from its viewers without stooping to the cringing level of tearjerker. This movie does not become a tearjerker because it does not need to sink that low. It is just a good, simple story. It is something I wish more movies could achieve. It really recaptures the excitement I had with space flight and rockets when I was a kid.October Sky is one of my three top movies of '99, along with the original The Matrix, and the good old fashioned fun of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. I encourage anyone who actually has a brain to see this movie. Highly Recommended.***** stars (out of *****).</fullReview>

We were a little farm town caught on the edge of the space race, and every day you could hear and see the planes that have been famous in history X-15, B-52, SR-71, U-2, etc. But we also had the day to day life of going to school and work around the house in a little town. October Sky is a great depiction of exactly what it was like to have the big world pressing around you, but still be caught up in the little things of a very ordinary life. I was getting goosebumps all through it. Especially when a model rocketry hobby (I did them too) turned into more than just a passing fad.</fullReview>

Everything about this film rings true, from the West Virginia accents to the 1957 era clothes and cars. The acting can't be beat. Everyone is excellent--so good that it is difficult to point to one star.While there are a few well chosen swear words from Homer's coal miner father, that is all that can be said is not family fare. But this is far from a sugar-coated look at life; existence in a mining town is difficult, and the work of coal miners is not stinted in this film. Perseverance, blood, sweat, and tears win out in the end, but it sure wasn't it easy.Go along for the trip; you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

Given: I am a sucker for the story of the unlikely hero, but this movie had merit beyond the sappy exterior (which did work very, very well, by the way). The character development was wonderful, and I felt that it was meshed in properly to a story that had such a heavy amount of plot to get through. Perhaps full explanations for certain relationships and so on were negated, but I felt this was necessary in order to keep the focus on the main theme. I utterly adored this film, and would recommend it to anyone. It was easily among the best five films made during last year's Oscar season. Why the Academy didn't see this is beyond me. Then again, after the Titanic fiasco, those old crows don't surprise me as much with their lack of taste anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a cliche only when it's treated as such. And October Sky prevents these familiar archetypes from going down that route by imbuing them with respect and dignity.There's the class beauty who possesses a genuine interest in rocketry and is just as determined to leave the small town, but does not fully grasp the power she holds over the boy who likes her. There's the housewife who shows how you can hate a person, while maintaining one's love for him. There's the geek who is disliked by others not because of his academic aptitude, but because he lacks the social graces of others--but for him, that's the only way for him to succeed. There's the stuffy principle whose realist attitudes can be swayed when he sees an actual chance of hope being fulfilled. There's the inspirational teacher who is so determined to complete her destiny before it's too late that she walks away from a student in his greatest hour of need. And then there's the hardheaded and apathetic father who demonstrates the possibility that one can be both antagonist and protagonist all at the same time.It's to director Joe Johnston's credit that the film continually rings true when we have seen everything before. Johnston and screenwriter Lewis Colick do not provide any villains in the film because they truly get human behaviour--every questionable deed is given a motivation that allows the audience not to justify it per se, but to at least understand it. Even the abusive, drunken stepfather is included into this description. Such a compassionate view of humanity can hardly be considered a cliche, since it's employed so rarely in cinema.How someone can deride this film on the basis of its supposed cliches, and then prop up Dead Poets' Society, is beyond me. Perhaps Laura Dern could have fleshed out her teacher character more by making a couple celebrity impersonations? I love this movie--the best film of the year thus far. A ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocket to One's Future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is far more subtle than is realized. The father-son scenes simmered with tension throughout, but never reached its peak until the end. The romance is handled simply and humourously, not at all melodramatically in some Romeo and Juliette way. The sibling rivalry never desolves into a brawl (which happens in the book, by the way), but you can feel the lack of closeness between the two boys. The movie uses as much music as any other movie, but when it's used to highlight a sentimental or happy story, it's called sappy. When music is employed to emphasize a scary or dark film, it's not criticized.I thought the scenes were restrained in its sentimentality, up until the final twenty minutes, when it went all out. And Thank Goodness--you had all these different emotions inside you, and those final scenes allowed you to release them. That final rocket launch is pure poetry.Why Homer was so enthralled with rocketry: It was a way for him to escape his destiny. Prior to 1957, the space program was never a fabric in the lives of those living in Coalwood. So when Homer saw Sputnick up in the air, he saw a different life, a future he never before realized existed. His attempts to build rockets were a symbolic endeavour to establish his own future--apart from the expectations of the town and of his father. This is a better explanation of wanting to go into space than desiring a chance to see one's dead parent (ugh).The Principle, like the father, is a significant figurehead in the town. He, like the father, realizes the extremely small probability of children doing something with their lives other than mining coal. Thus, he is not going to be as supportive of the Rocketboys as, say, Miss Reilly. When the Principle comes to realize the abilities of the boys, he becomes just as supportive as Miss Reilly. To me, this potentially one-dimensional character becomes fully human by the end of the movie.And Quentin continued to be ridiculed after Homer befriended him. Roy Lee continued to make fun of him, as did the other students (remember the drawing on the blackboard?). Heck, some of the adults had trouble understanding the boy! O'Dell seemed to like him though. But Quentin was still considered a geek. As Homer said, "It doesn't matter if you live in the White House, they still think you're weird!" A great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strangely affecting and penetrating, if sappy, film adapted from Homer Hickham jr.'s "Rocket Boys", about a group of friends in a coal mining town who, inspired by the Russian satellite Sputnik, started small and build up model rockets which could get them the colege scholarships they could not hope to get for football but which would give them a ticket away from the nightmarishly dead-end mining town of Coalwood. The subplot of workaholic, goodhearted but gruff father and slightly neurotic mother is not as interesting as watching the perfectly innocent, angelic Jake Gyllenhaal take the reality of the coal mines head-on. Wonderful</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent portrayal of a lost segment of society.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>October Sky is an excellent example of how movies can recreate a world which is virtually extinct. The pre-machinery days of coal mining in West Virginia are explored here through the eyes of a boy who dares to dream of a life beyond the coalfields.This movie succeeds on many levels, and most of them have been noted in reviews. But its greatest accomplishment is the evocation of the community and lives of a people who have other wise been written out of American history.While the U.S. was booming in the post-war, places like this small town of Coalwood, West Virginia were stoking the fires of the American dream. Required to contribute, but refused a piece of the great growth, these families are very much cognizant of their designation in society. This film deftly shows us Homer Hickham's painful self-awareness as he tries to show colors to a people relegated to dreaming in black in white.However, this is not a film about drudgery or the downtrodden. It is one about a town that was willing to believe in its youth, and it provides a valuable lesson for today's "television-as-babysitter" world.There are elements of Hickham's book which would have fit nicely within this film's framework. The value placed on high school football over academics is but one such element, and would have helped to explain the community's mentality a little more clearly.But that is nitpicking, for this is the best of all kinds of movies: It is one which respects it subject matter, its characters, and how their lives fit in the small frame as well as the big picture. Kudos to screenwriter Lewis Colick for appreciating Hickam's humor and the dignity of the town's citizenry. And bravo to director Joe Johnston for instilling this talented cast with a sense of esteem. The collaborative effort of all involved in this film make it one for the time capsule. It reminds us who we were, how we got to where we are now, and eventually where we are going. This film joins Charles Laughton's "Night of the Hunter" and John Sayle's "Matewan" as accurate portrayals of West Virginia and its denizens. Without condescension or unqualified judgment, Johnston joins these directors in celebrating a people who are often dismissed as insignificant cogs, but in reality they are the engines who create a prosperity of which they are never allowed to partake.A thought to ponder as in this movie we watch Sputnik streak across the "October Sky."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but as predictable as any other good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, October Sky is worth seeing. I'd give my take on the good points of this movie (of which there are many) but everyone else has already done this. So I'll tell you what I didn't like.It seems to me as if the director/writer tried to make every moment soak with emotion and sentiment. This might be good, but it also makes it a little sappy and terribly predictable. At one point, I predicated word for word what the next lines were going to be. That's pretty bad.In fact, October Sky is so busy trying to be inspiring that it acts like we already know the story. For example, why does Homer all of the sudden like rockets? Ok, so he saw Sputnik float across the sky. But so did everyone else. We never really find out exactly what his passion is with the sky. He looks up at space only three times in the entire movie. Anytime we have as dedicated and committed a character as Homer, we need to know why he is as dedicated and committed(Contact does a fantastic job of this).Other questions: why is the principal so biased against Homer's rocketry? No one else in the town, save Homer's dad, is. And for some reason, after Homer sits down with Quentin, Quentin becomes everyone's best friend. Why? Homer isn't THAT cool in school.October Sky is a great family movie for families. It's nice to see brains triumph over brawn. But I really wish they would've spent more time on the lure and the magic of space. Otherwise, rocketry might as well have been bridge building or car building.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw October Sky, I realized how great the movie was. The movie was very entertaining and based on a true story and there was also a book about it. Laura Dern and the other actors did a great job. The story brings you to Coalwood, West Virginia where Homer sees Sputnik and wants to make rockets, but his dad doesn't approve of it. He quickly meets friends and they have a few malfunctioning problems on the rockets but try hard to get the materials they need and are also influenced by Miss Riley a science teacher at their school. A great movie for all ages and not the least bit boring!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie carried me back to West Virginia.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I awaited the release of 'October Sky' with great anticipation. I had heard a talk show interview with Homer Hickam back in March. I was not disappointed by Hollywood's remake of Homer's life.I grew up partly in the West Virginia coal-mining town of Shinnston and partly in Indianapolis, so it's not a surprise that 'October Sky' was a true nostalgic trip for me. Everything from the trains and cars to the surrounding hills of Coalwood look familiar to me. Not only that, my uncle worked in a mine, and my grandfather was a station master. One of my favorite pasttimes was watching the B&amp;O coal trains thunder down the tracks next to the river.For me, 'October Sky' ranks up there with 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and 'It's a Wonderful Life.' After viewing most movies, I come away feeling no different (or even empty). 'October Sky' helped me listen to my emotions and feel fulfilled spiritually as I exited the theater.Two other heroes hail from the great state of West Virginia: my own father, and Chuck Yeager, the first man to break the sound barrier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best family film in recent times to be released.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As most everyone else has commented on, this film is one of the best family films that has been put out in recent years. Unlike other films that have been directed towards the family, this one is not filled with profanity and vulgarity to get a laugh. It uses everyday events that, when looked back upon, gets a chuckle out of you.The one thing that I noticed was that Homer didn't have strong math skills until his desire to build rockets entered his life. It was that one thing that piqued his interest and gave math meaning.Homer also had character. When the chips were down and the family was in trouble because his father had been injured in a mine accident, he stepped in. He could have allowed his brother to drop out of school and work in the mine because he was the oldest and stronger than his younger brother. But, because he had already been awarded a football scholarship, Homer wouldn't see it. Homer was the one with the least at stake to work in the mine and support the family.As I said, I think that this is one of the best Family films to be put out in a long time. I told my wife, after seeing the film last night, that I want to purchase a copy of the video when it comes out.</fullReview>

Nicely done all around.One dissenting critic wrote that only Republicans and fans of Norman Rockwell will like this film. Since I am a Republican and a fan of Rockwell, I am biased.

		<fullReview>A simple story told exceptionally well. Great, great movie.The main criticisms I have read in regards to the movie have been its excessive use of cliches, its predictability, and its sentimentality. However, I think all of them are unwarranted. First off, it's a cliche only when it's handled as such. I don't think any of the elements in the film (particularly the father played so well by Chris Cooper, who deserves an Oscar dammit!) were done in a cliche way. As for it being predictable, it's a true story--I don't know how one could avoid not being predictable. Anyways, predictability in of itself is hardly bad. If it is, then no one should ever see a movie for the second time, since we know what's going to happen. Lastly, people seem to confuse emotionality with sentimentality. Just because people may cry in a movie, it doesn't make the film sentimental. One of the great things about October Sky is its lack of excess fat--this is one lean, mean movie, clocking in at one hour and forty minutes, although the film is very much an epic. This is in contrast to other "sentimental" films--like Good Will Hunting, Patch Adams, As Good As It Gets, Titanic (although I love Titanic too)--that go well beyond the two hour limit with little of the story elements that October Sky crams in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie "October Sky" takes place in a coal mining community at the time the Soviet Union launches Sputnik, the first artificial earth satellite, in October 1957. There is excellent interaction among the three main characters: Homer Hickam, the student who develops an interest in model rocketry, John Hickam the father and coal mine supervisor who want his son working in the mine, and Miss Riley the teacher who realizes and encourages Homer's pursuit of science. The movie is filled with challenges and "lofty" goals and expectations with moments and sadness and grief just like real life. This is a "definite must see" film for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While not being as great as Shawshank Redemption, it does have the same feel to it- being emotional, uplifting, and inspiring. It also is continuing the recent trend of family-friendly movies which are actually good (better than a lot of the trash-mouthed sex-laced flicks that are pushed on us these days). The father-son relationship is very well done. While the father seems hard, calloused and completely devoid of any feelings for his son, he does love his son and wants what the best for him. This movie will probably be a slow burner - even a month after its release, it's slowly gaining word of mouth and selling out theaters. Go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First great movie of 1999</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OCTOBER SKY ****1/2 (out of 5 Stars) Starring-Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper, Laura Dern and Chris Owen; Director-Joe JohnstonEveryone I talked to loved Patch Adams, and yet the critics completely lambasted it. Here is a movie that I'm sure the movie-going public and professional critics can agree on. They're saying that October Sky is the first great movie of 1999, and they're right.This is the true story of Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), a young boy in a small West Virginia coal mining town who is obsessed with building a working rocket. His influence is the Russian satellite Sputnik, a landmark achievement that he sees pass, consequently, in the October night sky. His father (played by Chris Cooper), driven by generations of coal miners in the family, views Homer's rocket chemistry as nonsensical and wants him to follow in his footsteps. The only support Homer gets is from his friends and his teacher, Miss Riley (Laura Dern), who eagerly assists him as his dream unravels.Joe Johnston manages to press all the right buttons that a director possibly could, turning this basic formula movie into an uplifting, heartwarming piece of modern day entertainment. It's absolutely no surprise that the movie is produced by the same people as Field of Dreams. It's that good.October Sky could have easily failed if everything didn't click appropriately. The first mission was to get a believable actor to play Homer, the young real-life hero who now works at NASA. This is where the filmmakers struck gold. In casting newcomer Jake Gyllenhaal as the teenager brave enough to follow his dream, Johnston made the best decision of his career. Young Gyllenhaal is a sensational find, and the movie simply glows whenever he's on camera. This puts everything to rest, because he's in nearly every scene in the film.Another wise move was to put Homer's rocky relationship with his father ahead of even its main story. Cooper has a familiar role and speaks familiar dialogue, but his situation is so believable that all signs of deja vu are quickly pushed aside. Laura Dern is also playing somewhat of a stock character. Her role may be the one weak spot the film has, but in the same sense she performs very well with the material she's given. Everyone involved deserves a pat on the back for making this movie.There's truly never an uninvolving moment in this two-hour gem, which has far more than the designated amount of laughs and smiles needed to register. If you're looking for something entertaining, you couldn't do much better than seeing this. October Sky is the best movie Hollywood has presented so far this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>October Sky is a movie not to be missed. It has all of the elements that make it a great film. A great performance from Jake Gyllenhaal who plays Homer Hickam, a boy growing up in a poor coal mining town in Tennessee in the late 1950s. The boy is inspired by the launching of the Russian Sputnik in October of 1957 and decides, with encouragement from his teacher, played by Laura Dern, to go after his dream of working on rockets in the space program. Homer's father, played by Chris Cooper, is sure that both of his sons should work the coal mines as he did. The whole movie centers around his high school years and how he slowly realizes his dreams of going to college and becoming one of this countries most capable rocket scientists. The fine direction of Joe Johnston must be mentioned. You will also enjoy the score in the background of the late 50s rock 'n roll tunes. You will laugh and you will cry. The story is true. Please don't miss October Sky.</fullReview>

I would be not be telling the truth if I said "October Sky" was not slow-moving at times. But that didn't matter. This movie is filled with so much genuine emotion, and Homer's struggles with his father really hit close to home.It's a true sign of a good movie when the audience actually claps and does not leave during the credits. This movie got me all choked up, and it made me cry! Yes, I'm a guy, and yes, I cried for this movie. I'm not even sure what I was crying FOR. The movie is not EXTREMELY sad, but it's just such a mass of emotions, I didn't know what to do with them. It actually hit me the most AFTER the movie, during the credits. Everything sort of sunk in at once and it just got to me. I didn't want to walk out and have people see me!If a movie moves me to laughter, moves me to tears, moves me to whatever -- then it has done what I wanted it to do.

		<fullReview>Rating: 3 StarsAt the conclusion of this movie I dusted myself for fingerprints. The director's fingerprints were found all over me. I feel violated, manipulated, and you know what? It felt pretty good. This was a well crafted, entertaining, and inspiring film.The story opens with the old, "Based on a true story" routine. They should at least follow it up with percentages. Is it 10% true? 20%?, 80%? For crying out loud, how true is it?October Sky takes place in a dreary and dying coal-mining town. It's 1957, in a town named Cattlewood, West Virginia. The inspiration for this film is from a moment in history.On October 4th, 1957 the town of Cattlewood's eyes were fixated on the night sky. We see a single point of light that looks like a traveling star moving across space, as the other stars remain stationary. It is the Russian satellite, Sputnik.Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), a high school student realizes, after witnessing the historical event, that his goal in life is to build rockets. He has to overcome the standard movie obstacles:1)The angry hardened father who is the coalmine supervisor.2)The police that wrongfully accuse him of causing a major forest fire from one of his test rockets.3)Forced to drop out of school to work in the mines, etc. ("I'll be Back")4)The principal (Chris Ellis) is against me.5)Family dilemmas: Mother support = yes (Natalie Canerday), School teacher inspiration = yes (Laura Dern), Father support = no (Chris Cooper), Older brother assistance = no (Scott Thomas), Fellow students and town = no then yes (Remaining cast), Total = ?Miss Riley (Laura Dern) successfully convinces Homer and his three friends that they should enter their rocket into the National Science fair. This would be their ticket out of the town and on to a successful career as brain surgeons, I mean, rocket scientists. Sound familiar?The performances were top notch and it was visually attractive. In spite of the manipulation and predictability, this really was a good movie and well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie Ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best movie I have seen in years. I will be shocked if it's not up for some academy awards. It's been a long time since hollywood have come out with a movie of this caliber. It's also great to see that a great movie can be made for 25 million or under. Almost all of the action flicks that come out now all seem to have the same things in them, and that is guns, explosions,&amp; car chases. It was so good to finally see a movie without that content in it. My hat goes off to all of the people who made this amazing film. You all deserve a big pat on the back,for a job well done. A must see!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is refreshing to see a movie that is not filled with unnecessary violence and foul language. This is an excellent story. The use of props makes you feel you are really in the coal mine towns of the fifties.The tension of the boy's asperations against the fathers beliefs in his abilities really helps make the movie. I think most boys can relate to this. I had a supporting father but sometimes was still very unsure of his belief in my abilities. I think this was mainly because he didn't know how to express it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess the first thing I would say about this film is that it really brought me back to my own childhood as I watched the plot unravel in the theatre. I grew up in the sixties and seventies, in Virginia, but I remember going to West VA in the sixties and the feel that the place had (the poverty, the rusted old cars in the woods, etc.). I could relate to Homer Hickam, Jr. because I used to launch and design model rockets as a kid and in high school one of my idols was Mr. von Braun. I also liked the acting of Mr. Cooper as the father--but I kept expecting him to reach out and hit his son and was surprised when he never did. The home movie clips at the end of the film were excellent! I am now going to go out and read the book "Rocket Boys." My only gripes are minor: Why was the teacher's illness sort of casually tossed into the film (or edited down)? I felt more could have been explained here. Also: I was not alive in the fifties, but from what I know of the region (Southern West VA), it seems the soundtrack could have included more hillbilly music, more country/western in it. I know kids had AM radios that would pick up powerful signals at night back then from far away stations (like in Chicago or Buffalo) that would play more R&amp;B and Rock 'n roll, but leaving out all of the country or gospel or hillbilly music took away some of the regional feel in the film. For instance, you could have included George Jones' song "White Lightning" for the scene where the boys get the alcohol from the guy with the still. Or some Patsy Cline could have been mixed in, along with the Elvis and Buddy Holly. These are minor gripes though. The film was very very powerful and I am recommending it to all of my friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful movie about a young man with a dream. I don't know about everyone else, but it reminded me of the dreams I had when I was kid growing up. I lamented that I didn't have the same persistence and drive that he had.It also reminded me of other movies about a person or persons following their dream against tremendous odds. I gave each of these movies a 9 also: Rocky, Rudy &amp; Hoosiers - all sports movies. Another similar movie was Tucker: A Man And His Dreams. The only problem with it was that it had an unhappy ending.The wonderful thing about October Sky was that it was emotionally uplifting unlike very few films even attempt to be. Symbolically, the greatest moments of the film were when his rockets shot straight into the air - the same as our spirits.If you want an outstanding feel-good movie to see, this is it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie expecting to see an engaging movie. I was blown away by the its power in portraying the interpersonal dynamics of a family more meaningfully and more realistically than any movie I have previously seen. Perhaps this movie hit me this hard because I grew up during this very era, in a small town, with a strong but loving father.This movie should be seen by anyone who has had or will have a relationship with a parent or child. I'm serious. This is a movie that parents need to watch once in a while to stay in touch with what parenting can be all about.This movie depicts a father in the multitude of shades in which real fathers exist. He isn't perfect. He makes mistakes. But in the context of this movie, he is so real as to draw you inside the movie screen for the duration of the movie. Every character in the movie shares in this magic.The casting was perfection. The acting was superb. The music is the perfect counterpoint to the drama. The cinematography was exquisite, giving a color movie a feel and tone that I've only seen brought out in black and white films. If this movie speaks to you, and I feel it will to most who see it, regardless of age, you won't watch it... you will live it. You will experience it.This movie is about relationships. Parent to child. Brother to brother. It's about growing up, and finding your own way. It's about the social stratification that occurs in high school. And in the manner of Joseph Campbell, it's about following your bliss.I went to the movies to be entertained, as only a movie can entertain, and left in wonderment at having experienced one of the ten best movies of the decade.</fullReview>

In a world that seems to believe that the audience must be bombarded by special effects to get a point across we find October Sky subtle and fascinating as we look into the real life of Homer Hickam. Homer struggles to overcome the suffocating future that has been laid out for him in a 1950's coal mining town by reaching for the sky with his toy rockets. A drama of intense realism will bring a tear to the eye as Homer descends into the darkness of the coal mines while keeping his eyes ever upward at a disappearing sky. A must see movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better known as Rocket Boys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>October Sky is about about the future. Except that it's a future that we already know. You have probably already heard October Sky is another "Field of Dreams." That's not a fair comparison. Field of Dreams was a fantasy about the past. About remembering. In the last few minutes of movie. Ray's daughter talked about how people will come and "remember what it was like."We already know Homer's future. The trailer shows the space shuttle launching. The story is about following a dream sometimes when it would seem not to make sense to do. Not just because you live in a coal town. Homer is more like Matt Damon in "Good Will Hunting." A "fish out of water" who is struggling to understand a dream that few around him are able to nourish.I think I liked the title "Rocket Boys" better (the name of the book). It's more exciting and says something about the people. But, under any name, October Sky is worth taking a look at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A true and inspiring story about a coal town teen who, stubbornly, would not give up his dream of becoming a rocket scientist.I rated this film a "10", not because it's a flawless film -- it isn't (main criticism being that it's predictable). But it has a clear storyline, excellent acting, a "moral", and some heart-rending realization and growth on the part of the characters. What impressed me the most was that this was truly a film for an entire family that was not silly, or reliant on special effects. It appeals on multiple levels.After a day or two thinking about this movie, I realized, what more can you expect from a motion picture? Not much--which explains the 10 rating.I'm predicting this will be the sleeper hit of 1999.</fullReview>

The circumstances the characters faced seemed impossible and all too believable, which made the movie gripping. In other words, it rang true.

		<fullReview>Growing up in the coal fields of Virginia/West Virginia I was extremely impressed to see a movie that actually took the reality of life and put it on the big screen. There were no big special effects, none of the "hollywood glitz and glamour" or any of those action sequences that leave you wondering what just happened. The mines sequences were very realistic, and even the death of a miner was portrayed with the perfection. It was a straight forward, wonderful movie about the life of four young boys growing up in West Virginia. The only problem I had with the film was the casting of Miss Riley as a glamorous blond, instead of the pretty brunette that she was (just look at her when they show the home videos at the end). Of course, that only bothers me because she's my cousin, no one else in the world really cares. Overall, the movie was one of those films that drew me in. It left me wanting more. Although it was under two hours, the movie is well worth the six dollars you would have to pay to see it. Go out of your way for this one. It's probably the best of '99 so far. And don't forget to read the book...it should also be a hit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moving and inspirational piece of film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few times a year a truly inspirational film comes out, this is the first of '99. It follows the true story of Homer Hickam (Gyllenhaal) and his obsession with building rockets to go out into space. His infatuation pulls in his friends and a nerdy social outcast (Owen) and together they all get the nickname "The Rocket Boys". Through all the turmoil of trying to break out of their small coal mining hometown these boys prevail. One of the greatest obstacles that Homer had to go through was the views of his own father (Cooper) who thought what Homer wanted was only pipe dreams and that coal mining was going to be his life. This is a true story of overcoming opposition by all this world's forces.Gyllenhaal does a terrific job as our hometown hero. His youthful determination and strength plows through the screen and into your heart. The reality of Homer just makes his efforts in this movie more of an homage to the real man than just another role. Gyllenhaal treats it with the perfect amount of dignity and pride. The other impressive performace came from Cooper in his portrayal of Homer's coal mining father. The sheer hardness of his attitude towards Homer and his dreams matched the very coal he pulled from beneath the ground. He did show some admirable qualities throughout the film which gave the audience just enough reason to not write him off entirely as an uncaring and ignorant hick. Then at the end he opens his character up to the true depth of the love between a father and son.The direction and cinematography of this picture was beautiful throughout in not only its scenes of Homer's exciting rockets but also in the bleakness of life in a coal mining town. Johnston truly captured the harsh and heavy nature of mining life and the effects that it can have on those people and their families. This detailed very well the hard sacrifices that some people have to make in life just to survive.Recommendation: If you are looking for inspiration then look here. You can walk of this movie feeling that whatever it is that you want to do with your life can be done. The fact that this is a true story shows that your own circumstances could be far worse and that anyone can follow their dreams to the end. This type of motivational power hasn't been seen since Rocky.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Homer is a teenager growing up in Coalwood, West Virginia, in the shadow of the mines, and of his older brother, the football star. A football scholarship is the only way out of this company town, and it just ain't gonna happen for Homer.Then, Homer watches Sputnik streak across the sky, and suddenly, he's obsessed with launching a rocket of his own.In the process he has to defy peer pressure and make friends with the school nerd, and confront his father who tries to squash his dream at every turn. But when an inspiring teacher, Miss Riley (Laura Dern), points out that a winning science fair project can mean a scholarship and a ticket out of the mines, a fire is lit inside young Homer that ultimately lights up the entire town.The entire cast of this movie is amazing, but none more so than young Jake Gyllenhaal portaying Homer Hickam. According to the IMDB trivia, Mr. Gyllenhall just graduated high school himself, so is exactly the age that Homer would have been when these events took place. Yet Mr. Gyllenhall shows an amazing range as an actor, portraying, in turn, youthful enthusiasm and idealism, disillusionment, passon, rage, deep affection and respect, jealousy, and in the end, wisdom.</fullReview>

It is a strangely warm, thoughtful, caring movie about the trials and tribulations of growing up among the vast bluecollar yesteryear of the late 1950's and of a few young men who dream and strive for a better life. All of the actors and actresses here deserve a round of recognition. Bravo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just goes to prove that most successes are made up of a whole bunch of major failures till one gets the results one wants!PLOT SUMMARY: A group of high school kids in a mining town get interested in making and launching home-make rockets and get into all sorts of trouble.Many of you might not have been around in 1957. I remember early one October morning when I was almost 10 yrs. old about 3:00 A.M., I heard on the TV about Sputnik and it really did come as a shock to me and everyone else. Looking back the shock was not the Russians' success but, rather that we really didn't even know we were in a race (which we just lost!)But, in the end, some 12 yrs. later, after many, many failures, the race finally ended in an American manned landing on the moon in the Sea of Tranquillity, July 20, 1969.There is one small note though: Bigger, faster, further, farther is great until one day we realize we've forgotten where we started from ....Rating: 10 stars out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"October Sky" derives its title from the crisp, clear night sky often viewed over West Virginia in the waining months of any year. This particular "October Sky" sets the time of the movie as coinciding with the launch of Sputnik -- the first orbiting satellite, which was launched by the Soviet Union. Because of the technology of the time, the satellite orbited the earth and passed over the United States about every 19-hours. It could be seen with the naked eye on a clear night, and the wonder of man putting an object into space is keenly opposed to the fear such a device struck in the minds of many citizens during the Cold War.Based on a true story, "October Sky" also chronicles the diametrically opposed views of life -- the wonder of a young man who sees his future involved in the vastness of space and the uncertainty thereof, and the concern of his father for his son's future -- determined that it will be solidly anchored in the constant of coal mining (confined space and underground).This film celebrates the wonderment of dreaming and the freedom to both pursue and succeed at that dream. It is an impremartyr of the human spirit in a world free to overcome restraints. When you leave the theater, the viewer may feel pleasant contentment that nice guys CAN win.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw a sneak preview on Feb. 14, expecting a great movie, because of the critical raves. That's usually a bad thing to do going into a movie, but in this case, it didn't take from the movie at all. It was a good film, but not great. Sort of a cross between Stand By Me and any film about defying parents (take your pick). I can't say the acting was anything great, but the story was relatively captivating and the screenplay was good. Don't go out of your way to catch this movie, but see it if you have the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie at a preview on Feb. 7 after reading the book. It was quite faithful to the book. There were a handful of minor differences, and one fairly major difference, but I think they helped to get the story across in the limited time. Since the book lacked any photographs, except an obscured one on the dust jacket, the photos and home movie clips at the end of the movie of the real people were an interesting addition, and they added a lot to the point that this was a true story. I was somewhat surprised at how emotional the movie was for me. I built a lot of model rockets in the '60s and '70s, and the day after seeing the movie I had a good talk with my dad about those times.</fullReview>

I read the book "Rocket Boys" on which the film is based, and while certain liberties were taken the movie is largely faithful to the events and spirit of the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw a sneak preview of this film. It officially isn't released until next week. There isn't one thing in this movie that was done poorly. The actors don't try to be good actors, they just play it realistically. Everyone is very convincing. The story is excellent, and it's based on a true story. The soundtrack needs Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire". When you see the movie, you'll understand why. Really, the song fits in two ways. The music is good, but not too strong. A lot of movies try to cram emotions down your throat with music, but this one doesn't. It also resists the temptation to put too many peices of music from the period in. The music they do use from the time is accurate. Everyone in the audience loved this movie. I didn't hear anyone saying "It could've been better" as they left the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific little gem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually a great movie consists of big epics (i.e. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) or big director's with a big budget (TITANIC). Then sometimes you get those special little movies, the great movies because they have a good story and good acting. "October Sky" falls in the latter, it's a terrific movie that doesn't need effects or the works ofa famous director to make it a great movie. Instead the story and characters make it a unique movie, about four young boys who live in a mining town in West Virgina during the launch of Sputnik. One of the boys, Homer (Jake Gyllenhaal), dreams of making a rocket ship that can one day, go into space. His father, played by Chris Cooper (my favorite character actor along with Sam Neil) disapproves of this idea and wants young Homer to take over the coal mines when he's older. Following his heart instead of his dad, Homer recruits his two friends, and the school nerd, to build and test rockets. To their surprise, the entire town becomes excited about their project. This is a movie that explains to the viewer that one should follow their heart for what they want to do. This movie is emotional, both good and bad. I'm sure it won't win any Oscars next year, but it will be remembered as a great movie (like THE NATURAL). A very entertaining film that is great for the family!</fullReview>

However only "jocks" have gotten a scholarship and the four boys and their family's are to poor to send them to college. This Story centers on a young man named Homer who gets this dream started by building a toy rocket, after seeing Soviet satellite, Sputnik.

		<fullReview>I loved this movie completely. Jake Gyllenhaal, before his breakthrough role in Donnie Darko, stars as Homer Hickam, a teenager who in October 1957 decides to build a rocket. This is based on a true story, written by Homer Hickam, of how four friends start to build a rocket in the small city Coalwood, West Virginia, and how they inspire the people of that town by doing the impossible. Except from the story of the building of rockets and how people are both happy and unhappy of it, it is the story of a father and son relation, how a teenager really fights for his dreams, no matter what his father thinks or wants. A beautifully storytelling movie with all glorious moments... that it is a true story makes it more believable, but at the same time also unbelievable.Highly recommended, not only for the fine story but also for fine characters, great actors and a great photography. Forget visual effects - this is a great drama movie with a great story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshing, albeit a little twee</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>October Sky is one of those films which belong to the group with such titles as Billy Elliot, with the difference being that October Sky is more or less based on the real life of a man who is now an expert on rocketry and works in NASA. Young Homer, the same as young Billy, grows up in a coal-mining area, his father works in the colliery, but the youngster is dead set on not having to dig out his living a kilometre or so underground. Billy wanted to be a ballet dancer; Homer was inspired on building rockets after seeing the first Sputnik fly across Virginia skies. Nicely filmed, with Isham again doing the musical honours satisfactorily, the setting of the film in the late fifties of the last century is magnificent with exactly right automobiles and clothing and the interiors of houses, as well as, I must add, correct concept of people's mentalities of the times.This is a film to admire and enjoy, even though you may frequently find yourself thinking you wrote the script, as the chain of events is rather foreseeable, and thus do not expect surprises. However, it is enjoyable watching films with a story to tell without a load of violence and sordid sex as excuses for putting anything and everything on celluloid. One does get tired of such trash, though it would seem that Hollywood does not.October Sky is refreshing and sober, though faulting in rather tweeish principles, the same as Billy Elliot at times; but in both cases the result is an entertaining and clean couple of hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie in Search of Itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had an opportunity to watch the DVD of October Sky (Universal, 1999) and came away somewhat disappointed. I should note that I avoided the movie when it was out in general release for many of the same reasons I waited until now to review it. From all reports, the story of a 1957 West Virginia high school students experimenting with rockets that subsequently changed their lives seemed laden with the heavy hand of "individual triumphs over group expectations" cliche common to these coming-of-age genre pictures.Based on a true story, the film stars Jake Gyllenhaal as the high school student Homer Hickham, an actual person who currently works at NASA on the space shuttle program. We join the film as the Soviet Union has just launched Sputnik and the radio and television reports are buzzing about the meaning of this technological triumph.At first, Homer and most of his classmates are seemingly non-plussed about the event. This apparent reason for the lack of interest is that they are all trapped in a coal mining town, with all the property (including the school and everyone's homes) owned by an unnamed conglomerate. Mentions of the "company store" abound throughout the movie. The "company" is represented by Homer's father (Chris Cooper), who manages the local mining operation.West Virginia is painted as a place of unremitting gloom. The weather alternates between heavy downpours of rain to overcast conditions. One who has never been to West Virginia would be surprised to learn that the state enjoys occasional sunny days. It is notable the only clear sky that appears comes during the one night when Homer glances above to see Sputnik flying overhead. All of a sudden, Homer's future life course is set.The supposedly transforming experience of seeing Sputnik overhead does not ring genuine and the credibility problem for the movie begins here. Although depicted as a 1950s teenager, Gyllenhaal initially comes across as a prototypical 1990s slacker. As his teacher Miss Reilly (portrayed by Laura Dern) notes, Homer doesn't even like math.Homer soon starts the arduous process of putting together a winning entry for the area science fair. In doing so, Homer taps two of his friends, played by William Lee Scott and Chad Lindberg and he then befriends the class nerd, played by Chris Owen. Thus the "Rocket Boys" (the name of the book the movie adapts) are set. The boys then enlist the covert assistance of a company welder and a black miner with knowledge of metallurgy (surprisingly, the film does not touch on the race of the miner despite the era) in the process of constructing their craft.Laura Dern appears as Miss Reilly, the teacher who inspired the real Homer Hickham to follow his dreams. As the teacher, Dern's performance is etched with firm earnestness. She wants these boys to dream despite their circumstances and, for the most part, she manages to overcome the character's earnest nobility and provide a credible performance.The movie proceeds headlong into a series of setbacks and hairpin plot turns. Events drive the movie forward, not the characters. The themes are persistently the same; opposition to the endeavor emerges from the authority figures and then being countered by the determined efforts of the Rocket Boys and their allies. A scene at the national science fare where the demonstration materials are stolen is typical. The theft leads to a plea to the community that resolves a United Mine Worker's strike which in turn leads to the replacement materials being delivered right in the nick of time. It's one of the "oh, come on" moments that appear frequently in the film.As the lead, Jake Gyllenhaal spends most of his time trying to find his rhythm. Chris Owen as the standard-issue school nerd doesn't manage to rise above the stereotype. Rocket Boy Chad Lindberg manages to blend so effectively into the background that it's difficult to remember his performance.There are some good performances that rise above the material. In addition to the above mentioned Laura Dern, Chris Cooper, portraying the tough father with a heart of gold, becomes the soul of the movie. Natalie Canerday as Homer's mom likewise grabs the viewer's attention with the quiet strength of her character as well as the clarity of her voice. Rocket Boy William Lee Scott (currently featured in "Pearl Harbor") stands out from his group through a very subtle and stoic performance. A scene with Cooper and Scott and their encounter with the boy's abusive stepfather is brief, but is perhaps the most memorable part of the movie.The heavy-handedness of the period costumes, props and music (played loudly at every turn) is unrelenting. These items can be effective to set an appropriate time and place, but they instead overwhelm the momentum whenever they appear."October Sky" is in large part a roller coaster ride of events. While the film attempts to be a demonstration of the nobility of youthful spirit, it's focus on incidents and repetition of themes leave the characters with little room to grow and develop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not much original in this story of a high school kid who yearns to send rockets into the sky rather than work in the local coal mine. It's all pretty formulaic. But formulas are in such common use because they are dependable. Who would argue with A squared plus B squared equals C squared? They get the job done.Jake Gyllenhaal is the obsessed kid. He looks ordinary and is fascinated by an arcane subject like rocket design in a way that only a teen ager can be. He lives in a small West Virginia town where everything revolves around the coal mine which, like the town itself, is moribund. He has his mother's love, of course, but his dad (Chris Cooper) grew up in the mines and is now a kind of manager, and Gyllenhaal's aspirations occasion some irritation in his father. Cooper wants him to come down in the mines like everybody else instead of fooling around with this nonsense and worshiping Werner von Braun. Cooper makes a particular point of never attending any of Gyllenhaal's experimental launches. Gyllenhaal's teacher (Laura Dern) recognizes that the kid is a wizard and supports him.At first the others in town treat him and his interest in rocketry as half loony. One by one, though, the kid draws others into his sphere. A pimply nerd and a handful of other alienated students join him in building rockets that at first explode if anyone looks cross-eyed at them. Eventually others, including a black machinist at the mine, help him build rockets that act, not like inverted pendulums, but like rockets. There are, naturally, some obstacles along the way. His father's constant belittling of him, for one thing. And then there's the matter of finding money for materials, which leads to one or two comic incidents. Then his father is injured in a mine accident for which the company won't pay, so Gyllenhaal must drop out of school and go down and work in the mines for a while, accompanied by plangent violins. But in the end, he is sent to the Science Fair in Indianapolis, where he displays his rockets and their components. The score swells into an orgasmic triumph. (It's the International Geophysical Year of 1958.) Does Gyllenhaal win first prize? No power on earth could force an answer from me. Gyllenhaal returns to Coal Community, WVA, where he sets off one last big celebratory rocket. The entire town of Coaldorf has attended, everyone bursting with pride. Gyllenhaal dedicates this rocket to everyone who has helped him in his travails, listing them one by one, before finally reaching "my father" -- and, lo, there is Dad edging his way to the front of the crowd! Final shot: the space shuttle being launched from Cape Canaveral. It's got every cliché in the book but it's kind of sweet too. None of the performances stands out, although Chris Cooper does a good job with the role of the all-but-fossilized, but gentle, father. He's a pretty good actor.Of all the films about adolescents finding their own voice, this one is about average, but it's suitable for family viewing. The kids will understand it as well as the adults, and although their minds may not be exalted, neither will they be turned into suppurating boils. The location shooting is good, too, leading us to understand why Gyllenhaal would like to leave Coalton-sur-mont behind him.</fullReview>

Joe doesn't seem to make bad movies (although I did have some problems with "Jumanji", but not much), can't wait to see his next work!I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that is interested in a drama about some young men trying to fulfill their dreams.

		<fullReview>In October Sky the life of Homer Hickam and his friends (not all characters in the movie were actually Homer's friends) in Coalwood, WV a town that as the name suggests primarily mines coal. During the time that the story takes place the Russians launch Sputnik and Homer suddenly becomes engrossed with rocketry and such. His friends reluctantly help him with doing things with his hobby. Along the way Homer and his friends must overcome people in town who believe they're lunatics and Homer must overcome his gruff father who shows no proud in Homer but centers it on his brother Jim a football star. It is an incredible story about overcoming some fierce odds. Some good acting also helps the film. It was a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vivid reconstruction of a personal triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the many obstacles and personal tragedies along the way, this is an idyllic world carried by nostalgics everywhere. The parents are noble if at times unsupportive, the friends are true and selfless, the teacher lives for your success, and the whole community is focused on your achievements. Hard work IS rewarded. You ARE unselfish, humble, and undeniably deserving of every success.The director skillfully orchestrates an emotionally compelling composition. Most of the acting is understated and inoffensive. Chris Cooper reprises his life role as a courageous but sensitive man pursued by personal demons. Laura Dern is miscast as the supportive teacher. Jake Gyllenhaal soldiers through an uninspired performance. The cinematography and plotting, however, is beyond reproach. Every incident adds to the dramatic intensity and vividness of the picture. Even if you don't buy the enraptured faces at times, the landscape, homes, and workplaces ring true. People do help others out of the goodness of their heart and the film glories in these moments of real personal kindness.If you like Norman Rockwell, are over 50, and were caught up in the space race, see the movie. Check your cynicism at the door for a pleasant escape to a place that feels real, where good and bad are easily defined, and where all the problems are horrific but manageable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wasn't as impressed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, this has all the makings of a crowd-pleaser. Unfortunately, I was not part of that crowd. I was, however, part of a large group of predominantly families at an advance screening. It was, to me, a profoundly above-average family film-- far better than any Disney remake tripe, it was easily digested, with appropriate musical swells, and no surprising plot twists to distract you from the nostalgia. Forgettable for me, but worth watching for those two of you who haven't yet seen Field of Dreams, which had similar themes but was immeasurably more interesting. I must be watching too many Kevin Smith flicks or something, because I was sniggering when some viewers were crying, trying to absorb the uber-sappy dialog without busting up. If you hated Trainspotting, see this the day of its release!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inspirational story, a little slow, but entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>October Sky, the story of Homer Hickum, is a touching, inspirational story that chronicles his life as he and three friends try to build a rocket after being captivated by Sputnik. The movie is set in Coalwood, a mining town where it is predetermined that you are going to be a coal-miner when you grow up unless you are one of the lucky ones who got out on a football scholarship. Miss Riley, Homer's optimistic teacher pushes him along and goes against the principal by "believing in the unlucky ones."This wasn't a spectacular movie, but it was an interesting story and it is a nice change from the high-budget movies. The movie was entertaining for the most part, but I looked down at my watch an hour into the movie and thought that over an hour and a half had passed. Although to me it seemed the movie moved slowly, it was an enjoyable movie and it was fun to watch Homer and his three friends on their quest to build a rocket. It may just be that I see where he is coming from, myself building rockets, but I liked watching as the rockets progressed and became more and more stable. This was a good movie and I enjoyed it and there was some comedy thrown in that added to the overall movie experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>October Sky a bit too high</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this flick as a DVD last night, and in fact immediately wanted to see how well "Homer" would do relative to five years later, in his more mature acting role as "Jack" in Brokeback Mountain.I thought the film was formula for home town USA, especially those not too well educated. It had so many stereotypes that are not there in life. For example the very concerned and dedicated high school teacher.The Dad, who I thought, Chris Cooper. did a fine job as,Homer's father. You almost could hate him, until you see he has a finer and altruistic side. Of Course it wouldn't be formula family entertainment , if Homer and Dad didn't come to a great but, unrealistic and unlikely peace in the end.Was this film a real slice of the life or real people, NO! It was touchy feel-good with those boys raising their launch pad flag, just like the Marines. Could any eye in the house stay dry? There were some stolen pieces from other flicks, the railroad scene from Stand By Me, for example.The over all message, this flick should be credited for is, hold on to your dreams, and attempt to see the good side of your difficult parents.I noted in the passing closing credits all the real supposed little people, who were doomed to mine coal, somehow went to college and became successful beyond the average.I would recommend this movie not for insight into real people, rather to inspire those with dreams, to hold tight and perhaps they will, with work and luck come true someday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Deeper Look at the Important Things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this movie, it had quite a large emotional impact on me. I realize that many people probably didn't notice it very much. I certainly haven't read all the reviews on here, but I understand where they're all coming from.I saw October Sky several years back when I was in high school, between 1999 and 2001. I've always been one of the better students at math and physics and such. Normally, you would think that a movie like this should appeal to me heavily. I've always loved space travel, whether it's Star Trek, or coming up with my own quirky ideas for science fiction and such.If I recall, the movie was shown one afternoon to 20 or 30 students who were involved in many different things, not simply those steeped in chemistry, etc. The idea wasn't to have us focus on the rocketry plot as much as the simple idea of motivation, to help us follow our dreams and reach beyond ourselves and pursue lofty goals.If I had seen the movie a few years earlier, it probably would have hit me fairly hard on that facet. However, by the time I saw it I was already well-directed in my own life. I had a pretty good idea where I was going. No, for me, the impact came much differently.I've skimmed about 80 of the 290 reviews on here and have only found the love story subplot mentioned twice, wherein it was simply referred to as being worthless or useless in the story. I understand where you're coming from. It's too cliché, too alike every other movie out there. But so what? If it's true, it's true. Why doesn't it deserve inclusion?In 1998 I fell in love with a girl named Dorothy. For some time she meant the world to me. Eventually, I realized our relationship wasn't going to work out. She ended up getting married in 2003 to another guy. Nevertheless, October Sky had a strong personal impact on me at the time. "Dorothy" was the name of the girl in the movie that Homer had his crush on. When the first scenes of the two of them came on in the movie, I couldn't help but put myself in Homer's place. If I remember, the room where I watched the movie had the lights out, but all someone would have had to do was look in my direction to see the bright red glow on my face. On the screen, everything seemed to speak to me personally and my own life. At the time I still hoped things between me and my Dorothy could work out. The movie made me consider more and more my own situation. Everything just seemed so parallel. I wondered, in fact, if someone had purposely shown the movie to see how reacted?who knows, God, or a guardian angel, I don't know.So they fired off rockets. Our characters needed to find where one of the stray rockets had gone, so they used trig and scouted out through a forest until they found the thing. Cool stuff. I've always loved electronics, fuels, and all those nifty things. Eventually, Homer achieved his dream, becoming prominent in the aerospace movement. A new girl came along in the meantime. Did she really fill that void left by Dorothy? Who can say?October Sky was a good movie. While I can't downplay the importance of following your dream and achieving your goals, of research and study and sticking with something that's important; while October Sky was a meal on my journey that has helped motivate me to reach my own dreams in writing and doing some of the most important things in my own life, I can't deny that the more important place it held for me was offering me a strange and sad look at a girl that I loved.So, while some of you will undoubtedly continue to call the "minor" love story "trite," "cliché," "not crucial to the main drama," etc, from my own perspective I would call your attention to the likely fact that Homer H. Hickam Jr. included that "sub-plot" for some reason, perhaps because it was important to him and had things not occurred as they did, his life would have been far, far different. Don't completely discount something without taking a deeper look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good message but dull story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>October Sky tells the story of a small town boy who follows his dreams and eventually succeeds at what he dreamt of since his youth. Now, I have seen this film when it first came out and I wasn't very fond of it. I had the chance to re-view it and I remember why I disliked it. It was very boring and dull. Now I know its based on a true story and I understand what that means, but I didn't really like the sorry. It just seemed too boring at many parts, and it was very predictable. The characters were okay but in general not that great. Jake Gyllenhaal's acting was decent as the lead but it was his friends and others whose acting was lacking. This movie is basically about a guy- Homer Hickam (Gyllenhaal) whose has dreams of creating his own rocket because of one he recently sen on television. He eventually creates it and ends up winning in their science fair. Everything was predictable. Also this story was based in the 50's so that's why they all speak like that and the way they wear their clothing. The rockets were nice and all but overall this movie is lacking of excitement and entertainment. Its just not for everyone, and that is clear. Bad movie, don't watch it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The feel-good factor is a bit over-whelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of film to which the tag line 'heart-warming' could be ascribed but mawkish and sentimental could equally apply. It quickly announces itself as 'a true story', in this case that of Homer Hickam, (yup, that's his name), a boy who could just as easily have turned out to be no more than a hillbilly from West Virginia but who, instead, became a 'rocket scientist'. In other words, it's a tale of triumph over adversity. It's well enough made of its kind but the feel-good factor is a bit over-whelming.As Homer, Jake Gyllenhaal is so full of smiling, confident bonhomie you want to slap him, and hard. As his brusque, curt and seemingly unfeeling father, (if it's anything it's a boy and his father story), Chris Cooper redeems the film, giving it an edge beyond the imagination of either the writer or the director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I'm not sure if I've seen the same film as most of you, since everybody seems to have loved it. "October Sky" tells a story about some guys that, including Jake Gyllenhaal's character, plan to build rocket that goes to the sky-- you see, I found the subject so boring that I don't even know how to mention it. Gyllenhall is one of the many Hollywood stars that looks three/four years younger than he really is (was); in this film he looks 15 or 16, but his actually in his late 18.The story is pretty much of all other drama films. Someone has an accident, someone has a dream, a son is reprimanded by his father... nothing particularly new. The film is very light, there are no big performances, scenes or acting; everything is just so average and uninteresting that I lost my attention a lot of times. For instance, the scene where Homer Hickam just plain cheesy; I felt embarrassed for the writers and the directors for such a ridiculous script. I really tried to enjoy this film. Maybe it's just not my type of film-- or maybe it's really really bad...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A contrived Disneyesque feel-good flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"October Sky" has the feel of a purified and contrived Disney movie with the sole purpose of pushing the viewer's emotional buttons. Based on a true but thin story about a high school student who wants to be a rocket engineer and not a coal miner (who wouldn't?), this film is well shot, well acted, and full of implausibilities. For maximum enjoyment, disengage logic before viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You´ve gotta be kidding me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the top 250 ever made? Don´t think so. It wasn´t terrible, though. I spent a rainy Sunday afternoon in Germany with not a lot to do, so I checked out the Pay-Per-View selections, and chose 'October Sky' over 'Tea With Mussolini', which I am still pretty confident was a good idea.We´ve seen this film before, and it was called 'Hoosiers'. Or was it "Rudy" The same themes exist: some backwoods youth or youths overcome adversity and do the un-do-able. The same characters seem to ring in all these movies: an overbearing father that thinks his kid is a dern fool; an inspiring role model and encourager... But it was done much better than this in the aforementioned films "Rudy", and particularly "Hoosiers". "October´s" characters were one dimensional, the dialogue rivalled that of Titanic, and there was not enough detail put into the real rocket-making, in my opinion. (OK, so I am an engineer... we tend to take the fun out of all science-related movies if they are not fully precise.)But please don´t think I hated it. This film would be a perfect one to show to middle school and early high school students. I would have found it inspiring at that age, especially since I was interested in science and enjoyed blowing things up. So show this to your kids, they will probably enjoy it, and it is not something anyone would walk out of, although I found myself accidentally changing the channel a couple of times (remember, it was PPV!) But please don´t think you´re about to see Lawrence of Arabia since it is rated in the top 250!</fullReview>

Although it is well done, the plot is quite simple and the pace slow, definitely not for everyone (me included).

		<fullReview>It is the fault of public majority that movies like this keep getting made whether it's under the name of Seabiscuit, Apollo 13, October Sky, or The Rookie. These movies are as hollow as they are emotional and as vapid in substance as they are in creativity.These films all repeat the same concepts and questions without letting the audience expand on any thoughts. They are one-dimensional. False emotional and sentimentality are a fool's paradise.Overall, skip this. It's amazing how simplicity can infect the most hopeful of scripts. 1.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hopelessly Cliche</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had the right elements to be a good movie, but the plot was so predicable and cliche. As a 15 year old in the 1970's, I was a geeky kid who loved to shoot off model rockets as well. I expected to relate to this movie.Chris Cooper turned in a fine performance as the father who expects his soon to follow him into the coal mines as a career. Chris Owens also turned into a good performance as the son who aspires to be a rocket scientist, not a coal miner.Sadly, this is a very uncreative piece of writing. Every hokey attempt to tug at the heartstrings is attempted in this movie. The secondary characters are either gods or demons, but happen to make 180 degree turns in their characters when it suits the inability of the writers to innovate on the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better when it focuses on science</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When APOLLO 13, which, to me, is still the best movie about the space program ever, came out, Tom Hanks said something which is still instructive. He said the story was so good in of itself there was no need to go Hollywood on it, and I wish director Joe Johnston had taken that to heart with this movie. I read the book this is based on, and like this movie, it's best when it focuses on the science part. It's careful and probing, and it doesn't overwhelm you with jargon talk. And you get to see the many mistakes before the eventual triumph. But the rest of the movie falls a little short. The sentiment was there in the book too, but it wasn't as blunt as it is here. There are too many cliches, and a few changes(like having the teacher being able to see the final rocket launch from her hospital bed; in reality, if memory serves, she had already died). I guess I liked this movie, I just wasn't inspired by it like others were, and like APOLLO 13 inspired me.</fullReview>

It is well made, and away fromspecial effects, violence and dumb patriotism. From this point of view, it is very OK, but really not a great film.

Try watching a movie like "My Left Foot" or "Dead Poets Society" instead. The acting was unmoving and two-dimensional, especially Laura Dern's performance. Chris Cooper pulled in the only semi-believable performance. It's very poor (not to mention boring) when you are able to predict correctly what each actor is going to say to each other during the last 30 minutes. One last thing, I thought it was lame how everyone could see the rocket launch into the sky at the end of the movie (including a conveniently placed window in Laura Dern's hospital room). Save your money folks--it's definitely not worth it, not even on video. 1 out of 10</fullReview>
