		<shortDescription>A fine brew of psychological character and crime story. A-</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott and Nicolas Cage deliver some of their best and most intelligent work in a few years, even if Matchstick Men is not quite either's great contribution for this year in film. What they have done, from Eric Garcia's novel (adapted by The Griffins), come off rather entertaining, if anything else, and boasts much more thought than would usually be attributed to such a Hollywood film. Nicolas Cage, who plays Roy, part anxious/obsessive compulsive, part sly con man, and part father to a daughter he never knew he had, is a main reason to see this movie. His performance is on par with someone like Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets for watch-ability of a truly sad lifestyle, and while Nicholson's performance was and still is funnier and more charming, Cage gets so into his character, the little mannerisms that pop up more often than expected, that we feel for the guy even as his eyes get twitchy and goes over certain spots in his house like a detective. He may be the most believable obsessive compulsive/con man you'll see in a long while. Add then an outgoing, occasionally sneaky daughter (Alison Lohman in a performance that skillfully balances sweetness and irritability, sorrow and playfulness in a teenage girl) to the mix, along with a protégé-cum-partner (a cool Sam Rockwell) who has a love/loathe relationship Roy, and there's the map work for an interesting, if here and there predictable, drama/comedy/crime film. Along with the performances, which are all above average (Cage could be deserved of an Oscar nomination come February, and Lohman could deserve the win possibly), is the visual framework that Scott pushes in each scene. By getting certain camera tricks, and fantastic editing by Dody Dorn (of 'Memento' fame), the viewer can really get into Roy's head even in the smaller scenes, the ones that have little to do with the plot and only to do with the neuroses of Roy (there is even a little touch that I loved when Roy is waiting online early in the film at the supermarket, and the music in the background is an excerpt of the mental hospital music from 'Cuckoo's Nest'). This echoes the style that Scorsese used in Bringing out the Dead, also with Cage, in moving the film to get so into the mood that the story, no matter how intriguing and important, becomes secondary. Which brings me to my own personal beef with the movie, and that is the last fifteen minutes or so. It was clever, up to a point, but as it unfolded, no matter how much I was still emotionally involved with these people, I felt that the twists (I won't reveal them here) undermined a lot of the rest of the film. It will be based on viewer to viewer, but I just thought that it did a little too much to jab at Roy's lifestyle. And yet, when I walked out of the theater, though I wasn't sure I had seen anything spectacular, I didn't feel like I had wasted time and money either. Matchstick Men is witty, sometimes wonderful moviemaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome back, Nick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rather surprising turn for Ridley Scott there - probably the "smallest" film he's ever done, which harks back to Thelma And Louise than to anything else he's done in recent years (Gladiator, G.I Jane, Black Hawk Down, and back to Alien and Blade Runner). We have a very personal, up-close light drama here. Con artist movies have been swarming the theaters lately, but Matchstick Men is far more intelligent and more surprising, not to mention well-acted, written and directed, than Supercast films Heist and The Score. Nicolas Cage, after several years of B-action movies (Gone In 60 Seconds, 8 mm, The Rock, Face/Off...) makes a welcome return to what he does best - disturbed, neurotic, sensitive individuals (a comeback that got off to a good start on the schizophrenic Adaptation) - and delivers an Oscar nomination-worthy performance as con artist Roy Waller. Roy discovers a long-lost daughter, played brilliantly by Alison Lohman - also Oscar material. The relationship between the two is well crafted, and the story wonderfully written. Sam Rockwell also makes a fine contribution as Roy's partner.Elements of the plot may owe much to many other films - The Sting, perhaps Jacky Brown, and there's a bit of Leon (AKA The Professional) in Roy's relationship with his daughter, trying to balance a life of crime with a newfound family, and Lohman's performance is no less charming than that of Natalie Portman on that memorable classic. Worthy of praise is Ridley's directing, which proves he can make a small human theater piece as well as grandiose historical epics and sci-fi odysseys. The editing is wonderful, well visualizing Roy's condition and giving the movie an apt atmosphere. Overall, Matchstick Men is one of the freshest films of the year, and a very enjoyable watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful 'Sting' Film with a Twist!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who thinks director Ridley Scott doesn't have a gentler side (after all, GLADIATOR, HANNIBAL, and BLACK HAWK DOWN are not exactly 'touchy-feely' movies) may be in for a surprise with his latest, MATCHSTICK MEN. The story of extremely neurotic but brilliant con man Nicolas Cage ("I'm not a criminal," he explains to his shrink, "Criminals hurt people; I don't..."), discovering a daughter he never knew he had (Alison Lohman, of WHITE OLEANDER), on the eve of a big 'Sting', offers as much emphasis on his acceptance of his new parental responsibilities as on the caper he and his partner (the always watchable Sam Rockwell) are pulling off. Cage plays the role brilliantly, making his quirky character sympathetic, and Scott proves again why he is one of Hollywood's premier directors.The success of a film like this depends on the chemistry between the leads, and Cage and Lohman are terrific together. The young actress manages to be 'sweet' without being 'innocent', and the tentative steps she and Cage take to understand each other are both believable, and touching. In one scene, he attempts to prove to her that he can cook by preparing a spaghetti dinner...after one bite, the scene shifts to the arrival of the Domino's delivery boy!Ultimately, however, MATCHSTICK MEN is a tale of 'The Con', and Cage and Rockwell's 'Sting' against 'fat cat' Bruce McGill, while appearing deceptively simple, has a series of twists and turns, leading to a climax that is both stunning and unexpected. This is the kind of movie that will have you putting pieces together, LONG after it ends.It is an intriguing and rewarding film, and shouldn't be missed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice change of pace for Ridley!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest effort from Ridley Scott equates to Spielberg's latest, Catch Me If You Can. It is a nice, technically simple film that follows their more epic, effects, and set piece driven movies preceding them. Spielberg followed Minority Report and AI, whereas Scott is following Gladiator, Hannibal and Black Hawk Down. It is a nice and welcome change of pace for a master director, as CMIYC was to Spielberg.The film stars Nicholas Cage, who is making up for some lost years thanks to his role here and of course in Adaptation. Cage plays an obsessive compulsive con man who has an obsession of cleanliness and a fear germs and wide open spaces, and is hyped up on prescription drugs. Cage is superb here, it is a great performance, amusing and likeable. This is the sort of quirky character that brings the best out of Nic Cage. Co-starring as Cages partner in crime is the up and coming Sam Rockwell. I have been a fan of his since I first saw him in Charlie's Angels and then in his best role thus far in Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind. He was superb in Confessions and looks like he could be a top new star. Rockwell plays his character here with panache. Also starring as Cages daughter who turns up out the blue is Alison Lohman. Lohman is playing a 14 year old, who Cage has never seen and didn't know of at the start of the film. Lohman is much older in real life and so playing a 14 year is something she can do well but with the maturity and actress of that actual age may not have. Lohman is a lovely presence, she is charming and sweet and endearing to the audience, she is also a good young actress.The film is funny, charming and simplistic. It doesn't tax too much and is a quick and pleasant, much like junk food, only more good for you. I love it when Scott does his big epic and more elaborate films but this is a good change of pace, that Scott must have really enjoyed. It is something he could do with his eyes closed compared to say Gladiator.The film is well paced and there is a great twist that lets the film end on a real high. This is a good use of a great cast, and imaginatively edited. Overall a pleasing viewing. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nick Cage is awsome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewing a movie like Matchstick Men is tough because it's a con movie and as such I really can't go into the plot all that much. So, I'll just give a quick little synopsis of the plot, but really if you've seen any trailers for the movie, you know the plot pretty well.Nicolas Cage plays Roy, a con man (or, as he likes to say, a Con Artist!) who has a lot of problems. For one, he's a compulsive cleaner, he hates the outdoors and he has lot of ticks Roy needs medication to keep him sane.One day he knocks his pills into the sink and when he calls his doctor to get more he finds out that his doctor is no longer in town! This provides one of the funnier/saddest part of the movie. I'm not sure if it was suppose to be played up for laughs or not, the tone was kind of hard to tell, but Roy spend the next day and a half cleaning his house, his ticks got worst and well it made me feel kind of bad for him.His partner Frank, played by Sam Rockwell provides him with the number for another psychologist who can help. Roy goes to the psychologist thinking that it'll be easy, to just ask for the pills and he'll get them. No, this guy wants to help Roy and will not give him any pills until he talks. Which, I must say, shows two things. One, Nick Cage is great when he plays these type of rolls, and two, he's damn funny. What he tells the psychologist was both funny and sad. During that time though it's reviled that Roy was married at one time, and when his wife left she was pregnant and he doesn't know what happen to the child who would be 14 by now.After getting the pills (only a weeks worth mind you) Roy decides to find out about his daughter, but he can't because he's too scared, so after getting the number of his ex wife he asks his psychologist to make the call when he can. Later that night he gets a call from him and finds out that he has a daughter who wants to meet him.That's as far as I'll go with the plot because the movie really picks up from there as he bonds with his new daughter and sets up a really complex and dangerous con.Like I said, Nick Cage is great in the movie, but I also want to point out that his daughter, Angela (played by Alison Lohman) was just fantastic to watch. She really lit up the screen when she smiled and it looked like Alison Lohman was just having a ball playing her. She was your typical 14 year old (only, and this shocked me when I found out, Alison Lohman is 24 years old! If you watch it, keep that in mind and tell me she doesn't look like a 14 year old.) who knew just how to work her dad! Some of the funnier moments came after he would yell at her, then she'd start to cry and Roy would just completely collapse and start apologizing for what he said, even if he was completely right! It was just really funny.Matchstick Men isn't a fast paced movie, it's more of a character study between Roy and Angela and how she changes his life and makes him reprioritizes his values and the way he runs his life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Start and end very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The little problem that 'Matchstick Men' has is that there is not a real highpoint in the movie if the ending wasn't there. I think the movie starts as a very good movie. Roy Waller (Nicolas Cage) and Frank Mercer (Sam Rockwell) are con artists and the movie opens with showing how they collect some money. It is not as great as how George Clooney does it in 'Out of Sight' but it's a lot of fun. After this the movie shows who Roy is, a guy with all kind of weird things. Spasms, panic attacks, compulsive behavior. He wants things clean, he wants things a certain way, or he becomes a little crazy. He has pills for these things but he loses them and this is how he meets Dr. Klein (Bruce Altman), a psychiatrist.Because of him Roy learns he has a 14-year old daughter Angela (Alison Lohman, who was actually 24). He wants to care for her, spend time with her, and even reveals what he really is. In a great scene she shows her father and us how she would be if she had the same job as Roy. Roy and Frank have a big job planned where they would collect 80,000 dollars from a guy named Frechette (Bruce McGill). In a way they are taking money but Roy looks at it differently. He thinks, and he is actually right, that they just give it to him. Because it is all illegal they can't complain after they are cheated.Hoe these three big stories fit in one you have to see for yourself. The middle part is a little slow, but the ending makes up for that. All characters are played very well and Nicolas Cage is great. Ridley Scott has made another fine movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sustained my interest throughout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roy (Nicolas Cage) has some problems. He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic attacks, and gets totally hysterical when people leave doors open, don't take off their shoes, get mud on his carpet, etc. He takes pills for the many problems, but he accidentally knocked them down the garbage disposal and is a big frantic mess now, complete with nervous ticks of the face and exclamations of "mmm..." at the end of his sentences.That's a problem that severely interferes with his job as a con artist. He's not a con man, he's not a rip-off man, he's a con artist, with added emphasis on the "artist" part. He views his job as a beauty, a sort of majestic way of expressing himself, but not really, that's a lie, it's just something that makes him sleep better at night.He hates his job because it makes him feel dirty. It's not fun ripping off old people or fat people, but he is a high school drop out, how else can he get a decent paying job?His partner, Frank Mercer (Sam Rockwell), is a bit more at ease than Roy. He doesn't seem to mind his job all that much. Roy, on the other hand, is turning into a complete nut, and after going to a recommended psychiatrist, he musters up the courage to confront his 14-year-old daughter, Angela (Alison Lohman), who is eager to escape her controlling mother and check out her long-lost big pop.The film has a lot of different stories going on -- the worry-wart who learns to put aside his nervous ticks, the long-lost father who reunites with his daughter, and the con artist who tries to give it up for a normal life. They all succeed as a story, but the film's only flaw is its wandering, which goes on far too long.Who cares (and I mean that as a statement, not a question). The film is one of the great entertainments of the year. It has twists, turns, and a big streak of enjoyability running through it.Nicolas Cage is on a winning streak. First 2002's Oscar-winning "Adaptation," now this (rumored to be entered into the Oscar race for 2004). Who would'a thunk it?Sam Rockwell ("Confessions of a Dangerous Mind") continues to impress, while Alison Lohman (a 20-something actress playing a teenager) shines and convincingly portrays exactly what the character needs.Ridley Scott ("Alien"), the infamous British director, uses some great camera techniques here -- filmed in a blue shade with lots of different camera flashes, he subtly forces the audience into Roy's head, especially during sequences when Roy is having little breakdowns and the people and objects around him start moving at warp-speed.I'll admit that I'm a big fan of con man movies because I find them amusing. But "Matchstick Men" is not really a con man movie -- it's a movie about a con man who has to cope with his job and private life. And a movie about a con man who finds he has a daughter. And a con man who gets conned. It's all enjoyable, and though the film is long, I never felt very bored by it at all -- it sustained my interest throughout its running time. That's rarer and rarer nowadays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Cage's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicolas Cage plays Roy, a con artist, who has numerous psychological issues. He is an obsessive-compulsive con artist, with an insane need for neatness. Roy also suffers from agoraphobia, yet despite these problems, is an efficient con man. Much like in Luc Besson's Leon (1994), Matchstick Men adopts the same theme of a criminal figure taking in a young female apprentice. Although after the exciting exposition the film has a rather drab middle, the conclusion is stunning. This film is one of Nicolas Cage's finest, whom I have long questioned as to ability in acting. Alison Lohman does a fine job as Angela. Due to the spectacular finish, I am going to give this film ***1/2 / **** or 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>matchless fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 'Matchstick Men,' Nicholas Cage plays a con man so obsessive/compulsive in nature that he makes Jack Nicholson in 'As Good as it Gets' look like Oscar Madison in comparison. Fastidious to the core, Roy Waller freaks out at the first sign of dust, dirt or bacteria invading his personal environment, so much so that he keeps his place not merely immaculate but almost hermetically sealed off from the outside world. Somehow, even with this crippling neurosis plaguing his every waking moment, Roy has managed to eke out a pretty decent living as a shyster, ripping off gullible common folk with his partner, Frank, played wonderfully by the gifted Sam Rockwell.One day, into Roy's life strolls Angela, the 14-year old daughter he never knew he had. Suddenly, Roy is confronted with the need to reexamine both his life and his priorities and to make some crucial decisions about just how this strange young person should fit into the overall scheme of his existence.Written by Nicholas and Ted Griffin and directed by Ridley Scott, 'Matchstick Men' provides a stylish, clever and witty psychological riff on the old scam artist scenario, featuring fine performances by Cage, Rockwell and Alison Lohman, as well as an intriguing visual style by Scott, cameraman John Mathieson and editor Dody Dorn which often approximates Roy's mental and emotional state. Cage once again indulges in those nervous tics that seem to have become his actor's stock-in-trade of late, but he does manage to tamp them down long enough to allow a real character of flesh-and-blood to shine through the potentially distracting surface. Alison Lohman, so brilliant in 'White Oleander' last year, makes Angela into a multi-faceted teenager who runs the gamut from immensely likable to slightly irritating ? just about right for a character her age. Rockwell practically steals the show as Frank, the con man to the core who may be a bit better at his job than even Roy himself realizes. Hans Zimmer has provided a humdinger of a musical score, one reminiscent of some of Nina Rota's work for Fellini back in the early '60's. 'Matchstick Men' is not a perfect film; it sags in spots, doesn't dig deeply enough into its themes, and sometimes feels too clever and calculated for its own good. Still, the movie has an originality and an assurance that come when a group of old pros get together to have a good time and end up sharing that fun with their audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different, Entertaining......But Where's The Justice?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a bit different: a con movie that stays pretty low-key with some humor and a nice father-daughter story and then - wham - the last half hour it turns violent and very serious.Frankly, I didn't particularly care for the last few minutes. I'm not opposed to forgiveness, it's what we all are supposed to do, but I also am a proponent of justice....which doesn't happen here with Allison Lohman's role as "Angela."All the characters are very interesting and the story is involving. It hooks you in early on, and keeps your wondering what will happen. There is a nice soundtrack to this film, too, and the camera-work is first-rate. The bad news is that, once again we see a film in which they make good guys out of crooks and the lead good guy "Roy Waller" (Nicholas Cage) smokes the whole movie. When is Hollywood to stop promoting bad things (like smoking)? Overall, if you are looking for something entertaining and a little bit different, this is recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pros, Cons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Actors love to play actors, and con "artists" qualify, setting us up for the play within the play. In clever layered films of this type, the play within usually has a play within it -- a con within a con within the con that is the movie in the first place.This version has two features of note. Con movies are the reverse of mystery movies: we expect the storytellers to play tricks on us. We expect to know no more than the guy being conned. That gives Scott extra license to tie the point of view to his main character. He exploits this by giving Cage all sorts of mannerisms: ticks, jumps, triple stutters, ejaculations. Each of these is given to us as well through the camera. Jump cuts, smooth rolls, odd inerts, triple alloys, all to have how we see concur with what we see. Scott does this well and it is clearly his reason for doing the film.But he also brings an ability to exploit and pervert the genre. In this case he never really lets us know it is a con film until the end: he submerges the confidence activities under Cage's peculiar behavior. He enters "Family Man"/"Paper Moon" territory and plays those chords so effectively we forget where we are, just like Cage.Thank God for Ridley Scott. He's not the only intelligent director in Hollywood, but he is the only one who practices continuity of scenes one to the other by having the actors project forward. Previously he did this with an expectant tone in the reading, picked up by the first couple beats of the next shot. Here, he reduces it to the smallest unit: beats, not measures.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good vehicle for Cage's acting ability</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After recently having the pleasure(?) of viewing one of Cage's latest offerings - 'Bangkok Dangerous', - I approached this one with a sense of confidence, as it already has such a great reputation. Ridley Scott - the renowned director of Bladerunner - has made a film of quite a different genre, so a real departure from his usual stuff, but I have to say he has come in with what I felt to be a very watchable film with some pretty complex characters thrown in. Nic Cage gets to display a good range of his acting skills. He really is the master of the facial tic as anyone thinking back to some of his earlier films (such as Vampyr's Kiss') will recall. To those who scoff at his recent choice of projects e.g. G-Force, just remember, he is an actor. You take the work while you can. Anyway, to summarise, for me, above all, this film was refreshing as all of the actors acquitted themselves really well. A polished piece of cinematography that I will definitely enjoy viewing again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nic Cage's greatest acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know he won an Oscar for another film (don't get me started on that!), but this performance is really the one I regard as his crowning achievement. He's so convincing as a man who's totally out of control even when he appears to be in control that it's like a spinning top which doesn't really look like it's moving fast at all.Sam Rockwell and Cage are partners, if you can call Cage's tic laden role a man who ever really connects with anybody at all. They con for a living and are quite accomplished at the game. So when his new challenge, a teenage daughter he had no contact with up till now, enters and shakes up his OCD world, this walking, talking repetitive routine he calls life gets flipped over into something resembling a normal existence.The great Bruce McGill appears as someone you don't want to cross, unless it's out of his way to avoid the inevitable trouble. He fakes humbleness and charisma perfectly until the cobra he really is gets uncoiled and strikes.This is an odd choice for Ridley Scott to direct. I'm glad he made it, as this film is as great socio-comedically as "Blade Runner" was poignantly techno-emotional. "Matchstick Men" gets under your skin, in funny and tragic ways, usually simultaneously. There really are men out there like Cage's Roy, as disturbing as that might be. Here Cage gets to be a three dimensional person and not just the human function of a lame action formula.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another movie with Nicolas Cage playing a weirdo (after "Leaving Las Vegas", "Adaptation",...). Cage is really great in this kind of roles, although I love all his movies. The story is good, as well as Sam Rockwell but it is actually Alison Lohman who's steeling the show. Although she plays a 14 year old girl, she was in fact about ten years older.Her performance was wonderful and just like Nicolas Cage, I think we all fell for this girl. Such a sweet and curious young, innocent (!?) girl. I think Alison Lohman is an actress who we certainly have to watch in the future.For me, the last two minutes weren't necessary. I liked the ending as it was in the book, without the happy part. But on the other hand, it didn't bother me either. "Matchstick Men" is certainly a must see for Nicolas Cage-fans, but also for everyone else. Very entertaining and funny although the replay-factor is rather low.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were some funny parts, and the acting especially from Cage was terrific, but overall the movie was boring and predictable. The action is soooo slow that you have lots of time to ponder what is going to happen. That's a bad thing. I had most of the ending figured out halfway through the movie. The ending was no surprise. In fact, it was a letdown because I was hoping for more.The dialog was good, but the plot was weak. The director and scriptwriter should have taken the time to plug some major plot holes. Why didn't the master con artist smell the big con around him? I did. Why would he trust strangers with everything of importance to him? Why did he do everything they expected him to do? His daughter said it was her first time gig -- so why was she so good at it?The movie ended with a whimper. I was expecting some kind of twist, or maybe some kind of retribution, but instead we got a weak scene with a kind of moral message wrapped in it.</fullReview>

I don't know why I figured it out but I did. "Dammit" I said to myself and hoped for the remainder of the movie that I was wrong. I thought I may be wrong when so many other characters go involved, but they were all "in on it", which by the way was ridiculous. Nothing is worse than figuring out a surprise ending or an ending that ruins the entire movie. For me both happened in Matchstick Men. Just my opinion so don't sweat it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the year's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The amazing thing about Matchstick Men is that it shouldn't have worked. It tells three stories: primarily the story of a brilliant con artist. It also tells the story of a man driven by germofphobia (fear of dirt), and the story of the relationship between a man and the daughter he never knew he had. The protagonist of all three stories is Roy Waller, played by Nicholas Cage (in an Oscar-worthy performance, I might add). I've always admired Nick Cage, but in this film he outdoes himself. The three stories should contradict according to their nature. The three characters do contradict, but at the same time contain a certain unity. Cage plays all three roles effortlessly and convincingly. In a film where a lot of actors would have gone over the top he finds the right notes. There are scenes where tow and even three of the same characters emerge at one time. He finds the balance where a lot of actors wouldn't have. He is intense, subtle and ruthless all at once. The script, too, is Occar worthy, so absorbing that even when it goes off track it still manages to keep you interested. Sam Rockwell lends a convincing performance as Roy's partner, Frank, and Allison Lohman is equally entertaining as Angela, the daughter, who winds up wanting to be too much like her dad. The chemistry between these characters is there. They speak in convincing dialogue that shows who they are while propelling the plot forward.They manage to be likable even though by nature we wouldn't feel comfortable leaving a five-dollar bill anywhere around any of them.On a final note, I would like to comment on the last scene. Without giving anything away, I would just like to mention the many ways that it could have flopped, or given a final plot twist for the viewer. It could have been bitter of hurtful, but Ridly Scott is smart enough to know that, and the scene is done in such a fashion that we understand, without being outrightly told, that this movie ends in the only way it possibly could.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another overrated Hollywood movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a failure on three levels; each one worse than the previous one. *spoilers ahead starting with point 2.*1. Nicolas Cage gives a mannered performance that a student in Acting 101 would give. 2. The big "twist" is predictable and far-fetched. Let's see, in order for all this to happen, Rockwell's character has to assume Cage will lost his medicine down the sink, need a new shrink, never go to his daughter's house, and ASK THE SHRINK TO CALL HIS EX-WIFE FOR HIM! Gee, what a brilliant plan to have so much luck fall to you. 3. Cage is supposed to be this brilliant con man but he falls for something that was obvious to me in the audience? AND -- the worst part -- he "comes to terms" with it all in one ridiculously far-fetched chance encounter a year later. "Good to see you," he says to the fake daughter that tore out his heart a year earlier. Yeah right. And then we have the con artist herself looking longingly and saying, "Dad." Uh-huh.A feeble attempt at a Hollywood happy ending epilogue to help the box office after the dark (and fatally predictable) twist.A failure of the worst kind. 1/10See The Sting or House of Games on video/DVD instead. This movie isn't even worth mentioning in the same breath as those classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The very last scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am confused about the final scene...Roy has been conned and one year later he's working in a carpet store making some kind of living so he goes home in a nice car, to a nice big house with a pregnant woman making dinner. Is that his ex wife or Kathy (the grocery store clerk)? Or someone else? Where did the money come from for the nice house? I think the movie could have been done without this scene because it doesn't make any sense. And nobody has been able to explain it!!So when people refer to the great twist at the end of the movie, are they referring to the actual con on Roy which was obvious or the confusing final scene where all is well?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sluggish, forgettable comedy/caper. The plot payoff is decent, but what we have to endure to get to it is unforgivable. The film doesn't seem to know what kind of a feel it's going for, and the pace is painfully deliberate, frustrating any efforts to engage the audience from the very start. Nicolas Cage gives a rather typically twitchy performance--he's good here, but it's nothing we haven't seen him do before. Alison Lohman is believable as a fourteen-year-old, but her dialogue bears little resemblance to actual teenage discourse. Sam Rockwell, so often a bright spot even in bad movies, isn't particularly distinguished here. The lighting and cinematography is as pretentious as we've come to expect from Ridley Scott these past few years, and this adds considerably to the tonal problems. But mostly it's just a bore; not an awful film, but one weirdly disconnected from anything recognizably human or entertaining. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicolas Cage outshines practically everybody around him in a remarkable performances as Roy, a brilliant con man who has pulled off dozens of jobs which is amazing because he suffers from agoraphobia, germophobia, and multiple other psychological diseases. Sam Rockwell does nice work as Frank, his mysterious protégé, and Alison Lohman is also terrific as the young girl who finds her way into Roy's life when she tells him she is his daughter.When looking to rent this, I was kind of excited because it looked to me like a Steven Soderbergh-type movie with plenty of twists and turns like the Ocean movies. However, the great British director Ridley Scott oversaw this and it has a great, hip look as well as an ingenious script from Ted and Nicholas Griffin. If you like con movies, stories about people with mental disorders, or you love the work of Nicolas Cage, Matchstick Men works on all those levels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've seen a lot of movies, crime or con movies in particular, you won't be surprised when you watch Matchstick Men directed by Ridley Scott. Though it is predictable, it still is entertaining and well made movie, that fits in well among the stories of its genre.Roy (Nicolas Cage) and Frank (Sam Rockwell) are two con men, who of course con money from people. Roy agrees to do a last big con with Frank, but soon his life gets more complicated, as if his neuroses weren't enough, when he finds out, that he has a 14-years old daughter Angela (Allison Lohman), who want's be a part of his life.Matchsticke Men is well directed movie and acted movie, which saves a lot. As I said, there's not much of originality in the plot, but it does hold together rather well. And it even has a happy ending, which was quite nice, as Roy actually is quite a likable character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just a con job</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I'm not very good at being a dad, alright? I barely get by just being me." -RoyIn a movie full of cons, lies, and misleadings, truer words could never be spoken by a character. In Matchstick Men, Nicolas Cage plays Roy: an obsessive compulsive, germaphobic con artist. His life is a mess, not in the traditional sense, but in the sense that he has made himself a prisoner to his own tedious routines and arrangements; living a life of repetition, monotony, and misery. Roy is likable because even though he's a criminal and an eccentric, he's sympathetic because he's lost control of everything, and deep down he desperately longs for happiness.Happiness becomes attainable when Roy's estranged daughter enters his life. He tries to change things around, for her sake. For the sake that he actually finally has a reason to. Usually in a con movie, the main character should have things together and should be in control, but since Roy clearly isn't (calling him a wreck is just a bit of an understatement), we aren't simply rooting for the cool grifter to successfully pull off a con, we're watching a human being's life change, and improve. Ultimately, the movie is not about a mind-blowing con, but about the main character's redemption.The ending seems to be quite controversial around here, it's a love it or hate it deal, and I absolutely love it. People who ask, "Why isn't he angry?" must not have been watching the same movie as I was. Just look at the opening scene and then the very last scene, and tell me the movie hasn't gone through an amazing process. It's a wonderful ending because the big reward of the movie was not a cash payoff, but something much much more profound.I loved Matchstick Men. It's a lovely, quirky movie that is unforgettable. Cage, Sam Rockwell, and Allison Lohman create 3 awesome characters that really come to life and light up the screen. Amazing music by Hans Zimmer as always, with the use of a catchy little tango as the main theme. This was an unpredictable directorial move from Ridley Scott, who is among the great directors working today, and this is my personal favourite of his works, and one of my favourite movies altogether.1,2,3...My rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it's a given, that since it's a Ridley Scott film, it's more than likely going to be terrific, it still should be said, that this is one of the better films I've seen in a long time. It's cute, light enough for everyone to enjoy, but just intense enough at times, for the more spirited at heart to enjoy as well.Nicolas Cage stars as an anal compulsive con-artist, who has an unexpected girl come into his life one day. With his partner in crime Frank (Sam Rockwell), at his side, a fourteen year old girl named Angie becomes the missing piece in his sad and confused life, that he never knew he needed or wanted.The story circles around a con that the two men are working on, and this young girl is in the picture now, for him to make some choices with which he is faced.I loved this film, and I've seen it twice now. It's again, one of the better films, most people will have seen in a long time, and not only does Nick Cage give probably his best performance to date, in this, but Ridley Scott is a genius, and master at work with his photography, editing, and eye for wide angle shots.The imagination that went behind the story, screenplay and post production is very good, and I give it full credit for the job that they have accomplished. Sam Rockwell and Allsion Lohman are also exceptionally good, and I would have to say that Lohman is probably the prize find in the entire piece. It's amazing how well she was able to portray her character.I will be the new owner of this film, quite shortly. It's one of my favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't live up to its full potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found "Matchstick Men" to be an enjoyable film, starring Nicolas Cage as an obsessive-compulsive con artist whose life is changed when his teenager daughter (Alison Lohman), whom he never knew existed, walks into his life. This part of the film manages to entertain well, and Lohman's rebellious yet sweet personality comes off as a very appealing character and adds enjoyment and emotion to this film. Cage starts to turn his life around as this change in his life occurs, another positive element to the film. I also enjoyed the scenes with Lohman being taught how to steal, and these parts added some bits of humor to the film. The problem with this movie, however, is the number of unnecessary plot twists that start occurring toward the end. This film has been labeled as a comedy, which is not completely true. There is much more emotion and drama than comedy in this film, which is not really a benefit here. I won't spoil the plot twists, but some of them are very strange and unusual. The film would have been better, in my opinion, if it had stuck to a simple plot rather than trying to over-complicate the events of the story. It was a sweet, entertaining film, until everything started changing. The twists do add a sense of intelligence to the film, but it would have been much better if it stayed predictable and simple. Not a total waste of time, but could have been better.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You're not a bad guy - just not a very good one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a notion Matchstick Men is a minor curiosity in Ridley Scott's filmography, a little comedy about a con artist bonding with his daughter... for me, it's one of the best movies he has done since his incredible starting streak (The Duellists, Alien, Blade Runner - best beginning by a director, ever?). An auteur with a great eye for composition and a phenomenal gift for visual storytelling, Scott can shoot a fine picture but has no quality control when it comes to choosing scripts, with ponderous, often disheartening results.The screenplay for Matchstick Men, however, is breezy and clever, with vivid characters and sharp dialogues. Cage, who can be a calamity in the wrong part (The Wicker Man), is smartly cast as a phobic weirdo, which allows him to unleash one of his amiably over-the-top performances. In the right role, Cage can still knock it out of the park - I am thinking of a moment near the end, where his heartbroken sobs morph into a bark of hysterical laughter. Alison Lohman is perfect in a tricky role; supporting turns by Sam Rockwell and Bruce McGill are excellent.And when Scott puts his visual talent in service of a smart script, the result crackles.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scott chooses a different path in film-making as he opts for something a little simpler, lighter and fresher. His simple product is indeed a well-made movie with some pleasant surprises. In my opinion, this happens to be one of the more likable (and intelligent) con-artist movies. It has a fine screenplay and Scott brings a nice balance between comedic moments and the tenser moments and of course they way he brings the surprise element without making a mockery of the film is simply outstanding.Cage Roy is brilliant as Roy, the con artist who tries to be a better father after discovering his teen daughter. Like most men with an in-ordinary job, Roy also suffers from a condition, an obsessive compulsive disorder. Cage portrays Roy in an extremely believable human way. Rockwell as Frank is equally good. Frank is a departure from the 'weird' characters he's more known for. Lohman is excellent as Angela. She almost steals the show and the sudden transformation in character was done with grace. She's one of the finest young actresses. Altman and McGill are adequate and Kelly is pleasant.Visuals are good. So is editing. After a long time, Scott reminds us that he can still direct a very good movie without the need to spend loads of money. 'Matchstick Men' is one enjoyable flick.</fullReview>

It's a mainstream offering that asks you to use your little grey cells - like, say, "Usual Suspects"... Nicolas Cage is good; as he usually is these days - and Sam Rockwell offers a contrasting character to his which is equally well represented. The other principal (or is that principle?!) role belongs to the very able girl - Alison Lohman.There is a lot of cynicism on offer here but also some sweetness - and, finally, in the case of Cage's character, redemption.

		<shortDescription>what a disappointment**SPOILERS**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read the comments posted before me and I am quite amazed that no one has expressed the frustration that I felt through the entire movie. I had not read the book, did not know the premise, yet knew how it would unfold less than 20 minutes into it. There were so many glaring tells that a con was on that it made me question if Cage's character was more mentally challenged than obsessive-compulsive.&gt;&gt;SPOILERS&lt;&lt;Rockwell's mentioning the disparity in their financial status was a bit of a heads up, a little foreshadowing to those familiar with the genre, but the first real clue - and an absolute give away - was the psychiatrist agreeing to call the ex-wife. No doctor who valued his or her license (much less reputation) would agree to do such a thing, it's utterly implausible.The rest of the clues come later, like in the airport, (a truly professional con man would have aborted the mission when the mark was not in the correct place) Cage is accosted by the man he's supposedly duped moments after he exits the multi level parking garage; How did the guy know where he was? He'd have to have gone directly there to have beat him - he couldn't possibly have gone through security.There are others but I have a word limit and I must save a few to say something nice (Mom would want it that way). The cinematography was beautiful, and the colors were rich. Cage was Cage (I mean that in a good way) and Sam was a revival of Eric Knox, and very cute. Alison Lohman was completely believable as a 14 year old.All in all, a decent rental if at a bargain price, but it will take far more than that to con me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A con man meets his daughter, who complicates his life in "Matchstick Men," a 2003 film starring Nicholas Cage, Sam Rockwell, and Alison Lohman, and directed by Ridley Scott.Cage plays an obsessive-compulsive con artist, Roy Waller, who works with a partner, Frank (Rockwell). They're very good at what they do and are successful. When Roy runs out of medication, he goes to a psychiatrist (Bruce Altman), who requires him to have a session before he can get any medicine. It comes out that Roy suspects that he has a child with his ex-wife, Heather, whom he hasn't seen since she was two months pregnant. He presses the doctor to call her and find out about the child. The psychiatrist informs him that he has a 14-year-old daughter, Angela (Lohman). Angela and Roy take to one another, which leads to problems when Roy and Frank are working an important con.This is a really wonderful film with excellent performances by Cage, Rockwell, Lohman, Altman and Chuck Frechette as a con victim. The actors have been given top direction and an exciting and surprising script by Nicholas and Ted Griffin, based on a book by Eric Garcia. The story holds interest throughout, and you're not prepared for some of the twists and turns that it takes.Truly a must see, highly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neat character-piece disguised as a con-movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Against my better judgement, I have always classified Ridley Scott as a visual director (with a couple of exceptions like Thelma &amp; Louise), but here he steers way from the sweeping epics and sci-fi fares he does so well, carving out a grounded heist-film in a much smaller format, with more relatable notions and more subtle acting from the leads. Matchstick Men (2003) isn't really visual at all; it is character-driven ? and wonderfully so ? which is a clear showcase for Mr. Scott's directorial range. And what eccentric characters there are! Roy (Nicholas Cage) is a con-man who suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic attacks, and falls prey to hysterical outbursts and tics when people leave doors open, don't take off their shoes, get mud on his carpet, etc. Everything has to be in its place?a certain way, all perfect, fluent and organized. What takes him and shakes him off this course is the entry of his teenage daughter (Alison Lohman) that he never knew he had. Although their father-daughter storyline acts as a diversion in Roy and his con-friend's (Sam Rockwell) lives, it is both an obstacle and an advantage at other times, as Angela is willing to learn the art of conning herself. She proves a quick learner on the con-scene, but Roy's eccentricities is a barrier in their relationship. There are many story lines for few characters, but they are all carefully sewn together by the master tailor Ridley Scott.As for acting, Nicholas Cage captures the inner turmoil of his character very well in the film, from the twitchy tics to the odd stuttering ? he is a big mess, but has that inherent, effortless hero-quality when cast in protagonist roles. Alison Lohman plays a 14-year-old girl, but looks and fits the part ? the mood-swings, the crying, the upbeat teenage spirit. They are dynamic together, too, and their on-screen chemistry shrewdly transcends "average", managing excellent. It turns borderline inappropriate at times, given that they play father and daughter. You'll see.As it is a highly character-driven film, it places other diversions in the backseat to make room for the cast ? which is fortunate, because scratch the surface and there is not much else there. A few supporting character here and there, some subtle elements of humour, an attempt at a heist-approach. But mainly, it is not what is in focus, nor should it be. Sam Rockwell has a quite big, colourful part but even he fades because his character is neither explored nor dimensional. The constant conning proves to be a nice detour when it is tended to, but it rarely gets THAT interesting. Pacing is another problem that primarily manifests itself in the beginning of the film; although it's event-laden, it's extremely slow.Despite its clear shortcomings, Matchstick Men (2003) is still a quality film by a quality director. Now that Ridley Scott has supposedly given up science fiction, we can perhaps expect more films of the Matchstick fibre in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the swindler swindled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An habitué of the Hollywood blockbusters like Gladiator (2000) or Blach Hawk Down (2001), we are a little surprised here to discover Ridley Scott in an intimater mood and much more distant from his recent epic efforts. With "Matchstick Men" (2003), Scott decided to try his hand to the comedy, a type he has never really studied, maybe to show that he was able to entertain and to make laugh. But given the contents, the less we can say is that his movie has nothing original. For example how many times in the cinema have we seen the hackneyed topic of the father who discovers he has a daughter and so has to look after her? About this topic, the relationship developed by Cage and his daughter is largely predictable. More serious, Scott devotes an important part of the film to this relationship and what should have been the main subject of the film, the swindles is relegated to a position of secondary importance.I have written, in the beginning of my review that "Matchstick Men" was Scott's first attempt at making a comedy. Visibly, he isn't familiar with this domain and as far as I'm concerned, I almost didn't laugh during the projection. Probably to hide both a lack of experience in the comedy and a lack of originality in the topic, Scott opted for the overbid and compensation. Either it is in the sequences with Cage and his daughter, his shrink or partner, the film-maker multiplies the cues supposed to cleave through air but it isn't sufficient to make up numerous unfinished or skimmed over comical situations. Moreover, Nicolas Cage acts a neurotic character and there's a big supply of droll sequences whose center is Cage's illness: its effects (Cage's obsession with cleanness) the actor's efforts to cure it (the sessions with the shrink which strongly recall the Crystal-De Niro confrontations in "Analyze this" 1999). But all this is only of a minor interest and like Cage's efforts to take after his daughter, it has as a consequence to move the movie further away from the main plot.As a result, instead of following the linear main thread, the movie is further divided into several parts which juxtapose themselves to give a lame and patchy film. Moreover, there's one thing I'd like to say to Mr Scott: a comedy must remain a comedy. It mustn't go beyond the bounds of the type. What I mean is that his movie constantly wavers between the comedy, the drama and the thriller without succeeding in finding a unity and a lasting tone. It brings out a quite significant lack of cohesion and in another extent, the director also vainly tries to blend laughter with emotion.Scott seemed to be aware of these faults which can diminish the interest of the spectator and so to correct them and to boost the machine, he introduced, in the last minutes of the movie an unexpected twist (which I won't reveal). Even if the most perspicacious will say that it is up to from a mile off, this "coup de théâtre" may be dramatic, it also creates an easy moral that spoils nearly the whole movie.Ridley Scott's opus would be a total failure with Nicolas Cage's presence. The actor holds the whole movie on his shoulders. Beside him, the actress who acts Angela (I can't remember her name) has no problem to put herself in a 14 year old teenager's place in spite of her age (she was 22 years old at the time!).So, "Matchstick Men" is a flick to watch for Nicols Cage but to forget in Ridley Scott's dense filmography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Loss of Confidence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was any actor born to play a character with an obsessive-compulsive disorder, that would be Nicolas Cage. Annoyingly self-absorbed; prone to twitchy, quirky behavior; yet capable of making it all somehow -- sometimes -- endearing, Cage already makes all of his characters seem just a tad disturbed. So MATCHSTICK MEN has to be given credit for that; it has a strong, convincing and compelling performance at its center, which is essential to any film that wishes to draw you in and move you. It is, however, also essential to any con job that hopes to draw you in and play you. But to paraphrase the film's philosophy, it doesn't matter how much it wants to take from you, but how much you are willing to give. And MATCHSTICK MEN expects you to give a lot -- and give up a lot.First and foremost it expects you to give up your willingness to question its fundamental logic. Cage plays Roy Waller, who we quickly learn is a highly successful con artist and who, when not on his meds, is prone to obsessive-compulsive behavior. Though his condition is generally benign -- fear of touching doorknobs, cleanliness issues, agoraphobia, etc. -- it is enough to make his demeanor at least a bit suspect. That would seem to be a problem if the main point of your profession is to instill confidence and make complete strangers trust you with vast sums of their money. That may be why he took on a protégé, Frank, played by Sam Rockwell, who apparently sets up many of the scams that Roy then supervises. They are reasonably successful crooks, apparently specializing in telemarketing scams that allow them to steal the identities of innocent homeowners. They are scummy people, but at least Roy confesses to a little bit of guilt, which is possibly the source of his progressing neurotic behavior, and the only reason we could possibly have for being sympathetic to him.Enter into the story 14-year-old Angela (Alison Lohman); through a series of plot twists, Roy is united with an offspring he never knew existed and the wild-child free spirit quickly entangles herself in Roy's life of crime. The resulting hodge-podge ends up being a little bit of THE GRIFTERS merged with PAPER MOON, with elements of AS GOOD AS IT GETS, THE STING, THE CONVERSATION and any of a dozen soapy Lifetime TV movies mixed in. If you ignore a fundamental rule -- Never trust a film about con men to play it straight! -- then you might be sucked into the story and be fooled by the way the story tries to juggle plot lines and shifts in mood. But the unlikely attempt to merge a bittersweet family drama with the mechanics of a Big Con swindle caper should be a tip off that all is not as it seems. There are so many unlikely and contrived moments in the film, that it is all but impossible to not jump ahead in the story and see just who is conning who. Why is Roy's psychiatrist just a little too willing to breach his ethics? Why don't we ever meet Angela's mother? How come Roy's secret stash of money is so easy for Angela to find and why is she so instantly accepting of Roy's profession? The trick of a good con is in the cleverness of its details and its ability to not draw attention to them; MATCHSTICK MEN suffers from too many "that's odd!" moments which red flag the not-so surprising twist at the end.But if MATCHSTICK MEN leaves you feeling cheated, it is not because of the criminal scam that Roy is involved in, but rather in the emotional scam the film tries to pull on the audience. The film does make us care about the relationship between Roy and Angela, and that is where it plays us for chumps. If -- when -- someone is rooked out of their money and they get comeuppance for their wicked ways, it is to be expected; its all good sport for the viewer. But when a film builds its emotional center on a lie, we become the mark, not just innocent bystanders. Instead of being delighted at the film's twist ending, one might feel justifiably betrayed, but not in a sporting way. The film's big twist provides a sobering jolt, but it is almost immediately rendered powerless when the film tries to twist the twist with a curiously, inappropriately upbeat and unbelievably forced happy ending. To paraphrase the title of another famous movie, it tries to give us suckers an even break. It doesn't work at all. Its carefully, if obviously crafted story reveals itself to be a cruel charade, before saying, gee whiz, we really didn't mean it. Worse than conning us, the film tries to con itself into believing its cynicism is sensitivity and its brass heart is made of gold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never thought of seeing the day when a Ridley Scott film actually bored me to tears. Scott is usually dependable and even though some of his previous movies didn't work, at least there was something interesting in them (visuals or editing or music) but not with MATCHSTICK MEN. I was bored senseless with this obvious story. I just didn't see the point of making this story into a film. And watching Nicholas Cage, an actor with many ticks and mannerisms, play a man with obsessive compulsive behavior was just too much.All in all, there was nothing interesting in this film: predictable, weak and boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matchstick Men represents a pleasant change of pace for Ridley Scott. For a director known for doing films that are both large thematically and in scope, it's nice to see him tackle a film that has a simple premise which allows him to build the themes that he wants to discuss. Matchstick Men is a difficult film to categorise, as is the case for most con films. It has touches of dark comedy and pieces of crime thriller, plenty of drama without losing its quirkiness. It often plays out like a character study of a man who struggles to balance his dirty deeds with his mental issues. All of this delivered in a very free-flowing and vibrant way, much like the majority of Scott's work.At its core the film is about con man Roy Waller who suffers from serve OCD which become even worse once he loses his pills, shown in a scene that is both funny and sad where he spends a day cleaning his entire house. He then goes to see doctor who takes an interest in his life and wants to help him defeat his illness. Cage is the star centrepiece of the film. He also provides one of his best performances. In a way it is prefect casting, Cage has always been at his best playing edgy and jittery characters and here he gets a legitimate reason to act that way. His performance provides a surprising amount of sympathy as well as humour, he gets so into the character that his frequent ticks seem natural. The story develops further when it turns out Roy has a 14 year-old daughter called Angela who he decides to meet, which leads to him struggling to balance out both sides of his life. Enter Alison Lohman who is fantastic. It's hard to believe that she is playing a character ten years younger than she was at the time given how natural her performance is. She manages to capture the essence of what a character that age would be like, without detracting from the emotional weight and likability that she brings. I also think that Sam Rockwell (who I swear has never put in a subpar performance) deserves some praise for his role as Roy's confident business partner.It is tough to reveal much more about the plot without giving away pieces of information that might spoil its ending. Scott's direction is certainly a highlight, as usual with his films. It is possibly his most fluid film and he manages to convey Roy's breakdowns with his subtle use of the camera, whilst the frequent use of blue shade invokes the calmness of water which becomes something of a motif. From a visual standpoint the film reminded a lot of 'Catch Me If You Can' given its vibrancy and colour scheme. Adding to this is both the editing and the transitions which are seamlessly done. Hans Zimmer's score is also worth a mention, trading in his usually bombastic compositions for more jazzy and bass heavy pieces that fit the film perfectly.The only part of the film that left me cold was its climax and its eventual twist (which I won't reveal). For me the twist did disrupt a lot of the film's emotional and grounded aspects that had been developed excellently throughout. It brings a jolt that almost pushes you out of the film and instead of feeling that the twist transformed the film into something completely different, it simply felt like an unnecessary addition. I think the film would have been even stronger had it avoided said twist all together.Matchstick Men ends up feeling exactly like what Ridley Scott wants it to be. It's a film that blends multiple genres together and basically plays them off against the typical con man film style. It does go deeper than the story initially suggests, almost working as a psychological study of Roy and the building of his relationship with the daughter he never knew existed. On a surface level however, the film is constantly entertaining. Whether it is for the excellent acting, the charming central narrative, the tension building con or Scott's wonderful direction it doesn't really matter because all of these aspects blend with and play off of each other so well. I don't think the twist works, but it's a testament to the films strength that it isn't overly damaged by that. For me it's a film that is meant to be enjoyed on the surface, before you start to analyse what is underneath.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholas Cage as a neurotic con artist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Matchstick Men" (2003) is a fun movie, even though it's not a comedy. Movies that involve con artists have a certain edge of delight because the con games depicted are clever and defy expectations. This movie is virtually all about a con artist and his con games. It focuses on Nicholas Cage and his partner Sam Rockwell. Cage has all sorts of oddball neurotic behavior, and that adds hugely to the entertainment in the film. The film has some messages too, not laid on heavily. In this movie, we do not know what con game is unfolding as one occurs, and that engages us in finding out what's up.I've liked Cage in other films, and this one can be added to the list of his well-done credits. I give this one an extra point because of his performance and because the story is clever. The choice of music is superb too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Con artist. Film flam man, matchstick man, loser. Whatever. Take your pick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This might be the answer to all of Nicholas Cage's detractors who dislike his overacting and bursts of madness. He seems the perfect actor to play Roy, a conman who has a severe case of OCD. Cage adds to his portrayals a strong range of facial tics, stutters and uncontrollable bursts of emotions - sometimes matching those of his newly discovered teenage daughter. More immediately striking is the visual techniques that Ridley Scott employs to heighten his sense of paraonia and loss of control - speeding up and slowing down footage, rewinding the surrounding events, chopping up the soundtrack. When Roy goes through his usual obsessive ritual of counting the locks on his door, Ridley responds with 3 successive cuts to show how gingerly he screens the people entering his home. As he struggles to find more placebo pills on the phone, the cuts jump from side to side erratically as his anxiety builds. And when he wakes up after a nasty hit to the head, the frame is flattened and compressed to suit his POV. He and his partner Roy are smooth operators. They slip seamlessly into their roles over the phone; able to imagine and fabricate whole offices and businesses and co-workers with only their words. I am reminded of similar ability in the characters of Glengarry Glen Ross. Angela is also a great little actress, although we do not know it yet - moody, depressive, upbeat and teasing all rolled into one. The relationship is sweet beyond the long term implications of Roy's career, so naturally we begin to root for them to succeed. Roy shares this new joy of his with the targeted victim for the pigeon drop, exchanging those chuckling anecdotes that a loving father would. But we do begin to question whether he pulls it off so well because he is a veteran conman, or if it is because he is truly warming up to Angela. .Many have expressed discontentment at the rather tame ending. Perhaps they'd like Roy to unload on Angela and yell at her for conning him like hat. I think it's perfectly wrapped up; anger won't change what already happened, and he realises that he is now at peace with his ordinary life and happier than he ever was as a conman. That's about as far as the screenplay really reaches for. Besides the plot holes and conveniences that I'm sure everyone will be quick to point out, it's a bit presumptuous to simply assume that with a more stable life that his OCD would suddenly be resolved like some neat plot point. And again with the supermarket cashier, who doesn't really add anything of note except to symbolise his now happier life. But apart from all this, it's an enjoyable enough film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just happened to come across this movie while it was showing on TV, and I decided to actually sit down and watch it, even though it is a Nicolas Cage movie. And having seen it now, I must admit that I was more than pleasantly surprised with it.This was, hand on Heart, actually the best of all Nicolas Cage movies that I have seen so far. Why? Well, because of the movie's riveting storyline, but more importantly because Nicolas Cage delivered the best performance of his entire career in "Matchstick Men".The storyline in "Matchstick Men" is gripping, interesting and fast paced. More importantly, though, there are some nice change of events and plot twists along the way. I didn't see those surprise twists coming before they were actually revealed on the screen, and that kind of non-predictability is good.The acting in the movie was really good and helped further the movie quite nicely. Especially Nicolas Cage was in his ace corner here with this particular oddball character. But also Ram Rockwell and Alison Lohman were delivering good performances."Matchstick Men" is a very interesting movie that is quite good and should be seen, even if you, like me, are not particularly much of a Nicolas Cage fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matchstick Men tells the story of con artist Roy Waller (Nicolas Cage) and his protégé Frank Mercer (Sam Rockwell). The status quo of their work is disrupted when Angela (Alison Lohman), the daughter that Roy never knew he had, bumps into his life.Cage's performance as Roy is definitely the reason why you would want to watch this movie. He got very into character, a con artist with unique psychological traits where agoraphobia and OCD do not cover it all. Throughout the movie it's impossible not to feel for Roy when his eye twitches or whenever he has a nervous breakdown. This is most likely going to be the best obsessive-compulsive character performance you'll see in a while. Roy's organized and simple life is disrupted when a smart and outgoing daughter shows up, somewhat out of nowhere. Lohman's performance as Angela could be described as a unique balance between "lovable young lady with parent issues" and "sneaky little brat that wants things her way", resulting in a very solid performance (note that she was 24 at the time, 10 years older than her character). Frank, Rockwell's character, is an eager protégé trying to convince Roy into going for big hit, instead of the usual "simple is safe". Frank's passive-aggressive patience to deal with Roy's shenanigans adds a hint of comedy to the movie.The relationship between Roy and Angela actually remembers Leon, the Professional (1994) at some point. It's always refreshing to see small homages to certain movies ? and this one by Scott and Cage is a refreshing, 9 year gap fill. Also, two other things should be mentioned. First, the small but decisive aspect that Roy always uses matchsticks to light his cigarettes, overlapping a character performance with the title. Second, it's based on a novel by Eric Garcia, with the same title as the movie.An overall brilliant performance from these three characters and starting plot would be more than enough for anyone to watch this piece. However, the plot twist at the end, even though it's not that predictable, could be disliked by many (me included). Still, it's a movie worth watching, and one that I would recommend given Cage's performance and character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roy Waller (Nicolas Cage) is a con man in Los Angeles with partner Frank Mercer (Sam Rockwell). They sell over the phone and then even con them in person. Roy suffers from OCD about cleanliness. He suffers a panic attack and his psychiatrist Dr. Harris Klein (Bruce Altman) ask about his ex-wife Heather (Melora Walters). She was pregnant at the time of their divorce fourteen years ago. He contacts his daughter Angela (Alison Lohman) and he's rejuvenated. Roy agrees to work with Frank on a long con against businessman Chuck Frechette (Bruce McGill).It's a great con movie. Nicolas Cage's jittery performance is quite effective. Alison is terrific. She makes Cage's performance more than just weird mannerisms. They develop a great father daughter relationship. It was a bit of a surprise that she was in her 20s in real life. Although I didn't think she was that old, maybe that was part of the reason that I did foresee the final twist which detracts from the shock. There's something a little off with her. Sam Rockwell can't be overlooked. He's also terrific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The tobacco industry should be very proud!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally, I like this movie. Not a huge fan of Nick Cage most of the time and Matchstick Men is no exception. But he's likable enough once you get over the often-bad acting.I won't labor the plot - 300+ other reviews do that very well. And I am one of those who actually liked the "big con" twist - and no, I didn't see it coming (I can be plot-dense sometimes LOL!). I retrospect, it's so obvious - but so was Sixth Sense and a lot of people bought that one too.What really bugs me about this movie are two things:1. Cage's character is supposedly massively OCD about cleanliness. And yet he is a horribly messy chain smoker. In countless scenes he's flicking ashes on the floor, in the house and car. His car ashtray is overflowing. And everyone comes in his house and comments on how it always smells "clean" from cleaning products.... has anyone ever visited a chain smoker's house? EVERYTHING would be coated with goo that would then be collecting massive dust. And you don't just wipe that away! As a long-ago heavy smoker I can attest to this. No OCD-Cleanliness person would smoke much less chain smoke.2. I'd have to count, but I'd bet there are only a handful of scenes where someone isn't blatantly smoking. It's so annoying and so unnecessary to the plot. The little girl even is seen smoking, the shrink smokes a pipe, Frank smokes, the big con guy smokes, and they smoke everywhere - Cage even smokes while eating breakfast. The Tobacco industry must be proud of this - either that or Cage (who in fact is a chain smoker) demanded he be able to smoke in every scene or he wouldn't do it.I'm no radical "anti-smoking" person (typing this from a Casino bar in Vegas in fact LOL!) - but it's such a laughable plot item and clearly not an accident.But otherwise, I still like the movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You shouldn't expect some kind of masterpiece from this movie just because Ridley Scott is directing it . One could wonder what interested Scott in making this movie . The story here is good and interesting , but hardly spectacular in terms of screenplay. I guess he just wanted to do a fun movie."The Matchstick men" relies heavily on Nicolas Cage . The whole movie is concentrated around his character ? Roy , who suffers from many phobias . He's the heart of the movie . It a lot of fun to watch how he struggles with even the simple things like opening doors . Yet the movie doesn't make constant fun of him . We care about him , because we see how painful his life really is . Everyday for him is an adventure. It's get even more complicated when a new face appears in his life.Nicolas Cage is great . He might not be a best actor in the world , but if you use him wisely and cast him in adequate role he won't fail. During his career Cage has shown that he's really good in playing neurotic , troubled characters that don't fit in the world ? "Birdy" , "Leaving Las Vegas" , "Adaptation" and now "The Matchstick men" . You could say he's overacting sometimes , but it fits his character here perfectly.I must praise Alison Lohman . I didn't knew she was a adult woman ! When you look at that 15 year old girl you won't believe she's played by an adult . She brings a lot of innocence , charm and joy into her character . A great performance too . Sam Rockwell is also nice here , but is easily overshadowed by Cage and Lohman.The story mainly concentrates on Cage's disease and his relationship with Lohman . Those are the two most interesting aspects of the movie. The rest is a standard enjoyable bunch of twists you could expect from a movie about con artists.?The Matchstick men" is a solid movie about con artists . If you like this kind of stuff you won't be disappointed . It doesn't really stays with you and there is no need to see it again , yet it provides a solid entertainment. I give it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first glance, Matchstick Men appeared to be a quirky con-artist comedy with a few family themes thrown in, but turned up being a giant plot twist with little resolution for the film's protagonist Roy and no resolution for many of the other main characters. Matchstick Men not only leaves you unsatisfied, but with a sick feeling in your stomach. Through the last ten minutes I felt as though my emotional attachment to the main characters was brutally severed and stomped on repeatedly.As far as director Ridley Scott is concerned, this film is certainly not his usual style or subject, but it does have his tendency for an open ended and pessimistic storyline. Too much so in this case.Please Ridley, stop toying with my emotions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We have become so inured to the twists an turns of these types of movies, that for many viewers, we watch less of the movie and spend our time trying to anticipate the ending. One its own, this is a very good project. We have a man who has comes to realize how empty his life is. He has been conning for so long that he has lost his soul. Enter the daughter. This leads to a complex heist that involves layer after layer of enterprise. Mixed in with that is what he sees as a relationship, something to make the future better. If one looks at the cruelty of this whole thing, it becomes a very sad movie. That doesn't matter. It's still very moving, whatever the ultimate purpose. Cage is such a dominant figure on the screen. I have enjoyed almost every movie in which I've seen him. This was no exception. He has that demure look, that soft edge no matter how crooked the character he plays, and we end up pretty much loving him. He's one of those "I'd like to give him a hug" kind of guys. The plot dances around with close calls and challenges, each overcome along the way. Then, of course, we have the concluding scene. It makes you wonder if given another ten minutes, it may have turned again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roy Waller, a con artist, and his partner Frank Mercer got a way to rip off the big fish. Only problem is Roy's 14 year old daughter who, one day shows up at his doorstep and then there is his obsessive-compulsive agoraphobia.This makes out a plot with suspense, humor and drama. It's a "small" and simple story with few people, yet it's a good one. The story and the script is great. It's unpredictable, but easy to keep track of. There's at most no more then three story lines to keep track of, witch makes you relax and enjoy the characters. This movie is really all about character and reading the characters. The characters are good. You follow Roy all the time and you really get to know him, his past, behavior and personality. You don't get to know the other characters that well, you only know them as good as Roy knows them. You get to know their personalities, yet not their past and other hard facts about them. It's a well written movie.Nicholas Cage does a great performance. This movie really gets the best out of him. He's funny, serious and crazy and it all looks good. Alison Lohman is great as Angela. She plays a kid really well and as for Sam Rockwell he does a good job as Frank. The rest of the cast is good as well. They does a good job in supporting the story and the stars.The score by Hans Zimmer is, lets say interesting. It's good, by all means. It's kind of funny, crazy, psychotic, yet dramatic and thrilling and that makes it fit this movie perfectly. What's interesting is that it's not a typical Zimmer score. Never the less I would say this is one of his best scores.The cinematography and editing is great. The pictures are very comfortable to look at. Nicely lit and composed. The editing is kind of straight, yet it's not. Not much fancy effects or transitions, but it has a nice touch to it.The set decoration and locations are nice. They are kind of simple and minimalistic, witch look stylish and cool. It fits this story very well. There are not many actors or extras involved, which makes this movie kind of simple, yet that seems to close in the action of and between the main characters and you focus one 100% on them and has no problem paying attention.My final verdict of this movie is that it's a nice con/heist movie, with a twist, that is interesting from beginning till end. A safe and entertaining peace of film that I'm sure everyone will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breezy and well-acted, Matchstick Men focuses more on the characters than on the con.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meet Roy (NICOLAS CAGE) and Frank (SAM ROCKWELL), a couple of pros at the small-time con. As in con artists. Grifters. Matchstick Men. Take your pick.What Roy, a veteran of the grift, and Frank, his ambitious protégé, are swindling - er, make that selling - these days are "water filtration systems," bargain-basement water filters bought by unsuspecting people who pay ten times their value in order to win bogus prizes like cars, jewelry and overseas vacations?which they never collect. These scams net the film-flam men a few hundred here, another thousand there, which eventually adds up to a lucrative partnership.Roy's private life, however, is not so successful. An obsessive-compulsive agoraphobic (and chain-smoker) with no personal relationships to call his own, Roy is barely hanging on to his wits, and when his idiosyncrasies begin to threaten his criminal productivity he's forced to seek the help of a psychoanalyst (BRUCE ALTMAN) just to keep him in working order.While Roy is looking for a quick fix (i.e. pills), his therapy begets more than he bargained for: the revelation that he has a teenage daughter - a child whose existence he suspected but never dared confirm. What's more troubling, 14-year-old Angela (ALISON LOHMAN) wants to meet the father she never knew.At first, Angela's appearance disrupts her neurotic father's carefully ordered routine. Soon, however, with his own unique spin on parenthood, Roy begins to enjoy a relationship he never dreamed of having with his daughter. But while he develops paternal feelings for the 14-year-old, she's developing a fascination with Daddy's questionable career. Finally, at Angela's insistence and against his better judgment, the overprotective con artist begins teaching her some tricks of the trade and, much to his ambivalent mix of surprise, pride and dismay, she displays a remarkable gift for the grift.Now, like a kid with a new toy, Angela wants in on the partnership. But that could seriously jeopardize Roy's peace of mind - not to mention his whole way of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll tell you now, I believe Matchstick Men is one of my favorite movies. Despite what anyone else may think, I loved Nicholas Cage in it, and the plot was just superb. I did NOT see the ending coming. When I first saw it I didn't know what to expect but at the end my jaw was dropped to the floor.There was just a few things that I would have changed about the movie. I would probably explain the ending a bit better. You REALLY have to pay attention in this movie to understand everything. If not, you'll be completely lost. They could have explained what was going on better, and what everyone's motive was. But when you think about it, the ending begins to make sense.If you want a good, suspenseful, surprising movie with WONDERFUL acting, check out Matchstick Men.Two Thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is like Grifters gone wild. Nicholas Cage gives an amazing performance as a film flam master who may have lost his edge. Tough to review without giving too much away, but an exceptional rental that is highly recommended. Pay attention to the detail in this movie as it is easy to write it off as a slow mover. The cinematography is excellent providing just enough of a "soft edge" to shots that would otherwise be stark and boring. Alison Lohman's performance as "Angela" is stellar and she's an integral part of making this moving as believable as it is.My only advice is to get the one-week rental so that you can watch it again to find out where _you_ got grifted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scoot back in good form.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the putrid and disgusting HANNIBAL, partly due to Anthony Hopkins' hamminess, Ridley Scott regains his form with a flick that ranks up there with Alien and Bladerunner, or at least very close. While some parts of the story are predictable, and it's mostly lightweight drama, there's a lot of good inspection of the life of a barely functional obsessive-compulsive con-artist. Nick Cage gives another well-done performance and the supporting cast is very good. There's the more typical Hollywood cliché of the bad guy with a good heart who only needs to find his meaning in life, but it's totally enjoyble to watch Cage find his way here. And there's the always great Ridley Scott artistic visual sense in nearly every shot. I don't think you'll be disappointed at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS BEWARE**Films about con games, their perpetrators and victims, are always fun to watch, having previously enjoyed such gems as, for example, "House of Games", "The Last Seduction", and "The Usual Suspects".Having seen those films, however, I must admit that I've begun to develop a very suspicious nature in trying not to be conned myself as each scene plays itself out.That being said, I have to confess I'm always skeptical of any plot where one of the bad guys has some sort of "illness" or "physical defect"--such as, for example, the "limping" Kevin Spacey in "The Usual Suspects". Thus Nicolas Cage's portrayal in "Matchstick Men" as a slick conman afflicted with what seemed like a combination (!) of both OCD and Tourette's Syndrome was pretty heavy-handed. That by itself set off alarm bells in my head right from the get go.I think it's reasonable to suggest that, even with the right medication, I don't believe anyone could consistently manage to be so focused and deliberate enough to survive as a slick film-flam artist while simultaneously staving off the crippling symptoms of those aforementioned diseases.The partner-in-crime to such a person--in this instance, Frank, played by Sam Rockwell--would be hard-pressed to link himself up with such a liability for too long. Inevitably, he'd see the need to turn against his mentor and bail out for his very survival.Then, beyond the blatant storyline gaps already mentioned by an earlier commenter such as the fact Cage never phones his ex-wife, etc., their latest victim Chuck, played by Bruce McGill, just didn't look like a typical "fish" to me. In fact, I thought he looked too much like a cop, didn't you?Well, okay, so he wasn't a cop after all, but still he just seemed too trusting. NOT the kind of guy I'd even attempt to con in the first place.I confess, though, that I was totally blindsided by the brilliant performance of Alison Lohman. She had me fooled virtually to the very end--even to the extent that I still wasn't sure she was actually 14 or pretending to be. I, too, could even smell the bubblegum!Still, the characterizations kept me fascinated and the effects weren't too shabby either.Bottom line: don't trust ANYBODY! Not even a 14-year-old!</fullReview>

I thrill to the complexities of a well done scam, the more complex the better. If you like Mission Impossible, The Sting, The Spanish Prisoner, et. al., and my long-time personal favorite, House of Games, you will love Matchstick Men. Nicolas Cage gives his usual strong, slightly confused performance of a confidence man beset by nervous ticks and phobias whose world unravels when is 14-year old daughter from a failed marriage suddenly enters his life. The daughter is admirably played by Alison Lohman, who is perfect for this part. Her previous work really didn't impress me much, but based on this performance she is due for some good work ahead. The rest of the cast is even and passible. Overall, it's one of those fun movies that holds up in retrospect and makes sense. I even loved the ending, which was an understated surprise. Even if a few scenes were deleted that set up the ending, it still works all by itself. Don't miss this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(SPOILERS BEWARE)The ending had me fooled. I never expected the surprise twist till the very end. But, I do think the whole con was too unbelievable because for it to work, Frank had to rely on too many things to happen that wasn't a given. Such as, Roy not talking to the ex-wife, Roy getting his doctor to call the ex, Roy giving the password to his doctor, Roy telling Frank to take Angela and hide at the motel. Plus, how could Roy not become suspicious since he was this great con artist himself.The acting was decent, but there were some slow places. It would have been better if it was about 10 minutes shorter. And I didn't like the ending with Roy meeting Angela at the carpet store. That was just too stupid and would never happen. I mean, what are the odds she goes in the same store he now works at.FINAL VERDICT: Cool twist ending. I recommend it for simply an entertaining way to waste two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Endearing, Enjoyable Con Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Matchstick Men" is suave, funny and endearing as a tale of the life of a con and its many duplicities within. Nicholas Cage delivers a wonderful, adroit and whimsical performance as an obsessive-compulsive con man in the midst of dealing with an unexpected addition in his pawns: a fourteen year old daughter. His volatile facial expressions work brilliantly in portraying his character's neurotic demeanor as a man who doesn't exactly "have everything together". The father-daughter-con scenario is engaging and endearing, where we almost dismiss the illicitness of their dealings and merely appreciate their working successfully as a family team. This is much more than a routine heist story, as we realize the characters here are human and understandable, rather than ruthless and heartless. Perhaps the father-daughter scenario is renewed from the classic "Paper Moon", but it works too well in "Matchstick Men" for that knowledge to detract in any way from the whimsical originality of this story. My only major complaint with the film is Scott's overly curious direction in some places, particularly in Cage's character's "ticks and peculiarities", which sometimes comes across as frantic and enervating. Clever, enjoyable, and insightful con story which redefines the saying, "Do you know who's conning you?" ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

He tracks her down and finds her. After them immediately hitting it off, his daughter wants to learn the family business. He hesitates at first, but lets her in.

		<fullReview>** possible spoilers **Ridley Scott is the director of several memorable movies. I believe that the great thing he did here was to direct today's super-star Nicholas Cage and tomorrow's super-star Alison Lohman in two of the best roles of the year. The script is also quite smart - it has several layers and many surprises - starting from the psychotic drama, turning then into a sting film, getting into father-to-teen-daughter movie, up to the later surprises which I will not disclose to keep other viewers pleasure in watching the film.All is done in good taste, at the right pace, so that you can enjoy the story-telling. But the acting of the two stars exceeds everything. Watch Cage into a psychotic crook role, getting close to Nicholson in his best moments, but more human than devil for a change. Watch Alison Lohman in a teenager role letting Lolita and Leon's Mathilda in the shadows. Watch them and you will even be paid back for the too conventional and too expected ending. A solid movie. 8 out of 10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finely crafted &amp; craftily fine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Matchstick Men" engagingly mixes two seemingly incompatible cinematic genres, the family bonding pic and the heist movie. Director Ridley Scott adapts Eric Garcia's story of a quirky con artist (Nicolas Cage) whose relatively normal professional life is suddenly thrown off kilter by his introduction to his 14-year old daughter (Alison Lohman) and her desire to be a part of his criminal life. As George Costanza would say, "Worlds are colliding!" (Following the story of the film is much of the fun, so that's all the plot you're getting.) The appeal of "Matchstick Men" is derived primarily from the appeal and solid work of its leads, Cage, Lohman, and Sam Rockwell, who is Cage's partner in crime. Akin to his role in "Adaptation", Cage plays an idiosyncratic person who exhibits symptoms and tics similar to one with Tourette's Syndrome. He does this without succumbing to the temptation to overact, instead effectively melding it into his character. Lohman, who was twenty-two at the time of shooting, remarkably blends her real-life maturity with the proper carriage of her 14-year old character, never giving an indication of the age gap. Rockwell epitomizes an intelligent con man in his supporting role, oozing sliminess while maintaining a professional air. This trio creates a very likable set of characters that carry the film. You may or may not relate to them (I didn't) and may or may not be a fan of the actors themselves (I'm not a big Cage fan), but you will undoubtedly enjoy watching them (I did). A braid of professionalism weaves through the technical aspects of the entire film as well, also contributing to its appeal. From the top down, every facet of production is well done, even though the picture is not typical fare for many of its participants. Usually behind the lens of big-budget movies like "Black Hawk Down", Ridley Scott adjusts well to this smaller picture, utilizing his preference for few takes to get the most out of everyone involved. The editing of Dody Dorn ("Memento")is noteworthy for its tone-matching flexibility. She mirrors the actions of Cage by using a jumpier editing style when his symptoms are worse and a more traditional technique when he calms down. Hans Zimmer has also adapted his score to the nature of the film. Known for his soaring work in action films like "Gladiator", Zimmer instead accents the lighter side of "Matchstick Men" by eschewing blaring horns and dramatic strings in favor of a largely percussive score that nearly sounds as though recorded on a synthesizer. The clever editing and atmospheric music combine with John Mathieson's solid blue-green cinematography that stresses the contrast of light and dark to perfectly fulfill the roles of the technical aspects. Everything matches well to present a singular look and feel that provide an enjoyable film experience, hindered partially by a quirk of pacing. The first ninety minutes proceed leisurely, gently telling the story of a father and daughter. As the last half hour hits the gas, it throws you back in your seat, disrupting the established pace and eliminating the majority of the humor that had marked the film. Much of the first ninety minutes could be classified as comedy, while the final scenes fall into the drama/thriller category. Given the content of the script, I don't think this is a poor decision, but the abrupt switch in tone still jars the viewer into a few moments of discomfort. That and the lack of personal connection are my only complaints. Maybe you will find an emotional link with the film; I hope you do. But I didn't find myself intimately involved with the event, just an observer of a finely crafted story that fully entertains to the very end. Bottom Line: A low 8 of 10 for "Matchstick Men", which would have made my Top Ten of 2003 had I seen it last year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cage was very real character without being a joke.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film itself may have had some serious failings per the rather unbelievable storyline and ending, etc., etc., but then what ever happened to the whole suspension of disbelief? I mainly wanted to comment on the impressive rendering of the obvious tourettes-quality of the tics in Cage's character. Typically, TS is presented as a joke in films, with a primary understanding that ALL cases involve coprolalia (compulsive verbal outbursts involving swearing) within an otherwise normally functioning neurology. Although very little is made of the disorder in the film, in fact it isn't even mentioned by name, Roy is obviously the victim of recurrent and severe facial and vocal tics. I just happen to have a 10 y/o child in my household with tourettes, and I was very impressed with how well Cage presented the disorder. The director and writer's did their homework, and that's no small amount when it comes to not only TS itself, but to the comorbidity of obsessive compulsive disorders as well as depression and anxiety. OK, so it wasn't terribly realistic, as I saw noted ad nauseum, at least insofar as the story and the ending occurred, but then neither is any of the Star Wars movies or anything put out by Disney. THAT character presenting that particular disorder and living with what is generally considered a joke at best in our society was enough to impress me. I guess the movie itself probably prevented any serious consideration for awards, but Cage, in my opinion, deserved some kind of recognition for making TS a part of a realistically complex character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That was the sage advice given to John Cusack's Roy in Stephen Frear's excellent THE GRIFTERS. Nicholas Cage's Roy in the pale comparison MATCHSTICK MEN wasn't taught this, apparently, and pays for it.Without repeating the film's setup, I want ask "Why was this movie made"? After Frear's GRIFTERS and Mamet's HOUSE of GAMES (along with his other con films) what was Ridley Scott thinking in offering up this extremely slight piece? He adds nothing to the genre, and though loaded with entertaining performances by Cage, Sam Rockwell (as Cage's partner Frank) and Alison Lohman (as Cage's long-lost daughter Angela), the film goes nowhere with these unbelievable characters.SPOILERS!!!Ultimately nowhere, that is, after bait-and-switching us with a long con carried out on Cage by his "partner" and his "daughter" (and a few other fakes). Early in the film Cage tells Frank "I never work the long con". It's hard to accept that Cage's Roy could work the shortest of con's, so I wasn't surprised when he fell for Frank's bait.The phony baloney feelgood ending--in which the now broke Roy finds respectability as a carpet salesman (where he chance meets his "daughter" again as a customer, with a totally unbelievable live-and-let-live response) and finds love with his local supermarket checkout lady--makes the eyes roll.Contrast this silly film with THE GRIFTERS believably wicked characters and dark, bitter ending. Again, Ridley, WHY DID YOU MAKE THIS MOVIE?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matchstick Men has been out for a while now and, until it was recommended to me by a friend, I had no interest in seeing it. I finally got around to renting it and by about the halfway point I found myself liking it a lot.Nic Cage and Sam Rockwell were great as the two con artist partners as was Alison Lohman who was a very convincing 14 year old (although she really is around 24 years old)! The way I gauge how much I like movies is by the movies "buyability." If I like it well enough to buy it then of course it is a good movie. At the halfway point I thought it was good enough to buy, maybe previously viewed for around 10 bucks. My opinion changed from buying it used to buying it ASAP when I saw the ending. The ending was unexpected and made me rethink what I had just seen. When I first saw the trailer for this I saw that Ridley Scott was the director. The first thing I thought of when I heard Ridley Scott was Gladiator and then Black Hawk Down, I was pretty surprised to see him directing something like this. Scott did a tremendous job with this movie. Seeing some scenes through the eyes of Cage's character as things and people around him were sped up frequently was pretty cool and the final 20 minutes were just as impressive. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicholas Cage delivers another great performance in director Ridley Scott's Matchstick Men. Starring opposite Sam Rockwell and Alison Lohman Cage plays Roy Waller, a con man, who discovers that he has a fourteen-year-old daughter. Sam Rockwell plays his partner Frank and Alison Lohman plays his daughter Angela. All is going well for Roy until he accidentally drops his pills down the drain and discovers that his doctor, who provided him with the pills illegally, has skipped town. Frank sets him up with a new doctor and Roy asks him to phone his ex-wife, which he hasn't seen in about fifteen years, to see if he has a child that he doesn't know about. It turns out that he has a fourteen-year-old daughter named Angela. He tries to hide the fact that he's a con man from her but she soon finds out and wants in. He teaches her a con but makes her give the money back because he doesn't want her to follow in his footsteps. When one of his cons is moved up a day however he has no choice but to use her. Things don't go as planned and their mark ends up chasing after them. Matchstick Men is a good film until the last half hour or so. What starts off as a story about a man learning to deal with fatherhood escalates into something more serious. The ending feels out of place here because the story is more about the father-daughter relationship than the con artist profession. The ending might of worked in a film like The Grifters but it doesn't work here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Longing: the language of cinema according to Mr. Scott</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** SPOILERS INCLUDED - READ AT YOUR OWN RISK ****OK. I am now obsessed with Ms. Alison Lohman. But that's besides the point.And to wipe away any doubts as to whether Mr Nicolas Cage was any good - no one else could have played that role. More to my analysis:I listened to most of Mr Scott's commentary on the DVD, and came up with a certain conclusion: I believe I am taking a fairly accurate guess in estimating that throughout his career, Mr Scott had been accused of being quite "sentimental" about the ways in which he chooses his subjects and materials. He even goes to explain, emphatically so, that the penultimate sccene in this movie, where Angela (Ms. Lohman) reappears, as her "adult" self, in front of Roy (Mr. Cage) is just not that.Looking at just a few of Mr Scott's movies, most of his films may easily be mistaken for being sentimental, if being sentimental is defined as being in a state of bliss where one wishes for something to be other than what it is, emotionally speaking, that is, as far as one's connection to something or other is concerned. But I think this sentiment must be a very thin veil with which we all live, after having experienced something quite wonderful that actually fell apart, yet one is always unable to let go of those wonderful moments and feelings associated with them. I experiened the same thing with this film, as I had to watch it at least 3 times a day for a good 5 days before I could actually take the DVD out of the machine and return it to Blockbuster......This feeling, this sentiment, I call LONGING, and Mr Scott is an absolute master of it. No one does it better in my humble opinion. What could have been. What could be. What might have been. What might yet be. What if I did this? Will it be as it was? I miss it so much. It was so good. Can I be there again?And so on and so forth.Mr Scott likes us to linger on those feelings - thoughts along with the images that haunt the viewer for all time (and yes, I said all time) - as there really are a very few handful of true artists out there making such films that leave such an impression on the viewer. For me, it is so easy to recall those feelings that Mr Scott's films provoke (Bladerunner, Someone to Watch Over Me, GI Jane, Thelma and Louise, Gladiator). They really are like the Renaissance paintings at which I love to stare and search for the same sorts of feelings of longing........ I remember Mr Scott's films so easily, yet with many others' I find it very hard to do so. Guilty as charged.As for Mr Cage &amp; Ms Lohman - I think their chemistry was superb, they played off each other's goofiness quite marvelously. And yes, I agree that in some scenes Mr Cage's performances may have seemed a little over-the-top - but then he is a Hollywood Ace, and for Ms. Lohman to be able to hold her own, playing a girl 8 years younger than her real life self (she was 22 when she filmed the movie, as the DVD commentary says). I particularly liked the expressions they both had in 2 scenes: when Angela detests his pasta creation and then switches on a girly smile, a face full of pizza - reverse to Mr Cage's face expressing a dear love of this goofy daughter who has finally made his life whole; and in the carpet store scene, as Angela and Roy go back to the father-daughter dynamic, him unable to see her any other way, and her playing along, asking him whether he is going to ground her (she crushed me in that moment, let me tell you!) - and as she leaves, Mr Cage's face is priceless as Roy, held fast in his dreamy state of feeling what was and what will never be, yet the moments were so good, they were ecstasy.........................Am I being sentimental? I hope not, Mr Scott, but I do so wish I could re-live this film over and over again. Oh how I do so long for it.......... and that's cinema, isn't it?</fullReview>

But anyway, this movie has a few drug references and thematic elements and some language and very mild sexual references (like, a stripper on a stripper bar, a bare butt, etc..)***MAJOR SPOILER, DONT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING!!***Nicholas Cage's character didn't really have a daughter, the last he knew his former wife was pregnant 15 years earlier when he last saw her.

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. It had so much character and depth for a Ridley Scott movie. I heard people say Nick Cage's character was over the top, but I don't agree. I thought he gave yet another stellar performance and should have been nominated for an oscar again. Sam Rockwell was also excellent as his partner in crime. Alison Lohman (fresh off "White Oleander") in many ways steals the show. She is quite great as Cage's long lost daughter.Overall, a highly moving and entertaining film. I thought long and hard about it, and I guess I'm going to have to say this is Ridley Scott's best film to date. Most of his past films (IE "Blade Runner", "Alien", "Gladiator", etc..) have relied so much on visuals and mood, where this film actually has heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nic Cage is good as the neurotic con man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>November 2009 update: I watched it again after over 5 years. It was again an enjoyable viewing. This time, knowing what each character would eventually do, made it a different experience, recognizing clues to future developments.Most remarkable is that Alison Lohman, who plays a 14-year-old was actually 23 or 24 when this was filmed. I didn't know of her in advance, and to me she really looked 14. However, as the story unfolded it would have been difficult had she really been a young teenager. Some have complained about Cage's acting style, but you gotta give him credit, he always 'swings for the fences.' He doesn't play safe in any of his roles. I generally like him, and here is no exception. Sam Rockwell is good as his con artist partner, as is Lohman as the teenager who shows up as Cage's daughter. A big surprise to him, to say the least. I enjoyed the movie very much.SPOILERS, SPOILERS FOLLOW, quit reading, OK!?Cage's character didn't really have a daughter, the last he knew his former wife was pregnant 15 years earlier when he last saw her. His partner, played by Rockwell, set up the 'con' to get all the money that Cage had saved up over the years as a con artist. Lohman played a character who really was over 18, pretending to be his daughter as part of the con. The psychologist 'treating' Cage was also part of the con. Cage, a year later, broke and working as a carpet salesman, Lohman comes into his store with her boyfriend, he recognizes her, he isn't angry, they were all conned by Rockwell. Main significance of the movie is the role Cage creates as the neurotic con man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Spoilers) Ridley Scott takes a break from beating us over the head with his elaborate con-man movie, Matchstick Men. Nicolas Cage makes OCD funny with his tics and jerks, and Alison Lohman EASILY passes for a junior high student. I did a double take when I saw that she was born in 1979. Seriously, this girl may go to 30 before she takes a college-age role. Sam Rockwell gives the same kind of bored rock star performance he threw out in Charlie's Angels &amp; Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind, but the relationship between Cage &amp; Lohman move the show. It's good to see Cage back in decent movies after about a 5-year stint in so many bad ones. It seems like he's dropped his vanity, and it's helping in his role selection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets the Job Done - but here are some better Con Artist Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been so many movies made about con-artists, they could have their own category at the video store. Matchstick Men is an average entry into this sub-genre, and focuses less on the con itself and more on the effects it has on the people involved. This has been done before with results ranging from excellent (Grifters) to down right awful (Four Dogs Playing Poker). I'm not one for giving away plot points (especially in a movie like this where discovering the twists is all the fun), so I will just say if you are looking for your con-movie fix, Matchstick Men will take care out of it. However, I would recommended renting better entries from this category such as "The Spanish Prisoner," "House of Games," and the aforementioned "Grifters" first.</fullReview>

The first thing i really like about the movie is that the main character, played by Nicolas Cage, has a flaw. He has to lock the door 5 times for example and can't stand dust. He is so vulnerable yet he is very good at what he does, con people. Sam Rockwell stars as his partner in crime and also does a great acting job. There was only one thing that bothered me during the entire movie and that is why the hell didn't he beat the sh*t out of the young woman who pretended to be his daughter. I know i would.

		<fullReview>Matchstick MenGrifting from one mark to another is a dishonest way to make a living, but it's a living for con artists nonetheless. The trouble for Roy (Nicholas Cage) is that he's got nothing to live for after work outside of indulging his obsessive-compulsive disorder by cleaning his already immaculate house. The ob-comp angle provides a unique window into what would otherwise be another Hollywood tale of a criminal. It is a departure from director Ridley Scott's usual fare, and he makes it work in ways that would have escaped many others. Lending his legendary eye to the camera makes each and every scene resonate with subtle mood. Los Angeles plays like a character itself. It's a setting of supreme organization and planning that holds many lost people, and since the characters are all deeper into a maze than they realize, it's all the more appropriate. The talent surrounding and fleshing out the story make it work far more than it might as an independent film. Nicolas Cage is so deep inside of Roy that it's impossible not to empathize with this guy frustrated by his own very visible limits. First, the inner good guy trying to get out and then the everyman trying to escape his fears and ticks. It's an award-worthy performance with particular qualities that make you think Jimmy Stewart is being channeled through Cage. Sam Rockwell is cementing himself as a chameleon character actor capable of adding unwritten depth to even a simple stereotype. It's an amazing thing to see the young Alison Lohman play a kid 7 years her junior with such sincere innocence, curiosity and natural wit.The movie is a story of such a small and intimate scale that the one thing actually working against it is the name of the great gargantuan director at the helm. Ridley Scott makes a masterwork of every frame as he has never failed to do. He makes his camera open worlds for the audience. The recesses of space, the bleakness of the future and the glory of ancient Rome will forever be influenced by what Scott has brought to the screen. However, when he tackles smaller works, they suffer because of his greater successes. With `Matchstick Men' , as the story begins to feel too pedestrian for a Scott production, you begin to smell that something is up, not because anything in the film or the story falters, but because you know that Ridley Scott is not the kind of guy to make a sitcom script and be happy with it. One almost wishes he had used a pseudonym over the opening credits only to reveal himself after the fact. (Although that would probably have the same effect as when Garth Brooks tried to move away from country music by selling himself as a heavy metal singer under a different name a few years ago.)`Matchstick Men' is an artful enterprise by a cast and crew that are here to entertain. They made a supreme effort and succeeded. If you also watch the behind the making-of feature on the DVD, you'll see that they had a great time doing it. The audience will have a great time watching it, simply for the performances and the craftsmanship of its director if not for the quirky little tale of an LA criminal looking for something better.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dud ending spoiled it for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel conned, or at least I did at the end of the movie. Although I thought the daughter was unrealistically taken with her `new' dad that she had been reunited with, I still didn't figure out the end until it was sprung upon me, though I did watch it late at night. So in that instance I was surprised as the writers / directors intended, though I didn't like the surprise itself. You could say it left a bad taste in my mouth. I would say that before the end unfolded, I was on my way to giving this a 7+ out of 10, with 5 being average, but after the ending I give it a 4 to 5.It's definitely a slow starter, but Nicolas Cage was very good in his role, a little annoying at first, but just became funnier as the movie went on, especially when he was out of meds. Most of the movie is worth it to watch just for that reason. As the movie played on and he began building a relationship with his daughter, I really began to identify and like his character, which is why I hated the ending. The actress that played his daughter did a good job and for the most part I liked her character. I didn't care much for Frank, dunno why, he just kind of came off a little sleazy and punk kid like I guess.My overall point and the big beef I had with this movie was this: in my opinion good movies, or the ones you remember as good typically end with the characters you like winning to a degree, not necessarily the good guys, but the characters you identify with and like, the ones you don't like usually end up worse off. This movie broke that golden rule, just to give you this big bang surprise ending. Well hats off to the director, he had me throughout the movie, surprised me in the end, and lost me because of it. I probably won't ever watch this again because of the way it ends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ahh the con movie, right? Another movie with sappy twists and turns that makes you want to become a detective because you figure it out so fast. Imagine my surprise when I found this film good and entertaining.This film certainly does not play as a con film, it actually plays sort of as a Dramedy. Roy Waller suffers from a terrible problem in which he hates being outside and being around dirt. His partner Frank is a likeable guy, and their trade is conning innocent people. One day, Roy finds out he has a daughter, and that is when the movie completely shifts directions from being a con movie. The movie starts to feel like a good film of the relationship of a man and his daughter. It is obvious he has no clue as to what he is doing, but still, he tries. Over time, he falls in love with her and really wants to start being with her more. Watching this part of the film made me quite touched at multiple moments, do to the tremendous if only a bit over-the-top acting of Cage, and all the secondary actors and actresses. The movie really shows exactly how money and having a great house is not everything, and that some things are more important. This film is spectacular, and definitely deserves much more respect. The characters are not all likeable, and you might find yourself hating every one of them at some point during the movie, but they are real. A con movie with real people, now that is a shocker. This movie doesnt need a twist, with its spectacular acting and already great tale of the bonding between daughter and father, this film gets a 10. One of my favorite films of 2003, only topped by Thirteen. Rent the DVD today!</fullReview>

I am a big Fan of Nicholas Cage and havent really seen a bad Ridley Scott movie but I actually ended up switching this off half way through. Perhaps had I stuck it out Id have got my reward but in the first half this just didnt have anything to excite me, make me think or particularly want to see how it ended up. It just didnt seem to be going anywhere.On the plus side Cage was good if nothing spectacular and his character was brought some humourous moments. The female lead (her name I forgot just now) was refreshing and radiant and definately one to look out for. Though I dont always agree, Robert Mckee claims all films needs something to keep the audience hooked, alas, if this had one I must have missed it or it was too late in coming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matchstick Men was a relief for me since the moment I first read what it was about and who where involved. Allong one of my alltime favorite actors Nicolas Cage came my idol in direction Ridley Scott. But the unique thing was that this didn't involve any spectacular event like Columbus discovering America or Maximus killing the Emperor. Instead it's a con movie. With the emphasis on CON. It's all a con. Not only the characters are con men and the script is based around that but the movie itself is a con.This is hard to explain without giving away to much spoilers but let's just take it from the same level as the IMDB message board. Yes this movie does contain lot's of twists and double con's etc. Many of them (in backsight)where very easy to spot and that's why so many people might have given this flick a grade it doesn't deserve. The problem I think is that they didn't watch it in a good setting or weren't able to connect with the main character. Me however was very easily catched into the middle of the movie. It begins with the very opening tune reminding you back of faboulus movie's like Ocean's 11 (from the same writers) and Catch Me If You Can and great picture directing by Ridley Scott. The surroundings and looks of the movie just grabbed me and pulled me right in. Then we stumble on to Roy Waller (Nicholas Cage) a con man suffering from far to many tics (including a fantasticly pictured cleaning tic). His lovely, honoust and yet irritatable chaotic personality is one to fall in love with. Together with Scott's incredible directing he sets up a con in a con in a con in a con. Just don't try to figure it out to much and go with Cage's ride into the con man madness.A misunderstood masterpeace 4,5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disappointing schlockNone of the characters in this movie are likable enough for the audience to feel sympathy for any of them, even for poor Roy, and consequently, the movie cannot be successful on the basis of character sympathy or whatever. So, the only way that it can succeed is by tricking us and surprising us. But it fails badly at that. The actor who plays Roy's daughter is cute, but no way, no how did I believe that Roy could have believed that she was 14. (Does she really strike anyone as being two years too young to have a driver's license?) We distrust her from the start, and this starts us down the path of suspecting that Roy is being played, way too early in the movie, and was utterly unnecessary. The character's true age could just as easily have been 18, and she could have lied and said she was 15, without affecting the story in any way, yet this would have avoided creating audience mistrust. I find this bizarre, and I can't help asking, of the writer, producers, and directors, what were you thinking?This movie needed a slick diversion that would direct our attention away from what was really going on, so that we would be surprised to discover what was really going on. Not only was there no diversion, but at many points it was simply transparent. It didn't even make a serious effort to make the big con believable. I knew then and there that it wasn't going to make an honest effort to con me, and that was barely 45 minutes into a movie that was nearly two hours long. You start to figure out the real con about half way into the movie, because by then it is apparent that there is no other path for the plot to take. The entire second half of the movie is a slow-placed play-out of what you know is inevitable, with only the trivial details remaining to be revealed to the audience. This movie was a total disappointment, and not worth the time to watch it, even on DVD.</fullReview>

I mean the movie made you fall in love with the relationship between a father and daughter only to have it all be fake.. They did tie it in nicely with the reuniting of Cage with his Ex, but that looked like something rushed as well..This movie should have ended with one final BIG scam with Rockwell and Cage making like 2 million a piece and cage getting custody of his DAUGHTER and him telling her something like, "I opened a bank account for you, now that its official that i have joint custody", then she could open the checkbook and see one million dollars in the account!

		<fullReview>I'll just be honest. I knew the con the entire time. An observant viewer could tell that our little miss Lohman was conning poor mentally unstable Cage. You could just read between the lines the whole time. The key to clueing in on the ending is to read behavior. Cage admitted that Rockwell was his protege and that almost sealed what I was thinking. There was just something about Rockwell that never seemed cosher with me. He seemed to be conning Cage the entire film just waiting in angst to set him up. I knew almost immediately that Lohman was conning. I just read her manipulation too easily. I believe this film hurts because of this. The film has wonderful moments between Cage and Lohman. I'm telling you right now that Lohman is going places. She just has this mesmerizing screen presence. I bet she just glows when she enters a room. **/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazingly well done film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott did an amazing job transfering this movie from the novel and delivers a wonderfully entertaining and enjoyable film.Nicholas Cage's performance of a man riddled with tics and phobias deserves high praise as does Alison Lohman for being able to pull off being a 14 yr old despite actually being 10 years older. Sam Rockwell adds the finishing touches in what was most definitely an entertaining and mouth-dropping film.Both Cage's and Lohman's on-screen chemistry fittingly akward for the film as Cage plays a con artist reunited for the first time with his daughter Lohman. Soon after, finding that raising a daughter and being a con artist are both too demanding on their own, he decides to integrate the two and teach his daughter some tricks of the trade. Rockwell rounds out the cast as Cage's con partner, delivering just the amount of comedic acting to balance out Cage's entertainingly interesting tics and movements on camera.The film itself was very well done, providing a sound and believable story between father and daughter all through out the film and makes this film a delightful watch. By the end, Ridley Scott ties up all the loose strings and finishes up his film "Matchstick Men" with an ending that is sure to surprise and amaze.Well delivered, well performed and highly pleasing, this is a film for anyone who enjoyed "The Sixth Sense" or "The Usual Suspects" but with a lighter and more comedic approach.4 Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was sort of worried about Nic Cage after seeing stinkers like 8mm, Snake Eyes, and Con Air. But then he comes along with Adaptation and Matchstick Men. He is FABULOUS in this movie. Just watching him bring the depth of his character to life was a real treat. His ability to pull off his physical and mental quirks without really going over the top was incredible. Adding to the fabulous acting was Alison Lohman, who lit up the screen in every scene she was in. My wife told me she was 22 when the movie was filmed. I said "whoever wrote that must be wrong!" Yes, she was indeed 22 and her ability to play a 14-year-old was nothing short of astounding.I really don't want to say much about the plot because it is intricate, interesting, and well done. I've always loved "con-men" flicks, this is one of the best.I'd call this a MUST SEE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley proves himself as one of the best directors of our time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With 2003's Matchstick Men, you really now have to consider Ridley Scott as one of the best directors of all time. Not that he hasn't already been lavished with honors in amassing three Oscar and multiple DGA (Directors Guild Association) nominations. Just taking a glance at his behind the camera work and we see an epic (Gladiator), a historical war film (Black Hawk Down), a woman's revenge movie (Themla &amp; Louise) and two science fiction revered films with Alien and Blade Runner. In fact, since Scott became an active director in 1977, one could argue that only 1492: Conquest of Paradise was a flop. Not bad for the genius behind no less than 14 films.But it was 2003's Matchstick Men that had me lift this great director into the 'incredible' status where only Spielberg and a few others lay their hats. Why you may ask, would a film that may just end up a speed bump on a lengthy career catapult someone to such lofty status? The answer was in how I felt Matchstick Men completed the genre superfecta. M-Men is a caper-comedy, and now Ridley can lay claim to having directed films dealing with horror, terror, futuristic cyborgs, women on the run, a serial killer and a Roman soldier just to list a few. Outside of Spielberg, I can't name anyone that has been this diverse in his selections and this successful in the eyes of the paying public.Matchstick Men is another term for 'con-artist' or 'flim-flam man', and is the story of two maestros of the con, Roy and Frank (played expertly by Nicholas Cage and Sam Rockwell accordingly), who set out to graduate to the big time swindle with a money exchange scheme involving a wealthy philanthropist.Two obstacles seem to impede their smooth operating style and ultimate plan. First, there is Roy's compulsive behavior. He has tics and involuntary twitches. He has an obsession with cleanliness and his two vices are eating tuna fish and chain smoking. In short, Roy is an eccentric in a profession where being normal is a definitive asset. Also complicating matters is the introduction of Roy's 14-year old daughter, Angela, (played in what should have been a nominated performance by Alison Lohman) who runs away from home to spend time with the father she never met. Angela is a distraction for Roy and soon, he finds himself entranced by her youthful energy and his acceptance leads him to allow her access to his world of the grift.The plot thickens when Frank is able to convince Roy to go for one big con. The set up seems perfect, a curious and newly acquainted rich friend of Franks is interested in the quick buck. After a smaller transaction proves the men are good on their word, they set the price high for the con. An intense game of confidence then plays out with Angela becoming a central piece of the puzzle and where nothing is what they appear.Matchstick Men could have been a laugher had it not been for the incredibly rich performances by the central leads. Nicholas Cage has put his second strong performance back to back after last years Adaptation, and Lohman and Rockwell are the perfect straight men to Cage's erratic behavior. Some of this credit can be given to the screenplay by Nicholas Griffin, but the majority of kudos are for Ridley and his fast paced directing style that keeps us interested in a con film that is clocked at nearly 2 hours.What's next for Sir Ridley? Well in 2005, Orlando Bloom and Liam Neeson will star Kingdom of Heaven about the 12th Century Crusades, and then in 2007, it's Keanu Reeves and Ben Kingsley in Tripoli. Both are epics that are awaited with restless anticipation. Mr. Ridley, I will begin to buff your Oscar. We will be seeing you shortly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good performances, implausible story line; see it anyway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>spoilers- story outline and plot ploy revealedI liked this flick because the actors do a good job. The story is simple; a middle aged neurotic con man who lives alone goes for the long con or a big money prize while he trys to cope with the appearance of his never-seen-before 14 year old daughter in his otherwise neurotically ordered life. He's neurotic about cleanliness, bright sunshine and insists on opening and closing the doors 3 times before he finally swings the door back. Funny thing is he only does this in private and never with car doors or shop doors etc. Anyhow aside from being implausible in this matter the film also suggests that the man's lack of an emotional relationship is at the base of his neurosis. Hey presto get a relationship and he's not-neurotic and enjoys life for a change rather than earning a big pile of money as he's being going along doing so far. I suppose it's the magic of hollywood but I couldn't help feeling that this idea is the oldest con known to entertainers, but not just any old entertainers hollywood ones in particular. Aside from this oldest trick in the 2nd oldest trade this is a good film worth a look, Alison Lohman the 14 year old is suitably engaging to win over an audience to the idea she could win over her emotional basket case 'splitup with her mom from birth' streetwise con man dad. Nicholas Cage who I am no fan of plays this kind of role well, and the switch back to a so called functional dude works well, he even gets some laughs as his orderly life goes 'off the rails'. The subdued approach of the film by blockbuster director Ridley Scott is good but I wouldn't rent the movie if I were a fan of his but I did rent it knowing a capable director was behind the package. All in all entertaining but a little self mockery at the con men of con men that is hollywood, taking the viewer for a ride past the same place for the thousandth time like some 2nd rate cheap crook taxi driver would have made this film better and more realistic for the ounce of honesty it'd have introduced. This may sound like schadenfreude but it's really a plea for artistic responsibility of sorts. 7.4 out of 10 Viva Hollywood!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i was so glad to see a unique movie after many disappointments . Cage does a masterful job along with the supporting cast . i found this movie really humorous in an original way especially cages disorder and how it effects him and those around him . i was amazed that the girl who portrays his 14 year old daughter is really 25 . she transforms herself into character perfectly and surprises everyone towards the end of the movie . Cage outshines all of the cast though he is a very talented multi character actor and makes this film so good. If you are thinking about picking this movie is say do so &amp; you will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Not A Bad Film, Just Not A Very Good One....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually I did really enjoy Matchstick Men except for one glaring lapse in judgement and that was the "ONE YEAR LATER" epilogue. It completely killed the buzz I got from the first hour and fifty minutes.First of all I might of come into this film with a different mentality because I was informed of a major plot twist before hand. It ruined the surprise but it did allow me to focus on the construction of the whole thing and not really get caught up in the father/daughter thing. It all worked pretty well, although the main scam seemed to rely too much on chance or rather the complete trust in knowing for certain another character's reactions to situations.As always Ridley Scott makes a good looking flick and this one is no exception, I love the breezy look of the film, its funny that both Tony and Ridley Scott films seem to look the same but different, I am not sure what it is, maybe Tony uses more smoke, I dunno. Anyway this film looks and also sounds amazing.The main leads are also phenomenal and it seems that for some reason they were all forgotten come oscar time, not even a mention leading up to the nominations which surprises me, especially Cage And Lohman,Cage with his ticks and twitches and OCD induced freak outs. He's just a great actor no matter what any one else thinks. Allison Lohman is a revelation. She kind of looks like Elisa Cuthert, but man is she good at playing a 14 year old considering that she was around 24 at the time. Sam Rockwell conisitently creates good characters and that little hint of a Walken impersonation made me want to hear more. Its a good film and if not for the ending I would be very dissapointed in its complete ommision from the Oscars. Although this ending doesn't compare to the horrible ending to Spike Lee's 25th hour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard that this movie was good, but i must admit it was better than expected, and that's mostly thanks for Nicolas Cage, never have i seen such a good and solid act from him, and he's funny too damn!Very short the movie is about 2 con artists, one of them, Cage, have some sort of stress disease and therefore goes to see a shrink, the shrink thinks it may be becuase of his past and therefore he meets up with his daughter who completely change him and gives him life and he suddenly becomes more open..It's a very nice movie, as usual Ridley Scott is a real master in telling stories, and i must admit that he's really becoming one of my favourites, this movie has just about everything, it's actually quite a nice movie that makes you feel good, and then it has one of the most brilliant and unexpected twists i've seen since Fight Club which really left me with my mouth open, well done! Worth to watch indeed 8/10.-ks</fullReview>

Ridley Scott demonstrates that he is capable of hitting one out of the park in any genre in which he chooses to work.The story, meanwhile, is engaging and the plot twist at the end is thoroughly endearing. This is not a "great" film but it's a darned entertaining one. Movie historians will one day be scratching their heads, wondering how a film of this caliber could be so widely ignored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the sub-genre of the con man movie, David Mamet's "House of Games" would be hard to beat. "Matchstick Men" does not even qualify to compete, its very much second league stuff.For the con to be pulled of with panache it has to be smart and well written. "Matchstick Men" is neither. Director Ridley Scott ultimately has to resort to soap opera manipulation in order to bring the movie to a supposedly satisfying end. He should know better.Nicholas Cage who over the past few years has developed into a fine actor can add this portrayal to his growing list of acting achievements. With a worthy screenplay he could have been sensational. Sam Rockwell reprises his quirky and extremely likable persona which has been used to great effect in a number of indie movies. He's earned a right for a shot at the big time, but hopefully mainstream Hollywood will offer him more challenging roles than this one. He's an exceptional actor and deserves more than playing side kick to the big star. With so much talent aboard this one should have been a winner. It's not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to neuroses, Roy makes Woody Allen look like the Dalai Lama.He's the obsessive-compulsive conman played by Nicolas Cage, in Ridley Scott's enticing but defective dramedy Matchstick Men.When he's working a scam, it's not the cops Roy gets antsy about, but the microbes floating around in the air. Everywhere. Right now. Out to get you.His partner-in-crime and brash protégé Frank (Sam Rockwell) worries that Roy's multitudinous tics and phobias are eventually going to land them in hot water. To compound the problem, Roy's shrink (Bruce Altman) reunites him with his 14-year-old daughter Angela (Alison Lohman), and it's not long before she's kipping on the couch.She upsets Roy's carefully balanced pattern of existence with her clutter and bad table manners, and threatens to blow the biggest swindle of his and Frank's joint career.The premise is beguiling: Cage tortured with twitches, having to balance parental responsibilities with his commitment to ripping off hardworking Joes. It's fun for a while, but something's got to give.Disappointingly the same goes for the plot. It engages you with the deepening bond between father and daughter, but then late in the game, Scott takes his eye off the ball and leaves their relationship up in the air.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>spoilers There are two ways of looking at MM. To talk about it as a con movie involves divulging the plot, which should be left for the viewers' own enjoyment. I am therefore more inclined to look at it as a father-and-daughter movie. With two sons but no daughter, it's easier for me to empathize with movies such as Johnny Q. I do of course enjoy movies such as I Am Sam. While there are many reasonably good movies in this category, the best is Poppoya (1999) (Railroad Man), which I found deeply moving. There are also movies which, although technical not father-and-daughter, have the similar sentiments. Of these, the best is Whale Rider (2002) (grandfather and granddaughter). And then, there are other movies where father-and-daughter type of sentiments are present, although not the main theme. A most prominent, recent example is Theoden and Eowyn, in Return of the King. Even in Mystic River, we see a little bit of sweet father-and-daughter relationship before the daughter is murdered. The unique thing about the father-daughter relationship in MM is the layering. But even before the layering develops, when the daughter (portrayed Alison Lohman) first shows up, there is immediately a breath of freshness that is perhaps a little unexpected. The easy congeniality with which she handles this first encounter not only calms the sometimes neurotic father (Nick Cage), but also leaves the audience with a sense of relief that they are spared a sentimental scene of cliché. While there is more than meets the eye, the audience fully enjoys the ride as the relationship deepens and takes some familiar turns. This second layer works so well that the final scene, on which the entire film stands or falls, becomes convincing. Cage's line `I know your name' says it all, while the girls parting acknowledgement of `dad' has a natural sincerity. The final shot, a mere glimpse of the girl's gaiety in the car, effectively conveys the message that a considerably heavy burden had been taken off her back as a result of this chance meeting. Cage and Lohman deserve a lot of credit in making this whole thing work. As to the con part, the audience is given two good hints. In the father's first lesson to the daughter, he gives a cardinal rule: don't be conned by the people you are trying to con. Then, in discussing upcoming projects with his partner, he says that he does not like `long cons'. Both these remarks become self-filling prophesies. One other thing I like about this movie is the liberal and skilful use of popular music from the sixties and seventies, and even earlier. While examples are abundant, the best is the Swedish Rhapsody used in the scenes when Cage is frantically cleaning and tidying up his house.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who are the Matchstick Men ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who are the Matchstick Men ?Spoiler includedThis was to be the first movie to watch in cinema in 2004. I went to watch veteran Ridley Scott work with the talented Nicholas Cage in this classic modern comedic drama. I did enjoy the movie very much for all the right reasons.Director Ridley Scott, one of the most brilliant and very successful movie maker conveys this well written story to his viewers exceedingly well, unlike his past highly sophisticated movie projects, we find Matchstick Men to be a much simpler modern drama. Nicholas Cage delivers a very strong and convincing performance, a plays the character of this con artist Roy who happens to be extremely phobic, who depends on his pills and shades to get by the days. Cage proves that he has really evolved as an actor and artist. I much loved his performance in Adaptation as well in this movie. The story is as simple as it gets, this con artist Roy Waller, who works with a partner working people and taking away their money. We find our Roy of very peculiar character, he is very cautious when it comes to cleanness, he has a couple of phobias. Out of no where his 14 year old daughter emerges from his past to transform his whole inconsistent life, he finds new hope with her, he sees happiness and begins to ask him self what is he doing in his life ? We find our lead star Nicolas Cage the very phobic Roy Waller in a very tense area of his life, on one hand he enjoyed his daughter's company while he coned people and at the same time he asks his daughter what she thinks if he cleaned up and went straight in a very nice scene, where you find him very interested in what she thinks of that.This movie inspires us to think deep of our lives, do we need somebody to make us change or is that just an excuse to transform. The full cast delivered their roles intact and in place. So in our quest to know the Matchstick Men we ask thy self the same. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was excited to see Matchsitck Men because of its interesting previews and Sir Ridley Scott. I sat down and for 2 hours and really involved myself in the story. Nic Cage plays a neurotic con man whose daughter played great by Allison Lohman comes into his life. Sam Rockwell was great as Roy's partner on crime as well. I can't ever think of a time when I really got bored with this movie, in fact it's such a tight plot you really can't. I think Ridley Scott has done it again, he took this film and gave it endless potential to deliver and with a well played cast, sadly no awards will go its way but without a doubt this is one of the best movies of 2003.-9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>does not live up to its potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sad thing about this movie is how close it comes to greatness. The premise is terrific - an OCD, twitching, neurotic con man who gets reunited with his daughter and struggles to balance his quirks, his "job" and business partner, and his new relationship.You have SO much potential here! You can summon all those feelings of Leon (aka The Professional) and play on the hilarity that Cage provokes in a similar role in Adaptation. Even still, you can pull a terrific "gotcha" at the end as this film does and not be accused of deus ex machina (see Memento, Rosemary's Baby, American Psycho, Chinatown). What keeps this film from the greatness of the aforementioneds is not the performances, not the directing, not the cinematography - it's the writing! This film doesn't know if it's a comedic action film, a heart-felt drama, a black comedy, but it thinks it can be all three when it clearly can only pick one path. If only the screenwriters had invested more time in making this about the characters themselves and less about standard Hollywood plot formulas, you'd have a terrific film. Instead, it's just mediocre with a few good moments. Skip it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great cast in an ill-conceived effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing Nicolas Cage explore a character with an Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder has an entertainment value that transcends any plot, good or bad.But when you decide to make a grifter the protagonist of your film, you are faced with a choice: You can make a "light" picture that entertains with the layers and intricacies of a "long con" (as James Foley does in 2003's "Confidence").Or you can resolve to do a genuine character study, as Stephen Frears did in "The Grifters" (where J.T. Walsh also gives a great performance and reveals the emotional tightrope that con artists walk).But in this movie, Ridley Scott attempts to navigate between those two extremes, and the result is a film where the audience is either unsure if they should sympathize with Cage's character, or they do sympathize, but feel manipulated.In presenting a character with terrible mental problem, Scott lays an "instant sympathy" card on the audience, only to yank the heartstrings in another direction with how the man makes a living. The result is confusion and a conflict that is never given a satisfactory resolution.The film is predictable as well, lacking the entertaining twists of other "heist" or "con" movies. And its a shame, because the film could have worked as a "light" piece with about 3 times more twists and turns.But when you place an actor like Cage in the role of a troubled person, the audience isn't going to "suspend reality" and simply enjoy the ride. Unfortunately, the "reality" that Scott then presents is wanting in many ways. I walked away from the film glad to have seen Cage do some hooting and twitching, but I sure didn't learn anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it about portraying characters with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder that brings out the best from actors? There's Jack Nicholson's performance in 'As Good As It Gets' and Tony Shalhoub's performance in the TV series, 'Monk.' Now, you can add another actor to that list as Nicolas Cage gives a dynamite performance as a con-man suffering from OCD in 'Matchstick Men.' His ticks and mannerisms are just hilarious and fit his character nicely. Hopefully, the Oscar people will remember this performance as Mr. Cage definitely deserves another nomination.Ah, but he was not alone in this film. Great performances came from practically every actor in this project. Sam Rockwell did a tremendous job as did Alison Lohman, who had me befuddled for the majority of the movie. Is she really 14? Was that a typo on her IMDb bio? I don't know! Plus, the actors who played the psychiatrist and the "mark" also contributed nicely to the film.As for the storyline itself, 'Matchstick Men' ranks among the best con movies out there. It may not top 'The Sting,' but it holds its own. However, there's something that has bothered me about con movies since I saw 'Confidence' and 'The Italian Job.' Just how in the world can they pull this con off so nicely, while also purposely putting in factors that would seem to compromise the whole con itself? I find it hard to believe that anyone can establish such a fantastic con that no one has a hint of ever seeing it coming. For me that's just plain unrealistic.Nevertheless, this movie is still quite enjoyable. The ending is quite surprising, even though I felt a little unsatisfied by it. But hey, all in all, this is a pretty good flick!My IMDb Rating: 9/10. My Yahoo! Grade: A- (Almost Perfect)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley, what's going on? (In a good way)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should start off by saying that I don't like Ridley Scott. I have admittedly only seen the German dubbed version of "1492" while overseas, and my German wasn't really good enough to appreciate it fully - but, while it was visually impressive, it didn't seem to be much more than a self-important, grandiose epic. My understanding is that many of Ridley's films fall into this trap. There are exceptions, I know - "Blade Runner" is supposed to be a masterpiece, and I'm not sure why I haven't seen it. But, as a rule, I just have no desire to see Russell Crowe play Gluteus Maximus, or watch Josh Hartnett be wasted in yet another Jerry Bruckheimer explosion-feast.SO...when I saw that Nicolas Cage, Sam Rockwell and Alison Lohmann, all actors that I love, were going to be in the new Ridley Scott film, I was certainly not excited - verging on despair would be a more accurate description. But then the reviews began to come in, and I was forced to reconsider what I expected. It sounded as if, for whatever reason, Ridley had decided to take a break from his usual films to make something much more intimate, taut and touching - it almost sounded as if "Matchstick Men" would be worth checking out.So yesterday I watched it. And I have to say that it was one of the best films of the year. Packed to the brim with surprises (but which, unlike in films like "Boxing Helena" or "Wild Things", were genuinely clever, genuinely suspenseful), with some stunning cinematography, clever use of editing, music, set design, even costume, and a truly touching (not at all sentimental or cloying) script, "Matchstick Men" is already streets ahead of most mainstream films to hit our cinemas at the moment. Add to that the sheer genius of Cage, Rockwell and Lohmann, all giving performances that rate among their finest, and you get a surprising, memorable and provocative film. If it were only a crime caper film, it would be much more tense and intelligent than most. If it were only an emotional drama, it would beat almost every other film of its kind for avoiding heavy-handed sentiment and genuinely sticking in your head and heart. Put these two together and you get a film that really SHOULDN'T have worked (who ever thought of putting "White Oleander" and "Nikita" together?), but it DOES work - it works marvellously. Perhaps Scott's style of direction could be a little more experimental, but it does have moments of fascinating experimentation which (again) put it ahead of any other film of its kind. And really, you just have to respect it for working. Don't be a genre purist when watching this film; and don't be cynically hardened to the possibility of it affecting you emotionally. If you do either of these, you will be unable to enjoy it. Let it be what it is, and respect it for doing what it does so well. And let it touch you, because it will if you allow it. I can't stop thinking about the relationships in this film, about Lohmann's beautiful performance, Cage's surprising restraint, and Rockwell's incredible sense of style. This film was beautiful - it really was. Four and a half out of five. (Excellent work, Ridley. But I'm still not going to watch the rest of your work.)</fullReview>

He has many problems including anxiety attacks. He has facial ticks and makes weird sounds, but he knows how to get things done. I love the idea of a character that is mentally not all there, but can get through life successfully. This movie was in many of the critic's top ten lists. I guess I can understand that. It is definitely different. There are not many movies where the protagonist is played by a character with a neurotic compulsive disorder. The uniqueness of the protagonist is unseen in any other movie I can think of. After literally seeing thousands of movies in my lifetime, I enjoy the uniqueness of this character. Accept it, there are a lot of mentally unstable people in this world, (including me). It is about time that an uncomfortable protagonist is portrayed. I demand more movies with protagonist centering on the mentally retarded and mentally ill surviving through life</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not having read the book, I didn't really know what to expect, but this is one of the most surprisingly good movies I've seen this year. It could have easily been just another con artist (or David Mamet ripoff) type movie, but no, they went the extra mile here.I think the thing that impressed me the most was the script, especially how they handled the ending. Nicolas Cage is also one of my current favorite actors, he always does a good job and almost always makes good movie choices (I think he redeemed himself for Windtalkers by doing this movie and Adaptation). Overall I give it **** out of four stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scott on a smaller scale doesn't disappoint.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While slow to begin with the performances from the three main leads are excellent. The con man film is one genre I always watch out for. This is certainly better than David Mamet's last con man film "Heist". ( Mamet is the king of con man films but "Heist" just left me cold and disappointed. ) Nicolas Cage is never better and Sam Rockwell is always a treat to watch. It's great to see Ridley Scott branch out from his world of epics to work on such a smaller canvas with intimate characters. Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A swindle symphony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an incursion by Ridley Scott in the field of drama-comedy since he's better known by his terror, sci-fi or war works. In this symphony of swindle and counter-swindle played by a couple of crooks one of whom suffers furthermore of agoraphobia, it's difficult to say anything without becoming a spoiler since the plot is full of unexpected surprises though some of them quite artificial and intricate. The direction is not very inventive and the plot develops itself in not much brilliant episodes or scenes showing a succession of swindles not fanciful at all. Nicolas Cage and Sam Rockwell in the role of the two swindlers are neither good nor bad, performing it with no special genius and just fulfilling their professional duties with their well-known talent. This is the kind of movie that doesn't make you to win or lose anything by seeing or not seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matchstick Men has this year overcome all the bogus films that came out this year and totally dominates over "Confidence" with Dustin Hoffman. The film was entertaining, funny, dramatic at times, but it was done so smoothly that it has become a forgettable film.Why is a film like Vertigo still memorable while this won't be in five years? Because Hitchcock appealed to the audience but stayed true to his genre convictions. This film sells out at every turn in order to arrive at a "happy" ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The vote so far for this movie seems rather low; I think it should be 9.7, not 7.9. Perhaps it's because it never quite grabs your heart. Still, Matchstick Men is a film I enjoyed and will recommend to others.If you liked Nicholas Cage in "Adaptation," you'll see he brought his same tenuous grip on sanity to this one. He's the centre of the film and he's marvelous to watch. The way the relationship unfolds between him and his teenage daughter (IS she his daughter?) is delightful. More beer! More pizza!Take a chance. See it sometime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trick of the Tail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a rare surprise this year I found myself completely gratified with not only my experience watching `Matchstick Men' but as I walked out at the end thinking about it long afterwards. And it's due to the way the film was handled in a very professional manner by all involved that grabbed my attention. The story though was easy to absorb. The filmmakers approached this one with just the right amount of daring to make it interesting but with a small pinch of unadorned exposition and character development to remain steady and to the point.The tale of Roy Waller the con man is at the core of this film but it's the story of his deeply troubled life and the changes he undergoes that takes center stage, pushing the con-theme to one side. As you would imagine `Matchstick Men' is a smaller character driven film with only a handful of main characters without any elaborate designs or effects. This is a departure for Ridley Scott of late but it's a great example of just how crafty a director he really is. He knows precisely how to put together and structure a movie, not just as a story but also as an art form. With this film there is a pronounced sense of sincerity not to go overboard and just tell it the way it needs to be told, nothing more.`Matchstick Men' is a combination of genres so it's hard to categorise. I believe that everyone can find something here to enjoy because it's both exciting and intelligent without being too obvious about it. If you get the opportunity to see it then do so, trust me it's a few hours well worth it.Score - 4 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated (**)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott's "Matchstick Men" is unquestionably a very well-acted film. But well made? At times. At other times, not so much. Nicolas Cage gives a phenomenal performance as Roy Waller, a con man who suffers from a laundry list of psychological ailments. He has severe obssesive-compulsive disorder (for instance, he has to open a door 3 times before going through it) and is agoraphobic and prone to panic attacks. With all these problems, I have no idea how he manages to be a successful con man, but since Cage's performance is so entertaining and sympathetic, I didn't mind. Also entertaining as always is Sam Rockwell as Frank, Roy's considerably more slovenly partner in crime. Right as Roy and Frank are about to pull a big con, Roy's life is complicated by the arrival of his estranged 14 year-old daughter, Angela (Alison Lohman) who he has never gotten to know. Angela is an inquisitive tomboy, and before long is demanding to be part of Roy and Frank's escapades. The problem with this movie is the story. There's nothing wrong with the basics that I mentioned above, but rather the fact that this is yet another one of those movies where there's a Big Twist Ending that changes the whole rest of the movie. Those kinds of movies can be great, but here I knew where it was going the whole time, and didn't LIKE where I knew it was going. And when my suspicions were revealed to be true, it was done in a way that I found weak and unimaginative. Further complicating matters is a "One year later..." scene that allows for one of the flattest endings I've seen in a while. Maybe I'm sentimental, but sometimes I have to dislike a movie just because what I thought SHOULD happen, didn't. Once again, there's nothing wrong with the performances and the cinematography is pretty nice. I just didn't dig it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't answer your phone when these guys call</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Synopsis Spoiler! This is a crime/comedy staring Nicolas Cage who plays as an obsessive-compulsive con artist with his partner Sam Rockwell. During the first hour of the movie, they show the tricks of the con artist trade of how they scam people out of their money without using a gun. They are selling $50 water filters to people for over $300 and promising them that they have won a big prize, which they will never receive. This is a very good lesson for us to learn when people call us on the phone.  As they are about to pull off a really big con, Alison Lohman, who is the 14-year-old daughter of Cage, arrives. She has never seen her father and now she has put the big swindle in jeopardy. However, Cage puts her to work and turns her into a little con artist. This is not a job that you want your child to follow in the father's footsteps. I did not like the phobia-addled (carefully-ordered life) part that Cage played. I can't see how he could con anyone with that phobia. The movie is slow at the beginning, but it picks up when they do the big con. If they cut out 30-minutes of the beginning, I would give it one more star. There is a movie twist that is the best part of the whole movie, without the twist, I would probably take away one star. (Warner Brothers, Run time 2:00, Rating PG-13) 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome. Movie making as art. Excellent sound work. A 9, but possibly a 10 if you include the parts that went over my head.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is great, no argument possible. Ridley Scott knows exactly what he is doing and it's no fluke. He's consistant. This movie shows what it means to make a movie into a work of art. Every element of this movie is great: plot, characters, motivations, script, dialogue, music, sound, editing....and on and on.The sound track is very detailed. I haven't noticed that before in many movies. Additional sounds like the chime of the seat belt warning, the sound of shoes on carpet, security chain on the door ratteling, the detail is amazing and enjoyable and surprising.The music is excellent. Ranging from a 13 year old Wayne Newton singing "Danka Shern" to an alternate version of "More Than This" (made famous by 10,000 Maniacs) the music is again, detailed, enjoyable, and surprising. Also, the music intrudes on the movie just enough. Enough to notice and augment the action, but not enough to become a distraction.The editing and direction are excellent and done in a way that is "art" rather than simply "getting the job done." During the time when Roy was waiting for Angela at the park, there was a rapid fire succession of images. My first thought was it was like a computer program, following a logical and methodical process at lightning speed to deliver the intended effect. Not bad, but, hmmm, not exactly. Other thoughts I had about this scene were collage, montage, music video, mosaic, or painting. I'm not sure exactly how to describe it, but it was incredible and I appreciate this kind of effort in today's movie making climate.I give this movie a 9 because it was excellent, but it did not have the inspiring effect on me that I require to award a 10. However, I realized that some, possibly much, of the artistry and content of the movie went over my head. If I had understood it all, I would probably have to award a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somebody give Nic his second Oscar already!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My rating: **** out of ****Today is great day for me, as something joyous happened. I have just seen Matchstick Men.Here is a descriptive trajectory of my myriad reaction to this flick. By the first quarter I knew I would like the film. By the second quarter I loved it to bits. By the third though, I had an about-turn and hated hated hated it. But in the end, it closed on such a right note, I knew there and then that nothing less than a four star rating is deserving of this immensely insightful film. I am thus very hard pressed as to how best I should tackle a review for this flick, for its the kinda film that needs to be experienced and not read about. Of course, I cannot detail the reasons behind above rollercoaster ride, without revealing some of its major "sights". So how? The Sinnerman is physically incapable of churning out short takes? How?Then it hit me. I need not write about the film, I just need to share with all what I felt about it, what I learnt from it, and what's my "experience" of it. Well, the one overriding experience I'm bursting to share is the one powerhouse performance of one Nicholas Cage.So here goes....Nic was a borderline psycho who suffered from a potent mix of agoraphobia (fear of open spaces) and an obsessive-compulsive fixation with hygiene; he literally needed things clean. In fact, the guy spent an early part of the film ceaselessly cleaning and sanitising his entire apartment, for he accidentally thrown out his "medication". Oh, did I mention the guy was also a professional con artist, and a very good one at that? In fact, the whole film saw him planning on this huge scam with his partner (Sam Rockwell)? On top of this, he was also concurrently getting in touch with his paternal instincts, via a recent reunion with his teenage daughter after 14 years?Like a tug of war for the heart &amp; mind, Nic's character was hence struggling to stay afloat. His hands were obviously full from juggling so many challenges on so many fronts (work and home, body and spirit, love and relationships etc). On the outset, this already sounded like the kinda un-subtle characters that Cage seemed stereotypically gravitated towards these last few years. But the reason for this is that few actors can navigate equal arts madness and sensitivity the way he can. My only regret in fact, was that Spike Jonze never considered a "Being Nicholas Cage".Regardless, for I do think that both this performance and his last (Adaptation) has finally hark back to his Leaving Las Vegas days (IMO, still his career's best performance). For just underneathe the veneer of his OTT shtick, laid an evocative gulf of pain &amp; vulnerability, emotional neediness &amp; ironically, a generous dose of decency and goodness.Above uncomfortable mix of psychological markers are never easy to articulate individually, much less synergistically. It is thus a measure of Cage's certified acting chops that he imperceptibly blended it all together and made it so easy for us to identify them all on screen. His lucid performance in this unforgettable role was thus so spot-on, it cut through my skin, flesh and bone and back out the flesh and skin. Such experiential decapitation is becoming less frequent, the more movies I see. I am thus wildly appreciative (grateful even) for those all-round extra efforts taken. Somebody give Cage his second Oscar already!Okay, let me explain further why I felt Nic Cage's character deserved my unprecedented, undivided attention for this whole thought piece. For it exhibited an uncanny intuition for anyone who's ever been afflicted by psychological "wounds" before. It attempted to shed light on why some people act they way they do. Most of all, it aimed to convey something we all ought to listen and learn about.We have all seen various shades of people like Cage's character before. You know, the kind who's very capable on their professional, intellectual front but fail terribly in all other departments, from arrested emotional developments to social situational blindness to all round lack of relationship intelligence. These people are, for lack of a better word, embarrassing.But Cage struck such a perfect note as "the conduit" of this film; he successfully channeled the film's condemnation for insensitive pricks like me. For he revealed hidden depths in these "caricatures" which I seldom (care to) think about. Despite all their norm-aversed idiosyncrasies, these people may too have pain with no one to share with, they may too have fears that can't be allayed and they may too have love but no one/ nowhere to give? We are all conflicted people, us humans. But not being socially "malleable" may serve to make one even more vulnerable to such weaknesses. The lack of social support (from friends and families) may amplify one's vulnerabilities.But being humans, I'll like to think that we are all still capable of virtues like decency, patience, generosity, love and all other variation of basic goodness, in spite of our personality failures. Cage hence capably conveyed these heartening reflections in Matchstick Men. He did not expect sympathies from us. He was more than capable of working out his issues. I though, the voyeur of this flick, should wise up to one thing; the offensiveness of my very act in dishing out unnecessary sympathies. What a positive spin that was? What a presumptuous b**tard I had been made out to be? I am much humbled indeed.In closing, it must be acknowledged that none of the above revelations would have been possible, if not for the seering clarity and boundlessly fearless performance by Nicholas Cage. I instinctively responds to such forceful deliveries. He thus deserves every bit of my OTT trumpeting. So you don't believe me, do you? This drool gooped piece of Cage worship isn't worth it, is it? Whatever. Just go see this film and let's talk some more.I'm done. For now. Later.</fullReview>

And then tell me if I was wrong, you'll be two steps ahead of the movie if you have at least an IQ over 80.Ridley, please stop making this crappy movies and go back to your style.

		<fullReview>*POSSIBLE SPOLIERS*From start to finish, this movie never stops being entertaining and thought provoking. In one sequence, you're watching a heartfelt sequence of a man finally getting to have father/daughter time with the child that he never had, and you honestly forget that what they are doing is swindeling people, people who don't have alot to spare in the first place. But, this is not an unapologetic movie that simply turns unethical charecters into heros, even Roy himself admits that most of the people that he swindels, do not deserve it. The film has enough light-heartedness to be fun, but enough intelligence to point the camera at the victims. This is a movie that knows that there are several sides to everything, and that what you may think is one thing at one point, can in actuallity, be something completly different. And though this movie has many twists and turns, non of them cheapen the story in any way and help to inrich it in reality and originality. This movie is not for everyone, which is one of the reasons why I like it so much, this movie is for people who have gotten born with all the same crap and like to see a story with charecters that are relatable. 11/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>House of Games meets Paper Moon meets As Good as It Gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** Spoiler (?) *** I wonder if David Mamet was ever asked permission for being so heavily "quoted" by Scott in this movie. The core of MM is very much similar to Mamet's "The House of Games".The sequence when Cage and Rockwell talk outside the car after the big sting gone awry is almost identical to the one where Mantegna and his buddy stage a similar conversation in Mamet's film. The only thing that's different is the identity of the victim.... Apart from that, Cage is brilliantly playing a smalltime con with a load of neurosis and tics in desperate need of affection. Much in the same vein of Nicholson in "As Good As it Gets". When he meets with is long lost daughter the chemistry between them mirrors the one between the two O' Neals in "Paper Moon". The performances are consistently good and the writing is impeccable, the only - minor - flaw is a kind of patchwork sensation, if you get my drift. The film mixes many atmospheres not to say genres. It's not a comedy, not a thriller, not a drama, but a medley of all these. Luckily, it works. Just one more thing: Sam Rockwell. Great performance.</fullReview>

Actually, the movie, which does have an incredible and strange beginning, begins to travel in too many directions of genre. We don't know if we're watching a comedy, satire, drama, or whatever. And until we learn the excellent plot twist, the film asks us to really stretch our acceptance of the plot and the characters, especially the teaching of one's daughter the skills of the con game. But everything makes sense when the twist is revealed, and that makes everything before it sensible and enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to review this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSTruth be told, I think I probably summed up this film with my title. "Matchstick Men" is at times powerful, at times moving, yet at times slow and tedious. Nicolas Cage is occasionally stunning as Roy Waller, a conman with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, but at times his performance is similar to the disorder itself and is incredibly inconsistent. Cage seems to switch from stunning acting one moment, to ridiculously wooden the next. His character provides the occasional laugh, but sadly too many laughs are provided by his closing of doors. When studying Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, an actor should watch "As Good As It Gets" and witness Jack Nicholson's performance to view how to treat it properly. Sadly Cage obviously didn't.Other than Cage, the acting is relatively upto scratch but nothing special. Sam Rockwell as Frank Mercer is playing what seems like exactly the same character as he always plays. I wouldn't say Rockwell gets a bit type cast, simply as he isn't, but in everything I've seen him in, he's got different characters and mingled them to make the same person.Irrelevant of acting capabilities, what else can be said about this film? The plot is up to scratch, if somewhat predictable at times (although one twist at the end is clever, if obvious looking back at it), the directing is as you'd expect for Ridley Scott &amp; the cinematography is at times stunning. Other than this, there is relatively little to say. This film is by no means the best film of the year, but it is by no means the worst. It's good to watch if nothing else is available and you fancy to be moved (and slightly depressed perhaps), but ultimately, don't expect anything special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW! IF Cage doesn't get the Oscar, then there is something WRONG!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matchstick Men is a film about an obsessive - compulsive, agoraphobic, neurotic con artist who learns he has a daughter... and his whole world turns upside-down from there. Riddley Scott did an amazing job on this film, and deserves the Oscar for director as much as cage for acting. Alison Lohman (24 years old, would you belive!) is amazing as Cage's daughter. the story and everything works... even the music is awesome! FIVE STARS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was lucky to see this plus another film; - double-feature. It's been many years since I've seen a double feature, and I hope they come back. Cage plays a con artist and Sam Rockwell plays his partner. Cage plays a part which I think should win him an Academy Award for his fine acting. He is a fussy neatnick, an agrophobic, afraid of germs, and he has an awful tick and many idiocyncrasies, but he is smart. His unknown 14-year old daughter find him and wants to live with him causing him much distress. He goes to a shrink who helps him. He loves his daughter but after much involvement they get into a lot of trouble. In the end he becomes rehabilitated and all ends happily. I actually found myself crying for both him and his daughter and his partner. There is a lot of emotion and tension in this film. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicholas Cage was just right from the beginning until far past the end. I kept thinking about the movie and what I saw and it had just trapped me from the very beginning. The film was shot with such economy and all the little things do add up. Nothing was wasted. The people in the cast need to all be admired and praised. The writing and directing was so subtle. Make something so casual that you forget that you are dealing with thousands of little things which all add up at the end and after. I want to see it again. I enjoyed the experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's rare in this day and age we get a good story well told, without having to resort to huge explosions, CGI or large breasted eye candy. Matchstick Men is one of these rarities.From start to finish, the intricate layer of personalities and storylines is rich and diverse, even the minor characters are fleshed-out and convincing. The Story is very strong, as one would expect from a novel adaptation, and the viewer isn't allowed a moment's rest.Cage's portrayal of someone suffering from OCD is very accurate, he has to open and close doors three times, he becomes obsessed over dirt and dust etc. If you've ever known someone with this disorder I'm sure you'll see a little of them in Cage's character.I liked the way that his various tics rise and fall in intensity based upon how you would expect the character to be feeling at that point of the movi e. When he feels bad, the tics are worse, and vice versa. I think is a very clever use of symbolism, and helps to give a deeper understanding of what's going on in his mind.Cage plays a conman with integrity and moral fibre so poor, it's as if he's made of matchsticks. When he suddenly finds himself having to raise a young girl, he finds himself having to examine the example he's setting for her and the effects he is going to have on her life. It's a charming, well told story which is both funny and thoughtful.I'd have liked to have seen more of Gary Oldman, Cage's long suffering partner in crime, the dynamic between these two Hollywood giants was rather good, and left me wanting to see more of them together.I won't talk about the ending, as so many others have done.I have a message for all the morons who felt it necessary to talk about the end though:You either fall into one of the following two categories.1: Yes, well done, you managed to sit through a whole movie, and OH MY GOSH, it didn't turn out exactly how you expected. It happens, get over it.2: Waaay to go, you predicted something vaguely in the region of what would happen, you're some kind of super genius at spotting movie plotlines, I bet your friends simply LOVE the way you point out what's going to happen in a loud voice 5 minutes before it does. (or they would if you had any) And now you're off to post how awesome you are on the internet. Could you BE any more pathetic?In both cases, please don't spoil it for others who haven't seen it by giving away the surprise. I know most of you don't do it on purpose, but giving away any information at all about a films ending, no matter how trivial you think it is, is ruining it for someone. Keep to a common rule, No talking about the end of films ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One person on here said he didn't believe anyone who said they saw the ending coming half an hour into the movie, but he's just someone who hasn't watched as many con men movies as I have, because if you're familiar with the genre you don't even have to try to figure it out. My girlfriend didn't figure it out and really liked the movie, but it's just not as much fun when you see it all laid out. If I had been surprised I would have liked the movie much better, although I doubt I would have loved it even then. And now, for people who disbelieve the end is easy to see coming, I will explain:***************************** SPOILERS *******************************In a movie about a con artist, there is always a big con. It might have been nice if Matchstick men skipped that, but they didn't. The con men themselves weren't involved in a big elaborate sting, they were involved in a fairly small, simple con that feels like an aside to the film. So one immediately thinks, where's the big con? And if you have ever seen another con movie you are going to realize that the guy never spoke to his ex and that the doctor came from the partner, another con man, and the daughter came from the doctor, so basically nothing has a solid base. Therefore, since it's a con man movie, the girl is not his daughter. If you have seen more than three con men movies and didn't get this then you just weren't thinking at all.**************************** END SPOIILERS ***************************As for the OCD stuff, it's done better on Monk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever had a really great prank played on you? No matter how funny the prank actually is, its been played at your expense and so you laugh heartily, but inside you're pretty p***ed off? That's how I felt sitting through Ridley Scott's MATCHSTICK MAN. A film that's so good, and yet in the end, goes one step too far.The story stars Nicholas Cage (Adaptation) as Roy Waller, a con-artist with what seems like OCD. He can't help but clean things; he a tad bit crazy that way. His partner in crime is Frank (Sam Rockwell, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind); he's the brawn of the operation to Roy's brains. Frank spends most of the movie setting up people, and Roy goes in for the kill.When Roy runs out of his medication, he goes to a shrink to get some more. Only to face the fact that he wishes he had a relationship with his daughter (Alison Lohman, White Oleander). Eventually the two meet and they strike up a relationship. Pretty soon she's in on some of Roy and Frank's con jobs.MATCHSTICK MEN is a brilliantly conceived movie that refuses to remain at all conventional. Roy and his daughter Angela have this unique and fun relationship. It's great to watch a man fight his quirks for the people he loves. I loved that the moment Angela shows up on Roy's doorstep that his immaculate house is dirtied and yet Roy doesn't seem bothered by it. That's real progress.Nicholas Cage does a fine job as Roy. He walks the thin line between a real person and a cartoon so well, you sometimes forget you're looking at the guy from SNAKE EYES. He plays these larger than life characters with so much vigor you forget he's acting.Cage is best in the small scenes in the Supermarket. There is this beautiful women (Shelia Kelley, Nurse Betty) that Roy really loves. They have this connection with so few words. Like they long to spill their life stories out at each other, but they just say hi to each other and that's almost enough. When Roy finally asks her name it's like a floodgate has open, and he is a man reborn.What bugs me about this film is that I'm not sure about the ending. It's everything I have ever wanted in a movie and yet it left me cold. It's hard to explain why because it would ruin the movie. But I guess it's an important lesson in the fact that "there is no such thing as a free lunch", and "what you sow, must also you reap."Now that I think of it, this film reminds me so much of the outcome of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Of course Alex deserved what he got in the end, but don't you feel sorry about it. Roy is not a good person, he's taken advantage of everyone who he's come into contact with, but can loving one person be enough penance for a lifetime of sins?All in all Ridley Scott sets a nice light tone on what otherwise could have been a more standard gritty and dramatic picture. His visual style is really close to Noir without the faded fedoras and the stanch seriousness. It's definitely one of those films that will have a hard time being jammed into just one genre category, and that's okay with me.Why not give MATCHSTICK MEN a look, you may be left scratching your head in the end, but at least it's a compelling ride.**** out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matchstick men is one of those films that resurects a genre while bringing in enough new elements to create a refreshing and immersive cinematic experience. In this case, the new elements are delivered by great directing and impeccable acting. Ridley Scott (Blade Runner, Alien) directs this con movie with great agility, handling the camera with great energy and a rythmm that makes the picture very unpredictable, much like the protagonist's hectic personality. Fresh off Adaptation, Nicholas Cage brings another stellar performance, establishing himself as one of the best actors of his generation. The two other notables performances come from Alyson Lohman and Sam Rockwell; two upcoming stars on their way to becoming major players in the movie business.I went into the movie theater expecting an average film trying to bring back an overused genre and came out completely delighted. It is always a surprise to find a Hollywood film that does not rely on fancy special effects but rather, on provocative character development brought by some of the best actors and actresses in the business. If you're sick and tired of the Fast and Furious franchise and superhero movies, do yourself a favor, go see Matchstick men.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who's the Real Con Here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only the most naive viewer will be surprised by the twist most will see coming a mile away. Like most filmmakers, Ridley Scott assumes his audience is clueless, as epitomized by the cheap film-school tricks he uses to convey Roy's disorder (like the cheap film-school tricks Spielberg used to convey Tom Hanks's "issues" in "Saving Private Ryan.") He rips off not only "The Sting" and "Paper Moon," but "Diabolique" and "The Kid," then tries to convince us that what ultimately happens to Roy is a good thing, with a resolution so predictable and perfectly timed that it's, in itself, a con.Scott, who seems uncomfortable with projects that don't call for tons of CGI, over-edits, but, at least, unlike "Gladiator," you can follow the action. I think the movie would've had more bite were it set in the past, where people were much more trusting, instead of our cynically-drenched times. What redeems "Matchstick Men" is Nicolas Cage as a variation of his goofball self.I will say that, whomever came up with "For some people, money is a foreign film without subtitles" earned his paycheck -- it's the best line of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you didn't get the ending...(spoiler ahead)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...then you probably didn't watch it closely enough. I have to disagree with those who criticize the ending. Yes, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out the con Roy falls victim to at the end, but you're working with inside info if you think you can get away saying you saw it coming from the first 30 mins of the movie; sorry, don't think so. So, my opinion--I thought it was a nice job on that part. So many movies are entirely predictable; this isn't a shocker of an ending, but it keeps you interested and in the movie.As for the final ending where we see that Roy is a carpet salesman, well yes, there is an initial feeling of disappointment. Most of you were probably thinking, "Why wouldn't he go back to his trade?" To me it shows how affected he was by the experience. The greatest effect was realizing how he felt; what he had never known before in his life--the realization that having that personal connection with someone had done more for him than anything else he had experienced in his life to that point. So much that it conquered his compulsiveness, allowed him engage in a relationship with a woman he could never have approached before, and to get so much more out of life by investing himself in that endeavor completely. He didn't need aflamboyant job nor a flamboyant life to accomplish that. What I took from it is a confirmation that life's joys are not a result of material goods, but result instead from becoming more through loving relationships as a husband and a father.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be a star-making performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, the film itself is enjoyable enough, but the highlight is unquestionably the hugely appealing Alison Lohman as Angela. So she's older than the character, so what? I thought she was thoroughly convincing as a teenager, and the scenes with her are the best reason to go and see the film. I hadn't seen her in anything else before this, but believe me, she is a joy! Nicolas Cage is his usually quirky self (sometimes too quirky for my liking) and Sam Rockwell is entertaining as Frank - he too should become a bigger name after this. Ridley Scott's direction is crisp and competent, as you'd expect.**SPOILER ALERT**Just a brief word about the twist: like many others, I guessed the big twist early on. You're always on the lookout in these kind of films, but I think it's testament to Lohman's performance that she still managed to win me over even while I suspected her of not being what she said she was. No doubt many people will feel cheated by the ending, but that's the whole point - it's about conmen, and we the audience have been conned ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ending Makes Sense Depending On Your Perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While sitting in the theatre, I was disappointed with the ending of this film. I felt let down and what was a great film suddenly felt only good at best. What can I expect from a director who gave us Black Hawk Down which is one of my least favourite movies of all time. Now after a few hours to digest the twists in the movie, I realize that because of my sympathy for Cage's character, the ending angered me more than anything. I hated to see what happened to him because the movie did not create him as a character to dislike but as one to be sympathetic towards. However after awhile you realize that it was all poetic justice and he was able to come to terms with his fate and so should we, the old what comes around goes around idea. Once we get over our initial need for pay back which no doubt took much longer for Roy, we realize that this is what he needed to allow him to get on with his life and create some REAL human relationships. The whole world crashing down around him scene was absolutely critical if you cared about him as a person and not just a "businessman". In the end he is left with something real which is obviously a step up from the fantasy world he was living in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie offers the audience a tremendous promise and then ultimately suckers us out like the flim flam man protagonist. As part of a work of fiction, we're expected identify with the main character and as such we want him to be successful. When a character we have invested so much thought into ends up failing, we have to ask ourselves, what is the point? That is the feeling we have at the end of this movie. The main character is essentially worse off then when we first met him. Perhaps if this had been based on a true story, this would have been acceptable, but unfortunately it is just a bad work of fiction.</fullReview>

Cage has played variations on this character before, but that didn't spoil the fun. Lohman is very good (and believable) as the daughter, which is even more impressive when you realize she is actually a 24 year old actress playing 15.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into the movie theater having heard virtually nothing about this film, but when I came out I was very glad I had taken the time to see it. I'm a big Nicolas Cage fan as it is, but I think Cage really shows his versatility in this film as an obsessive-compulsive con artist. His obsessions and tics are incredibly believable and even a little funny, making Roy (Cage) a rather lovable character, despite his neuroses. Alison Lohman, too, is exceptional as Roy's outspoken, long-lost fourteen-year-old daughter.And besides just the acting, the film itself was also above-par. The director made some choices along the way that made the film very visually captivating. For example, a few times throughout the movie we see the action of the scene through Roy's twitchy eyes, with everything really bright and moving in fast-motion. The plot was also very intriguing and exciting, involving lying, cheating, mystery, and even a little humor.All in all I give this movie two thumbs up. It's a very enjoyable film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without spoiling the movie by disclosing how or why Roy Waller (Nicolas Cage) comes to his new realization or epiphany, the movie all leads up to a splendid moment with his daughter. In a scene where honesty of emotion envelopes the viewer with a breathless pace, Roy tells his daughter that he sees things "differently now."Roy has at last grown to understand the most beautiful of life's lessons. Casting aside his previous regretful greed and corruption, he sees what is true. It is a moment of demarcation between what his life had been and what it would become. The love that was always in him, the trustworthy and responsible sacrifices he will make for his child, are wonderfully symbolized in the final scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Appealing characters, a good story, and a life lesson as well give Matchstick Men a 9 out of 10! In fact, the more one thinks about the plot the more one realizes how the little things work together to make the whole. Unfortunately, it not possible to be more specific without revealing the ending but obviously, those involved in bringing this story to the screen had a solid road map; they knew where they were going! Those who seek to nitpick the plot elements have missed both the fun of the movie and the little things that make the plot work with only a bit of reality suspension. But this comedic drama's (I've heard it called a dark comedy but that really doesn't fit) strength is not the plot, fun and twisting though it may be. The appealing characters that populate the film are what make this movie a fun date!Matchstick Men(2003)is directed by Ridley Scott and stars Nicolas Cage as Roy, a conman suffering from an obsessive compulsive disorder, Sam Rockwell as Frank, Roy's young partner who tries to keep him in working condition and Alison Lohman as his long lost 14-year-old daughter Angela. Cage is great in a part tailored to his style but still not easy to pull off. His character brings to mind the song "Both Sides Now" where "something's lost but something's gained in living every day."Alison Lohman, age twenty-three when the movie was shot, is completely believable as a fourteen old who fights with Mom and runs off to spend time with her newly discovered Dad. She proves she can handle big screen emotions moving us through several mood changes in short order.The supporting cast from partner Frank (Rockwell) to Doctor Klein (Bruce Altman) to the laundry lady (Beth Grant) all do excellent work developing their screen personas in a matter of minutes, personas believable even at the end after the all the twists and turns. Of course the novelist (Eric Garcia), screen writers, and director Scott, all deserve their piece of the credits.Personally, I see about one half the number of movies that I used to see in the theater - can't afford the popcorn anymore! And if I choose poorly, I really feel ripped off. But this one was a good choice - even without popcorn. A word to the wise: see it with someone you love - so you can compare notes later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, more than any other I've ever seen, shows how important an ending is to a story. A movie can recover from a bad start or even a bad middle, but if the ending doesn't work, then the whole movie doesn't work. I cannot think of any other movie that I have seen in recent years that makes less sense than this movie's. The characters in the last 10 minutes of the movie are not the same characters that were in the first hour and 50 minutes. This film provided a resolution that didn't work at all because the continuity of the story took a total dive.Aside from the ending, this film was excellent. I would like to see more personal human stories by Ridley Scott. He's really good at it and its time he started making more movies like this and less movies like HANNIBAL. Nicolas Cage deserves an Oscar nomination and so does Alison Lohman.I would give the beginning and middle of the movie a rating of 10 out of 10 and the ending a rating of -5 out of 10. If you do the math, I guess the overall score would be +5 out of 10. I wish I could give it more, but I can't honestly recommend this movie because I feel like it betrayed me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked Matchstick Men, but the ending that came after the movie's real climax, that whole "one year later" bit (no spoiler here, but it's tough to talk about this without giving something away) seemed so out of place, so wrong, that I think it was tacked on by the studio, which wanted a happy ending because all the surveys show audiences like a happy ending. They couldn't just leave a likable character, who turns into a good family man and succeeds in conquering his personal problems, in a bad way. I think the studio saw the movie and made Scott shoot a happy ending. The movie was actually over, and then they had the "one year later" scenes. That final bit was just wrong and left a bad taste in my mouth, worse than the bad taste so many seem to have for the plot twist that was the real climax for the film.Also, I expect a plot twist in a con man movie. The Sting set the tone for that. I watched Confidence a couple of nights ago and there was that same plot twist again. I don't mind it if it's a good twist. I think the problem with Matchstick Men is not the twist as so many claim, but rather that the twist wasn't set up as well as other films set up the twist. It wasn't so bad as it wasn't set up too well. I was waiting for it, but I wasn't buying it. It seemed too pat this time.By the way, I highly recommend Confidence. Great style, sparkling performances from Ed Burns, Dustin Hoffman, and that guy who played the "Gordo" character.</fullReview>

Matchstick Men is thriller with its main protagonist (Nicolas Cage), afflicted by obsessive complex disorders of all sorts, earning its living by being a con man. This routine activity is put in disarray, when he met his daughter whom he has never seen. Now a 14 year old smart teenager (Alison Lohman), she obliged him to behave like a dad, a role he obviously does not know how to play. The deft direction of Ridley Scott, good story line and good acting of the entire cast made this film very entertaining. I don't think it can be compared to such classic as the The Sting and it hasn't the darkness of The Grifters of Stephen Frears or the machiavelism of the House of David Mamet. It has the usually twists of such story though the false endings somehow diminishes the plot. It is still a movie I will recommend strongly with a special note for the gifted Alison Lohman, 24, which plays very convincingly a 14 year old girl. As a charming, full of life young girl, she reminds me a little of Kirsten Dunst. This promising role in a big Hollywood film bodes well, I hope for the future of her career. Sam Rockwell, playing the associate of Nicolas Cage is equally good, as good he was earlier this year, in Confession of a Dangerous Mind. And finally Nicolas Cage, perhaps a bit over the top sometimes, is well at ease depicting a con 'artist' man lost between his daughter, who suddenly appeared in his life and his panic attacks caused by his mental disorder. He helps greatly to make original and credible the entire film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts on the wrong foot, with some bad editing and too much focus placed on Roy's (Cage) phobias. But as the movie progresses it becomes steadily more enjoyable, and without realizing it, you're pulled in, and totally absorbed.The ending is wonderfully pulled off. It was a twist that I, at least, did not see sometime. I give it a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes the great Ridley Scott also got old. Trying to imitate a bit "Paper Moon" and a bit "The Sting" he just made a mean movie. Nicholas Cage, after the Oscar, believes really to be a great actor and choose only to act in movies where he is in every single shot. The result is a mess. I did not like it at all. Hannibal already has been a bad sign. Better should be to make "Gladiator 2". Sorry for my bad English</fullReview>

I kept hoping I was wrong - everytime he dropped her off at "home" I really wanted to just see her enter the building, but of course that never happened, so I just couldn't enjoy any of their "father-daughter" moments. I felt like walking out halfway through thinking "what's the point", but I stayed for Sam Rockwell. He always plays a creep, but he's got a certain charisma that I really enjoy. He's even Dwight Yoakamish without the hat... which is disconcerting but good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you come with a Matchstick mentality..You get burned!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Match Stick Men- Rated PG-13 for thematic elements, violence, some sexual content and languageNever go to a movie where the lead players are all con men, because you will never look at another movie without second-guessing if the characters are true to themselves or each other. I hate movies like this. It only worked well. And that was in 1973. George Roy Hill's 1973 Oscar winner, The Sting with Robert Redford and Paul Newman. "Matchstick Men" is hoping to build on the confidence that there is honor among thieves. There's the mark and there's the sting and never the two shall meet. Nicolas Cage and Sam Rockwell play con men that take old people and insecure people and the Newvo-rich out to the laundry without them even knowing it. In fact, they give them the money. In lies, Cage as the more successful con artist who has been storing away the money, is a obsessive -compulsive neurotic and has an obsession with dogs. Rockwell is his protégé, but still needs to make the con just to make car payments. After one of his neurotic attacks and loss of `Medication' that goes down the drain literally, Cage goes to a doctor, who talks to him about his past, in which he said, there is an ex-wife who was going to have a baby. Cage gets the number for the ex and has the doc call her to see if she had the baby, If he's a dad, and what does he or she looks like. Then we meet Angela, the daughter and the obsessive-compulsive con artist forms a bond with his newfound daughter. He even takes her on cons and shows her the ropes, because that is what she wants to do with her father. With all this adding up, you throw in the big con that Rockwell is planning. A white washing of foreign money for American rate at a nice profit for the mark and the cons. It's at this point I start to have my doubts. Who is really in on the big con and who's conning whom? This movie reminds me a little of David Mamet's House of Cards. A thriller about a psychiatrist who's one of her patients is a confidence man. She wants to know what's involved and in the end, the con is on her. Basically, she learns that when you play with matches or matchstick men (another name for a con artist) you get burned. In the best movies, the hero or anti-hero in this case finds that the truth shall set you free.and it does. There is an ending that was not as emotionally impacting as I would like but it does work. In the end, you are the Nick Cage character and what happens to him, happens to you. And his happiness is your happiness. And his loss is your loss. And his life is your life. He tries to justify in the movie that his marks are all deserving and that he never hits on any victims that don't have it coming and in the end, he learns that that is not true. I still liked the Sting and I love movies about cons that work. Matchstick Men worked, not because that the con was the plot. It worked because the plot was the con. If Nick Cage gets a nomination for his performance here, it is well deserved and that's no con. - Mr. Cinema</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not the sting..so please stop saying it is (Potential Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, this is not The Sting. So please stop comparing, that film is a classic. There was also talk of how the climax of the story was unfulfilling, because the big con wasn't all it was cracked up to be. This is false in my opinion, I'm not saying that the con wasn't all that it was cracked up to be, but I don't think that the big con was the climax. I think the climax is what takes place after the con. People are categorizing this film as a "Con Movie", which is typically about one or more con artists trying to make a great and intricate con. This movie is about a man who happens to be a con artist. The man meets his daughter and his life is turning out better...yadda yadda yadda. The directing by Ridley Scott was great, aside from a few scenes in the beginning where the camera work just didn't fit. Nicolas Cage gives a great performance (although over acting a bit, but I'll ignore it because of the likeable character). Alison Lohman gives an outstanding performance, I actually thought she was 15 (she's 21 I think). And Sam Rockwell gives a great perfomance of a character you want to love but just can't. SPOILERS!!!!! The end was a big twist, but left me angry. I didn't want Sam Rockwell's character to do that to Nicolas Cage. And instead of the last few minutes of the movie, there should have been a meeting with Sam Rockwell's character. Now that would have been cool. Part of me wanted another hour of the movie - just to see Nicolas Cage con the money back out of Rockwell...But NO! Nicolas Cage goes to his wife and kids - which just goes to show...Crime doesn't pay, Unless you're Sam Rockwell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another bad third act crashes a potentially good to great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(mild spoilers ahead)Note To Hollywood: Please figure out a way to make a good third act because Matchstick Men could have been a very good movie.2nd Note To Hollywood: I am getting sick of unbelievable twist endings.I sit in the cinema for the first hour and a half or so engaged with the characters, Feeling an emotional connection to the protaganist's plight and then the movie goes ahead and cheats all in the name of fooling the audience with one big "gotcha" twist.Yes, this is suppose to be a con artist movie and I expect twists. But I cannot accept twists that betray the flow of the 1st part of the film. It almost started feeling like another movie.Now I am not discussing the last scene in the movie. I kinda liked the last two scenes even though it was one of those coincidences that really was out of place. But again, I kind of liked it. It wasn't subtle, but at the same time I kinda believed in those scenes.ButAnd maybe I need to watch this thing again, or maybe I am just not sharp enough to pick up on the connecting threads. But man oh man, before those last two scenes, this movie went "off the tracks" which I don't mind so much as the movie going "off the tracks" at the same time it destroyed whatever emotional resonance the story was building up to. All in the name of a gimmick driven twist ending.Right after the movie, I was reminded of a small gem of a movie that convered similar ground as far as the concept of love trying to redeem an emotional wreck of a person who is good at his job, but nothing else. I was reminded of "Zero Effect" the Jake Kasdan directed film which shares some similarities with Matchstick Men. Both characters live off of tuna fish. Zero Effect had twists, but the twists never betrayed the emotional direction of the story for gimmick effect. In fact the twists were kinda of subtle and very much in tune with the characters and the story.With Matchstick Men, I was maybe kind of hoping for the same thing. I guess they don't call it a con artist movie for nothing.5 out of 10 stars(might raise upon second viewing)end kdc</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can I put this mildly? I didn't enjoy this movie. That isn't to say I don't enjoy most Ridley Scott films or even to say that I don't enjoy watching Nicholas Cage but this attempt to cover 'The Sting''s ground was missing that certain something. I guess I went into the movie with one expectation of seeing a movie show you how a con works and that by itself is always entertaining. But this movie seemed to be trying to play that angle while showing a portrait of a man who has made mistakes and is now trying to rebuild his relationship with his daughter. I didn't care about the characters and I sure didn't care about the con itself, which was complex and poorly worked. Scott didn't seem to be too concerned with the reality and believeablity of the crime world he was attempting to portray; the scheme his characters used to bilk the old folks with was more engaging and interesting than the one used at the climax of the movie.To begin with, I kept hearing about how Nicholas Cage does a great character study with someone suffering from OCD. However, there's nothing here that you haven't seen Jack Nicholson do and do better in 'As Good as it Gets'. I had to fight the urge to shout as much during film. And then there was Alisa Lohman as Cage's daughter. There are no suprises in this movie - she's the rebel with the heart of gold, just like the old man. See, we know this because when she first appears in the movie, she's riding a skateboard and it seems like we're expected to know how rebellious and Grrl-power-ey chicks on decks are.I don't take this as a definitive Ridley Scott film, it's just a movie. Something to painlessly seperate you from your $9.25 and make you forget your troubles for a couple of hours. If you want to see him do an epic, watch 'Gladiator'. If you want to see him do sci-fi, watch 'Blade Runner' and 'Alien'. If you want to see Ridley Scott do a summer movie, watch 'Matchstick Men'.</fullReview>

(Tony Shalhoub does the same shtick about a million times better on Monk'). All of this trashed by a plot reversal so transparently obvious that no one in the audience misses it, and the only ones `surprised' are those (like me) hoping, praying that the filmmakers aren't that dumb.But they are.</fullReview>

Then obsessive compulsive weakness' happen.Great movie, kind of a mix between 'Leon: The Professional' and 'The Grifters'. If you've seen the later or perhaps 'The Sting', then you know that con movies are truly the best for plot twists. I have to give kudos to 'Matchstick Men' though, it ranks in the top three con movies of all times. Send me a check for $50 and I'll tell you the other two.Bottom Line: See it. Move to Provo, Utah. Start your own con operation. Realize that there are more layers to individuals then just the skin deep first impression.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My first thought when this film was over was 'Oh my God, I Love this movie'. The truth is, I've loved this movie sense I saw the trailer. Here's the details. Roy Waller (Nicholas Cage) is a neurotic 'Con-Artist' who's partner is Frank (Sam Rockwell). His life is turned upside down when his 14 year old daughter, Angela (played by the 24 year old Alison Lohman) comes into his life for the first time. The movie is mainly about Roy's getting used to having a daughter and juggling his career at the same time. This movie tugs at the ol' heart strings. The acting is superb. Especially the way Cage and Lohman bounce off each other. It's the stuff we go to the movies for in the first place. Ridley Scott is the director and he's not exactly known for dramadys like this. He is known for his epic action like 'Gladiator', 'Black Hawk Down' and 'Alien'. But he handles this like a pro. It's almost like Steven Soderbrough directed it. The movie is also very pretty to watch. It really gives Los Angeles it's due. I've always thought of it as a beautiful place, but never seen it correctly portrayed on film. The acting is really the highlight. Lohman is going places. Hopefully, we'll see some Oscar nominations for this movie. Even if it's for Cinematography, which was excellent. I can't really go into the specifics of why the movie was great without spoiling major plot points. All I can say that it is very character driven. But take it from me, this is a must see movie for anyone.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I decided to spend an afternoon to go see this one on my own, I am glad I did. Most of the time when I go see movies I feel like I am watching them on my own anyway. Ridley Scott can finally show me that he can make other types of movies besides epics and make them work so well. As simple as the movie may have looked, you must read between the lines, because in the end it will get you. Probably one of the best endings to me since The Usual Suspects, it's right in front of you but you refuse to believe it.Nic Cage was great as usual, his twitching was funny and worked well into the character. Sam Rockwell was so great as his "sidekick" he at points was funnier than Nic, but keep your eye on him. Alison Lohman, was just great and adorable, any scene she was in with Nic was well done, she will go places.There are so many things that you should look for in this movie, and you will feel so stupid after the movie is over cause you will feel as tricked as the people they trick in the movie, it proves that it doesn't take much to trick someone. Of course the odds of most of this happening would be slim to none, but none the less it still tricks you no matter what.Well done job by all, I will go sit down and still continue to ponder at myself how I got so tricked at the end....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Uno-dos-tres," is one of Roy's repetitive doings in "Matchstick Men." Nicholas Cage's performance as an OCD-ed con-artist boosts the film's classic behavior. It is a blend of "Catch Me If You Can" and "Ocean's Eleven," and although, not as hip and slick, Ridley Scott shows the realism of both the strength (stealing) and weakness (OCD) of Roy. But what more can happen when his 14-year old daughter (Alison Lohman) decelerates the flow of his job? At the end, we find that his strength shuns him while his weakness wears off. The cast, which included Alison Lohman and Sam Rockwell, was remarkably good, but Nicholas Cage's portrayal of a neurotic, habitual pretender makes him one of the greatest classic characters of 2003. Put in mind that Johnny Depp as Jacks Sparrow should also be up there. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a great movie. It really isn't even that good. I give it three Ds for Disturbing, Draining, and Depressing. HOWEVER, Alison Lohman's and Nicolas Cage's acting, in particular, was excellent. Everyone who wants to be an actor or simply enjoys seeing fantastic performances should see the movie just for that alone. I felt sad for every character in this movie. I really didn't even like any of them. All of them were VERY creepy and no fun at all. This is strange for me to dislike all the characters for I usually love, at least, the really anti-social ones like Hannibal Lector, Michael Corleone, Samuel Jackson's character in "Hard Eight" or even Kevin Spacy's character in "Seven." Also, the movie's ending (the last 20 or so minutes) was soooo poorly structured and terribly unreal. I left the theater feeling as if I was the true victim of the Matchstick Men - as if the last reel of the actual movie had been switched for a fake! For a moment, I thought of the likeness of the film's ending to the one to "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" but then I realized the latter and older movie's ending was clever and all around better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>7 on a scale of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The positives of this movie are that it has a somewhat unique premise and it held my attention relatively well. And, I thought the acting was good. Allison Lohman was especially good and Nicholas Cage did a fine job.But, any movie that "only" gets a 7 has some problems. First of all it was too long. It could have, and would have, been a better movie if they had cut 20 minutes out of it.Secondly, there were just a few too many holes in the twist. Yes, there is a twist and I won't spoil it. But, I didn't think it was handled all that well.Thirdly, I have no problem with Nicholas Cage, but I can say without question that I have never seen a movie (and I've seen thousands) where every single scene in the movie had the same person in it. Yes, he is in EVERY scene. There are probably 50 scenes and he's in every single one! In retrospect, it is consistent with twist, but frankly, after 2 hours of seeing Cage in every scene with his emotional problems was just too much. He is fine co-starring in a movie where he acts normal, but you better be prepared to get overdosed with him if you are going to go see this movie.Otherwise, not bad. Not great. Probably not worth the time and money, but not a total waste either</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall this film is a visually and mentally challenging picture. From the start of the film i was intrigued and interested in the characters. Nicolas Cage's performance is on the mark and equally powerful as his similar "obsessive compulsive disorder" role in Adaptation. The film progresses strong and the character development is solid which pays off in the end. The climax of the film's story is extremely suspenseful, but director Ridley Scott doesn't leave the audience there. Until the final moments of the film Scott entrances the audience in awe and surprise and ends with a great twist. The only dislike i had with this film was certain camera and editing choices Ridley Scott used in conveying the seriousness of Nicolas Cage character's "obsessive compulsive disorder." In the beginning of the film there were numerous scenes where the editing was tight, quick, and flashy. This was very effective in taking the audience inside the disturbed mind of Nicolas Cage's character. Yet towards the end it became apparent that Scott and the editors just gave up this initial theme and editing pace they had started in the beginning. I wish they had decided to stick with this theme which i felt really expressed Nicolas Cage characters' disturbed mind visually. Also, throughout the film there were cheap - looking transitions from scene to scene which just annoyed me. All in all, this is by far one of the best films I've seen lately in theaters. It is an extremely entertaining, enjoyable, and exciting piece of cinema. I give it a 9 out of a 10. GO SEE THIS FILM.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid and Consistent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone who has seen [i]Adaptation[/i] you have witnessed what Nicolas Cage can do. You've seen his talent. In [i]Matchstick Men[/i] he steps it up a notch. His character is Roy, an agoraphobic (afraid of the outdoors) with nervous twitches and an obsessive compulsive disorder revolving around threes but only specified to certain actions. However, as long as hes on his meds the symptoms are managable. Cage is incredible in the details he uses to bring out this character. He keeps the twitches consistent and is constantly surprising you from one scene to the next. When paired with the talented Rockwell he excels even more playing off the snappy chemistry between the both of them.Roy and his partner Frank (Sam Rockwell) are polar opposites. Roy likes everything neat and has a closet just for cleaning supplies. Frank lives in a pig-sty of an apartment reminscent of Joes hole in Joes Apartment. But together they make an incredible team who can design and execute some of the most brilliant cons around. But in there next con an obstacle has presented itself. Roy's 14-year-old daughter suddenly arrives on the scene. Interestingly enough she expresses an interest in her Dad's work and quickly becomes involved. But her eagerness and inexperience could prove to be destructive as well fueled by their own twisted motives.Its a brilliant dark comedy. It slides from one genre into the next with the sleight of a magician's hand. Cage delivers more than a few quotable lines and the con games run like capers. But also there are touching father-daughter scenes that reach their climax during a nail-biting car chase through an airport parking garage.The film's atmosphere brought to mind [i]Catch Me If You Can[/i]. Ridley used clothing and decorations to evoke a feel for a past decade. Hans Zimmer and his mix of lounge songs solidified this hypothesis.Although this is not an epic Ridley still showed off his talent. He exploited the close-up and used quick editing more and more as Cage's ever changing condition would worsen. In one particular scene Cage is sittting at a table in front of a door and a woman opens the door to let the dog out. Blinding light fills the screen and we seen a close-up of Cages twitching eyes. Everything through his point of view becomes exaggerated and anxious tightening your own chest. Then as he leaves the house the film calms down as Cage calms down. It was a wonderful technique used effectively throughout the film.In conclusion the film is solid. It is successful in all areas leaving few kinks in its armor. The acting is superb and leads the film through it's innovative plot. Drama/Comedys that work powerfully on both levels are hard to pull off. A film that can have you laugh out loud, sweat in suspense, and reflect on the complex relationships has something few other films have. [i]Matchstick Men[/i] is unqiue and strange, consistently surprising you all the way to when you are blindsided by the twizzelered ending.[b]A-[/b]</fullReview>

Between his shots and Gage's acting, you could actually feel what it is like to be Gage's character. However, one thing that I could not understand about the story is why I could tell the con when one of the best con-men in the world could not. Maybe Scott wants us to know to show us how mixed up Gage was and what finding love in his life could do to him, or maybe the story was just not that good.</fullReview>

I realized that the melodrama was just to keep you from seeing what was really happening. In any case, this film works on a whole lot of levels, and all three leads give great performances that have you caring about the characters.

		<shortDescription>Genius director Ridley Scott pulls off another excellent job.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lead actor Nicolas Cage and director Ridley Scott should be working together more often. Cage's portrayal of Roy, an obsessive-compulsive con-artist, is complemented by Scott's directing to give the audience an accurate idea of what's going on inside the character's head. As the movie progresses, it becomes increasingly easy to estimate Roy's stress level via the frequency and severity of Cage's nervous ticks. Roy, obsessed with cleanliness and uncomfortable in outdoors situations, is played in a more humorous manner than one would expect, and combined with colleague Sam Rockwell's character Frank, the movie is funnier than nearly any comedy released this year, while still managing to be dramatic.A bond between Roy and his recently acquired 14-year-old daughter is the main plot of the movie. After being convinced by con partner Frank to visit a psychiatrist, Roy attempts to contact his ex-wife, resulting in the meeting of his daughter, who he becomes emotionally attached to and suddenly he questions his borderline-illegal actions (much to the dismay of his business associate). 24-year old Alison Lohman does an incredible job of conveying the actions and personality traits of a teenage girl whose tomboyish ways are reminiscent of recent Avril Lavigne fame.Matchstick Men will reach practically any audience with its elements of drama, comedy, suspense, mystery, and action. Being released the weekend after the slow Labor Day weekend ticket sales will certainly help its performance as well. Combine that with an ending as intricate as that of The Usual Suspects or Fight Club, and you have a movie that isn't just conning you out of your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Attention everyone, rising star on the horizon, or should that be shooting star? Alison Lohman is an incredibly gifted 23 year-old actor. Case in point, this film; she convincingly plays the role of Nic Cage's 14 year-old daughter. Since the only other role I recall seeing her in was as Michelle Pfeiffer's teenage daughter in `White Oleander', who knew she was in her 20's. That aside, this is a well written, well acted look at the mental make-up of a con man and his protégé. It's not a cutsey happy-happy joy-joy kind of story, but it is about trust, family values, and the pursuit of happiness (if that comes with pulling the biggest and best scam of your life). Nicolas Cage has been on the down end on the teeter-totter of his career and finally, someone sat on the other end to raise him back up, almost, to his `Leaving Las Vegas' level. The man's practically flawless in his portrayal of Roy, the `flim-flam man' who's so full of tics and obsessive-compulsive behavior, he makes Jack Nicholson's character in `As Good As It Gets' look perfectly normal. Also notable, is Sam Rockwell as Frank. Without Frank (the protégé), you'd really have no story. Frank is Ying to Roy's Yang and Sam pulls off a brilliant turn as the semi-slimy con artist. I can't give you much more to go on, except to say that I was truly impressed with this gem in a sea of special effects summer movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the supplement that's needed to treat deficiency...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's Cage's miserly (the doggy--bank connection is an uncanny idea), neurotic and over-cautious recluse, with his OCD problem, matching up with Sam Rockwell's devil-may-care, impulsive weasel. You can expect to see a pair of odd men subconsciously acting up to make the audience laugh. This film's about "taking money away from people who are too stupid not to have it taken from them." The wisecracking jokes are hilarious but they're also telltale clues to some of the unexpected events that follow.When a script brings two characters to support the saying, 'unlike poles attract,' one can expect this film to succeed only if its character development is solid. Oh yes, under Ridley Scott's artfully crafted direction and with the great performances of ALL the cast members, this film is a delight to see. Even the actors with the smallest roles get their moments to pump up their on-screen expressions and become part of the whole film.The dialogue in this film is incredibly sharp. This is one of those truly smart films where events happen that uncannily reflect back to little hints in the passing dialogue. Definitely a great ploy to help with the development of the characters and their personalities! The film makes a play on words a lot. Many of the words, in the dialogue, gradually become puns when connected to events. Even a simple word like 'supplementary' brings important meanings to several sets of events. I had a lot of fun trying to make a recall of them. The film includes many wonderful plot twists and scams - be it at a time the characters are taking the audience to the grimy diners, or the laundromats, or the airport bars, or the convenience stores.Even the last few minutes of the film work well for me, almost as if flowing out the dialogue context preceding this scene ... beautifully summing up the concept that there are non-monetary assets, that to some people, are worth their weight in gold. Alison Lohman's Angela is delightful to watch - the sort of energetic and charismatic young lass that would brighten up a dull home. This film has a terrific choice of soundtracks. A Solid B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is wrong to describe MATCHSTICK MEN as a caper-movie, all though the main characters are two great con-men (sorry, con ARTISTS). It is however a wonderful character-driven drama about a neurotic criminal who gets his life turned upside-down when the 14 year old daughter he has never seen suddenly enters his life as he is about to pull a big job. Well, when the ending comes, it turns out that MATCHSTICK MEN was about much more than this, but still what makes the movie is Cage's brilliant, at times hilarious performance as Roy. This is one of those movies you can't really talk about until everyone has seen it out of fear you will reveal too much of the plot!See it and you will know why. But it's a great movie, with a series of wonderful scenes between some very likable and believable characters, portrayed to perfection by Cage in particular, with great support from the always great Sam Rockwell and a charming Alison Lohman who plays Angela.A wonderful film with plot and characters that will take you by surprise.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Film of 2003</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Initially this film looked like just another caper movie but it is really more of a character study.Roy (Cage) is a Con-Artist or Matchstick Man. Roy has an obsessive compulsive disorder and suffers from anxiety attacks. He has accumulated wealth through years of cheating people out of their money. However, Roy's life is empty because he had no one to share his life and fortune with. His new psychiatrist encouraged him to contact his ex-wife about the kid they "could have had" 14 years ago. I wouldn't elaborate further than that because it will ruin the movie for you. The whole cast gave a very good performance throughout.The main fault I found with this movie is that if Roy was so obsessed with dirt and cleanliness, why then is he a chain smoker??? Dropping cigarette ash everywhere doesn't make sense to a person with this disorder. In the movie, Roy confessed to his psychiatrist that he contemplated suicide by blowing his brains out but he didn't go through with it because he would be concerned what it would do to his carpet. How much more hidden tobacco advertising do we need in films?Anyway, I do recommend this movie purely because I enjoyed the acting and the offbeat story. The ending was also satisfactory. 7/10.</fullReview>

Nicolas Cage gives a great performance as usual, but not in that Tom Hanks way. Sam Rockwell is probably one of the most underrated actors. Allison Lohman gives a memorable performance to say the least. I hate reading reviews on con movies because either they work or they don't.

Nicolas Cage plays Nicolas Cage better than any other actor. He is so one dimensional. Cage had a big chance here to show some acting ability, playing a neurotic O.C.D. con man...but he blew it. The movie is almost completely claustrophobic (interiors take up at least 80% of the movie). That would be O.K. if we had a good script....but its lame stuff. It is annoyingly plastic, looks so clean and clinical ...and EVERYTHING appears fabricated. For the story to work ...we would have to somehow like the central character (Cage). I found it impossible to engage with a con artist who rips off everyone he can. When the "big surprise" arrives, it is badly handled. Too contrived, too ridiculous. So the con king loses everything (big deal). Who cares ?? What do con men do after they "retire"? They get a job in a carpet shop...marry...have babies, and live happily ever after.

		<fullReview>When you consider how wooden Nick Cage was in 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' (every time he kissed Penelope Cruz I feared she would end up with a mouthful of toothpicks), his transformation here is total, and he suddenly reveals himself as an acting genius. Of course, it is not for the first time. But it must be the directors which make him so uneven. In this case, we have Ridley Scott at the helm, and a fine helmsman he is, as all know. The story is from a novel by Eric Garcia, who writes satirical science fiction, so that is odd in itself, and then the screenplay is by first-time scribe Nicholas Griffin. It was very bold to take a newcomer and a weirdo sci fi source and base a big movie on them. But it was a gamble that paid off in spades. The magic ingredient to this film is Alison Lohman. She had previously devastated everybody emotionally in 'Sharing the Secret', and now she plays an even younger part of a 14 year-old girl. Being very small at five feet two (Shhh! she hates that) and Nick Cage being tall, the size thing works. She is just the cutest, most engaging, smiley, jumping about with glee like a kid teenybopper imaginable. You just want to put her in your pocket and take her home. But there are deep poignant elements to all of this, and I cannot reveal all the reasons, as we get perilously close to spoiler territory if I do. Sam Rockwell, a kind of poor man's Brad Pitt, is wild, wild, wild, just right in fact. This is all so carefully judged. Cage plays a man with nervous tics, phobic and manic-compulsive symptoms, and a tendency to extreme hysteria and panic attacks. He does this to perfection and it does not appear mannered. So hats off! Tics on! I can't imagine how or where he managed to learn how to do all that, unless he has a few crazy relatives or spent some time in the bin. But he pulls it off, that is what counts. He really is a major actor, you just can't get away from it, no matter that he has always inspired reluctance. He does not seem the sort of guy who should be an actor. He is one of those quiet types whom you expect to see at the airport, who is about to get into the cabin and reveal himself as a pilot, you know, the ones with three gold stripes on their cuffs and the silent faraway look. And then suddenly he becomes somebody. It's mystery time! Well, then there is the plot. It is really really slick. You can't imagine, and I can't tell you. Curl up with this on the sofa, you couch potatoes. (And yes, Dan Quayle, potato has an 'e' when in the plural.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily Nicolas Cages' Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with, this movie is an amazing story and I would love it no matter how it was presented. However it's fortunate that it was told so well with such quality actors and actresses. Nicolas Cage plays a successful con artist {or matchstick man} who is only just barely managing to keep his act together. His world is shaken even further when he discovers that about 14 years ago his now ex-wife gave birth to his daughter, whom he presumed had been aborted. Struggling to "keep doing business" and form a bond with his teenage daughter he turns to a shrink and medication to help him. This is all working fine until his daughter decides she wants to learn the tricks of the trade, then we hit some serious plot twists, but I won't ruin those for you...Bottom line: an amazing story, well told and well acted. EASILY worth the 9 of 10 I gave it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott's tricky caper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think I'll ever forgive Nicolas Cage for 'City of Angels;' in fact, I don't like most of the movies I've seen him in. He has however starred in one film that is an all-time favorite of mine, 'Matchstick Men.' Its plot and characters are almost impossible to describe in a short space, and the twist ending ranks right up there with 'The Sixth Sense' as one of the best ever. But you know what? Even if it had a conventional, happy ending that was no surprise at all, 'Matchstick Men' would still be one of the most enjoyable movies of the last decade. Cage plays Roy Waller who, when we meet him, is a small-time con artist with a rash of personality and mental disorders, none of them completely disabling but put together make him quite a mess. In fact, one of the amazing things about the character is that he can usually pull himself together long enough to complete a con job. These tend to be phone scams, telling people they've won some valuable prize and then convincing them to hand over a check through official-sounding double-talk. He and his partner Frank (Sam Rockwell) are quite good at it... until one day when Roy loses it and has a major panic attack. Frank arranges for Roy to see a shrink and from there the film goes off in an unexpected direction (though I'm not sure what the 'expected' direction would be.) Roy meets his daughter Angela (Alison Lohman) for the first time, a teenager he didn't even know existed. Given his profession and range of emotional problems, their time getting acquainted does not go smoothly; she's something of a troublemaker to boot and so that complicates matters. But a rapport develops between them and he takes her under his wing eventually, teaching her the tricks of his trade, probably because he doesn't know what else to teach her. Helping Angela seems to help Roy overcome his own problems to a degree, so he and Frank decide to pull a big con on a wealthy target and Angela becomes involved in that as well, in fact playing a key role at a crucial moment. To tell more beyond this point would ruin this intricately plotted story, spoiler warning or no. Suffice to say there are two major surprises that pull the rug out from under the viewing audience but are so well-done, one is left open-mouthed in admiration. Director Ridley Scott once again displays his professional acumen and versatility here, delighting in bringing this oddball script to life. Nothing ever feels forced, and the surprises when they come really blindside us. Alison Lohman is perfect in her role as a fifteen-year-old; one would never guess that that actress was in real life 24 at the time. Sam Rockwell is very funny and convincing as Roy's partner. And yes, Nicolas Cage succeeds in bringing a very complex and strange personality to life. Roy Waller becomes so believable to us that by the end of the film, we feel we know him as a person, not a character in a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie is like a blister of pills you didn't want to take. You've got a good-looking cheek on the cover but Nicholas Cage let you understand that the film is not going to be a flat teen-age love story. So you grab it because it has got Ridley Scott's warranty and you don't know what to expect. The beginning is funny, quick and smart (As normally the pills work when you start the cure). After twenty-five minutes the story evolves positively and it's like when you feel your health is getting better... Then things get messed up. It's tough to go on and you would like not to have even started so the only thing you actually start doing is counting how many pills you've got left. When you are finally ready to see the end, this half comedy half action picture switches to a tragic and cruel pre-ending. Lucky you, the last scene is the best one... And it is just like when you bin your prescription. The structure of the story evokes what the protagonist does to make his living and it surprises you so well. I can hardly think about a movie similar to "Matchstick men". The last ten minutes of the film blur everything was given for sure so the protagonist has to acknowledge a bitter and tricky truth. Two minutes later is happy as he has never been before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Let his greed meet his imagination"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Matchstick Men' is a film about con-men. Accordingly, we're never sure which facts are true and which are merely constructed as part of a ruse. The film plays games with its audience: just like a good con, we are subtly coerced into placing our trust in the narrative, and that moment of revelation ? when we suddenly realise that we have been completely and utterly duped ? leaves us feeling hollow and foolish. Director Ridley Scott has dedicated much of the last decade to epics, and few can match his skill for constructing cinematic spectacle. Next to such films as 'Gladiator (2000),' 'Black Hawk Down (2001)' and 'Kingdom of Heaven (2005)' (or even the underrated 'Hannibal (2001)'), 'Matchstick Men' might seem a comparatively light effort, and yet Scott's storytelling experience was just what was required for such an intricate story. Though the film is, superficially, a film about con-men (and the twisting, deceptive narrative emulates this), at its heart, 'Matchstick Men' is very much a character study, an exploration of the relationship between a morally-irresponsible, psychologically-unstable father and his estranged fourteen-year-old daughter.Roy Waller (Cage) is a con-man; or, as he likes to declare, a "con artist." Together with his protégé and partner, Frank Mercer (Sam Rockwell), Roy makes a living out of relieving people of their finances. He doesn't particularly consider himself a criminal, justifying his actions by stating that "they give their money to me," citing his victims' greed and naivety as their own downfall. Problematically, especially for somebody who must always present the appearance of respectability, Roy is also a serious obsessive-compulsive, always edgy and constantly cleaning his already-spotless, multi-million dollar condo. In the middle of a potentially profitable long-term con (the shifty victim played by Bruce McGill), Roy discovers through his psychiatrist (Bruce Altman) that he is the father of a 14-year-old girl, Angela (Alison Lohman). As Roy tries to juggle all these happenings in his life, everything he depends upon threatens to fall apart, and he ultimately discovers a part of life that really is worth living.Nicolas Cage really is something of an on-off actor. That he's got talent is beyond question, but, sadly, for every 'Adaptation' there is a 'The Wicker Man.' However, he is positively excellent here, playing his trouble-plagued swindler ? nervous tics and all ? with a quirky combination of comedy and pity. Sam Rockwell once again demonstrates that he really is a quality untapped resource in Hollywood, his character's vulgar, carefree demeanour in direct contrast with Cage's obsessive-compulsive. The main talking point of the film is, however, Alison Lohman who ? at an astonishing 24 years of age ? manages to portray a flawless 14-year-old girl (or, more specifically, she plays an adult passing herself off as a 14-year-old girl, which only makes the performance even more impressive!). I already knew this age discrepancy coming into the film, and I tried on numerous occasions to discern a mature young woman beneath the rosy grin and baggy clothes, but I couldn't see a thing. The disguise is, for lack of a better word, flawless.For most of the film's running time, the viewer is lulled into a false sense of security, wholeheartedly believing that 'Matchstick Men' is something of a feel-good romantic comedy. Just at the climax, this entire notion is yanked from beneath us, as the entire plot is revealed to have been Frank's own elaborate long-con, a meticulously-calculated bid to claim his mentor's substantial bank account. Don't listen to those who claim to have guessed it from the beginning: my bet is that most of them already had prior knowledge that a twist was coming, and so spent the entire film scanning ever scene for clues. Even with my incredible intellect (and please forgive the modesty), the possibility of the twist didn't even click in my mind until Roy had emerged from the make-shift hospital bed. Despite the twist, the film never loses sight of its main purpose, which is a character study of the father-daughter relationship between Roy and Angela. When the former discovers that his entire life for months has been one huge con, his major regret is not the loss of his million-dollar fortune, but the fact that the caring relationship he had developed with Angela had been nothing more than a ruse. Nevertheless, despite being fooled and robbed, Roy is all the better for it. Ridley Scott has orchestrated a wonderful con!</fullReview>

But also pointed to people who need to re look they're goals and achievements. They're needs and things they really love and care about. To have the courage to change what need to be changed. To forgive and to be forgiven. Chances people have every moment, they only need is to try. This movie can be an wakeup call, or guide in your life. I would easily give an 10 (excellent) for this work. Also i would recommend Adaptation (N. Cage), also an great masterpiece. Both of them would stay in my DVD collection.But ones again, please find out for your self and make your own judgment</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicolas Cage's acting was okay - playing a Con Man with a conscience and a rather nasty obsessive compulsive disorder. But the rest of the cast irked me especially Sam Rockwell as Cage's partner (and apparently, only friend) and Alison Lohman as Cage's long lost daughter who cries crocodile tears every ten minutes! The "twist" was clichéd and predictable (the antagonist is the protagonist's best friend in far, far too many films). It also left me feeling hollow and cheated. I thought this movie would give me hope about family unity, but it's moral seemed to be - people who steal deserve to be stolen from by people who steal. Still, our Nic ends up on the right side of the picket fences at the end - selling carpet and living the fruitful, Christian life with Mrs. Jo Bloggs from the grocery store.On the whole, it's a load of tripe! 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oscar winner Nicolas Cage (Con Air, National Treasure), Sam Rockwell (Charlie's Angel's), Alison Lohman (White Oleander), and Bruce McGill (Runaway Jury, Cinderella Man) star in this comedic thrilling film. Roy (Cage) and Frank (Rockwell) are partners owning a business - but this is no ordinary business. It's the business of the con. While Frank is wily and witty, Roy undergoes agoraphobia and germaphobia - ultimately leading him to a psychiatrist that tells him that he has a long absent 14 year old daughter.When Angela (Lohman) steps into Roy's life, everything begins to change. And now his business is ran by "triple-partners." 'Matschstick Men' is filled with comedy by watching the actors act wonderfully to their parts, and even a twist-ending, that can barely be thought out from the beginning. Between the twists, turns, comedy, and crime, Matchstick Men makes an excellent Saturday-night movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been watching a lot of movies throughout my life, and one of the best I've ever seen is definitely "Matchstick Men". I came across it on accident. I went to see "Open Range" at the theater, and it was sold out. The only other film playing that was new was Matchstick Men at the time, so I figured, what the hell, should be good. By the time it ended, I realized that I may not see another movie that's this good in my lifetime.Roy Waller (Nicholas Cage) has been a con-man for his whole life. The real premise here is that he learns that he has a daughter, so now he must learn how to go on being this father without putting her life in danger. The film has the best ending I've ever seen in a movie, it will take you by surprise, and it will really leave you going "wow, that was fantastic, and I never saw that coming". I don't want to go into too much more of the plot or I'll give it away, but this film is just great.It's a comedy but it's also a drama. Nicholas Cage gives the best performance of his career, and Sam Rockwell also proves that he's a very good actor in this film. A must have, must see film for anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Con men and likable, that is why they can con people. Nicholas Cage is a Con Artist with a range of neurosis, mostly obsessive compulsive and various social phobias (often manifesting itself as fear of the outdoors). But when he is on a job he can pretend he is a normal guy.He is so good at this he has a nice house and a safety deposit box at the bank with an undisclosed amount of cash (though the movie hints it is over 1 Million).Then in comes Angela, the 14 year old daughter he didn't know about. It makes him question his life and he has to consider what he is doing.He is working one last long con job to get $80,000 and then he will quit. But of course this is a movie and things will go wrong and Angela will be drawn in.The movie cruises along at a steady pace, and it is the characters and their lives that are important. It also makes a lot of comments about what it is to be a con artist and about how we live our own lives without making it so obvious that you don't have to think.Worth watching, is entertaining enough but I felt it never took it's subject matter far enough. However this is what makes Ridely Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma &amp; Louise, Galdiator, Black Hawke Down) movies so enjoyable. The characters are characters and not ciphers for a message.If you like con movies then this will take you somewhere new, and if you hate con movies then here is a story that addresses what you hate about the con.</fullReview>

To ME the ending was too harsh and ruined the movie. The fathers love for his new found daughter was revealed as her con on him.

His Roy is the most engaging thief in the movies I've seen.Roy (Cage) is an obsessive-compulsive con man who has had a very successful career. He's good, although his partner Frank (Sam Rockwell) worries about him. Roy is a fascinating guy. For example, when his medication runs out, he locks himself in his house for a few days and cleans his house top to bottom... but still finds smudges and stains. One day, while Roy is visiting Dr. Klein (Bruce Altman), he finds out that he has a fourteen year-old daughter, Angela (Alison Lohman), that he didn't know he had. Angela comes out to visit, and the two begin to bond.Nicolas Cage is at the top of his game here, and his performance is often very funny. Sam Rockwell, as Frank, is very good in portraying his character's simultaneous goofiness and sneakiness. Alison Lohman, a new discovery for me, is wonderful as the daughter, and I hope to see more of her in the future.As all con-game movies, 'Matchstick Men' has some twists in the plot, including one that is genuinely surprising. I won't reveal what that is, but the final scene in the movie is genuinely moving. 'Matchstick Men' is a wonderful film.</fullReview>

Nick doesn't play it safe in any of his roles. I don't usually like him, but this film is the exception. Sam Rockwell is good as his con artist partner, as is Lohman as the teenager who shows up as Cage's daughter.

I bet, perhaps Eric Garcia speaks spanish and know "Nueve Reinas"(Nine Queens)... this movie begins with the light of a... MATCHSTICK!,the music are old fashioned and are about two con artists too... certainly many coincidences.I'm argentine and the language is the key in a con movie style, sadly the english subtitles in Nine Queen don't fit the spellbinding argentine slang. In MM from the standpoint of credibility the script is a flaw, what's the meaning of the long silent in the interview with Dr. Klein and the clock's bells sounds? Also the end of the movie must be better, just like the book itself.-Roy are you Ok?-Yeah... I'm Ok.What's the meaning to show Roy one year later overcoming from his phobias and the con business? It was all about the redemption of a con artist?. I was watching the redemption of the actors from the scripters. And when I remember Nine Queens, the long silent and the Strip-Cut Paper Shredder sounds while the expert analyzes the fake "Nine Queens" stamps... that's a real subtle scene with meaning in a movie. Obviously a can't avoid to compare MM and NQ, both are fine movies but not are the greatest in the genre, and I guess the only subtle scene en MM are Roy and his daughter talking spanish, may be are the scripters trying to say hello we also like NQ.-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This an entertaining film if one goes in with an open mind to enjoy. The screen play has a lot of holes. It also needed some trimming, but in general, it delivers. Ridley Scott's take on the novel by Eric Garcia about these con men is well paced, as we get to know the M.O. of Roy and Frank as they fleece their victims. This get complicated by the appearance of Angela, Roy's daughter, he never knew, who wants to imitate her old man going into his same line of work. Of course, everything falls into place too easily for Roy to question the turn of events with the con job at hand that Frank convinces him to do. He should have avoided the whole outcome of the story if he should have taken the time to pay a visit to his ex wife...Nicolas Cage's take on Roy, who might have a slight case of Tourette's Syndrome, is believable in his portrayal. Sam Rockwell's character is not very well drawn. We have seen him doing this likable guy before. Allison Lohman makes us believe she is Angela, the daughter who has a different idea as to how to endear herself to a father she never knew.Basically this is a film to like, only if we avoid comparisons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading the synopsis of this movie, I was expecting some sort of "Catch me if you can" or "As good as it gets". But somehow, the movie falls far short of these two movies.Nicholas cage as a con-man having obsessive compulsive disorder, does not really make you have any respect, love or hatred towards him. In fact, there is not justification for his dis-order, and he looks ridiculous, when he tries to act like a person having some kind of mental problem. He does not look that convincing.At same time, the focus is hardly there on the tricks played by him and his partner on other people - even though the theme is the core of movie. The movie simply drags during the first half, and is interesting only after his daughter appears in the movie. Also, the director-script writer seems to have been confused, whether to focus on father-daughter relationship or Nicholas Cage's profession.However, I have given 6/10 just because of the novelty in story. I would rather watch "Catch me if you can" for its humour and content, and "As Good as it gets" for Jack Nicholson's acting</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Matchstick Men" is a glossy, highly professionally made con men movie featuring terrific performances. Director Ridley Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson (both were together on the very differently scaled "Gladiator") have crafted a beautiful looking movie. The various sting plots, which as is standard for the genre don't make 100% sense from the premise on, are helped immeasurably by the leads. Nicholas Cage adds to his range of tics from "Adaptation" and Alison Lohman centers the movie as luminously as she did "White Oleander." Their father/daughter relationship is unusual for a caper flick, and keeps it out of the more typical noir atmosphere, and perhaps unnecessarily reinforced with the coda after the twist uncoils. Are the rat pack music selections supposed to intentionally recall "Ocean's 11"? The movie recalls the 19th century source of the term "confidence man," from the first grift that the police identified, that started with the line "Do you have confidence in me?" In these pro's we do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About as subtle as a hacksaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came into this movie with fairly low expectations. It was reviewed by most as a family sort of flick, con-man meets daughter who turns life upside down, etc. By the combination of seeing the advertising and reading reviews, it was clear that the film was at least partially trying to cross Ocean's Eleven with some lovey-dovey family angle.But no, it was worse.The film starts out fairly strong, with a lot of camera tricks to emphasize Roy's (the main character, played by Nicholas Cage) obsessive-compulsive disorder. Cage can't seem to strike a line as to his treatment of the character's illness. He's either over-doing it or completely forgetting it. One moment he has five tics in a row, the next he seems perfectly fine. The film also quickly discards all the camera motifs, such as the images of Roy's ordered, contained life being shaded blue, and chaos and the world outside being yellow.A little way in, Sam Rockwell's character Frank (who is sorely underused, by the way) gets Roy a new psychiatrist, as his old one has skipped town. The shrink hooks Roy up with his long-lost daughter Angela (Alison Lohman). Angela is either crying, giggling, gaping or being cute throughout the entire film, until perhaps the ending.Meanwhile, the film opens roughly five other excess sub-plots, such as Roy's blossoming relationship with the woman at the checkout line in a local grocery store (they say "Hi" a few times), and a con on a guy who is very greedy and very rich. The writers box themselves in, strangled by the tangled plot lines.So what do they do? They get ludicrous. Suffice it to say that the big con goes wrong, there's a ridiculous car chase, and the guy who was conned tracks Angela down. Things get more contrived from there, piling on the "surprises" until everyone in the audience either oohs, ahhs, or throws up.To top it all off, there's a completely unnecessary "One Year Later" coda, which returns to the same sentimental mush the film had at its core. The process of groping for a twist ending that would make people think the film was clever has now elongated the film by about 45 minutes.To add to this mess, the film never executes any of its development with subtlety. If it had some finesse, this movie could probably have been decent. Instead, I felt more conned than anyone else on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott continues to bore and entertain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott cannot make a film that is tightly entertaining from start to finish without a boring spot. This has plagued him in his entire career. 'Matchstick Men' is solid for the most part and what Scott does well with it is he makes it an uphill climb. It gets more interesting the longer it goes on. The boring and slow pace comes early in the film's first half hour to 45 minutes. Nicolas Cage is definitely better in this than he was in the highly over rated 'Adaptation' from 2002. I wouldn't be surprised if he got another Oscar nomination for this film. In this film Cage plays a con artist with a conscience who works with a partner (Sam Rockwell) and a 14 year old girl (Alison Lohman). The grand father of all con films is 1973's 'The Sting' and now 30 years later it is hard to disguise a con film with twists because we have seen just about all of them. Still, this is a quality film with a good old fashioned lesson and 'Matchstick Men' is light and occasionally high end entertainment.</fullReview>

This movie was quite interesting and funny. Nicolas Cage was absolutely hilarious and Alison Lohman is a cutie although she is much older then her character.

That is exactly how I feel about Matchstick Men. When I first saw the preview to this movie I couldn't wait to see it. I thought Nicolas Cage and Ridley Scott...how can this possibly not be good? And then I went to see it. And I enjoyed the whole thing...almost. That darn ending. As the movie went on, and as I laughed, and enjoyed the performances, I knew it was coming. I knew it was going to have one of those twists to it. I was also pretty sure what that twist was going to be. But I was hoping I was going to be wrong. I wasn't. The direction this movie is originally headed in is so much better then where it ends up. I am sure there are many who will love every part of it. And I am sure that there are many who think the ending is perfect. I'm just not one of them. I think it was hurried, predictable, and totally unnecessary. As far as I am concerned, this was a perfect gem until the tarnished conclusion. But that's just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No twist in this "grift"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Obviously many are delighted, entertained and surprised at Ridley Scott's film. I have not read the book, but for me, this movie provided some entertaining moments and absolutely no surprise twists. There are so many better con artist movies ... "The Sting", "House of Games", "Glengarry Glen Ross" and especially the "The Grifters" (who's lead character is also named Roy). In "Matchstick Men", I found Sam Rockwell's (whom I thought was brilliant in "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind") character Frank to be little more than a low rent scammer who latched on to the more brilliant con played by Nicolas Cage. And all this talk about Cage's performance being Oscar worthy makes me wince. It is nowhere near his best work and is hokey and overblown at best. Dustin Hoffman in "Rainman" made you believe Ray was a real person caught up in a horrible disease. Cage plays his disorder like a cartoon character, overblowing every twitch and mannerism. A little subtlety would have helped. For this year's best performances so far, check "American Splendor" and "Pirates of the Caribbean". The two male lead performances are brilliant by Paul Giamatti and Johnny Depp, respectively. I will say Alison Lohman (who is actually 24, not 14, and was excellent in "White Oleander") is tremendous and I look forward to more of her work. She has huge talent and can wrap an audience around her proverbial little finger pretty quickly! Just a quick note for any "L.A. Law" fans out there. Don't miss Sheila Kelley (who was Glen Taylor) as the checkout lady (and more) in the grocery store. Overall a very disappointing film due to the performance of Cage and the poor execution of the surprise twists and especially the ridiculous ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully entertaining low-impact comedy/crime flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicolas Cage is one of my top ten favorite actors but this doesn't make me biased towards every film he's appeared in. Some I've liked, others not so much. In Matchstick Men he is cast in one of his better roles much along the lines of "Lord of War" and "Bringing Out the Dead". The type of character that's quirky, misunderstood, completely believable, and at times morbidly funny. You gain a feeling of empathy for him as Roy Waller, an unscrupulous con-man with some of the most unusual mental imbalances, "ticks" and OCD habits. These habits become the focal point of the subtle humor throughout the movie. Sam Rockwell, playing Cage's right hand man in crime as Frank Mercer is an equally quirky and shady character. Lacking the obvious psychological idiosyncrasies as his partner, he spends half his time setting up the "con" job and the other worrying whether Roy has taken his medication and is stable enough to follow through. The chemistry between both as actors and characters nears brilliance.Alison Lohman who plays Angela, Roy's newly introduced (and previously unknown to him) daughter is instantly likable and first appears to be the antithesis of him. Her emotional outbursts are well acted and you will immediately feel sorry for her as much as Roy does. But keep in mind once you've reached this point of familiarity with the characters the viewer is being taken in by the "con" as much as their film victims. All is not what it appears. The story and script is witty and it holds your attention from beginning to end. The cinematography, direction and editing is meticulous and sets the stage perfectly for every scene - down to Roy's bleak, antiseptic lifestyle and brief glimpses of what's really going on in his head. This isn't an action movie per-say. You won't find guns blazing, things blowing up and hateful villains such as in "Con Air" or "Face/Off". This is an intelligent comedy, not snobby or artsy, with a great story and acting throughout. If I was to embellish any further details it would ruin the film for you. Just remember when you think you've figured out what exactly is going on, this does a 180 on you with one of the better endings I've seen in years.</fullReview>

So it was great fun to actually get taken in and totally surprised by the ending to this movie! I really did NOT see it coming!The ending is really rather sad, a "downer" ending. The filmmakers seem to have softened it by giving us glimpses of "what happened next", essentially an epilogue to show that a life was NOT just completely destroyed.The film uses all sorts of misdirection to keep you from paying attention and catching on to the con, it makes the viewer a "mark" just like the character in the movie. Afterwards I had to sit back and think it through ("So, wait, who was in on the con? . . . Ohhh, now I get it!")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but rather predictable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matchstick Men is a film about con-men, namely Nicolas Cage and Sam Rockwell. Now both of these are actors I like, though I have to say that Sam Rockwell's career hasn't taken off like I hoped it would - I still think his best role was in Galaxy Quest - and they both carry the movie pretty well, especially Cage.The film is solid enough entertainment, but it is rather predictable, particularly towards the end. My only gripe with the movie is Ridley Scotts's seeming obsession with cigarettes. Cage smokes constantly throughout the film and, quite frankly, the use of the imagery adds nothing to the movie. In fact, quite the obvious, as it often (for a non-smoker like myself) distracts from the story. In fact, I've never seen a modern movie where the smoking image is portrayed this strongly.I also question it in the contect of Cage's character who, we discover, suffers from obsessive-compulsiveness and takes vast pains to keep his home spotless from even the smallest spots of dirt. Everyone entering his house has to take their shoes off and he wipes things tht other people touch, etc. Odd then, that he appears to have no problems with cigarette smoke staining his ceiling and furnishings, or ash falling onto the carpets. Whilst I can see the use as a means to portray Cage's characters' stress level, I find it counter-productive, and frankly non-plussing, to see it used by an obsessively clean person.That gripe aside, the movie rolls along steadily, if not a little pedestrianly at times. The finale is well managed, though, and of the "everything turns out for the best in the end" school of storytelling.It's worth a look if for nothing else than to see the look on Cage's face when he finds out what tablets he's REALLY been prescribed by his new shrink.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good performances and slick direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some viewers may think that this is just another con artist film but I think if you take a good look at the performances and the direction by Ridley Scott you might see that this film has something extra to it. Story is about a con man named Roy Waller (Nicolas Cage) who is obsessive compulsive and chain smokes and possesses many tics. His partner and protege is Frank Mercer (Sam Rockwell) and together they Scam people out of money with a prize scheme. They have a rich businessman named Chuck Frechette (Bruce McGill) spotted for a con with a big payoff at the end but one day Roy spills his medication down the drain and his doctor is nowhere to be found. Frank tells him of a doctor to go see so Roy pays him a visit. He meets Dr. Klein (Bruce Altman) and Roy starts confessing what some of his problems are. He mentions that he has a child that he has never seen and asks Dr. Klein to make a phone call to his ex-wife for him. Dr. Klein does and tells him he has a daughter that wants to meet him. Roy meets Angela (Alison Lohman) and she seems to be interested in her father from the start. She comes over to his home and stays for a few days and they become close. Roy tells her the truth about what he does and he even involves her in a scam or two. Roy and Frank bilk Chuck out of a lot of money but Chuck gets a look at Angela and he tracks her down and he has a confrontation at Roy's home. Chuck demands his money back and he also says that he will want more! Ridley Scott shows us again that he can handle more than action films and he reminds us of the director that gave everyone "Thelma and Louise". Scott's direction is slick and the cinematography is very impressive. Their are several shots with rays of sunlight shining through the windows and this gives the film a sleek and slick look. The music score is very interesting also and it seems to be a mixture of 1950's jazz with a European flavor. In some scenes the music sounds like it came right out of a Fellini film. Cage revels in giving us flawed characters and he seems to be well cast here. He does an excellent job of giving different looks to Roy and we actually see his character change during the course of the film. I said last year that Alison Lohman deserved an Oscar nomination for "White Oleander" and her performance here is very impressive. She's actually 24 years old but she plays a girl of 14 and it's totally believable. She's a young actress of extraordinary talent and following her career will be exciting. I thought the twist at the end of the film wasn't necessarily to fool the audience but to be used as a device for Cage to become the good person that he has realized about himself. He is shocked when he discovers what has happened but in essence it was the best thing that ever happened to him. On the surface this material may appear to be familiar but if you look into the performances and the direction you should see that this film does have something extra to offer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In homage to the classic game show, here is a `Match Game' question: __________ Cage Ahhhhhhh! Wrong! No! Not `The Bird Cage'! Ahhhhhhh! Wrong! No! Not `The Meezacage' for those of you who are annoyed by my puns, and think I should be incarcerated for aggravated punning.The answer is: Nicolas CageMr. Cage has once again demonstrated why he is the best male actor of this generation. His performance in the invigorating film `Matchstick Men' will be tough to match as the best male acting of the year. Cage plays Roy Waller, a con artist who unexpectedly discovers that he is the father of a 14 year old female teenager. Roy also suffers from a colossal case of obsessive compulsive disorder. However, he is vocal &amp; expressive and is definitely no `Monk'. Sam Rockwell plays Frank Mercer, Roy's con partner who himself probably suffers from a case of `confessions of a dangerous mind'. Rockwell demonstrates once again why his `school of rock' thespian work is deserving of Dean's List accolades. Alison Lohman, who plays Roy's daughter, might have been in `lohman's land' by sharing screen time with these magnificent male actors. However, her work was mesmerizing and deserving of a Best Supporting Actress nomination. Director Ridley Scott inserts enough intriguing &amp; puzzling situations into `Matchstick Men' to challenge viewers to answer complex `ridley riddles'. Take your perfect match to view `Matchstick Men'. You con go wrong! ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how else to explain it but when this movie is over you will feel like you were robbed of your Soul. There is no real redemption and the attempt at a happy ending does not put your soul back.Nicholas cage's character is a loner con man with OCD and only one partner (no other friends) who learns he has a daughter. They spend far too much time "developing" his OCD that it distracts from the movie. But the con is really on him. His partner through some elaborate ridiculous plot cons him out of all his money using his "daughter" which is another con. He then winds up selling carpet remnants and marrying the grocery store checker - Depressing.I wasn't surprised when the con on him was revealed as much as I was depressed by the daughter not being real. You watch a whole movie that implies redemption between a father, his estranged daughter and a recovering con man but instead you get laughed at for having hope. That to me is insulting and the lowest thing you could do to someone.All I am left with is the five minutes at the end, the rest now being irrelevant. That is the problem here. Instead of the ending making the rest of the movie more meaningful, it makes it completely worthless. This movie not only robs you of your soul, it robs itself of the whole movie. Conning the audience apparently was the only point. What a waste of time.I hope Ridley Scott gets back to making good movies again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good premise, weak execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected to like this film. I enjoy movies about con artists, and it looked to me like a return to the quirky types of roles Nicolas Cage used to do back in the '80s. Ever since his rise to stardom, he's frequently been cast in roles where--to me, at least--he has seemed oddly out of place. This is probably because he has an air of unconventionality to him, which often clashes with the tone of what he's in.So when I heard that he was playing an agoraphobic, obsessive-compulsive con man who discovers he has a teenage daughter, I was sure this film would be my cup of tea. It was getting good reviews, and it sounded like an interesting premise, one that cuts across genres. That, unfortunately, turns out to be the main problem. The film tries to do too many different things, and they cancel each other out.We can start with Cage's character. He's shown as a socially inept individual with lots of tics and stammers, a man so fearful of the outside world that he has trouble leaving his own house. The notion that a guy like this could also be a seasoned con artist doesn't ring true. When we see him working, he seems marginally competent at best, and his scams aren't particularly clever or inspired. Maybe I'm spoiled after seeing "Catch Me If You Can," a movie that shows what true brilliance in this profession can look like. But even con artists of lesser skill usually know how to adapt to new situations, a trait this character does not appear to possess. On the contrary, the first scam we see him pull off, he nearly blows. How did this guy stay in the business for twenty years, with as much success as he's said to have had?Not only is it hard for me to believe that he'd be capable of working in such a venue, he doesn't even seem the type who would want to. He has too much of a conscience, as becomes evident when he develops a relationship with his newfound teenage daughter, played by Alison Lohman. I realize the point is supposed to be that the Lohman character is bringing out feelings in him that he didn't know he had, but from the beginning he seems too moral for his own good. If he's irresponsible, it's not because he doesn't care, but because he's overly absorbed in his own problems. Some of his scenes with her are entertaining, but ultimately they don't go anywhere satisfying. All the film achieves in the end is plot manipulation.Perhaps Cage was not the right choice for this role after all. I can think of several actors who might have done a better job. One that springs to mind is Bill Murray. He played a severely phobic character in "What About Bob?," and while his performance in that film was over-the-top, he has shown from his other work that he can reign in his comedic talent when he needs to. He's also good at playing conning types of characters, exhibiting a smoothness that Cage lacks. He would have been perfect for this role, as would have many other actors. It may not have saved the entire film, but it would at least have provided a more convincing starting point.</fullReview>

The Main character. As in most movies this would be okay, but considerably, he did not have a very important nor exciting back story. Saying that, the movie wasn't too exciting in a whole. It seem to be in pieces, pieces that weren't meant to be there. I am satisfied with the great performances of early Nicolas Cage and Sam Rockwell, and the great directing of Ridley Scott.

		<shortDescription>You get what you give and (hopefully)... redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard good things about Ridley Scott's "Matchstick Men", released in 2003, but was reluctant to give it a try since it was about two con-men. It's hard, after all, to care about the outcome of a story if its main characters are swindling scumbags who make their living by ripping others off. Let 'em be wiped off the face of the planet for all I care. But everyone universally praised the film and said it had a good ending that catches the viewer off guard, so I finally decided to check it out.Nicolas Cage's character, Roy, is crippled by obsessive-compulsion disorder, likely a physical consequence of the guilt of his criminal lifestyle, which he tries to justify ("I don't take money from people; they give it to me"). He sees a shrink and relies on meds to deal with his condition. Ultimately Roy and his partner (Sam Rockwell) happen upon a big score. At the same time his life is complicated but also blessed by the appearance of a 14 year-old daughter he never knew he had (alison Lohman).The story is good all the way through but the last act &amp; epilogue in particular are worth the price of admission.I like how the movie emphasizes that love is more important than money, and more devastating to lose as well. And also that, if one truly has a worthy and noble heart, it will ultimately vomit out foolish, selfish and unnatural inclinations &amp; actions. Redemption is always there, no matter how bad you are, but you have to want freedom enough to choose it and change.I don't want to say anymore because the less you know the better.The film runs two hours and was filmed in the Los Angeles/Anaheim/Venice areas.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matchstick Men is a great, character-driven drama. This movie hits you with all the right chords and by the end of the movie, you feel for each character and you would wish you have gotten to know them more. This film is very entertaining and it's well-acted. The leads are great and the direction of Ridley Scott is nearly flawless. What I really liked is how this film focuses more on the characters rather than the actual con and because of that, we get some extreme character development.Scott's film is about a guy who works in a life of crime and he happens to have some mental issues mainly about everything must be clean. Unknowingly to him, he had a daughter who came out of nowhere to be with him. Now she just might ruin he and his partner's life of crime.The acting is very good. Nic Cage delivers a knock-out performance and his character slightly reminds me of his character from Leaving Las Vegas. Sam Rockwell is very good in his role and is quite funny. Alison Lohman however is very good. I was shocked to learn she was 24 at the time of this film's release and she really does her teenage role perfectly.Overall, this is a great comedy/crime film that benefits from a strong screenplay, great acting, great direction, an interesting story that doesn't fail to captivate thanks to some twists and turns, and some powerful themes involving family. I think this is an underrated piece of art. While not perfect, it's almost perfect. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another two hours of so-what from the master of mediocrity, Ridley Scott. A more serious approach and less facile characters might have grounded the movie, or at least made it more interesting, but it seems to be about absolutely nothing; a late about turn in the plot is kind of cool but let down by its predictability. Hans Zimmer's gratingly jaunty score is backed up by too many montage- inducing swing tunes, while the gimmicky editing is just inappropriate. Even the performances are largely underwhelming: Sam Rockwell steals the film almost by default, and Nicolas Cage coasts along using his usual performance - half compelling, half annoying. A disappointing damp fuse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>could be better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was kinda disappointing that i figured what the end would be 1hour prior to the finish. From that moment i was hoping that Cage would figure it out too and with some cleverly planting seeds throughout the plot he would get them back twice as hard. A better written script would made this movie one of the best of his career. If one glue the pieces together will quickly realize that the same ending would have been achieved with a simpler plot. I just cant appreciate the different meaningless scenes. What i appreciated is the effort of keeping Angela innocent and at the same time devious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A con artist suddenly gets a daughter to take care of and when she finds out what he's doing for a living she gets very interested in it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well i saw this movie awhile ago for the first time and to be really honest i expected much more. In my opinion it's too focused on the drama and even though the main character has a tic it annoyed me like hell . I wanted to see much more about Nicolas and his daughter ripping people of and i saw the twist coming from the beginning which made it far too predictable for me. Its definitely worth giving a try as some people will appreciate the sentiment. It wasn't that horrible that i didn't see it through the end as the acting was pretty good none the less and maybe i was wrong to expect more out of it. Its just a matter of taste but still, this is my opinion on the matter so I'm free to give it a low rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade Runners</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody else's. They're Tyrell's niece's." - Deckard Ridley Scott's answer to Spielberg's "Catch Me If You Can", "Matchstick Men" is a slick but lightweight comedy thriller about a con artist, played by Nicholas Cage, who suffers from OCD and agoraphobia. The film, which mixes scenes of family bonding with cool con artistry, eventually reveals itself to be a con on both audience and Cage's character.Though David Mamet and Neil LaBute routinely cover such material in a superior manner, "Matchstick Men" is nevertheless one of Scott's better films. And like Scott's only great film, "Blade Runner", it is very much a film about neuroses and surfaces (Cage spends the film both obsessed with objects and unaware that they are in fact manipulating him).Scott's filmography is one of pretty pictures, one which puts primary emphasis on surfaces, looks, aesthetics, the external, outer facades, light and decorative arrangements. In contrast, "Blade Runner" is about a dour character, Rick Deckard, who confronts the fact that all men are machines programmed by impersonal, outside forces; all identity is a matter of engineering. For Deckard, what constitutes essence, depth, authenticity and Self suddenly then becomes a fiction. There is no subject, only matter. All identity is a mechanistic construction, nothing is given, all is artificially produced, the "subject" is borne of an ornamental void, and clinging to pretty pictures, photographs, designer visuals and memories no longer help but perpetually torment. For Deckard, the outside then becomes nothing, mere code to be chewed, aesthetics become vapid and all environmental objects point to Antonioni-like depthlessness. Consciousnes is itself called into question. Consciousness, like memory and habit, is always a reflection on, or after effect of, the unconscious processes which produce it (some neuroscientists themselves believe that actions, thinking, learning and intention all precede consciousness, are preconscious, thereby negating free-will), and the always too-late attempt by a subject to grasp the "moment" will only ever produce neurosis. "Blade Runner" doesn't subvert Scott's aesthetic, but captures a kind of painful, melancholic, hollowness behind it all. In contrast, all of Scott's other films pass off kitschy style as depth, and pretty postcards as "importance", "content", "authenticity" "meaning" and "auteurism".So perhaps this is why "Matchstick Men" remains one of Scott's more tolerable films. In being about misdirection, programming, engineering and the falsity of images, it, like "Blade Runner", negates some of Scott's more grating tendencies as an artist. Note too that it is the promise of sex, family and companionship that allows Cage's reality to be re-engineered, a common P.K. Dick theme, in which the author's future men frequently find themselves engineering babies, pets and animals to engender feelings of "purpose" and assuage an innate human Lack; "I know it's not real, but it's real to me, completes me, makes me whole, and that's all that matters." The film then ends with Cage substituting his simulational "fake family" for a supposedly "real one", pregnant wife and all.7.9/10 ? Worth one viewing. See the con movies of Neil LaBute and David Mamet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An efficient and fairly entertaining misdirection flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matchstick Men arrived and vanished without a trace because the film has been made many times before - not necessarily better made but definitely made. And with a film like this the ceiling is quite low, meaning even if it is well executed it can still only ever be fairly entertaining.So perhaps it is high praise when I tell you this is efficient and fairly entertaining? Roy (Nicolas Cage) and Frank (Sam Rockwell) are small time conmen, keeping things low key enough to avoid serious investigation whilst still enabling their nefarious lifestyle. They diddle little old ladies and the too trusting alike, but never to any massive extent. They use various ploys and various aliases to get what they want.Roy's life is ruled by repetition and superstition, he is fully OCD and everything must be done in an order and way that is logical, at least to him. If this daily routine is altered in any way by Roy or anyone else he loses the plot. One example has Roy clean his already clean house from top to bottom. Pills keep Roy (mostly) on the straight and narrow and aware of his restrictions. Funnily enough for someone with so many cleanliness issues Roy chain-smokes throughout the entire film.This all changes when one day Roy loses his pills and finds that his regular Doc has retired. Roy also finds that his ex-wife has previously never told him that they may have a child, this is all a bit much for Roy. Upon consulting a new Doctor Roy asks the Doc to call his ex to make sure, and he is amazed to learn of the existence of Angela, now 14 years old.At the doctor's insistence Roy meets with Angela, he finds that she is a spunky and confident tomboy, quick witted and very smart, suddenly all seems to be going well in Roy's life and he tells Frank that it is time to go for the "big score".After a time Angela moves into Roy's home, being a teenager this creates significant issues with Roy's condition and when one evening he comes home to find the house in disarray Roy gets more than a little wound up. After an argument and a temporary daddy-daughter estrangement Roy decides to open up to Angela as to exactly what he does for a living, instead of revulsion Angela expresses a desire to learn the ropes, leading to some basic training in "scamming for dummies". When this goes wrong Roy decides at the last minute to ditch his normal order and bring Angela along.This initially goes well, then very badly.After the botched scam Roy starts to realise the risks that his career poses for his new relationship with Angela, Roy decides that perhaps exiting the game for good might be the appropriate course of action. After all he has already amassed a considerable amount of cash through many years of low level scamming. Frank tries to talk Roy out of changing his mind or simply targeting bigger ticket marks, but sh*t gets complicated first.The movie ends shortly after Roy realises the dangers of the illegal game that he was a part of for so long. The final acts seem pretty nifty at the time but don't hold up very well to close scrutiny, especially if you consider the chain of events that need to happen to enable them to happen.It's basically hard to explain without giving things away but can I just say that there is a sequence of events that is implausible to say the least.Final Rating - 7 / 10. The movie is entertaining and for a long while captures your attention, just try not to think too hard, you'll end up second guessing a lot of what happens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Acting, Good Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has great acting from both the actors, Nicolas Cage and Sam Rockwell, and the young lady Alison Lohman also does a very good job acting her role. The movie is not as good as the acting but it is still definitely a great movie to watch and worth the rental/time involved. It is hard to review a movie like this because it is about con men doing a heist and there are obviously twists and surprises and I don't want to give away any spoilers, but basically it is about two con men trying to put together a big con on somebody when Nicolas Cage's daughter gets involved and that threatens to tear things apart. I recommend watching this movie if you like con/heist stories and if you are a fan of Nicolas Cage's acting which I definitely am.</fullReview>

This film will take you for a ride, the only parts that irritated me were the heavy OCD moments (only because I'm slightly OCD) and the constant weeping (but plays in greatly in due time). Without there two things, the film would've been very dull, the only reason they irritated me was because the acting from Nicolas Cage and Alison Lohman was so spot on that it felt too real.This film is worth the watch, even the purchase. The dialogue is brilliant and the story is nothing short of brilliant.Nicolas Cage, Sam Rockwell, and Alison Lohman... what a superb cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice, Meaningful, and Too Far to Believe !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie about a first-time father with his turbulent teen daughter meets a twisty heist. (Ridley Scott) handled it well as somewhat a vacation for him away from his special atmospheric very detailed worlds (sometimes I feel that the thing that attracted him to Matchstick Men is having a man with inveterately scrupulous taste!). Everything is watchable, the pace is good, and the soundtrack is catchy and mostly nostalgic. Aside from being outwardly a story of a hustler who got hustled, tasting finally his own bitter medicine, it managed also to be a satire of a lying world where your; friend, daughter, psychiatrist, and even victim (added to the police officers too) are all parts of a hoax played all the time on you; that served a deeper meaning of how all the humans around you are just actors, and your life is the play, yet you're naturally ? as the lesser liar and the more innocent ? the last to know. However the problem wasn't Cage's performance inasmuch as his character and the script in many places. Firstly, I don't believe for a second that there is a professional impostor who has an obsessive-compulsive disorder and suffers from panic attacks. It's hard to buy that he doesn't have the bad symptoms while complicating any job ever, so how about being a very successful impostor?! For me being a phobic con artist, is like a surgeon with a tremor; he just can't work smartly, or work at all ! Plus, the whole scheme looked too-sophisticated-it's-fabricated. I mean if that guy's money is the target all along why all of that long term plan? It would have been a lot easier and shorter with hypnotism, an injection of truth serum, or a direct threat to his daughter or ? in this very case ? his rug! Furthermore, the holes. For instance, what was the mega-trustworthy guarantee that this man wouldn't, at any cost, call the mother? There are questions of that sort, and they're more interesting putting in mind how that "professional impostor" who got so rich out of too many "successful jobs" didn't notice anything wrong about any of all the people around him at any time ??!! At one point I became content with an idea that says how this movie was having another ending, with less far twist, then it got changed for more loud shock.Anyway, it gives us the simple moral message at the end; "stop lying to have a true life", but sure not in a way to be believed !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a great caper flick from Ridley Scott, a near-perfect little caper movie starring Nicolas Cage at his quirky best. It's a con artist movie that holds up with the best of the genre, just as tricky and entertaining as some of the best of the genre. I would say it's almost on par with The Sting or Ocean's Eleven, but loses a few points in the last thirty minutes or so. Still very watchable, right up to the twist climax, but it does become little bit sentimental as it nears the finish line. Sam Rockwell is good as always, and Allison Lohman is perfect- a big surprise that we haven't seen more of her since this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original, interesting and unpredictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matchstick Men is a film that walks in several genres at once, and gets away with it. It's part comedy, part crime/heist-movie, and part drama. Despite of that, its a well balanced, well paced and interesting movie. It's funny, moving and exciting.The performance by Nicolas Cage is memorable as the totally neurotic con man, but Alison Lohman takes the crown in this film. Her performance, her character and her looks are unique and amazing. Sam Rockwell also does a great job as the sleazy partner in crime to Nic Cage's character.Talking about the plot would soon lead to spoilers, so I won't go into it. Instead I implore you to watch this unique and unpredictable film with an open mind. There are some real surprises in this movie's plot, twists that I did not see coming.Overall: a great movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just rent this movie from video store, watched it couple weeks ago, and I would have to say this is one of my favorite movies. It has its own atmosphere, tempo and nice BGM. I enjoyed it very much and would like to recommend you check it out!!! Both Cage and Lohman's acting are great, especially it was quit amazing when I found out Lohman was actually 22 when this movie was filming. She really looks like 14! Cage created a really strange, weird but still cool con man.One of my favorite scenes in this movie is the one where Roy(Nicolas Cage) teaches Angela(Alison Lohman)how to con. He is a con man(well, he more would like to call himself 'a con artist'), but is also a 14 years daughter's father now. He teaches her con and is also trying to teach her 'moral' at the same time. This is kind of contradiction and strange, but is interesting way of showing the relationship between them, too. I like that very much.The point of this movie I think is who is 'the vest con artist'. Some are saying this movie is predictable and the ending was not so good, but it was completely unpredictable to me and I really enjoyed it from start to end. I was completely deceived by the movie itself. well, I shouldn't give you them all. Please check it for your self and enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A con to believe its Oscar material, but its still quite the show.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cage, Lohman and Rockwell star in this mildly advertised mystery movie about a Con artist (Cage) (who, quite obviously, has a series of running mental problems. OCD, Torrets, and ADD.) who goes about living his normal life until he meets up with a long lost daughter (Lohman). Eventually, after much complaints and requests from Lohman, he lets her in on his secret and even involves her in his business.I watched this movie with little or no knowledge of it beforehand. I had stumbled upon its name when a friend of mine gave me a list of good twist endings in movies. I decided to watch this one last, and I must say I'm disappointed I put it off so long. Cage gives a solid performance, and really acts like he has these diseases. Lohman-Thought well in her twenties- acts according to her character of 14 years. And Rockwell is your usual smooth criminal/partner. The characters never drift out of plot, and I never found myself trying to get through rough lines or bad acting. All good stuff. If you liked the Cons of Oceans 11 or 12, or ones you see on Court TV, you'll love them here. Lottery scams, phone cons and many others are included. These are witty crimes, and enjoyable to watch. Even if you don't care about the rest of the movie, this aspect can hold you off.Anyway the movie is really your basic criminal movie. There are plenty of smooth moves, fast cons and intelligent scams in this movie, as well as an ending that might just make all that you watched a con in its own. Also, I couldn't help but think Oceans 11 the entire time. If you liked--or disliked-- Oceans, you'll know what you're coming into.BUT, I will tell you what I did not like about the ending. After we get the twist, Cage runs into Lohman one year later. This ruins the mystery, and the feel, and even though we get to see where he is, it does kind of break its own mirror. Most twist endings are fast paced, dramatic. A knife in the back, to say. But this one folds over on itself. Be warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a low key movie for Scott and judging from the DVD's extra features Scott does a very professional job both before and during shooting, and it shows on this one.Roy suffers from Tourette's. He's a matchstick man - a 'con artist' as he prefers to describe himself. He has a partner - Frank. One morning when Roy is getting ready for 'work' something happens that changes his entire life.This is very solid writing. It's originally a book, so all the screenwriters had to do was not ruin the story, and judging from those special features, they were tempted (but at the end of the day did not give in).Could anyone else play Roy? Don't know, but Cage doesn't disappear into his role the way - sorry - better actors do. You're always aware it's Cage.But watch out for Lohman. That is one very hot and very talented actress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know that Matchstick Men meant con artists or film flammers, but learned that by watching this film.The film is mildly entertaining because it combines comedy, sadness, happiness, redemption, and even forgiveness, with a touch of terror.Nicholas Cage did a capable job of playing a difficult character, chain-smoking his way through. The other leads, sorry don't remember their names, also turn in competent performances. In my opinion, Cage's on-screen daughter does a great job, and I will look for her in other films.Maybe I thought too much ahead, but I felt the ending was a little predictable. I felt the same way with another film recently, Proof. Similar in that there was a great cast, but the end was pretty predictable.You will like this film if you enjoy films like The Grifters or the Sting.

		<shortDescription>WAY Too Many Plot holes! &lt;----- Got conned by the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to reply to the poster below me and point out that the plot holes he had pointed out were not plot holes...************************* - The guy that Nicolas Cage was conning "found out" who the young girl was because her face was on the security camera tape and she'd been arrested before. Um, she was using a fake identity. So how did the criminal link her back to Nicolas Cage? - Also, the guy said he called Nicolas Cage's ex wife and that's how he found out the address. He hadn't spoken to this woman in over 14 years. How did SHE know where he lived? -Nicolas Cage was freaking out because his "daughter" had been arrested before. And later he freaked out because the other guy threatened to have her locked up. Um, what exactly was her crime? She was a minor. She was in the car with a criminal, which doesn't exactly MAKE her one. And the worst she did was yell at a bartender and break a glass. That's not exactly grounds for locking her up indefinitely. *************************The guy that Nicolas Cage was conning was IN ON THE CON! He did not get shot at all (with a real gun anyway).************************* -Nicolas Cage was in the hospital being interrogated by investigators (or did I miss something or is it assumed that these guys were fake also and the hospital just allows ANYONE to impersonate cops). They said they knew everything. Well, apparently not. If they did "know" everything, they wouldn't have threatened the "daughter." After all she didn't DO anything. - Nicolas Cage was handcuffed to the bed, wearing only a hospital gown. But suddenly he was able to just WALK OUT of the hospital and magically had a change of clothes and cab fare? And the police just FORGOT about him after that or what? *************************Nic Cage was not in a real hospital. That was pretty obvious. The cops weren't real as well and was IN ON THE CON. Cage was handcuffed at first so that he will reveal the passcode to his psychiatrist (who was also IN ON THE CON, but I'm sure you got that). Also, they left clothes for Cage on a chair right by the "hospital's" door (there's even a note on it with "Roy's" written on it). One could assume that there was transportation money there as well. Basically he was handcuffed long enough for them to steal his money then set him free once the con job was done.************************* - Are we really supposed to believe that the bank allowed a minor (along with an unidentified male adult) to enter the bank's safety deposit box area and withdraw the entire contents? And without checking with the primary owner of the box first? *************************Cage pretty much made her a primary owner by including her name on the list. Regardless of her age, being a primary owner gives her full rights to access the safety deposit box by herself.************************* - Nicolas Cage had a fear of germs and wouldn't even touch his OWN shoes, and yet he rented BOWLING shoes? - OCD cannot be remedied with placebos! - People with OCD don't just all of a sudden one day "get better." *************************Nic Cage did not have OCD. It's all in his mind. Also, whenever he's around his daughter, he's more carefree, which would explain his wearing bowling shoes. Though part of his is still a germaphobe by cleaning up his bowling ball. But, overall, though, he's a much different person when he's around his daughter.************************* - There were way too many variables for the con for it to have worked out right. The criminals would have had to know all about Nicolas Cage's past and his ex wife and maybe having a kid beforehand. There was no way for them to know about the safety deposit box. There was no way they would know that Nicolas Cage couldn't call his ex and would ask a stranger to do it for him. There was no way they would know that he would ask for his psych doctor and give him the safety deposit info. *************************The "too many variables" all boil down to Nic Cage's best friend, partner, and protégé, Frank. Frank knows everything about Nic Cage. Why do you think Frank conned Cage in the first place? Because he had a lot of money. He was the "Big Con." The biggest ingredient to get the con going was involving the daughter. Her role was integral to discovering where he hid his money (the dog and safety deposit box). Basically, they psychologically profiled Nic Cage's character to the point they knew what he will do. As a con man, Nic Cage made the mistake of being too trustworthy to those who were close to him. It was his downfall and ultimately redemption as the con done to him ultimately led him to a fuller and richer life (minus a million dollars)... :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow to start but Cage made up for it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no idea what this film was about when I went to see it but I am a big fan of Nicolas Cage so I gave it a try, Cage does a great job with his portrayal of an obsessive compulsive and plays a great 'Dad with no clue'. Every time I see Sam Rockwell's face I see that retard paedophile rapist from The Green Mile, but he plays a good part in this as the protégé of a conman, and is funny as hell in some parts.When Alison Lohman shows up she seems a little too confident for the 14 year old she plays (which could be intentional as you will find at the end of the film) I also think that the relationship with her 'father' was too easy as they seem to have known each other for years after meeting for a couple of times. (again this could have been intentional, but if all this was deliberate then Lohman is the best actress I've ever seen) The film really starts when Lohman learns the con, and Cage teaches her whilst trying to be a good father at the same time.The film is a little slow but I don't mind this if the dialogue is good enough to back it up, and Cage is his natural cool nature and Rockwell works great with him I just wish Cage would play another Caster Troy type character in a film, I was hoping for this character in this film but I don't think the 'father daughter' relationship would worked as well as it did. I did not see the ending coming and it was a complete shock which I love in a film, Cage's character took it well too. I was hoping for a cheesy Blade type ending where Cage goes to find the con men right before the end credits but it didn't happen. Slow film but made up for it with Cage and Lohman's chemistry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie puts the "M" in mental!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knowing the case of OCD would give away the man. Nicholas Cage does it so well in "Matchstick Men". Playing a con man with OCD would make any crook want to give himself in. Such a neat freak even Felix Unger would rather have him as a roommate and would kick Oscar Madison out. Only if he found out about his line of work, Felix would rather stay with Oscar instead. Working with other cons would be a piece of cake. But the real victim in the movie is the con victims but the con man himself. Everyone he's working for are bigger con artists than himself. His shrink is a fake, his "daughter", for goodness sakes, who's the real deal around here? Since all of this was nothing more than a head game, the whole thing would make Roy Waller(Cage) find a new line of work, and a new environment as well. Roy's fake daughter(Alison Lohman, "White Oleander") was a born natural, only she realized she was going to get stiffed by Frank herself. Talk about who out-conned who? There were two victims there. I think this movie is really for the mental and the worrisome. It has a lot of everything you want in a movie. Great cast, great storyline, everything was great itself. I've enjoyed it very well. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm frustrated that this movie doesn't make sense! Can anyone explain?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie left me frustrated! Can anyone explain the following? 1. The psychiatrist called his ex-wife and reported to Cage that he has a teenage daughter. But at the end of the movie, his ex-wife tells him she miscarried. Thus the girl is not his daughter. So why did the shrink lie, telling him he has a daughter?2. Why did the girl act like she was Cage's daughter?3. The cops had Cage surrounded in the hospital. How did he get away from them?4. At the end, the guy Cage swindled was shot by Cage's supposed daughter. Thought he was dead, but was it he who socked Cage in the face when Cage returned to help him? If so, what happened to him? Did he die after all? And how was it Cage never was a suspect in his death?The ending of this movie really has me irritated! Can anyone shed any light?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot predictability and the con genre. (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the films, both comedy and drama, that I have seen in the con men genre, this has to be one of my least favorite for the sheer reason that 1) the main character is given far too much attention is and his incredibly anal personality makes him a rather boring spectacle, and 2) it provides too many clues to the audience, which lead to a rather predictable plot. Although, the latter may just be a result of my having seen too much of the con men genre and thus, have some idea of which details are essential and what kind of character interaction I should expect. Even where such details create an obvious storyline, some films like Following and Criminal have done it well enough to at least satisfy, if not altogether wow it's audiences. Matchstick Men doesn't seem to me to have that same effect. It was a great idea, what unfolds in this story of two con men and the reunion of one with his estranged daughter, but something there just lacked the pizazz and I have yet to figure out what it is.Nicholas Cage plays an obsessive compulsive con man. An unusual character combination. He and his partner/protégé, Frank Mercer (Sam Rockwell who, like another viewer suggested was indeed not given nearly enough screen time as he should have), are involved in a con job involving a rather large sum of money. It seems like an easy job and Roy and Frank are just waiting for the payoff.In the meantime, Roy (Cage) becomes debilitated when he runs out of medication needed to control his compulsive behavior. When he tries to contact this therapist and learns that the guy left town, he hires a new one who is pivotal to reuniting Cage with his estranged daughter who is purported to be living with his ex-wife. And this is where Ridley Scott's own con begins.The rules of the con men genre are simple. Those who seem like the most inexperienced cons, or at least secondary grifters, are usually just as observant and capable as their mentors (see Criminal). There is always a con being played, even at times when the audience may've been told that it has not yet begun or was completed at some point (see Following). And every character, no matter how innocent, is usually involved in one way or another. That is usually why the casts are so small, typically involving two or three main characters and three or four supporting characters. No on in innocent and the twists of the story require using these characters to out-con the cons, especially the primary cons. And Matchstick Men plays by every rule.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly clever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott shows his versatility by now turning his head to a story about swindle, here Nicholas Cage and Sam Rockwell are a team that lures people of their money in different ways. Its an easygoing story set in sunny LA, but manages to be quite clever. I never expected the plot twist, mostly because I hate to watch plot twist films and don't expect it from a movie that I like, so I think it was well done. In fact, my English teacher told us in class that when we write a short story we should always have a plot twist, a surprise ending. This I felt were so ridiculous, if you always expect a twist, then there would be no twist if the movie were not ending in a more normal, pre 'The Usual Suspects' style. Scott is probably more than aware of all the silly scripts out there with this element to them, so knowing that and seeing that he utilizes it in a good way was a refreshing breath.Nic Cage is good in this movie, but his nervous compulsiveness get a little too much at times. Music is so-so. Direction and story is good. Go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Nicholas Cage's finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I saw the movie "Leaving Las Vegas" for the first time, I'm a fan of Nicholas Cage. I don't know how he does it, but he always seems to be in his natural environment, he almost never seems to be acting. Of course not every movie he has made once is a big success (I don't think there is any actor that can say that he only made great movies), but I think I'm not exaggerating if I say that "Matchstick Man" is one of his best until now.It's about Roy Waller and Frank Mercer, a couple of very successful and professional small-time con artists. Their main target: old and lonely people who are easy to manipulate and eager to believe what they are told. Each time they sell one of their 'exclusive', 'outstanding', 'incredible' water filtration systems for 5 to 10 times the actual price, they earn a few hundreds of dollars. Not exactly much, but all together it makes a nice living. But Frank's private life isn't as successful as his business. He's an obsessive-compulsive agoraphobic, who needs a clear routine and a psychoanalyst just to keep him in working order. He doesn't even have time for personal relationships, until he's confronted with the fact that he has a 14-year old daughter who would love to meet him. At first his whole world is turned upside-down, but gradually he develops paternal feelings for the teenage girl that wants nothing more but to follow her dad in his professional footsteps...This movie really has several good things to offer and was a nice surprise. Next to the excellent performances of Nicholas Cage and Sam Rockwell, I was surprised by Alison Lohman's performance. She did an excellent job as the teenage daughter. But not only the acting was more than average, so was the story. It was funny and touching at the same time and really offered everything that I look for in a movie. As I already said earlier in my review: it's one of Cage's best movies. I give it a 7.5/10 at least, although an 8/10 isn't too much for this excellent movie either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott directs this excellent comedy thriller about a con man whose life is interrupted by the discovery that he is a father.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring: Nicolas Cage, Sam Rockwell, Alison Lohman When I first watched this movie, I really had no idea what to expect. I'd only seen one brief preview, I read the back of the DVD case, and then I rented it. Suffice to say I'm very glad I took the initiative to make that first rental. It now sits proudly in my DVD collection, and I think this is a fantastic flick.Roy (Cage) and Frank (Rockwell) are a couple of con men, or matchstick men if you prefer. As the case of the movie says, if there's a sucker born every minute, these guys would be working the delivery room. They run all sorts of small time scams, including selling water filtration systems at absurdly high prices with the promise of a prize coming in the mail, or pretending to be the FBI to get clearance into people's checking accounts, and so on.Roy is uncomfortable outdoors, he hates dirt and messiness, he hates it when people say "J---- C-----" (as do I), and he has many other little quirks. He is on heavy medication that he is getting illegally, but then one day he accidentally spills the whole bottle down the drain. He calls his doctor to get more, only to find out his doctor has moved. Roy becomes a complete recluse and spends a week just cleaning his house, over and over and over. Finally Frank comes over to see him because he isn't returning or answering calls. Frank gets him to go see a shrink.The shrink, Dr. Klein, puts Roy on a "new medication," which Roy does not realize until later are just placebos. It helps Roy a little bit, but not much. Then Roy decides that he's going to call his ex-wife to see what happened to the baby that she was carrying in her womb when he left her. He can't bring himself to talk to her, so he gets Dr. Klein to give her a call. Then Klein gives Roy a call and lets him know that his fourteen year old daughter, Angela (Lohman) would really like to meet him.The movie has two primary focuses. The first is the relationship between Roy and Angela. It's several twists and turns, and if you're pretty smart, you might be able to figure out some of them before the credits roll, but I didn't.The movie probably won't end how you expect it to, but that's part of what makes it so great.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adult Revelation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicolas Cage seems to grab juicy, serious parts for his roles. With teens flocking to see slocky special effects, there are fewer thoughtful films for the forty and up to see. Cage in Adaptation and later Matchstick Men carries the flag for adult revelation movies.These types of film show the protagonist's messy life. The revelation that your existence has hit a wall is usually catalyzed by an unusual event, for an example, Cage's 14 year-old daughter he has never seen has suddenly arrived in the midst of con-man shenanigans. All hell breaks lose during a caper, and retro father-Cage has to make some mature decisions. If I described the trick ending, and there is a trick ending, there would be a spoiler alert, but this film isn't so much a film about tricky cons, it's a revelatory of personality atrophy.Matchstick Men plays a little slow at times with good acting and fair-to-good swindle surprises.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholas Cage proves himself yet again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that Cage's last film, Adaptation, was not as warmly accepted by everyone as it was by me, but I feel that it was one of the most intelligent and creative films to be released in a long time, and with Matchstick Men, he assumes a role in another extremely well-made and well thought-out film. I remember seeing the preview, in which Cage's character learns that he has a teenage daughter from a long dead relationship and, being a con-man, ends up being convinced by her to teach her something of his trade. At the time, I expected his character to be something more similar to his character in Snake Eyes than Adaptation - a smooth talking, fast paced kind of guy who knows what he wants and how to get it.Needless to say, it came as a surprise to see his character in Matchstick Men literally incapacitated by something as simple as someone leaving a sliding glass door open. I can kind of relate to that little quirk, in a way, because in movies, for example, when someone jumps out of a car and leaves the door open or doesn't answer a ringing phone it drives me nuts. (spoilers) About midway through the film, I was simply waiting for it to end. I was completely convinced that Cage was going to do one last score, his daughter would get taken hostage or something, he would have to give up his biggest payoff ever to save the life of this little girl that he just met, and he would suddenly find it within himself to give up his life of crime and start being a legitimate and loving father. Maybe he and his wife would even get back together, I was just waiting for it. Thankfully, the movie takes a completely different direction and, while I still find some of the details of the conclusion slightly hard to believe, it was great to see something so fresh and original and entertaining. There were spectacular performances in this film, the comic relief was abundant and effective, and the film never once panders to exactly what the audience wants to see. So here are the problems that I can see people having with this film. It might be seen as one of those movies that deliberately leads the audience in the wrong direction and then pops this twist on them at the end, and while that may not be completely untrue, it doesn't do it in a way that leaves you feeling cheated. Every movie with a successful twist has to lead you in the wrong direction to a certain extent, but it is whether or not it was obvious or at least cleverly crafted that makes the difference, and Matchstick Men is VERY cleverly crafted.Perhaps more pressing than the concern of leading the audience in the wrong direction, Matchstick Men does, in fact, have a problem with being a little bit too convenient. It is a very complex story, which makes it extremely entertaining, but this also gives it the feeling (especially when the girl happens to walk into her father's work at the carpet store at the end of the film) that everything just worked out too perfectly. Sure, deciding to buy carpet with her loser boyfriend at just the wrong carpet store is perfectly plausible, it may seem strange that she did it exactly six months after ripping him off. But of course, as always, Nicholas Cage delivers a great performance as the slightly disturbed but highly amusing Roy Waller, and Sam Rockwell draws on some of his best performances, especially his performance as Billy the Kid in The Green Mile, and takes the best parts while still adding new dimensions to his iconography. Outstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasing criminals on-the-job movie - if a little thin and predictable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nic Cage and Sam Rockwell play LA con artists who make easy money from well known cons like the "Jamaican Switch.": Looking like they are exchanging goods or money with a mark, but actually only handing over a lookalike dummy. To make things a bit different Cage is a cleanliness obsessive with an estranged wife and daughter.I generally like con movies although you can only watch so many before you realise that there is only about five possible plot lines - and this uses them all up. If this movie doesn't have alarm bells going off in your head then you are obviously new to movies or have turned your brain off - not that this isn't the best way to get through a lot of modern Hollywood!Despite its flaws this is a slick and entertaining product that gets going quickly and keeps going. Yes we have twist after twist, but con men only have two things in mind: To make easy money from their mark and stay out of jail. Nothing else matters because no one gets tired of earning easy money. However Hollywood has to spin something around this empty spool - or it just becomes a repeating men-at-work movie.(Many criminal movies are actually men-at-work films. We watch them from behind their shoulder for long periods taking in the detail of all they do. If plumbing was illegal I guess a lot of movies would be about that too: How are we going to get around that tough U-bend? The dilemma, the dilemma...) The introduction of Cage's daughter (Alison Lohman) really mixes up the lead con, and heaven help us, if he isn't mixed up enough already. Thankfully Cage's acting makes up for the predictable nature of the script - that has all the freedom of a tram-car on a one way street.Maybe this movie plays better with people that fall victims to con artists. People think that there is such a thing as a free lunch or free money. That one day a stranger is going to come in to your life and give you what you have always wanted asking nothing in return. WC Fields said you can't con an honest man and this movie isn't smart enough to con the honest viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scott, Cage and Rockwell. Good team, no? I'm not quite sure how this fits into Ridley's 'canon'; but of his others, it reminded me most strongly of "Thelma and Louise" (perhaps because I only recently saw that, too... ) It's true to say that the characters in both are all on the margins of society; and the director once again makes good use of that 'dusky' visual style of his. Maybe since the '90's, he's been going through something of an 'outlaw' phase, who knows? A full-on Scott 'Western' would certainly be interesting...One thing about 'outsiders' - they can be tasty, if they bite back; and there's plenty of sneakiness and double-dealings going on, here in the world of the tricksters. Cage has once again managed to find a showcase for all of his wacky tics, but impressively, without treading over old ground. When he's on his game, there are few in Hollywood capable of outdoing him. Rockwell has long been a talent to watch, and is someone who might well have an edge on Cage, in the future. Here, it's a crying shame that his wait to go 'mainstream' seems destined to be prolonged; owing first to MM's lukewarm and undeserved reception, and secondly to the fact that he's largely playing third fiddle in the scheme of things. This plays out mainly as a movie about a long-lost family discovering a bond, and as such, it's Cage and his screen daughter who are afforded the majority of the limelight.Apologies if some find this review 'meandering'; but the joy of Matchstick Men is to let events unfold right as you watch - and knowing that someone of such consummate skill as Ridley Scott is in charge, I'd be very surprised if more than a demanding few were left feeling conned out of their time and money. The whole thing is a sleight of hand so deft that my immediate reaction was one of wanting to be taken for a ride all over again...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Il Bidone, reworked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know Matchstick Men was based on a novel, but Ridley Scott's film is actually a very amusing reworking of Il Bidone, Fellini's classic (yet regrettably little-seen) mid-50s opus about three con-men in postwar Italy. Their neuroses and distinct personality traits form the core of the tension in both films, and although Il Bidone has a much darker ending, the emotional payload is the same: the aloneness of these men. Scott's meticulous attention to the details of performance is almost on a par with Fellini's (which is saying something, especially with the 50s films), and Cage and Rockwell do a fine job making their characters funny and poignant.Other comparisons: Whereas in Il Bidone, the daughter of the Broderick Crawford character was only in one scene and was more of an emotional catalyst than an active player in the story, here the "daughter" obviously has a larger role, and mostly for the better. Also, parts of Hans Zimmer's score slyly suggest elements of Nino Rota's music for Il Bidone. Overall verdict: Not another irrelevant remake, but a most imaginative reworking.</fullReview>

For me it happened right when he was giving his "daughter" access to his fortune. "Oh," I thought to myself, "This is a con-the-con-man movie!" Eh. I was hoping and praying that they would do something interesting with it. Or at least make it believable. It wasn't. In order for the con of Nick Cage to work, all of the following conditions had to be met: 1) Mr. Cage could never call his ex-wife2) Mr Cage had to ask the fake doctor to call his ex-wife for him. 3) Cage would entrust is fortune to his "daughter" so quickly4) Mr Cage would give the secret code to his fake doctor.5) Cage, a master con artist, could never suspect anything fishy.That's a lot of pieces to fall into place for a con. I would have just staged a phony kidnapping of the girl after it appeared he cared for her.The worst, though, was the feel-good ending completely tacked on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Homage to Fellini</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is "La Dolce Vita" "lite" for those of us who may have trouble parsing the densely packed Fellini original for the moral. I was thinking about the line from one of Paul's epistles where he says, "There is a way that seems right to a man, but the end is death." Fellini's "Vita"--and now Matchstick Men ("MM")--are entrants in the canon of films that explore this idea. It takes more work to get this out of "Vita," because the hero (Marcello Rubini, played by Mastroianni) is so clean-cut and well-intentioned--we could all plausibly want what he wants--so Fellini had his work cut out for him driving us to the conclusion that, no, we *don't* want what Marcello wants; the end thereof is death. The anti-heroes from MM are pre-fabed lost souls; we are quite unlikely to want what they want, and are chomping at the bit to see something give. So when Cage's daughter shows up, we can almost hear the strains of Bobby Darin singing "The Good Life" returning to us in our mind's ear.Add to all this the sweet, almost reverential, use of Rota's "Vita" incidental music in the "airport" and there's no mistaking it; Ridley Scott most assuredly had some tipping of the chapeau to Fellini in mind as he worked out the details of this movie. Fellini fans should take note and indulge in a controlled swoon during this sequence.So: Is the film good? Here's my experience. Like many others commenting in these pages, I felt left a little high and dry by the ending--it just wasn't realistic, and I felt the mythic payload of the movie didn't compensate; it didn't feel like the suspension of disbelief required to accept the ending paid off adequately. However, the film grew on me over the next day. I went back and watched it again, and started to warm up to the overarching theme; the trap of the "sweet life." MM is an accessible "Vita." Some people were put off by the film's final shot before they fade to black. I wasn't. Call me a sappy romantic greenass, but I was deeply touched. This *very* lost soul has finally figured it out; and he got his lesson from life experiences that had been architected to con him. Fascinating!</fullReview>

This comedy was refreshing and a real relief from all the usual comedys*** we usually have to watch and the three characters played splendid, not that I expected anything else from Cage but let me say that Alison Lohman has it all in her to become the next big actress. Absolutely a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Nicolas Cage's best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott has done G.I.JANE that is stinky and he has done GLADIATOR that is one piece of brilliant moviemaking, so, this is his latest instalment so far. Nicolas Cage stars together with CHARLIE'S ANGELS 1 wannabe star Sam Rockwell (and CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND). The movie rolls on with a confidence, with a charm, humour, entertainment, dramatic and warm that is one of the best seen in a long time.Nicolas Cage is absolutely brilliant and the movie has got such a fine mood and is all over such a wonderful movie that I just sat there and had a huge smile all over my mouth threw the whole movie. Although the end is more of serious and dramatic, it is the first half of the movie that is really a beauty. Although the other half is just as good the movie is sort of split in half; the choosy, wity and smart part and the violent and dramatic part. The movie has got a lot of nice twists such as the final thing happening with Cage. MATCHSTICK MEN works as good as it can work, and it reminds of CATCH ME IF YOU CAN a lot of times and if that isn't a compliment I don't know!This is one of Cage's best movies. All I got to say is; it's a jolly fine movie where about everything works well. STARS: 4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm really surprised this didn't get nominated for any awards for 2003.This is a great movie. Nicholas Cage is hilarious as the narotic cleanfreak. And Sam Rockwell plays his partner in crime. When Roy's daughter comes in the picture, for a moment you think the film is going to go downhill but after 30 seconds with her the movie goes....uphill.. The ending blew me away but I think they didn't need the additional ending that kind of ruined the alreadysurprising ending as it is. You will understand what I'm saying after youwatch this movie. 4/5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nic Cage is in top form as a neurotic con artist who meets his teenage daughter for the first time and somewhat reluctantly begins teaching her his trade. Nothing is what it seems in this funny, and sometimes sad, movie and the ending has not one but two major twists -- and I guarantee no one will see them coming. The very fetching Alison Lohman, who also plays a key role in Tim Burton's BIG FISH, is the spunky daughter who manages to look just enough like Nic Cage to make you believe she is indeed his daughter. Highly recommended. A little long, but so be it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nic and his tics !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Intelligent comedies about clever, middle-aged and normal looking people who make their living out of ripping other people off... We see a lot of these lately. You might even start to think that the whole image of the "American Dream" has changed. Being an impostor now seems the ideal way of life.Personally, I didn't mind watching Matchstick Men ( far from it ! ) but I do think we've seen it by now. After a while it all becomes so predictable and you can't get surprised anymore. Whenever there's a twist shown, you start to think that it's part of the plan anyway. So these movies about the ideal heist, perfect murder etc may slow down a bit as far as I'm concerned.But nevertheless, I advise you to see Matchstick Men !! Not so much for the story (which is still very entertaining and enjoyable) but most of all for the terrific acting and directing skills in it. I often read the comment that Ridley Scott has lost his genius and that he'll never make movies like "Alien" or "Blade Runner" anymore. That's probably true but so what ? He still is a very talented storyteller and he proved it again here. Although I didn't like "Hannibal" and hated "Gladiator", I still think Scott is among the greatest living directors in Hollywood. Nicolas Cage is perfect as ever and he once again confirms that he's one of the greatest actors ever. His character totally makes this movie and if it wasn't for his tics and phobia's, it would be a terrible average and dull movie. But it has to said...Nic is perfectly backed up by Alison Lohman. This girl is multi-talented and I'm sure she'll win an Oscar one of these years. She's the best young and rather "new" actress since Anna Paquin in my opinion. And, I admit it, I'm glad I learned afterwards that she's in fact 24 years old instead of her 14 year old character. She really looked cute !That said, I recommend Matchstick Men also for the great use of music and soundtrack. Great oldies feature in it and several tunes stick in your head long after you finished watching it. I love it when this happens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who's really being conned here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is much to like in this quirky tale of two con-men, Cage and Rockwell, who set themselves up for the "big sting" they can finally retire on. Cage is ultimately engaging as the obssessive compulsive Roy Waller who discovers at the most inopportune moment that he is the proud owner of a free-spirited fourteen year old daughter. Unfortunately however several other factors conspire to detract from the film's overall impact.While Cage adds effortlessly to his gallery of 'troubled' screen characters - the nervous tics especially he affects well, the film's climactic 'twist' has been telegraphed for the best part of an hour and fifteen minutes. Furthermore, saturation pre-publicity that actress Alison Lohman who plays Angela, Waller's 14 year old daughter Angela, is in fact 24, totally beggars the question "now WHY would they need an actress of that age to play a young schoolgirl? The more you dwell on that point, the quicker the film is totally ruined for anyone of even the vaguest intelligence.It has been suggested that MATCHSTICK MEN contains no Ridleyesque signature artwork. In fact, his trademark blue filtered light is in evidence in many scenes if you care to look a little harder. As I said at the outset, the film is far from being a loser, Cage's performance alone nails that tight...but from the half-way point onwards it degenerates significantly. The trite ending simply does not do the film justice at all.Ultimately, and it pains me to say this, MATCHSTICK MEN is way less than either its early promise or the sum of its disordered parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The old con within a con</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[W A R N I N G : S P O I L E R S!]Ridley Scott's Matchstick Men is from a novel by semi-cult writer Eric Garcia. The premise is well publicized: a con man who suffers from various forms of compulsive behavior discovers that he has a fourteen-year-old daughter, and for a while - spanned by the movie - she becomes a part of his life. Meanwhile his partner pushes him into the big score he's long avoided.Matchstick Men is the opportunity for the hardworking Nicolas Cage to take on another challenge: playing a loveable neurotic who's also a serious criminal. A con job, a father-daughter story, and a psychological portrait all in one, this screenplay takes on a bit more than it can handle. Even though Ridley Scott does his best to give it deftness and rhythm, the movie doesn't fully develop as either crime drama or family drama. It doesn't show character in depth like Stephen Frears' The Grifters; doesn't study con games and con artists in detail like Nine Queens; and isn't as exciting and suspenseful as crime thrillers like The Italian Job or Rififi. The fun, and fun there undeniably is, is in watching the actors and filmmakers try to distract us from these shortcomings. At moments they do succeed. But then you realize you've been conned, and you haven't gotten to the bottom of the crime, the con mentality, or the neurotic personalities of the principals.As the movie opens Roy (Cage, the compulsive) and partner-protégé Frank (Sam Rockwell, who's more of an adrenalin junky and wastrel) are involved in `short cons,' What they're doing now is using fake phone prizes to get into people's bank accounts. Roy can function well living alone in his immaculate house, so long as he has his meds. But when they suddenly run out (one wonders why a compulsive would run out of anything: he has two or more of every household cleaner), Roy goes bonkers, and then finds that his usual source of meds has left town. Frank finds Roy a psychiatrist named Klein to help Roy get his meds, and Klein not only gives Roy some new and different pills but also persuades him to come in for continuing therapy. This brings out Roy's need to know if his ex-wife had a kid, and he gets Klein to call the wife for him. Before long fourteen-year-old Angela (Alison Lohman) enters Roy's life.Angela is a feisty, tomboyish girl with rough pigtails, a skateboard, sparkling eyes and cheekbones like Mariel Hemingway, as well as a surprisingly strong urge to learn about the grifter life. Against his better judgment Roy shows Angela some elementary cons and she turns out to have a natural gift for the work. Roy is torn between the belief that he ought to keep Angela far away from such business and the certain knowledge that it is the best way for them to bond, which he ardently desires.Matchstick Men is (like Nine Queens but more simply) a con within a con, which seeks to con the audience. The trouble with this device is that when we go back and analyze the way we were conned, it makes the cons in the story themselves tend to crumble. Little effort is given, in fact, to making the men's climactic `long con,' in which they plan to take a lot of money from a nasty rich man (Bruce BcGill) either convincing or well fleshed out. If the whole movie is a con on us, can we trust its portrait of the grifter life? The one time that real con men are honest is when they're explaining their cons.The man who best knows Roy, the compulsive-neurotic con artist Nick Cage plays, is obviously his partner and protégé, Frank (the wild and crazy Rockwell is fairly well used here), who's as much a wastrel and slob as Roy is tidy and anal, and it's Frank's con - also foisted on us as well as Roy - to invent the fourteen-year-old daughter who cons Roy out of his whole stash of cash. Even if you don't realize that till late in the game, the whole network of cons and characters eventually shatters.This plot device is as weak as most of the cons. As Nine Queens (a fuller portrait of con artists) points out, grifters are on guard against other grifters, and an experienced con artist won't fall for his protégé's con. Matchstick Men gets around this problem by presenting a hero who is sympathetically flawed: Roy's mildly disabling ticks and phobias make us feel for him and then he turns out to be a complete softy. The girl's evaluation is to say, `You're not a bad man. You're just not a good one.' And yet he's an ace at his trade. `You don't seem bad,' the daughter says when she's met him. `That's why I'm good,' he answers.But is that believable? Is that enough? There's something missing from the portrait of Roy. All that Cage gets across to us are the tics and the lovability. He does a fine job of that, but he doesn't round out his portrait with any sense of the edge of cruel brilliance that would explain how Roy could have accumulated a huge stash of dough in a safety deposit box without ever being arrested.It's exciting and fun when Roy and Frank, Roy driving with his daughter, head for the airport to complete the big `long con.' Both male actors contribute to this, but Lohman is at her least sympathetic during this sequence.Frears' The Grifters has a detailed and memorable mother-son relationship (Angelica Huston and John Cusack) as well as a story of hers with her boss, and that way the movie explores the soullessness and cruelty of con artist relations in real, chilly depth. By comparison Matchstick Men's father-daughter relationship is slight; it's not developed through a whole movie like Paper Moon's. In the end it's just a bit of lively playing around. The movie keeps us amused for a while, but it leaves us hungry. There are no real payoffs in Matchstick Men, nor does it ever quite decide what it is.My guess is that the injection of both more comedy and more violence, a la Pulp Fiction, might have made it work better. But I don't know. Maybe the filmmakers just conned themselves into thinking they had something here when they didn't; maybe Eric Garcia did too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Switch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Ridley Scott made a monstrous comeback with Gladiator, Hannibal, and Blackhawk Down, he chose this topic. For whatever reason, Matchstick Men is superior in most areas than its bigger budget brothers. The acting, Cage in particular, is better and the visual trickery and goofiness of Scott shines better than Spielberg did with Catch Me if You Can. Just when I thought I understood him as a director, he goes and changes gear on us again. First I thought he'd be stuck in a fantasy genre after Legend, then an obscure drama line of work with G.I. Jane. Now he's gone from pompous blockbuster supporter to film guerrilla. Obviously he is smarter than James Cameron, Sydney Pollack, George Lucas, Quentin Tarantino, and--perhaps--even Oliver StoneAlas, I cannot really say the same for Alison Lohman. In my book, the two best child-actor performances have always been Christian Bale in Empire of the Sun and Natalie Portman in Leon. Granted, those roles weren't perfect, but they utilized the persona and attitude of the child rather than have some young adult try the role. More memories popped up in my head during Matchstick Men of the "kids" in The Breakfast Club rather than anything truly credible. Fortunately, the director has better things in mind...Scott truly is a visual maestro and everything he's done in the last 12 years has only been an exploitation of that visual grandeur, not caring about the relative comfort of script and acting. Perhaps Thelma &amp; Louise can really be considered his last true film where the actors were allowed to let lose with their own nuances, certainly compared to the operatic emptiness of Hannibal and the cacophony of combat in 'Blackhawk'. Sadly, Hans Zimmer's music isn't a help this time around and really ruins a lot of the moods.Overall, a trademark Scott false-ending, a mediocre storyline, and one of Cage's quirkier performances make this good, but not great. I am happy that Nicolas has since abandoned the money roles of The Rock and Con Air for better work. 3 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matchstick Men: 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, it's hard to believe that Matchstick Men is a Ridley Scott film. He's mainly known for his gruesome films, like Hannibal and Alien. However, for each Black Hawk Down, there's a Thelma and Louise. Matchstick Men is by no means a violent film, nor hard to watch. In fact, out of all of the movies of 2003 so far, I'll bet that this movie has more rewatch value than most. What really makes Matchstick Men a realistic piece is the acting, which I will get into later.Nicolas Cage, in hopefully another Oscar nominated role, plays Roy, a con man (artist, as he would correct you) with obsessive-compulsive disorder. He and his partner Frank (Sam Rockwell) aren't in the big-time, but still collect decent sums of money. However, he runs out of his pills he needs to control some of his OCD, and his doctor's moved, so he goes to a psychiatrist (Bruce Altman) in order to get some more. In the course of it, he decides to see if his wife, who was pregnant when they were divorced, has a child. Lo and behold, she does, and 23-going-on-14 Angela (Alison Lohman) is introduced into his life.Roy, obviously, doesn't know the first thing about parenting, which doesn't work well with Angela's semi-rebellious behavior. Also, to thicken the plot even more, Roy and Frank are about to perform a huge con on someone, and don't want anyone in their way. Roy doesn't want Angela to know about his real profession (he tells everyone he's into antiquing). And then things start to heat up.Going into Matchstick Men, I was expecting something like Ocean's Eleven, a light-hearted crime caper (not necessarily a comedy), and that's what I got. Although it's not as entertaining nor as confusing as Ocean's Eleven, they're both good movies in their own right. Matchstick Men runs too long at about 110 minutes, but I never felt like checking my watch or wanting to leave. I have read a little of the book by Eric Garcia (it didn't really keep my interest), but not much. Therefore, throughout the movie, I had no idea what was going to happen. At the ending `twist', I predicted it right before Roy did, so I was happy, not only for myself for being able to guess it, but how Scott made the movie go out, I had no idea.Cage, unlike Adaptation., deserves whatever awards or nominations he manages to get. Not only did he make me believe that, yes, he was Roy the con man, but he was also Roy the obsessive-compulsive. The only other actor I have seen portray someone with OCD so well is Tony Shalhoub as Adrian Monk on TV's Monk. The way that he acted was so realistic. However (this is a script complaint), about halfway through or so, he basically lost his OCD. Anyway, Rockwell added another impressive performance, but he didn't have much to do/work with. Lohman impressed me, very much so. I didn't expect so much out of her.This may be considered going off on a tangent, but it makes sense that Robert Zemeckis is an executive producer. He's a protégé of Steven Speilberg, possibly most famous for his false endings. If the last ten minutes or so had been slashed off, then maybe Matchstick Men could have gotten a higher rating. However, it wasn't, so the rating is a solid 7/10.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for thematic elements, violence, some sexual content and language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As Ridley Scott movies go, "Matchstick Men" is a small one. There aren't any replicants, gladiators or xenomorphs, but it's still a good bit of fun. Sam Rockwell's involved, so the cast is great by default, but Alison Lohman's no slouch. And Nicolas Cage wrings every laugh possible from his OCD tics. But it's a con artist movie (damn good one, too) and just when you think you've got it pegged as a sweet father/daughter story, up is suddenly down and you've been had this entire time. And it's not a cheap swindle, but one that definitely pays off in the end. The twists are well staged and the sentiment is genuine. Great movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit contrived, but a lot of fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While parts of the story are insanely contrived and hard to believe (like the fact that Roy doesn't call his ex-wife the entire time Angela is with him, especially when he comes home and she's gone), Matchstick Men is a really stylish and entertaining story of a unique form of con man. Nicolas Cage gives a decent performance, but I felt he went a bit over-the-top from time to time. And of course my complete hatred of Bruce McGill never helps. The real stars of the film are Sam Rockwell and Alison Lohman. As always, Rockwell delivers a flawless performance that was completely overlooked. His charismatic hilarity is the perfect fit for the film and he embodied the character so wonderfully. His laugh is absolutely infectious. Lohman gives a stunning performance with tons of emotional range. It's a wonder that she was 22 years old when she auditioned for the film, and she perfectly portrays a 14 year old girl. Amazing. The big twist was quite shocking and I still really loved it the second time around. It almost makes up for all of those contrivances at the beginning.</fullReview>

But the viewer is entirely at the mercy of the film as it develops in its own way. Its exploration of the art of the scam is similar to Mamet's _House of Games_, but much more aimed at the complex Cage character and the unexpected turns he encounters.Don't you love it when you really like a film and then afterward discover it was directed by one of your favorite directors? I had no idea it was a Scott film. It's remarkable Scott is so successful in this modest film after his "big" films _Gladiator_ and _Black Hawk Down_.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie somehow helps explain my life. This poor guy is trapped in a life of lies. Everything is affected by it. It seems like he has to somehow keep everything else about himself perfect because of the guilt he carries around because of what he does. I found I was really able to relate to the this idea of having to keep all these secrets and how it can affect your life more than you think. On the subject of Alison Lohman's part: She is by far the most realistic and talented actress I have ever seen. Is she even acting? She made her part so real that It didn't even seem like a movie. She made me believe that I was living the life of this con artist finding a new unfelt and unconditional love of a father for his daughter. I have never been so emotional during a movie. It seemed like she was fixing my life like she was fixing her fathers. She made me want to be a better person in the same way she made her father feel. She made me want to love her like her father wanted to. She also destroyed my life in the same way his is when he finds out it was all a lie. When he sees her again all you want him to do is grab her and say "Don't you know I loved you?" but you can feel a fathers relief when he knows that she is alright and that she is happy and he will see her again. The Production and direction of this film were perfect. Ridley Scott is amazing and grabbed me by the heart and never let go. He made me want to be an honest man. Alison if you ever read this, thank you and keep up the good work. Your acting truly inspires me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very solid thriller from Ridley Scott</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matchstick Men is Ridley Scott's return to form after a rather torrid decade with the 1990's. While the film is not as great as his masterpieces; classics such as Blade Runner and Alien, Matchstick Men is still a very solid entry into the con artist sub-genre. I'm a big fan of con-artist films, especially ones that are done well and so I really enjoyed this one. The plot follows Roy Waller, a highly neurotic con man with an estranged daughter, Angela. Roy does his cons with his partner Frank, and the two have just hatched a plan to con a rich businessman out of his hard earned cash. The film benefits from great performances, most notably from Alison Lohman as Roy's daughter. Her performance is good in it's own right, but it's even more amazing when you consider that the actress playing the fourteen year old girl is actually twenty four! Nicolas Cage puts in a nice, if slightly over the top performance; but he always ensures that the action stays interesting, and even Sam Rockwell does well with his role; although he's definitely the third party in this movie.Matchstick Men takes obvious influence from a range of sources, but most notably the Peter Bogdanovich masterpiece; Paper Moon. The way that Roy interacts with his daughter is reminiscent of that movie, but it's also different enough to give Matchstick Men a style of it's own. Ridley Scott is on top form with this movie, and his direction is a huge advantage for it. The pace of the film always suits what's happening on screen; it's thrilling when needs to be, mysterious when it needs to be, and it's even quite touching at times. Matchstick Men is one of those films that are easy to view, and it's hugely enjoyable for that reason; but unlike many films in it's class, Matchstick Men stands out because it offers a very potent commentary on the term 'crime doesn't pay'. Also, as is the standard with thrillers like this; I'm happy to report that the twist is superbly handled, and gives the movie a nice payoff. On the whole, I don't hesitate to recommend Matchstick Men to anyone. Though it doesn't set the cinematic world on fire, it offers a good time and is populated with intriguing and interesting characters. Good stuff!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was unjustly over-looked when it first came out. People were probably alienated by Ridley Scott's choice to adapt this book into a film, as it's not as.. Epic, for lack of a better word as most of his other movies. In any case, the fact that this movie was over-looked is nothing short of a trevasty. All the actors in it shine &amp; flesh out their respective characters. Nick Cage is great as Roy, an obsessive-compulsive con-men and Sam Rockwell is possibly better as his protege, Roy. I have to confess that I never saw Alison Lohman in a movie before, having not as of yet seen "Big Fish" &amp; just refusing to watch that chick flick that is "White Oleander", but one can see she does have a nice future in the acting biz.I was all set to give the film an A rating...until the seemingly tacked on last moments of it, that just doesn't fit into the rest of the film no matter how you want to rationalize it, but in spite of this, it still remains one of the most enjoyable films of 2003.My Grade: B+DVD Extras: Movie commentary by Ridley Scott and writers Nicholas &amp; Ted Griffen; the excellent 71 documentary "Tricks of The Trade" (the best one I've seen since "The Hamster Factor and other tales of Twelve Monkeys"; and theatrical Trailer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Matchstick Men" is dramady-lite about Cage as a conman with OCD, phobias, tics, and high anxiety who discovers a 14 year old daughter he never knew he had. The film could be about how he is inspired to reform by having someone to love. The film could be about how she helps him overcome his neuroses. The film could be about lost innocence as he teaches her his trade. The film could be about all these things or none of them. What the film is about is scamming and the discovery of parental love. "Matchstick Men" is a solid three star watch which delivers sweet sentiments, attitude, some action, a whole lot of scamming, good work by Cage and Lohman but gets a little clumsy in the end as it tries to be all things to all people. Beware of spoilers as the film contains some twisty-turny stuff. Other scamming flicks include "The House of Games", "The Spanish Prisoner", "Nine Queens", "The Grifters", "The Prime Gig", and "Confidence". (B)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Feel free to watch the movie but please do yourself a favor. As the end of the movie approaches, there is a scene where Nicholas Cage and his daughter dance at a restaurant. Once that scene is done RUN OUT of the theatre! By doing so you can leave the theatre with a satisfied and happy feeling instead of a bewildered "Why oh god why?" feeling that you'll march out the theatre with if you stay and watch the whole ending.There's just no getting around it. The ending for Matchstick Men is just awful on so many levels, so much so that it actually becomes the only movie I've ever seen where the last ten minutes can ruin the previous two hours. Not only is the ending cruel, preposterous, out-of-touch with the entire movie, but the ending really doesn't add to the movie. It's just done to surprise the audience, and apparently the filmmakers didn't care if most of the audience felt betrayed and angry by the ending...Oh wait they did, with a last painful five minute scene that lamely tries to make up for the "big twist" ending. Just awful.Until the last 15 minutes, Matchstick Men might have been my favorite movie of 2003. However the filmmakers showed outstanding creativity in finding ways to destroy the previous two hours. It was like Ridley Scott and the screenwriters got in a feud with the movie company and decided to sabotage their own product. If that's the case, then bravo boys. You've succeeded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never liked Nicholas Cage but I trust Ridley Scott enough to watch any of his movies and intend to enjoy it. Too bad. This was a boring film. Right from the moment when the psychiater was recommended to Roy I saw the con coming. And it unfolded exactly the way I expected. That's such a bummer! I hate that. The only good moment was hearing the song I'm leaning on a lamppost. I haven't heard that since my gran sang it in the kitchen, a lifetime ago. But it wasn't George Formby and it wasn't played on a ukelele. Another bummer. I hate that. There's really nothing more to be said about my wasted evening. I haven't even asked if my friend liked it because I'm not really interested whether she did or not. She can't have, can she? Not this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charmless characters, preposterous plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen Nicolas Cage turn in a bad performance, but here the role -- an obsessive-compulsive who also has something of a split personality -- offers so many actorly bits of business that the ham in Cage just can't resist; he gives us just too damned many blinks, tics, and twitches (and so does the director, who uses the character's mental state as the excuse for lots of flashy cutting and jerky camera movement). Worse, there seems no connection between the two halves of Cage's character: When he's in his OCD state, he's as exaggerated as a cartoon, and when he's supposedly "medicated" and working a con, he's too icily cool and resourceful to be believed. Still, even when he's overacting in an extremely unrealistic, Hollywoodish part, Cage is likable. I can't say the same for Sam Rockwell, as his partner in crime (it's hard to figure out why anyone would ever want to see this actor again); and least appealing of all is Alison Lohman, introduced to us as Cage's teenage daughter. Lohman, who's actually older than the role she plays, is something rare for a slim young actress: Shrill, stiff, and thoroughly charmless, she manages to make a creepy, unpleasant role even creepier. Because "Matchstick Men" is a three-character movie, with the main character pretty implausible and the two supporting characters fairly repulsive and impossible to care for, watching it becomes tedious pretty quickly. It's gotten some surprisingly sympathetic reviews, but I'm baffled: The audience when I saw it seemed tired and disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More garbage from Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading comments from other viewers on IMDB I can't help but wonder what movie these people saw--or even if the comments are plants by the studio. Studios have been caught using manufactured quotes from a fake critics in their print ads and using phony audience interviews featuring studio employees on television spots, so it certainly seems possible that some comments posted by viewers are suspect, particularly when the comments sound like they were written by the publicity department for the studio and even more particularly when you read gushing comments about something as mediocre as Matchstick Men. Maybe I'm being too hard on the movie because I saw it right after Lost In Translation, which was genuinely great, but I thought Matchstick Men was was shallow, phony garbage, and I wouldn't recommend it to my most hated enemy, even if his tastes were so undiscriminating that he might actually like it. I enjoy con men movies very much, but this is one of the worst and has very serious script problems: 1) The big "twist" is way too predictable for any audience member that's actually paying attention and it's difficult to believe that Nicolas Cage, who is supposed to be very bright and good at what he does, would fall for it; 2) Said big twist is a major miscalculation because it completely invalidates the only part of the movie that was actually working--the blossoming father daughter relationship; 3) The attempt to wring a happy ending from the dark twists of the script's final act feels completely phony--in fact, if Nicolas Cage had turned into a werewolf at the end and eaten the rest of the cast it wouldn't have been any more implausible than what actually makes it to the screen. Matchstick Men is very bad. Stay away. See Lost In Translation or American Splendor or Once Upon A Time In Mexico or one of the other genuinely good movies in release right now but don't waste your money on this cynical, sentimental garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although Having a Great Potential, a Predictable, Corny and Moralist Conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roy Waller (Nicolas Cage) is a paranoid con man, having agoraphobia and many nervous tics. His partner is the ambitious Frank Mercer (Sam Rockwell), who wants to be as rich as Roy is. When the pills of Roy finish, Frank recommends Roy to visit Dr. Klein (Bruce Altman), a psychiatric who could give Roy a prescription for buying his medication. Through Dr. Klein's advice, Roy decides to meet his unknown fourteen years old daughter Angela (Alison Lohman), who changes the life of Roy. "Matchstick Men" is an overrated story with a good but very predictable plot point. My son and I "guessed" what would happen since the beginning of the story. Although having a great potential, with Nicolas Cage and Alison Lohman having magnificent performances and chemistry, after the twist, the story becomes corny and moralist. This commercial conclusion spoils what could be an excellent movie. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Os Vigaristas" ("The Crooks")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable mix of con artist cool and family bonding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roy is neurotic and phobic but it doesn't stop him and his partner Frank being successful conmen. After changing therapists and medication, Roy decides to do a big score with Frank to finish them off. As the score starts, Roy's 14-year-old daughter (whom he has never seen) arrives to spend time with him. When she starts to work out who he actually is during the working day he starts to bond with her and teach her the tricks of his trade - tricks that he will need her to perform.When I went to the cinema to see this my friend took too long in the shops and we missed the start time of it and ending up going into Raising Victor Vargas. Because I owe this film the thanks for seeing that film, I felt I should still see Matchstick Men because it still appealed to me as a film. I rented it at the same time as the film Confidence and, having first watched that, I expected Matchstick Men to be more of the same sort of slick and cool con artist capering with all that that entails. However it was a pleasant surprise to find that this is much more than just a collection of slick ingredients.The film starts as a con artist movie, but doesn't really present itself in the same way as other con artist films do - there is no excess of slick music, visuals or dialogue. However it is still pretty cool in it's own right. What it does do well though is to fill out the plot with something other than the usual collection of twists and turns that the rest of the genre will usually use as their sole device for holding the audience in. While the film does have some good twists and turns, the heart of the film is the core that sees Roy bonding with Angela. If anything, this section does almost too well at involving the audience - a problem that created a rather lame ending that smacks of compromise after a test audience viewing. For the majority of the film, the two threads are weaved together very well and it works to make them seem as all one story rather than two separate aspects of the film.Scott plays with out emotions well, ultimately playing a con of sorts on the audience as much as the characters are playing on their marks. The story is slick in several ways, but not just a superficial manner that you'll be used to if you watch other genre thrillers. Likewise, Scott and his casting team have done a great job with the casting of the film. Cage has done too many action blockbusters lately to still be considered a really good actor but he does well here. He is given a difficult role in that he could have almost been a comedy character with his ticks etc, but he delivers them without letting them control the character or become irritating. Rockwell has too little screen time but is very good; he adds lots of little touches that fill out his character well. Lohman would be a great child actress were it not for the fact that she was actually 22 and not 14! She is really good here and she is a big reason why the family threads all work.Overall this is a pretty enjoyable and involving film - albeit not in the way I expected from a film of this genre. Where often the genre suffers from style over substance but here substance is actually more to it than style. The threads all work well together and it engaged me no problem, only a rather pat final scene spoils an enjoyably bleak conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicholas Cage is a fine comic actor, and acted his socks off in this film, but didn't really save it. He plays a con man (he's not a thief: he just persuades people to give him their money). With his partner they make a respectable living from the gullible. However, he suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorders which bring him into contact with a shady psychiatrist. He is separated from his wife but has a 14 year old daughter he's never met. The psychiatrist gets them together, and the girl turns out to be an excellent con artist in her own right. Suffice to say, the three of them carry out a major scam, but cage gets double crossed by his partner and the girl was an accomplice. It all got rather complicated as to who was doing what to whom, but it had a soft ending, with Cage becoming a carpet salesman and marrying a nice girl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MATCHSTICK MEN (2003) **** Nicolas Cage, Sam Rockwell, Alison Lohman, Bruce Altman, Bruce McGill, Sheila Kelley. Excellent adaptation of Eric Garcia's splendid novel about a phobic, walking tic con man (Cage in another of his finely honed, nuanced performances that has Oscar nom written all over it) and his glib partner (Rockwell equally excellent) whose days of scamming as flim-flam artists have nearly reached their nadir when in walks in his long-lost teenage daughter (the amazing Lohman who also should get an Academy nod) to further complicate things. Cage is brilliant as the coming-apart-at-the-seams neurotic mess who finds his life gaining meaning when he inexplicably bonds instantly to his daughter who only wants to be loved and to learn the game of the grift. Sharply, biting and witty screenplay by the brothers Griffin, Ted (who excelled on the 'Ocean's 11' remake, in this the first sibling collaboration) and perfect direction by veteran Ridley Scott underlining the pathos with heart. Funny and full of nice little plot twists. One of the year's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Con Men!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicolas Cage is one of my favorite actors. I don't know how he does it, but he always seems to be in his natural environment, he almost never seems to be acting. Of course not every movie he has made once is a big success (I don't think there is any actor that can say that he only made great movies), but I think I'm not exaggerating if I say that "Matchstick Man" is one of his best until now.It's about Roy Waller and Frank Mercer, a couple of very successful and professional small-time con artists. Their main target: old and lonely people who are easy to manipulate and eager to believe what they are told. Each time they sell one of their 'exclusive', 'outstanding', 'incredible' water filtration systems for 5 to 10 times the actual price, they earn a few hundreds of dollars. Not exactly much, but all together it makes a nice living. But Frank's private life isn't as successful as his business. He's an obsessive-compulsive agoraphobic, who needs a clear routine and a psychoanalyst just to keep him in working order. He doesn't even have time for personal relationships, until he's confronted with the fact that he has a 14-year old daughter who would love to meet him. At first his whole world is turned upside-down, but gradually he develops paternal feelings for the teenage girl that wants nothing more but to follow her dad in his professional footsteps...This movie really has several good things to offer and was a nice surprise. Next to the excellent performances of Nicholas Cage and Sam Rockwell, I was surprised by Alison Lohman's performance. She did an excellent job as the teenage daughter. But not only the acting was more than average, so was the story. It was funny and touching at the same time and really offered everything that I look for in a movie. As I already said earlier in my review: it's one of Cage's best movies. I give it a 7.5/10 at least, although an 8/10 isn't too much for this excellent movie either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More About Character Than The Con</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matchstick Men is a film directed by Ridley Scott.It was based on Eric Garcia's novel Matchstick Men: A Novel about Grifters with Issues with the screenplay written by Ted Griffin and Nicholas Griffin.It stars Nicolas Cage, Sam Rockwell, and Alison Lohman.Matchstick Men is about neurotic con man Roy,who suffers from several emotional problems, including obsessive-compulsive disorder. He and his partner Frank swindle people out of money by posing as money collectors who promise things like tax refunds, package vacations, and other fabulous prizes that they never get. Frank wants to pull a really big job, but Roy is too consumed with fear and panic attacks to join him. Only cigarettes and his trusty illegal prescription drugs seem to keep him going. When Roy finds himself in desperate need of more pills, he is forced to see legitimate psychotherapist Dr. Klein. Roy ends up talking about his emotional damage from a troubled marriage and divorce, which results in the discovery of a child whom he has never met. Dr. Klein suggests that he spend a weekend with the kid, so in walks teen-aged Angela. Reluctant to develop his role as a father, Roy also gets heavily involved in Frank's ambitious swindle.Matchstick Men is about con artists.But the story is more about the characters involved in the story rather than the con that these characters get involved with.It was a character-driven story that has many interesting subplots and as the film progresses,it gets better and better.It provides an intriguing exploration of dishonesty in its varied forms.Also,it the performance of the cast was great especially with Cage,who is absolutely terrific down to his eye twitches and neck jerks as a phobic con artist.Special mention should also go to the 23- year-old Alison Loman,who played the role of the 14-year-old Angela.The humor was also funny.And most importantly,the story was never predictable and formulaic from beginning to end.Matchstick Men is a brilliant character-study and enjoyable film that will appeal to anyone who loves good movies.It is close to being a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic heist movie with a twist (which, tautologously, makes this a film with a twist with a twist). In fact the script is excellent and Ridley Scott, unfortunately, churns it into something less effective, ably aided and abetted by the comic tourettisms of Nicholas Cage.Sam Rockwell plays Frank as the perfect sidekick to Cage's Roy, eager and with a better grip on the necessary limits of the humour. Alison Lohman is a charming, mercurial daughter to Roy. Throw in Bruce McGill as a mark and you don't want for a top-notch supporting cast.The problem is in the way Ridley Scott wants to tell the story. It's as if he's rather embarrassed about the subject matter - a man discovers himself to be a father and undertakes the role despite the contradiction of his job. However, the nicely played-out main con and the burgeoning love of fatherhood don't blend. They're not helped by some highly capricious film-making, taking its lead from Roy's neuroses. It's a very long first act. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I guess Matchstick Men really was predictable for all you omniscient movie bozos, but then again that's easy to say AFTER you've watched it. "Well, it could have been an absolutely luvvvly movie, but I saw it coming for two hours, so it was utter rubbish." Get out of here. And even if you do saw the ending coming, does it make it a lesser film? Think about that. Endings never work for me anyway, the whole movie does. Matchstick Men was brilliant. Normally I like Ridley Scott's work for his directing, but this time around it was the acting. Cage was superb, and Lohmann equally good as the Lolita. Yes, Lolita. I was honestly happy to find out that she wasn't really fourteen years old when they shot it, because otherwise I'd be one hell of a paedophiliac. And I didn't saw the ending coming. You know why? Because I can't be bothered with foreseeing the ending. I get bothered with what's going on on the screen. I've got no time left for figuring out whatsoever is going to happen. I don't feel like impressing my friends by knowing it all along. So judge a movie by its own aesthetic quality instead of your personal 'foreknowledge' or whatever insight in movies you think you've got. It's an excellent movie which probably none of us could have made the same way themselves. You know it.</fullReview>

It's a fun ride up until that point, but if you stop and think about the twist, you should realize it is laughably far-fetched.The plot is so conveniently manipulated and contrived that it is nearly putrid. Any one of a hundred tiny changes in most of Roy's actions and decisions would have thrown off the entire plot and made the twist impossible. I can't even think of a satisfactory analogy for the absurdity here. Maybe if you made a two hour movie about someone going around asking random people on the street for hundred-dollar bills and EVERY SINGLE PERSON for two hours said yes and handed over a hundred-dollar bill they just happened to have. That's probably about as likely as the events of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much Cage not enough Rockwell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few films that interact with the audience the way that Ridley Scott's Matchstick Men does. It opens as a film about con men, turns into a film about family men, and ends one-hundred and eighty degrees from where it began. Along the way Scott plays the audience in his own kind of con, and he pulls it off pretty well.Nicolas Cage plays Roy an obsessive compulsive grifter, who at the urging of his partner Frank, played by Sam Rockwell, visits a shrink who directs him to the now teenage daughter he left with his ex-wife. Roy meets his daughter Angela, played by Alison Lohman, and begins to strike up an almost normal father daughter relationship with his wayward teen. While this is happening Roy and Frank are involved in a con against a rich business man. That is all that can be said about the story without giving anything away.The driving force behind Matchstick Men is Nicolas Cage and his wacky acting. At times he is over the top, but for the most part he turns in a good performance. Unfortunately for Cage the supporting acting is good enough to make him look like he is trying to hard. Were Matchstick Men fails isn't in the story, which is confusing but for a reason and works in self out in the end, but in its failure to utilize the talents of Sam Rockwell. Rockwell is brilliant, but he isn't on screen enough to make people take notice. If Ridley Scott were to remake this film, he could greatly improve on it by adding more scenes with Sam Rockwell. Overall Matchstick Men succeeds and frustrates at the same time.</fullReview>

Surprisingly brilliant performance from Alison Lohman who plays 'Angela'. The chemistry between Cage and Lohman are just enough to get you involved in the whole scenario of the film. A similarly good performance from Sam Rockwell as well. 'Matchstick men' will surely draw you to its situations, the moods and mostly its characters.

		<shortDescription>Fine effort wrecked by clichéd violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another example of tremendous effort put into a film whose screenplay exhibits that most common of early 21st century screenplay weaknesses, the inability to resist the temptation to substitute violent plot turns for real character development. All of the actors here turn in fine performances (and that's saying something, because I'm not generally a Cage fan). Some of the whimsy is a shade over the top, (the scene of the cowboy-hat-wearing sidekick casing the lobby of a high-rise office building, for instance), but overall the first part of the movie works. But the whimsical tone of the movie is shattered with a gruesome, unexpected, and disturbingly realistic moment of violence, complete with a look of shock and horror on the victim's face, plenty of blood, a death rattle, and limb-twitching. I guess I can only sigh and conclude that I'm the only moviegoer left on the planet who does not appreciate movies that feel they have to rip my nerves raw with a graphic murder to get a reaction from me. Let's not build dramatic tension slowly, and break through to a genuine climax; let's just pull out a gun and blow a hole through somebody to jump-start the plot. That shows how edgy we are. That shows how bold we are. That shows how lazy, and more important, clichéd we are.I can't say a lot about how the movie progressed after the bloodletting because I soon got up and walked out. But I saw enough to say that the violent plot twist had its usual effect: Suddenly the characters are no longer believable. The sweet, sheltered 14-year-old daughter is far more concerned with the fact that her new-found daddy no longer wants to see her, than by the murder. That doesn't make sense. Oh, I suppose the writers could pawn it off by saying, "EXACTLY! Moment of violence, and suddenly, NOTHING MAKES SENSE! Get it?" Well then, why not just cut to a shot of her giving her inaugural address after being elected the first 14-year-old female president? Or maybe piloting an F-16, single-handedly destroying a fleet of alien invaders? Or leaping through the air in slo-mo, ala Antonio Banderas, shooting two guns in opposite directions?Because, at bottom, this movie's resorts to clichés every bit as thin and worn as "Independence Day" or "Once Upon a Time in Mexico". Yet it was clearly aiming at something far higher. Hence my disappointment.</fullReview>

Turns out the doctors, physhciatyrst, partner, and girl are all conning Cage. They steal all of the money he saved. Plus, the girl isn't his kid!!! He doesn't have a kid!! If you (like me) get taken in by this film and forget to realize that there has to be some twist, you may not be able to get over the stupidity of the whole idea.

Not that I mind- his continual devotion to sacrificing any semblance of story for attention grabbing histrionics have often livened up even the most banal money gigs (see any of his 'sunshine trilogy'), but this time he practically mops up the screen with his poor talented co-stars.And talented they are- Sam Rockwell and Allison Lohman struggle valiantly to keep concentrated and focused on the STORY, which is slim at best. A con man who reunites with his daughter (really conveniently, with the help of his shrink, played by a great actor) and then they go on a con.I enjoyed it at moments, but the last half got really long and plot driven. The con didn't make much sense, and- as always- Cages ham fisted approach and "look at me, ma, I'm acting!" wore as thin as his hair.Overall I'd give this one a 4. Good for a rainy day but best seen with a pause and fast-forward button handy.</fullReview>

The plot went from boring to predictible, then to basic pedantic BS.Cage's twitches were utterly annoying, and his occasional "duuuuuh"s were laughable.I don't understand how something this bad can be called a movie.</fullReview>
