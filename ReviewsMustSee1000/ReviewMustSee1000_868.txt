		<fullReview>I probably watch this film every two years, yet like fine wine, it grows even better after time. This picture is a beautiful, thought provoking, and highly effective meditation on how love, death, god, joy, and pain all coexist in the strange universe that is life. With subject matter as complex as this, the viewer can see where one could easily become lost in C.S. Lewis's story, but "Shadowlands" never falters. The film remains quiet, simple, and highly effective through Attenborough's understated direction, and its cast's uniformly excellent performances. However, what sits at the very core of "Shadowlands" beauty is its ultimate truth. There are moments in this film so full of genuine, unflynching emotion that its power practically hits the audience member in the gut. Yes, the film's magnificently depicted scenes of death and grieving never fail to jerk tears from my eyes, but Lewis's closing lines regarding the choices he made as a boy and a man make me sob. "Shadowlands" is undoubtedly representative of filmaking at its very best. I recommend this film without reservation to anyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, based on the love story of C.S. Lewis, noted author, scholar and religious apologist, and Joy Gresham, American poet, is so very haunting and beautiful. Those familiar with Lewis will know the tragic outcome of this love story for the ages and will appreciate the realistic adaptation to the screen. Sir Richard Attenborough could have been tempted to cast glamorous actors in the leads but instead he chose Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger whose characterizations more closely resembled the true life couple. Hopkins, who should have been nominated for the Academy Award for this role, plays Lewis to a T.....rumpled, vague and totally naive in the ways of the world and certainly where love is concerned. Winger, looking frumpy, is appropriately brash and out of place in the world of Oxford academia. She approaches Hopkins' character with a refreshing honesty that is sometimes hurtful but always straight to the heart of the matter. In the end, it helps him to cope. She captures his soul and therein begins the short but wonderful love story that forever changes their lives. The intensity of their relationship and the inevitable ending will make you weep and a box of Kleenex is recommended. Heavy breathing and graphic loves scenes are not what this is about.....it's about love that transcends the physical and it will steal your heart away. You will weep and rejoice at this film....see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Shadowlands does, it does very well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people seeing this film who are familiar with CS Lewis' writings will be tempted to be disappointed.They should not be. In defense of this film and the method used to get the results, I have two things to say.The first, and by far the most important, is that spiritual films are very difficult to make -- especially if one is speaking about something above one's head. That's why the life of Jesus is such a difficult subject and has met with so little success, at least from an artistic point of view.Even Mel Gibson's Passion suffers from this to some extent. I would say his representation of the Passion reflect more of our times and what we consider to be important than on the ministry of Jesus. I may be wrong; I am not a believer so my opinion may not matter. But what is true is that no matter what your belief, spiritual man (Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha and others) are very hard to make biographies of. In my opinion what they represented survived not because we have understanding, but because our instincts tell us they are what we should be. It is not a mind thing at all. AND FILMS REQUIRE OUR MINDS, at least to make them. It would take a soul equal to that of Christ to make a film about Christ.To a far lesser extent, that is true of CS Lewis. His was a very complex theology dressed in wonderful parables. He had a great understanding of the parables and used the same technique. It does little good to discuss his theology in a film that is about 2 hours long. In fact, the viewer is sort of expected to know something about his writings and theology.Which brings me to my second point. Perhaps it is because I am over 60 and not been brought up on Romances that I find this one so appealing. Here was a man that had lived his entire life one way, mostly in his mind, when he was confronted with feelings that demanded he reinterpret everything he believed. How many of us at his age could do what CS Lewis did?Here was a man that thought one way and was forced to live another. What the mind is a very poor substitute for what our emotions understand. CS Lewis was very quick, I think, to recognize this and embraced it completely once he found it out.Douglas Davidman Gresham (Joy Gresham's son), has said that the film is perhaps not completely factually correct, but the emotion representation is "spot on".For me, no truer words could be spoken. What does it matter what details are missing, or changed because we have only 2 hours to tell a story? What matters is that we see the humanity of the man and his wonderful ability to embrace openly his new found emotions are what matters. And to put this into his spiritual structure was even more remarkable.It's a good film. Enjoy it and pay attention. It requires an open heart and an open mind. Give it both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Extremely Touching Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>C. S. Lewis is making a bit of a comeback with the "Chronicles Of Narnia" movie of late, but here's a film portrait of him made in 1993 starring the great British actor Anthony Hopkins.To Christians, Lewis has always been a familiar name: one of the greatest and most well-known Christian apologists theologians ("Merre Christianity," "The Screwtape Letters,"etc.) and fiction (the Narnia series) writers of all time. But this film - no surprise - doesn't really deal with that: it's mainly a love story, the love he had toward his American wife, played by Debra Winger.Being a Brit, the film takes place in England and features some wonderful landscapes of that great country. Hopkins exudes warmth in the role of Lewis and Winger is okay, New York City accent and all, as the American. I would have chosen someone else for the role, but Winger gets by. Not to be forgotten is the fine job Edward Hardwicke did as "Warnie," Lewis' brother. Joseph Mazzello, one of the top child actors of the early '90s, is the Lewis' young boy. When father and son cry together at the end, it is one of the most touching scenes I've ever viewed on film.It's a touching story, period, and if it doesn't get your eyes moistened at least once, check your pulse. The dialog in here is excellent, too. I particularly enjoyed the by-play of dry wit between the professors and Winger's various comments to her husband.Nice films like this are unusual and should be treasured, as Lewis and his works are by so many people, Christian or non-Christian.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Get a box of Kleenex, and be prepared to go through the whole box when you sit down to watch this movie. Shadowlands is one of the most moving films ever to be made - an affecting tale of love, loss, and the price of safety.Shadowlands is the story of C. S. Lewis (Anthony Hopkins), and his relationship with American Joy Gresham (Debra Winger). When the movie starts, we find Lewis, known as Jack to his associates, teaching at Oxford, writing, lecturing, and living as a bachelor on the family farm with his bachelor brother Warnie (Edward Hardwicke). It's a comfortable, if somewhat empty existence. Jack receives a letter from an American woman asking if she can meet him. They agree to have tea, and strike up a friendship, as Jack is impressed with the brash, yet very intelligent Joy. She tells him that her son loves his Narnia chronicles and asks if the boy can meet him. Jack agrees, and Joy brings her son, Douglas (Joseph Mazello) to Jack's home. Jack and Joy maintain a correspondence, and at Christmas, Joy writes that she is coming to England for the holidays, and would like to visit. Jack invites her to stay at his home. While there, Joy tells Jack that her marriage is ending. Several months later, Jack runs into Joy after a lecture he has given. She tells him that she has moved to England, and invites him to her house for dinner. While he's there, she asks him to marry her so she can stay in the country. He agrees, and they have a platonic marriage until Joy becomes gravely ill, forcing Jack to reevaluate his feelings for her and the state of their marriage.Visually, this is a beautiful film, set mostly in the lovely English countryside. The period is well depicted, and you feel that you have stepped back slightly in time. And the wardrobe in Jack's attic is a particularly good touch.The script is brilliant. Emotional issues are handled with great intelligence, and comic touches help to lighten what is sometimes a very dark story. Jack's emotional fragility is presented in such a way that the viewer discovers it with him at about the time he realizes that this aspect of his personality must change. Joy's brashness balances very well with her emotional intelligence, and she gets the best lines in the film, both comic (her response to the baiting of one of Jack's colleagues "Are you trying to be offensive, or merely stupid?"), and poignant ("The pain then is part of the happiness now," as she tries to prepare Jack for her imminent death). Her scenes with Jack are lovely, and the growth in the course of their relationship is beautifully depicted. Warnie is also a nicely developed character, a loyal and caring brother who takes on the responsibility of caring for Joy's son with warmth and kindness. Nothing is wasted, as every scene helps to propel the story forward to its conclusion.The acting is excellent. Hopkins' portrayal of Jack is sensitive without being weak. Winger hits all the right notes in her portrayal of Joy, brash and bold, yet with a better understanding of emotion than the more sensitive Jack. Edward Hardwicke does a nice job with Warnie, giving us a performance that makes us wish we knew more about him. And Joseph Mazello gives a great performance as Douglas, a little boy who finds himself orphaned in a strange land with few people to turn to. The scene where Douglas and Jack finally comfort each other over their common loss is among the most touching in the movie.A movie that stays with you long after it ends, and makes you long to sit through it again and again. Just make sure you have those Kleenex handy...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Attenborough's best directorial effort.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is Richard Attenborough's best directed film. Unlike Gandhi, it had no ambitions of being a grand scale historical epic. It actually played to Attenborough's strengths as a director, which are story and character development. Of course some fantastic performances from some great actors helped him out immensely. Debra Winger was nominated for an Oscar, and she was great, but we already saw her play the same disease in Terms of Endearment. Anthony Hopkins should have received an Oscar nomination for his incredible multi-layered turn as C. S. Lewis. His lifelong bachelor that falls in love and then questions his own theological beliefs when he grieves is the polar opposite of his most famous role, Hannibal Lechter, and yet he is just as convincing. With Hopkins in the lead, and Attenborough's attention to detail, this movie is one of the most overlooked films on every top 100 list, or in the case of this site, top 250 list. If you like movies that have stories, characters, and atmosphere, this is for you. 8 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lewis' step-son says the portrayal of emotion is perfect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years ago, I had the pleasure to correspond with Douglas Gresham. (FYI, Douglas is Joy's son -- thus C.S. Lewis step-son -- played by Joseph Mazzello in this film.) I had recently seen Shadowlands, and so I asked Douglas how "true to life" the picture was. He told me that some details (dates, places) had been changed slightly for obvious dramatic/story-telling reasons, but that the "spirit" and "feeling" of all the emotions portrayed in the movie were perfectly accurate. That's exactly what it all felt like, he said.I own the movie (and the soundtrack), and have seen it a dozen times... and I still get teary-eyed at the scene where Douglas and Jack cry in each other's arms... this movie rates a perfect 10 from me; I can't find any fault with it at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Shadowlands was definitely my cup of tea. But before I get into that I will give you a brief overview of this true story. This movie was directed by Richard Attenborough and it was based on the original stage play by William Nicholson. It featured Anthony Hopkins who plays C.S. Lewis, the famous author of the Narnia books. He is a teacher and writer who resides in England with his brother. He also spends his time giving lectures, and eventually gains quite a following. A divorced American woman named Joy Gresham, played by Debra Winger, writes him an admiring letter and soon after they begin a correspondence. After a while she comes to visit with her son. She eventually moves there, the two become romantically entangled and ultimately the unlikely couple falls in love. Neither of them was looking for it. He is used to his life as a bachelor and she is concerned with the well being of her son. After time progresses Lewis finally discovers he can't imagine his life without her in it. When all seems to be going well Joy contracts cancer. Lewis is there for her through all of her pain, and they must together face the fact that they soon must part. The story of their love was refreshing. It was not based on physical desire, but for their mind, sole, and heart. At the beginning it seemed as though Lewis did not have the ability to love another human being other than himself. Yet, when he finally does find the courage to love it is a more exciting adventure than any of his books. Gresham too is not prepared for love, but found it with Lewis beginning as early as their initial writings. And when all is going well, their love is tested. I truly believe this couple did share true and eternal love. What this movie lacked in action and adventure it possessed in depth. It was unlike the usual movie love story. The range of emotions felt by the characters can almost be felt while watching the movie. I recommend it to anyone who has loved or suffered a great loss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect movie for the educated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film as I'm a sucker for weepies. I didn't know that it was about CS Lewis, a little naive, you may say, but I just saw that it had a good rating in the TV guide and so I set the video to record it. I have told my family that I will kill them if they ever record over this film! It is beautiful. No background knowledge of the life of CS Lewis is needed- just sit back and enjoy. Some people may criticise such things as Debra Winger's accent and the fact that Douglas (Joseph Mazzello) should have had a brother in the film, but ignore them and let yourself be submerged in the sheer excellence of the film. The best line, for me, is when Hopkins, as Lewis, is teaching his class and tells them that "The most intense joy lies not in the having, but in the desire. The delight that never fades, the bliss that is eternal, is only yours when what you most desire is just out of reach". It will leave you crying yet contented. Watch this film, but do so with a box of tissues. If you leave the room to get something, you will without fail miss something. Not a moment of this movie must be missed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lovely, deep film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Debra Winger was a great candidate for the part of CS Lewis' wife, and there is no other better Lewis than Mr. Anthony Hopkins. A sad, slow, painfully sincere story tells about the love of these two people, their short and passing happiness and her tragic death. But what a brilliant film! The elegiac nature adds to the pure British feel of the movie, while the secondary roles are also so refreshingly endearing and truly masterful. I agree, that's a pity that there is no JRR Tolkien in the film, but even then this is a worthy work. It gives a sense of something dear, fragile and very brisk, like their love in the film is. It leaves with a heavy heart and you only wonder how could a man who had such a tragic life write such great books as he did. A marvelous film and a great praise goes to all the film crew.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shadowlands is directed by Richard Attenborough, based on the life of CS Lewis, has a screenplay by William Nicholson, music by George Fenton and stars Anthony Hopkins, Debra Winger, Joseph Mazzello, Edward Hardwicke and John Wood.CS Lewis (Sir Anthony Hopkins )author of the Narnia stories is a bachelor and teaches at Oxford university and lives a quiet life with his elder brother Warnie(Edward Hardwicke). Into his ordered world comes American fan Joy Gresham(Debra Winger) and her young son Douglas (Joseph Mazzello). Lewis and Joy fall in love and marry but he doesn't show his true feelings until she is diagnosed with cancer and from then on emotions run free and you see how tragic love can be just when every thing is fine something terrible happens. Hopkins gives one of his best performances as a man who is very reserved and shy. Lewis is afraid to let himself experience too much happiness after Joy falls ill because he doesn't want to have to go through great pain if she dies. He comes to learn that the pain later is part of the happiness now, knowing what they both face makes their time together all the more special and meaningful. Hopkins has your attention in every scene he's in and he does such a good job of showing Lewis trying to control his grief and desperation at Joy's illness and struggling to contain those emotions. Winger makes Joy passionate and full of life, she does a good job of showing Joy's determination not to be overcome by her cancer. The scenes between her and Hopkins are tender and moving. Hardwicke provides fine support as the kind Warnie.A moving and unforgettable film about love and loss. This is one of Attenborough's best films but sadly seems to get overlooked in comparison with some of his others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard of this film I thought it would be too near 'The Remains of the Day', made in the same year and along the same lines. A repressed English man in repressed England (which it is, I should know!), but I couldn't have been more wrong. There are similarities in his character but it doesn't matter because this film is amazing. Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger are brilliant. Winger as the brash American who falls in love with CS Lewis and he with her. It's such a heart wrenching film, you'll be groaning by the end of it. It hits you in all the right places due to Richard Attenborough's brilliant directing and the acting of the two stars. Watch out for Hopkins at the end sat with Winger's son after her death. I challenge anybody not to feel moved as he breaks down in tears. Or as he sits at her death bed. I don't know how he does it but you are so convinced that he is hurting, as we know he is.My favourtie all time quote comes from this film and I think it defines the film so well. A vicar speaks to CS Lewis after his wife's death and tells him God is the creator and we can't do anything to change his decisions. And Lewis's reply is: "No, we're the creatures aren't we? We're the rats in the cosmic laboratory. I've no doubt the experiment is for our own good but, uh, still makes God the vivisectionist doesn't it?" Think about it. I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little too folded in on itself but still very worthy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Lewis is a teacher at Oxford University as well as being an author of children's books. He is a reserved man who lives a quiet, insular life; a life that is disturbed when an American fan, Joy Gresham, arrives to meet him for tea. Over years the pairs' friendship and care for one another grows in the face of life's obstacles.Hopkins will always be known for his more worthy roles that, in my mind, seemed to revolve around restricted relationships where he suppresses his feelings. This is one such film and, while not the equal of the emotionally similar Remains of the Day, it is still a worthy story that is strikingly well told. The film tells the supposedly true story of CS Lewis' love and marriage with Joy in a slow manner that only lets out the feeling as slowly and as shielded as Lewis himself. I don't know how accurate the tale is as all I know of Lewis is his work. However, the gradual flow of emotion both works for and against the film. It works against the film in that the drama seems rather stilted and folded in on itself. But the upside of this is that, when the film (and Lewis) starts to feel, it is like a rush of relief after so much in the way of holding back and unrealised emotion.Of course for many, the patience required will be too much when compared to the emotional pay off, and that is a fair point, as this film is not the most moving one I have ever seen. However what helps make it is a tremendous performance by Hopkins. Recently I have seen him slumming in several films and it is difficult to watch those knowing what he can do. Here he holds back but allows us to see that he is holding back - that's very different from just not showing emotion (hell, even Steven Segal can do that!). Winger is good albeit in a less obvious way. Her role require more forwardness and emotion on her sleeve - at times her character seems easy (indeed it is not as interesting as Lewis) but she still does well. The support cast all do as well, there are no weak links, not even Mazzello - so awful in Jurassic Park yet so reliable here.Overall this is a `worthy' film, meaning that it is not perfect but it is still worth seeing. The emotion is all rather turned in on itself and it loses some impact for that reason but the story is still involving and the performances are good. Hopkin's central role is key to the film and he delivers with every bit of the class and ability that we have come (until recently) to expect from him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Romanticized true account of British writer C.S. Lewis and his timid, awkward friendship and eventual marriage to American poet Joy Gresham, a feisty divorcée with a young son. After a flat, numbing first-half, "Shadowlands" gets a bit pacier, becoming a moving (if rather saintly) look at old-fashioned feelings and true love. Anthony Hopkins, playing Lewis, doesn't seem quite into this role (his performance consists mainly of faraway glances and noble little smiles), but Debra Winger comes through with a strong characterization. Overall, the film is just so-so, beautifully filmed and obviously made with care, but missing that hearty ingredient which might've made it a romantic classic. Factual story was first produced for British television in 1985 and starred Joss Ackland and Claire Bloom; writer William Nicholson penned both versions, as well as a play under the same title. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Shadowlands" is possibly the most emotionally resonant, evocative film made in the 1990s, and it is amazing that this motion picture has not been available on region 1 DVD for many years.Anthony Hopkins plays the Oxford don well, though his Welsh-accented English would have been more accurate had it an Irish tinge instead. Debra Winger is an appealing choice for Joy Gresham, but her Brooklyn accent comes and goes, sometimes within a single scene. She could have used a language coach.Though much attention is paid to period detail (1952), it is jarring to see some post-Beatles moptops on several of Lewis' Oxford colleagues (Christopher Riley, marvellously played by John Wood, for one) and their scenes spoil the illusion somewhat.The film ends with a crisis of faith for C. S. Lewis after the death of his beloved Joy, which doubtless resonated with many viewers who have no particular convictions, but in truth Lewis' faith in Jesus Christ was renewed yet again.Lord Richard Attenborough did a fine job of direction, as did George Fenton with the film's score, and William Nicholson who adapted his own stage play. The resulting movie, whether intentional or not, shares some of the same ambiance as "Love Letters" and "Brief Encounter" (both filmed in 1945).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So truly beautiful and quaint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very strange film, a most extraordinary film. C.S. Lewis and his brother are two unmarried professors in Oxford, living together in the same house. They are living in this haven of peace that Oxford is, entirely dedicated to learning and knowledge, to the maturation of men in the teenagers they get every year, year in and year out. It is their function, their aim, their target and they cannot be derailed from this perspective. Oxford is their own territory and their own world and the world has no limits within these limits of Oxford, and an eventual trip to London for a lecture, but never beyond. C.S. Lewis is a special case in that entirely ghettoized intellectual world. He writes stories for children, for the children he will never have. These stories are about a strange world beyond the bottom of a wardrobe in the attic of his home. A world of bad and evil, of fighting for good and against evil. And yet his life is a routine that would kill thinking out of any human being. But not him, and plenty others around him. They are righteously living in the comfort of academia. The top echelon of that academia. Till one day when an American woman and her young child comes up and asks for an autograph. And the ghetto implodes. The peace is gone, love takes its place. The diplomatic marriage will eventually give way to a real marriage, but on a sick bed in a hospital. She finds out, too late of course, she has bone cancer and will eventually and soon die. And that's how C.S. Lewis discovers there is another love he had never really thought of and certainly not experienced: love for another human being that becomes your horizon and for whom you are dawn and dusk at the same time. That love that makes you mute and talkative in the same minute, so much the one and so much the other that your tongue trips on your muteness and your words get strangled in your talk. Love as a feeling of total gift of yourself to the other and of the other to yourself, with the tremendous responsibility that goes along with it. And death then becomes an unacceptable step away from this reality. Death comes and love will never go away and will turn into suffering, longing, wanting, needing and never getting the satisfaction you could ever wish to get. Love is for life I was going to say, oh yes, love is for life and even beyond life, for death if it comes and when it comes. Love never turns into ashes and never goes back to dirt because it is not dirt, it is the soul of the heart and the mind of life. And that's what C.S. Lewis actually discovers late in his life and never forgot after that. He finally learned how to be a fully blooming man, but it hurts so much when you learn love from within the death of your beloved. I must say the slow rhythm of the film, the very intimates scenes, the delicacy of the language and the acting, and the art of Anthony Hopkins serve that theme so well, so beautifully. It seems to be able to last for ever and ever, and yet the young son, now step-son, is there to remind you the show of life goes on for ever and ever on the stage of the strutting human beings we are.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is just extraordinary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will say that when I saw the rating of 7.4, someone will say that is a fairly decent rating. I personally think for this masterpiece, the rating should be higher, honestly the quality of the acting and cinematography makes it worthy to be in the top 250. I honestly did think that this film is just extraordinary, beautifully shot with wonderful locations, and matched perfectly by one of the most gorgeous music scores I have ever heard in my life, composed by George Fenton that never interfered with the calmness of the film. Richard Attenborough has directed many ambitious but beautifully made films like Oh!What a Lovely War, Cry Freedom and Chaplin, and I will say that Shadowlands deserves to be up there with his best, it is a heart-rending film of true love and the consequences that left me speechless(I am 17), that I don't think has had enough praise. The performances were just outstanding. Anthony Hopkins was phenomenal as CS Lewis, and I am glad he got some awards for his performance, honestly it was that good. Debra Winger is just perfection as Joy Gresham, a victim of the devastating illness bone cancer. The two leads' chemistry is the main reason why I love this movie, I confess I cried when Lewis held the dying Joy in his arms, the reason being it reminded me of Mimi's Death Scene in La Boheme. The child star, Joseph Mazello was a huge surprise as Douglas, a boy of wide imagination and deep feeling. The scene where he and Lewis are crying in each other's arms made my eyes well up with emotion, never until yesterday did I see Hopkins look so tender with anybody on screen, not even in The Elephant Man. As Warnie, Edward Hardwicke best known for his appearances as Dr Watson in the 80s-90s Sherlock Holmes series was remarkable, a minor character but one with feeling and understanding. The actors are helped by a poignant and well-written script, that at times does give clever nods to Lewis's literary genius. It is no wonder that Shadowlands got an award for best British film of the year, it is just beautiful. It is more steady paced than the Elephant Man, another film I am really fond of,and less involving in terms of action, but neither of these things are disadvantages, because i cannot deny what joy I felt watching this film. 10/10 Bethany Cox.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does he hear you?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can only think of one movie that does as good a job of dealing with a child's loss: "Careful, He Might Hear You", directed by Carl Schultz. Both are so masterfully executed they don't deserve to be compared. "Shadowlands" is everything the other IMDb reviewers have so eloquently said. I just wanted to add a few comments regarding the look/design of the film. Ugliness is very cool right now, in commercials and and in our movies. I expect the studios to do away with posters and start promoting their new releases with spray paint on underpasses. "Shadowlands" is a period piece in more ways than one. Not only in terms of the story, but in how it's made. The clothing, the sets, the lighting, the pacing, the music...pitch-perfect. That's all. Not cool. There's even prayer. But with the powerful notion that he may not be listening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this the saddest film ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film in the cinema in England. Normally, as soon as the first end credit rolls, the audience are on their feet, seats flip up and basically there's a rugby scrum to get out. With this film, not a soul moved as the credits began. They continued, and still no-one moved. And eventually, when the last credit disappeared and the screen went black, everyone was still in their seats. When, at length, everyone did start to leave, I was passing people sobbing and clinging on to one another in the foyer.Since then I have seen the film a number of times on TV or DVD. One scene never fails to move me to tears - the one near the end in which we see stepfather and stepson sitting the attic in front of The Wardrobe. I am not usually affected by films in this way, I am a bloke aged forty-something and not prone to displays of emotion. However if you can watch that scene and keep down the lump in your throat, especially if you have a son, then I'm worried about you.What also impresses me about this film is the way the screenplay is so 'closed' - by which I mean there are no loose ends, and everything relates to something else in a sub plot somewhere.And finally a word about George Fenton's marvellously restrained score - just enough to underline the story, gentle, touching and poignant, and somehow helping to prevent the tragedy from becoming over sentimental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film would not normally be the kind I would choose to see. However, it is the only movie to make me cry as an adult. This is despite the fact that the subject matter seems far less important than, say, "Schindler's List". Perhaps though it is as important because it operates at a human level that is easier for most of us to relate to. Although I was familiar with C. S. Lewis, I had not previously known enough about him to be aware of his love for Joy Gresham and the outcome of their relationship. That perhaps made it all the more powerful. Perfect acting and a story that is simple, yet so moving. Less is most certainly more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took me four tries in a span of 12 years to make it through the entirety of this movie. The first time I watched it, I only made it through the first 20 minutes before I was bored out of my mind and abandoned it. I was too young to appreciate it. The second time I was either in my late teens or early twenties and, again, only made it through the first quarter before giving up. The third time was 3 years ago and following a horrible break-up, so an emotional love story was just not going to cut it. I made it half way through that time before giving up. Finally today, 12 years later, I watched the entire movie and loved it immensely! Although I cried so hard toward the end I believe my neighbor could hear me. I am a devoted fan of C.S. Lewis and his writings and this movie made him more real and more personal. Anthony Hopkin's performance was absolutely stunning. I was less thrilled with Debra Winger as Joy (although I do normally enjoy her as an actress). I think this movie means so much more to those who are familiar with Lewis and his work. Those who are unfamiliar will appreciate this movie as a love story and spiritual/ personal growth of a celebrated intellectual. I never thought I'd finish this movie, much less like it, but I now consider it one of my favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shadowlands illustrates the man behind Narnia (spoiler).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of us have read C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia, or at least, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe as children. Maybe we have never given thought to the author who created such a magical land. To those who have read these books as children, may have never known that Lewis was far more than just a children's author, and in fact this was secondary to his work of writing for adults. One wonders when reading his works for adults, such as The Four Loves, what the man in real life was truly like. The movie Shadowlands shows us a small part of this life. The movie begins near what most would deem was the end of Lewis' life: he was past middle age, had experienced both world wars, and yet, had never been in love. Ironic that a man who had never been in love, or had a family of his own could write such memorable stories such as Narnia. Shadowlands takes us to the point in Lewis' life where he finally does find love.Although, he is far from embracing when it knocks him on the head. Lewis is a classic example of someone who knows how to explain how to do something (love) and yet, does not know exactly how to do it. When Joy walks into his life, it takes her sickness to make him realize how he truly feels for her.Anthony Hopkins is amazing in the role of Lewis and adequately portrays a man who doesn't know how to love and is crushed when he learns that after loving he will lose the woman he loves. 'We love to know we're not alone,' says Lewis in a part of the movie, and Hopkins shows how Lewis is able to be alone, and at the same time not be alone, when Joy Gresham comes into his life. Debra Winger's role as Joy is well portrayed: we see a stubborn independent woman who is in love with Lewis the author, and later, Lewis the man. She is strong even in sickness and shows Lewis how to love and how to express his love.This is a dramatic movie that moves the heart and gives insight to an author who imagined a world full of magic for the minds of children and illustrates how he truly lived and loved during his lifetime. It is a movie that is worth seeing for anyone who would like to know just a little more about the man who created Narnia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-Done Love Story; NOT A Lewis Biography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I well remember discussing this film with a friend who utterly hated it and left before the ending, whereas I was enthralled, returned to see it on big-screen again and promptly bought the VHS when it was released. The key, I believe, is expectations. I knew little of what to expect and was quite happy with this love story about Lewis and his wife. My friend, however, expected a strong focus on Lewis' Christian faith, which was predictably absent from the Hollywood version. The photography is excellent, the music delightful and the acting superb. Some might believe it a bit over-sentimental, but this was one of the film's charms for me. There isn't much food for the intellect here, but a lot of nourishment for the heart. Yes, I was a bit disappointed that there was so little of Lewis' grief and shaken faith, and I'd certainly have preferred that they'd have touched on some of Lewis' many books beyond the Narnia series, but on balance this is a well-done film about a limited portion of this great man's life. It is a remarkably clean film, appropriate for all audiences save perhaps children younger than 10 or so. Shadowlands easily makes my personal "20 favorite films" list.</fullReview>

And indeed he was present in all the pub-scenes in the 'Eagle and Child'. (or 'Bird and Baby' as it is also known)Surprisingly I was caught by the movie apart from that fact and went to see it twice when it was in the theatre, and surprised I couldn't get a copy on VHS or DVD afterwards. For years I was hunting for it and today I finally found a unique copy in my local videostore of all places and bought it straightaway.A beautiful movie about a man who finds love late in life.The key scene near the end between Anthony Hopkins and Joseph Mazzello (who interestingly also starred alongside Richard Attenborough in Jurrassic Park that same year) still brings me to tears.</fullReview>

Lewis, portrayed Lewis' grief so well that you hurt right along with him. Debra Winger was great as Joy, just like all I've ever read about Joy Gresham, and looked perfect for the part. Visually the film is gorgeous, from Douglas playing in the snow to the very end of the film where C.S. Lewis walks away, and the music is excellent. The part where Douglas tries to enter Narnia from the wardrobe in Lewis' attic is heartbreaking. As a long time fan of nearly all Lewis' works, I could not be more pleased and moved by the film. Watch it and then read A Grief Observed, C.S. Lewis' diary after Joy's death. But watch it, it's magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up on the books of C.S. Lewis. The fantasy land of Narnia was as real to me as any other foreign country I'd never visited. So I went into this movie knowing the main character to a degree. As Anthony Hopkins as C.S. Lewis says himself in the film: `We read to know we are not alone.'As the movie opens Lewis is alone. He's a comfortably single, middle aged and devoutly Christian Oxford Don living a life of quiet academia with his brother. Then Debra Winger as Joy Gresham, a Jewish American single mother comes into his life turning it upside down. They marry and fall in love (In that order.) The story takes a tragic turn but never descends into sentimentality or mawkishness. This is a story about intelligent articulate people dealing with death and loss feelingly, directly and with an emotional depth that is not lessened by their careful appraisal of their own feelings but rather deepened. If tearjerkers repel you with their manipulative abuse of your emotions see this movie that takes the dictum that an unexamined life is not worth living to apply to all aspects of life.Both light, laughter and love and the Shadowlands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies are such great stuff. They often get past the bull and right to the heart of things. So it is with "Shadowlands," a film that can provide emotional healing for those who find it hard to commit to another person because they are afraid of losing them. Anthony Hopkins IS CS Lewis, perfectly cast. And Winger is fine. The whole film is full of lines of power...perhaps the best one is delivered by Winger: "The pain then is part of the joy now. That's the deal." The story is almost secondary to the emotional journey of one man's acceptance of his own fragile, limited humanity. To accept love is to also accept the fact it will eventually leave us (death). "Shadowlands" explores this theme better than any movie in recent memory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Narnia author C.S. Lewis is confronted by a woman who writes him from America, which calls into question the way he has constructed his emotional world. [Acting] Anthony Hopkins is in his polite, intellectual gear, but his warm hearted C.S. "Jack" Lewis pulls through this chapter of his life with perfect, heartbreaking sincerity that closes the distance between his removed British demeanor and the audience. Debra Winger pokes and prods at him like only a quick witted American jewish mother could, but she skillfully softens her character so as not to bruise the movie (and is wonderful, in case you thought I didn't like her performance). [Cinematography] Less is more. The only noticeable "effect" is that, being real life and in rural England in the early fifties, most rooms are dark when walked into or even through, and outdoor scenes at night in the country are left equally murky (probably something to do with the title). [Sound/Score] Choirboys. (But usually only when choirboys are actually present) [1-10] "10". No action, no big bang, just an honest 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The novelist and critic CS Lewis (author of 'The Chronicles of Narnia' and members of the Inklings writing group alongside Tolkien) met poet Joy Gresham late in life and for the first time found himself in love. He was a shy academic and she was a loud, brash American - the old story of 'opposites attract'.William Nicholson's play was first done into a screen version for television in the 1980s, where Lewis was played by Joss Ackland and Gresham by Claire Bloom. I remember that production as having a great deal of power and of defining clear characters for its leads.The 1993 version was a movie directed by Richard Attenborough, and it ranks amongst one of his best. Lewis this time round is played by Anthony Hopkins, and I'd much rather see him in this type of role than in horror/blockbusters. Gresham is played with panache by Debra Winger, an actress who should have been seen on our screens more than she was. Alongside them in the cast are Michael Denison, John Wood, Edward Hardwicke (memorable as Lewis' hard-drinking brother), and Joseph Mazzello as Gresham's young son, Douglas.The play focuses first on the meeting of the two leads, then into their awkward marriage, and into the onset of Joy's fatal illness. All scenes are handled extremely well, with getting sentimental or poking fun at the reticent Lewis. Hopkins in particular is excellent, giving a rounded view of the writer and academic.</fullReview>

The acting is superb, the direction is exquisite, and the cinematography is second to none. But in my mind, the best thing about this film is the MUSIC. The Fenton soundtrack is one of my most prized possessions. Try listening to track #21 with headphones on. It's a masterpiece.The tearful attic scene is a killer - hard to watch without joining in - and I've seen it at least 15 times. This is two great actors at work, artfully carrying a very difficult scene.The end credits are not to be missed. Be sure to watch the beautiful abstract visual sequence BEHIND the credits (while the aforementioned track #21 plays). Awesome.I am glad that I knew little of CS Lewis before seeing this great picture. I feel a little sorry for those that knew much about Lewis, and commented before me. Many of them said they were disappointed in the movie's lack of factual accuracy. However, I wish they could just see this as a statement of art, love, and emotion - not as a detailed chronicle of a time in Lewis' life. It's a great stand-alone movie.Making people I care for watch this movie has become a mission of mine. If you're one of my best friends, you've already seen it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shadowlands portrays Lewis as a naive old bachelor with little experience of life, sheltered if not positively shallow. But you tell me: when he was 10 his mother died; when he was in his late teens he entered the army, endured trench warfare, and was wounded; he saw his best friend killed in battle; honoring a pledge, he moved in with the friend's mother and sister and supported them for many years; he had a sexual relationship with his friend's mother, and although she was an extremely difficult woman he remained with her until her death; and during all these years his much-beloved brother Warnie was a binge drinker who often ended up face down in the gutter. Does this sound like a sheltered life to you? I can't speak for anyone but myself, but this strikes me as a pretty full life - he'd gone through more by the age of 25 than I have at 45. Lewis loved Joy Davidman, and she brought something important to his life. But to say he needed her to become a Real Human Being is condescension of the worst sort, and this aspect of Shadowlands's script is a kind of slander (perhaps a backhanded slap at Lewis's Christianity, which is "obviously" childish and unrealistic?).</fullReview>

One is in the movie Steel Magnolias when Sally Field sits after her daughter has passed away &amp; just silently cries and strokes her hand. Another is at the end of this movie, when a brilliantly played Joseph Mazzello (Douglas) tells Anthony Hopkins (Lewis) that he just wishes he could see her again. Wow! Who hasn't felt that way after losing a loved one? So true to life. This movie is beautifully acted and directed. In essence it's about "carpe diem", seizing the day- regardless of the pain involved.

Married American fan Joy Gresham (Debra Winger) comes to England with her young son Douglas to meet C.S. Lewis. The outspoken woman doesn't fit within the reserved academic atmosphere but Jack likes her spark. She has left her husband who wants a divorce to marry his third. He's also a drunk. They start a relationship.It's a slower moving romance with a bit of comedy. These are two older characters in a mature relationship. It's an effective biopic but not that compelling for me. It could be interesting for C.S. Lewis fans or Richard Attenborough fans. Both Hopkins and Winger are great. I personally find it a bit too slow but still a fine watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful, extremely intelligent and deeply moving film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 1989 stage play which was itself based on the 1985 TV film by William Nicholson, this is an absolutely brilliant film which explores what it means to love someone. The script by Nicholson is beautifully written and there is not a false moment in the entire film. This is my first exposure to his work but he has a fantastic understanding of human nature. I think that the general thrust of C.S. Lewis and Joy Gresham's friendship turned romance is portrayed accurately but the film takes some liberties in depicting her as only having one son as opposed to two and in having their entire relationship play out over the course of a year or so as opposed to eight. The film is wonderfully directed by Richard Attenborough, whose excellent eye for casting is once again in evidence.Anthony Hopkins, making his fifth and final appearance in an Attenborough film, is simply superb as C.S. Lewis, who is depicted at the beginning of the film as being content with his life. He is a successful author, a popular speaker on religious issues and an Oxford don who lives with his beloved elder brother Warnie in a nice little cottage. A lapsed atheist, he is a devout Anglican who argues that "pain is God's megaphone to rouse a deaf world." However, when the American poet Joy Gresham enters his life, she knocks him for six. In real life, Warnie said that Joy was "quite extraordinarily uninhibited" and that is the perfect way to describe her. Debra Winger, whom I had never seen in a film before, is likewise brilliant in the role of Joy. Whereas Lewis is shy and often does not know what to say around her as he has little to no experience with women, Joy typically says exactly what is on her mind, in the process shocking Lewis as they are things that he may have been thinking but would never say. At one point, she accuses him of having an insular existence and of deliberately shutting himself off from anyone or anything that might hurt him. The reason for this seems to be the death of his mother when he was nine. Over the course of the film, he gradually falls in love with her but at first seems unable to process it as it has seemingly never happened before. Before Joy came on the scene, he thought that life was fulfilling but he later realised that he was lacking something, something which she provided.After Joy is diagnosed with cancer, Lewis begins to face the prospect of a life without her. There is a very moving scene in which Lewis cries in a church in Oxford and tells his close friend Reverend Harry Harrington how much he loves Joy, which is the first time that he admits it even to himself. They previously married in a registry office so she and her young son Douglas could stay in England but he wants their union to be recognised before God so they are married again by a minister in her hospital room. While she goes into remission and stays with him in Oxford for a time, her cancer is too far gone for her to make a complete recovery. After a quick honeymoon of a sort in Herefordshire, she dies, leaving Lewis and Douglas devastated. These are the most moving scenes in the film as Lewis finds that he is hardly able to live without her. Her death makes him question his strong faith and he is no longer able to rationalise suffering as God's way of perfecting humanity. Since Douglas has lost his mother at nine, Lewis knows exactly how he is feeling but he does not know what to say to him. When they finally talk about her death, they break down in tears in one another's arms in one of the most heartbreaking scenes that I have ever seen in a film.The film is carried by Hopkins and Winger, who was deservedly nominated for an Oscar, but it has an excellent supporting cast: Edward Hardwicke as the loving and supportive Warnie, Attenborough's "Jurassic Park" co-star Joseph Mazzello as Douglas, John Wood as the rude, obnoxious and condescending Christopher Riley who is put in his place by Joy, James Frain as Peter Whistler and Michael Denison as Harry Harrington. It also features great appearances in smaller roles from Robert Flemyng, Julian Fellowes, Peter Howell, Roger Ashton-Griffiths, Julian Firth and, in his seventh and final appearance in one of his brother-in-law's films, Gerald Sim. As with Denison and Flemyng, it was also his final film appearance altogether. Hopkins was not nominated for Best Actor for this film but for "The Remains of the Day". In the early days of the Oscars, actors and actresses could be nominated for more than one performance and this is the first time that I have regretted that this system was abandoned as Hopkins deserved Best Actor nominations for both performances.Overall, this is a wonderful, extremely intelligent and deeply moving film which shows that love makes the world go around. At the end of the film, Lewis says that we love to know that we are not alone and I can't argue with that, whether it is romantic or platonic love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Different Biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>C.S. Lewis (Anthony Hopkins), a world-renowned Christian theologian, writer and professor, leads a passionless life until he meets a spirited poet (Debra Winger) from the United States.One would think the story of C. S. Lewis would revolve around his writing the Narnia books, probably his greatest creation. Or at the very least, a look at his early years to see how he developed his Christian philosophy (which is still very powerful... the Lord, Liar or Lunatic idea has remained strong). Instead, they focus on a romance involving a Jewish atheist. Odd.But, of course, that in itself makes for an interesting story and is a lesser-known part of his life. Did she influence him? Certainly. And he also influenced her. This is foremost a romance, but with more than a little intellectual and spiritual development.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have truly loved the Narnia books by Clive Staples Lewis since I was 7. I have a memory of staying up late in bed, reading the last few chapters of "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" before seeing the movie the next day. Little did I know of C. S. Lewis' (Jack) personal life. He was a very reserved man as is shown here, and he doesn't have much of a life outside of teaching and writing. That is, until he meets Joy Gresham, an American woman living a hard life with her abusive husband and young son. Jack takes them in and for the first time, begins to love like he never thought he could. There is much more to this film than what meets the eye. It it is a story of compassion, love, loss, grief, and faith. As a Christian, it is wonderful to see a film with such deep and moral messages that revolve and even feel aimed, at me specifically. Anthony Hopkins does a magnificent job in portraying the famous and troubled writer. This is a movie worth watching again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honest and moving. THE movie Hopkins should be known for...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm impressed with the volume of favorable reviews of this film. If you've gone this far, there's no reason at all for me to rehash the plot, the marvelous acting, or the directorial skills displayed here. If I may add something new to the reviews, I would like to say that it's a sad world where Anthony Hopkins is much more known for his portrayal of Hannibal Lechter in The Silence Of The Lambs franchise. I despised those movies, not because I don't like horrific flicks. Check out my other reviews if you think I'm a sob sister who just can't take it. But this is not a review of those films, so I'll proceed...What makes this film rise to greatness is it's portrayal of a man who thinks he has life, the universe, and everything, all wrapped up in a tidy intellectual package, and then finds himself doing and feeling things which force him to completely reevaluate the foundations of his life and faith. I can't help but think that there are many Christians who considered the subject of C. S. Lewis to be safe ground to venture through. Those who only know him through his Narnia stories, and the approval given for those films by their clergy, must have been quite surprised to find the man willing to break immigration laws to wed a somewhat bohemian woman for reasons of citizenship. I hope that those who first recoil at the truth of his life, grow as Lewis did as he faced the contradictions to his smug, self satisfied, view of himself and his faith. If you're a macho man who can't imagine himself capable of crying at a film, get ready to have the rug pulled out from under your pretension. This film hits notes of truth in sadness that are specifically male, and completely missing from 99.99% of cinematography. You will cry not because you are manipulated, but because you recognize yourself in this gentle intellectual facing the glory of love, the pain of unfair tragedy, and the responsibility that endures beyond the drama. Whoever you are, whatever you believe, watch this wonderful film. Share it with a loved one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies don't always have to have an exciting premise. Sometimes a touching romance is not about two passionate young lovers but about an older couple finding each other long after their well-travelled youth. Shadowlands does not even have The African Queen's adventuresome setting, being set amid the quietness of 1950s Oxford. And yet it has on its side exceptional writing, deep humanity and good taste. Based by writer William Nicholson on an episode in the life of author C.S. Lewis, every scene is like a warm and meticulously sculpted syllabub, a little slice of human interaction that, whether joyful, angry or sad seems shot through with affection and universal truth.The picture benefits considerably from the sublime tranquillity of its lead man Anthony Hopkins. Blessed with such a piercing gaze, Hopkins has never needed to do anything ostentatious to hold our attention, but this is not to say his acting is simple. Shadowlands sees him moving in the depths of serene understatement, portraying a man not so much repressed as sparing in his emotional expression. When he does have a few outbursts towards the end of the movie, the effect hits us all the harder. On the other hand, Debra Winger seems to me a rather lazy choice for the role of Joy Gresham, since her most successful role prior to that had been in Terms of Endearment as another woman dying of cancer. She gives a decent account of herself though, showing us a woman with a hard exterior around a warm heart.Richard Attenborough has never been anything more than a mediocre director of drama or comedy or action, or anything. But he does have a few exceptional qualities, and one is the beauty with which he endows his work. There are several moments in Shadowlands, such as when Hopkins and Winger ascend a narrow staircase onto a tower top, or wend their way through the Herefordshire countryside, that something quietly breathtaking will slowly steal across the shot. Attenborough gives us a feeling of awe at landscapes and cityscapes without drawing too much obvious attention to them. Above all he directs with a slow subtlety that grants the picture its necessary dignity. One of the strangest things about it all was that when he helmed this movie he had just come back from playing a man with a bad Scots accent in Jurassic Park.Despite being all about the man, Shadowlands barely mentions the high fantasy of Lewis's Narnia novels for which he is best-known. The fact that he is famous for his work in fact seems entirely inconsequential to the story. Rather, it's the case that a handful of real events of his life have provided a story in themselves. This is a picture that is often profoundly moving in its normality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply moving character study. Attenborough's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Immensely moving, with a stunning, complex performance by Anthony Hopkins, and a very good one by Debra Winger as his slow developing love. Yes, it's corny in a few moments, obvious in a few others, but overall this is a highly intelligent, thoughtful, subtle look at damaged adults reaching for love and dealing with loss. By far my favorite of Attenborough's films. A 'tearjerker', but elevated way beyond that by the writing, direction and acting, into a profound examination of the way we need love to lift us up, while that very thing makes us so vulnerable.Ironically, while this may be the strongest of Attenborough's films, with a stellar cast, great reviews, a fascinating main character (The novelist C.S. Lewis), and powerful universal emotions, it has long been unavailable on DVD. It seems almost a forgotten film, which is everyone's loss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More reality?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read the first page of the above reviews, and cannot find fault with anything contained therein. This movie is an emotional experience making us all think about life, death and and our own personal views of these things. I guess it must work 100% for anyone who is only a moviegoer and likes this sort of thing. However, to really appreciate the deeper messages in the film, I think one would need to be a little familiar with Lewis's whole life and his writings. Perhaps in this respect I was expecting too much of a mere movie. The inaccuracies were also a little disconcerting, for instance Joy only appears to have one son, but I do understand this was done for dramatic effect, rather than a "goof"! I guess this film can be described as a biopic. It should certainly never be presented as a biography, and I trust it never has been, or will be in the future. Film-makers have the funds to make a biography which should be accurate in historical and geographical detail. It can also be controversial, which this film is not and was never intended to be. In other words, even in this highly dramatised account of Lewis's love life, I would have liked to have seen some reference to his sexual experiences before meeting Joy, and I would have liked to have had a little more information given on Joy's motives for writing to Lewis and ultimately visiting him. I think in real life, Joy was already aware of her cancer before she even travelled to England the first time, because it was very far advanced when it was finally diagnosed. To meet a very well-established Englishman, to be able to settle with her son(s) permanently in the UK, seems to me a perfectly reasonable thing for her to have planned. I wonder if C. S. Lewis ever thought of that possibility before he died? An excellent film, and recommended even for anyone more interested in the really true lives of famous people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A restrained,well - crafted "Boutique" movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lord Attenborough is a man who wears his heart on his sleeve."Oh what a lovely war!","Cry Freedom","Ghandi",all were made with anger and passion unrestrained.None of them could be said to have been objective accounts of their subject matter and therein lies both his strength and his weakness.The same goes for "Chaplin",to my mind his best work by some distance,which he made immediately prior to "Shadowlands". In this lovingly - made small - scale movie Attenborough reverts to his own cinematic roots with a simply - told tale of an English Academic in the dry,fusty world of Oxford in the 1950s and his relationship with an American woman writer and her young son.There is no epic vision here,just a perceptive and sympathetic look at how the life of a confirmed bachelor(in the old - fashioned sense)is turned on its head just at the time when he was quite happily settled in an endless round of College functions,lectures and research in the great libraries of Oxford. Of course C.S. Lewis was not quite the typical Don inasmuch as he was also a popular and successful writer,but,as many of his kind he was much given to introspection and was not of the "It is what it is"school of thought.He was the sort of man who would intellectualise a boiled egg. Mr A.Hopkins plays him to minimalist perfection.Miss D.Winger is cast as his American admirer with a brilliant performance of brash vulnerability that she has never bettered . Their unlikely romance is allowed to develop at a proper gentlemanly pace,Lewis's internal conflicts superbly conveyed by Mr Hopkins without a superfluous gesture. Attenborough encourages fine work from his cast and the overall result is a well - observed rather moving piece redolent of the Rattigan/Lean canon,and,for me,a welcome return for him to the world of the small,personal movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love Brings the Greatest Happiness and the Worst Pain But It Makes Life Worth Living</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anthony Hopkins plays the stoic, self-contained, dedicated man extremely well, the guy who longs for greater meaning than that provided by his stimulating work but cannot find it even when it is dangled right in front of him. His role as Mr. Stevens in "Remains of the Day" was one example and in the same year (1993), Hopkins gave a similar interpretation to the role of C.S. Lewis in "Shadowlands." The reasonably contented old writer/professor might have died without ever knowing romantic love, that is, until a younger woman with no time to waste delivers a telling blow straight to his heart. The profundity of this wrenching film develops slowly but inexorably right up to the climax, when the emotion it provokes is almost too much to bear. Debra Winger, as Joy, makes an increasingly convincing fit to Hopkin's Lewis, and as others have noted, the supporting cast is also quite good. I haven't noticed any reference to the beautiful score, which features the very professional London Symphony Orchestra rising to a moving crescendo as the final credits roll. Some may recall their wonderful backup to the Moody Blues on their classic first record, "Days of Future Passed." As for the excellent pastoral photography, how can you top The Golden Valley? Despite my acquired cynicism regarding what must lie beneath the surface of such a gorgeous locale (provincial people and their bigoted and ignorant attitudes), it nevertheless was Joy's last gift to her husband and her son and appeared to be as close to heaven as one can get right here on earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A marriage of Lewis' young and mature theology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a theology student and devotee of Lewis' work (including all of his literature criticism), I loved this film. It was very close to the play, but more melodramatic, which serves better for a movie. It focuses entirely on his relation with Elena (Joy), leaving out his earlier romantic relationships, and that's fine because there's only so much you can fit in a movie.Lewis' basic outlook of life is that we all seek an inner contentment called "joy" which nothing can quite fulfill (although poetry and selfless love come close). This is most closely analysed in his early work "Pilgrim's Regress". Ultimately, if we're honest with ourself, our desire for joy will drive us to God. To paraphrase Lewis, once we come face to face with our true self (our hunger for fulfillment) then we can come face to face with God (that's from "Till we have faces").Lewis' mature theology (seen clearly in "The Great Divorce") is that all of our joy has sorrow mixed in (since we know it can't last) and all of our sorrow has joy mixed in (since it shows that we care). Hence, our present life will prove to be as much a heaven (joy overcoming sorrow) or as much a hell (sorrow overcoming joy) as we choose it to be. This complex idea is basically a reflection on Jesus' point that our eternal life can indeed begin now (John 6) and also that for non-Christians, our damnation has already begun (Romans 1).In its subtext, Shadowlands clearly charts the movement from Lewis's young idea to his mature idea, since the latter follows on from the former. It is a great accomplishment for a love story!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film deals with several subjects: love at an older age, fantasy versus reality, self-sacrifice, the meaning of suffering, the life of poet and writer C.S. Lewis, to name but a few. It is a feel good movie with a very sad end. Anthony Hopkins plays his usual part in films from that period in his career: the scholar, the English gentleman, the typical Britisher that has troubles showing his real feelings. Nevertheless it is a small masterpiece, just like "Howard's End" and his best-ever film "Remains of the Day". Debra Winger puts in her performance the perfect touch of an American admirer who is surprised by the strange behavior of the British when it comes to showing their feelings. It all adds up to a beautiful film, that should be seen by larger audiences than it got when it was released.A special compliment I would like to add for the beautiful music by George Fenton. I knew his music already from the soundtrack of "Cry Freedom", but his score for "Shadowlands" is really a composer's masterpiece. We have been playing the CD over and over again since 1993, and it has not stopped to charm and move us!Leo</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of us brought up on great classic romances, movies like *Dark Victory* and *Now, Voyager* (Okay, I have a soft spot for Bette Davis movies), this is our kind of movie.Richard Attenborough has brought a true melodrama to life in the same year in which he acted in Stephen Spielberg's *Jurassic Park*. (The young Joseph Mazzello appears in both films as well.) This is about the love affair and marriage of Joy Gresham (American poet) and C.S. Lewis (Professor, writer, and probably best known for his children's "Narnia" series of books). He manages to do it memorably and without manipulation. He lets the characters tell the story and reach out the viewer through the story, making you feel as if you are a fly on their wall.Anthony Hopkins is superb as "Jack" Lewis, life-long bachelor, more set in his ways than he cares to admit, and Mr. Hopkins, who acts so much with his eyes, makes us believe that he really IS Jack. Debra Winger brings just the kind of vibrancy to the life of "this old bachelor" that gives the film life too. In light of the story arc, one might wonder if Ms. Winger has been typecast, but if so, only because she sharpens the soft tones of the location, plays a character that brings new life to the Lewis brothers, and makes one believe that if the real Joy was as Ms. Winger plays her, then her name was apt.And watch for a scene near the end of the film between Mr. Hopkins and young Joseph Mazzello as Douglas. Through most of the film, his innocence is juxtaposed against world-weariness of his mother and Mr. Lewis, but the viewer can see throughout a connection that is finally made in this scene between the characters. Edward Hardwicke as brother and fellow life-long bachelor "Warnie" is a delight, especially in his scenes with Douglas, with whom he develops an especially endearing relationship.Maybe it's because I enjoy the classic romances so much that I enjoy this film, but I've had male friends enjoy the film as well, set as it is in 1950s Oxford, which was, at the time, a all-male institution, with the typical male banter and pub-crawling.The only reason I don't give this film 10 stars is that the momentum of the movie is lost in a couple of places, where a subplot appears that does not at first seem connected to the story. But it is to the credit of all involved that the momentum is regained each time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inspiring and unforgettable film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An emotionally exhausting, yet spiritually energizing film, Shadowlands tells the story of renowned author C.S. Lewis' (Anthony Hopkins) relationship with American poet Joy Gresham (Debra Winger). C.S. Lewis, known to his friends as Jack, is a professor at Oxford University and lives in a quiet home tucked away in England's countryside with his brother and fellow professor at Oxford, Warnie. Joy and her son are both admirers of Lewis' Narnia Series so she writes to Jack in request to meet him. They exchange letters regularly and eventually meet over tea. Their relationship grows as their lives progress. Jack and Joy come to have what Aristotle would call a complete friendship, as they both earnestly wish good for the other person and fall in love. As all writers are philosophers, the two make observations on the ideas of life, death, pain, and love as they truly enjoy each others' existence, such as when Jack asserts, 'The pain now is part of the happiness then. That's the deal", and when Joy explains, 'We can't have the happiness of yesterday without the pain of today.' The film reaches viewers who are in different stages of their lives. It is easy to connect with the actors and completely lose oneself in the emotions the actors express and the, often profound, thoughts they verbalize. It reaches to those who have loved, are afraid to love, and have lost a love. The cinematography is expansive. The camera captures views of England's natural landscape as well as its civilized areas. Scenes at Oxford capture the enormous architecture that decorates the town. Overall, Shadowlands is an enjoyable film with skilled actors. The story-line illustrates the formation and growth of a human relationship. The genius of the characters is inspiring and their love for one another is divine.

		<shortDescription>Life Changing - If you let it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since my childhood years, the name C.S. Lewis meant something. His chronicles of the land of Narnia occupied many a night's reading growing up. So it was with trepidation that I watched a movie about his adult life, wondering if it would impair in some way my memories of that fabled land. And early on, I began to regret it, as we saw a man living in a dull world, with very little to connect him to the Narnia other than the fact that for him, it was a way to escape as well. What the movie did in the end, was connect me in a way emotionally to his life, and truly make a difference in the way I view the world.As with nearly all movies based on true stories, Shadowlands does have some problems. When comparing the events in the movie with the real life of C.S. Lewis, you seem to lose grip of things like the amount of time that passes (While the events took more than 8 years to pass in real life, the movie makes them seem as though they happened in a very short period of time) and some things don't appear to be entirely based on fact (weren't there two sons?) but rather are put in place for dramatic purposes only. However, the movie's main goal is to show the transformation in thought that occurred in Lewis's life, and the transformation in his view of the world. That, it accomplishes spectacularly.The idea of Debra Winger and Anthony Hopkins becoming involved in a romance seems somewhat silly considering their difference in age, but this only adds to the power of the movie, since in real life, Lewis was 17 years older than Gresham. The duo perform their usual outstanding jobs, and Winger's Oscar nomination was well deserved, although I personally thought Hopkins turned in a much more powerful performance and deserved one as well. The fact that he was nominated that same year for Remains of the Day probably hurt his chances for a 2nd nomination.Overall, the movie is incredibly well acted and directed. The scene with Hopkins and Joseph Mazzello near the end of the movie as they sit in front of the wardrobe is one of the most powerful scenes I've ever seen, as it not only brings us to a wonderful finishing moment, but shows two actors dealing with a tough scene in fantastic manners. The moral of the story is a life-changing one, and is summarized by the last line in the movie. It has the ability to change your entire outlook on life if you take it to heart, and after all, isn't that what a good movie should be all about?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i watched this i was taken in by the incredible sadness of some parts of the story, notably the end. For a slushy movie, it scores pretty well. If it were supposed to be a dialogue on the life of C.S. Lewis, i could accept the criticism that has been entered by others on this site, but it isn't. It is about the love story existing between Lewis and the American woman and the fallout from that. Taken at that level it does what it says on the tin. I enjoyed it immensely.</fullReview>

It pulls off that clever trick of serving up humour and tragedy in equal measure, to very great effect.Hopkins here is every bit as good as his role as the butler in 'Remains of the Day' - if not better. Perhaps one of the most under rated movies in recent years. It certainly deserved to receive far more accolades than it did. A classic movie that will undoubtedly stand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read the "Narnia" series from start to end about 7 times in my life. It's magical every time. I saw the TV version of "Shadowlands" (with Joss Ackland) long before I saw this version, and I'm tossed. The TV version was more involved and probably more accurate (the number of kids, little things), but Anthony Hopkins is hard to beat. He can elicit the best acting out of anyone, including Debra Winger, whose best roles involve her dying at one time or another. I cry at this every time, but I'd like to see the TV version again for comparison. I remember it being dryer...definitely less passion. Although "Shadowlands" can't be considered passionate by most people, I find that the more subtle form of romance and love far more passionate that the blatant versions usually provided in movies. And no, I'm not old and codgery. I like to be romanced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie again yesterday for about the sixth time, and its impact upon me emotionally was even greater than any previous viewing.A long-time fan of C.S. Lewis's apologetic works, I find the tone--the emotional wallop--of Shadowlands to be entirely consonant with the nature of his writings.He liked to write about reality, and subscribed to the idea that there are degrees of "real." For us as human beings one of the realest experiences of all is to consciously face the demise of a loved one.And this movie puts you right there, up against it--the reality that we are mortal and that everyone we love must die. It doesn't let you off the hook for one minute.I found that having seen it before and knowing what happens ahead of time took nothing away from seeing it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very solid biopic about writer C.S. Lewis and his relationship with a spunky American.This is one of two great performances Anthony Hopkins gave in 1993, the other being "The Remains of the Day." Debra Winger had a bit of a career comeback playing said spunky American, and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for this role. Does Winger have a clause in her contract that says whenever she plays a character who dies slowly of cancer she MUST be nominated for an Oscar? Richard Attenborough directed this in a very British way, so it's a bit too slow and tasteful. But it's well written and acted and should satisfy those who are drawn to movies with a literary bent.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watered Down Version Of The True Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Shadowlands" had already been effectively done once before as a British TV-movie with Joss Ackland and Claire Bloom. It's poignance lay in it's ability to movingly tell the story of C.S. Lewis and Joy Gresham *without* tampering with the facts. And in particular, the importance of Christianity in the lives of both Lewis and Joy was not watered down one iota. When Lewis goes through his crisis after her death, we hear quotations from his moving "A Grief Observed" that helped him regain focus on his faith, and the film ended with a powerful image of Lewis planning to tell his stepson Douglas about the meaning of faith.Alas, this important element is completely missing from this ultimately pointless theatrical version of the story. To be sure there are fine performances by Hopkins and Winger, but in addition to the altered factual details (unlike the original telefilm, Joy's elder son David Gresham is zapped from existence this time out), this movie in typical arrogant Hollywood style decides to remove the importance of Christianity from both the lives of C.S. Lewis and Joy. The end result is something that is blatantly dishonest in the worst form, and one can only note that if Lewis and Joy were practitioners of any faith other than traditional orthodox Christianity, we would no doubt have not seen Hollywood (which will always have nothing but contempt for those of traditional faith) try to downplay this into meaninglessness.Leave it to Hollywood to find a way of turning a story about the 20th century's greatest apologist for traditional Christianity into what is ultimately another of their typical backhanded anti-Christian swipes.UPDATE: Four years later, I am amused to see the reasons for my negative view validated in so many of the positive reviews of this film, which again operate from the conceit that the importance of Christian faith in the lives of both C.S. Lewis and Joy is something that can be easily ignored. That is the ultimate testament to the historical dishonesty behind this movie because without the mutual element of faith, there is no story of these two. This was the point that the original BBC telemovie did NOT forget, and it accomplished it without giving us a non-stop sermon (which is what the apologists for this movie seem to think a critic like me would have wanted to see) but by judiciously inserting the moments of Lewis and Joy talking about faith, and giving us that poignant ending that lets us know that Lewis is serious about teaching Douglas the meaning of how to find the true faith in God that he has now recovered in the wake of Joy's death. That is the definitive telling of the story in a way that this one could only hope to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shadowlands is a wonderful movie, for so many reasons: the fact that it is about the author of the Narnia books (many people know nothing about him except for "Narnia"), the beautiful interiors and the academic, time-honoured atmosphere at the old university, philosophical thoughts, poetical language, the fact that Anthony Hopkins had the lead (everything with Antony Hopkins in it automatically becomes sublime!)... One wishes that one could have had a teacher like Lewis/Hopkins when one was young! :-) But best of all was the love story, of course. It was very romantic when the bogus marriage turned into real love, and the couple got married for real with a priest! This is of course a not uncommon theme in romantic movies - but this time it was about real people, and it had happened just like that in reality, which made the impact on the viewer even stronger! ...and it was of course even more tragic when Joy (the American wife) died, as love had come to C.S. Lewis so late in life...The reasons I give the movie "only" 9 stars instead of 10, are two. First, I did not find the American woman very sympathetic. It would have been much more fun with a nicer and more beautiful woman as Lewis'/Hopkins' great love... Of course it might be that she is portrayed accurately, but as the portrait of Lewis is also romanticized (he was not as handsome or charming as Hopkins! :-) ), the filmmakers could have used their poetical license to make the wife a more lovable character as well! The other reason is that I found the movie just a little too slow and long. It would have been a great improvement if they had shortened the slow parts with 10-15 minutes all in all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pain Is Part Of Happiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many years ago I read C.S. Lewis' wonderful book "A Grief Observed" - essentially his journal of his journey to rediscover his faith after the death from cancer of his wife Joy Gresham. I didn't deliberately steal the concept from Lewis, but perhaps he was at the back of my mind, since now, as a pastor, I often at funerals remind mourners that "grief is the price we pay for love." A concept similar to a central theme in both that book and this movie. This movie, which deals with the Lewis-Gresham relationship, surprised me in some ways. I had their relationship burned into my memory as a sudden and passionate thing, with Lewis being swept off his feet by this vivacious American divorcée. Instead, we see here a picture of a very cautious relationship that develops slowly. Lewis, the lifelong bachelor, meets Gresham and is clearly taken with her, but always maintains a distance. Even when they marry, it's - in Lewis' words - only "technically," so that Joy can claim his British citizenship as her own. The romance - the open acknowledgement of love - comes only after her diagnosis, when Lewis is forced to confront the fact that she gives his life meaning, and that he can't imagine life without her, and they're married "properly" - by clergy, before God and without hiding the fact. Then, of course, there is the remission of her cancer, its return and her death, which forces Lewis to re-evaluate everything he believes about God, in the end, coming back to the realization that pain is a part of happiness, and that God is not to be blamed for Joy's death, but thanked for her life.Although the movie is spiritual, it's not in your face religious. It's a human movie; a sensitive movie - in the end, it's very moving. There's a lot of theological reflection that takes place on the relationship between suffering and faith, pain and happiness and how God fits into the picture, but there's nothing here that demands that one be a believer to enjoy this. It's fascinating to see the evolution of Lewis, who - by the sudden love he feels for Joy - has to change virtually everything about his life; perhaps best summed up by the bedroom scene, in which, on the first night they share a room together, Joy asks him what his routine is. He describes it, but then admits that he doesn't know what to do now that she's part of it. She says something like "you do everything you did before, then you just lie down - and I'm here." That exchange summed up both the gentleness of the movie and the challenge for Lewis of re-evaluating his entire life and everything he believed. C.S. Lewis is best known, of course, as an author of children's books. Fewer people realize that he was also quite an accomplished theologian. Regardless of how you think of him, though, he is a fascinating man, and while this movie is certainly gentle rather than exciting and romantic rather than passionate, it provides a fascinating glimpse of his spiritual journey. One also shouldn't overlook the excellent performances from Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger in the lead roles. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Acclaimed Christian writer C.S. Lewis is the focus of Sir Richard Attenborough's gentle but moving film about the realisation and discovery of love.Anthony Hopkins (an actor who has movie-goers waiting with baited breath for his next performance) plays the aging lecturer and philosopher who meets an American divorcée whom he takes under his wing. It is only when faced with the possibility of losing her that he realises how much he cares for her.Attenborough' film is very English as it tells this romantic and tragic love story with sensitivity and a delightful sense of humour. Hopkin's is in fine form again as he plays a role similar to the one in "Howard's End", and Debra Winger is very competent as honest American fan Joy Grisham (she's been better though)."Shadowlands" is also bound to make a big impression at the Academy Awards, due to its fine production values (especially cinematography), sturdy direction and strong cast. Perhaps a little too subtle and gentile to have an enormous emotional impact, but many will still find this fairy tale love story very moving.Sunday, February 13, 1994 - Village Rivoli Cinema</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderfully acted and directed. The protrayals of C.S. Lewis and (a very few) of the Inklings are marvelous and touching. J.R.R. Tolkein, a prominent member of the Inklings and one of Lewis' good friends, was missing, however, and I found this puzzling.There also was some plot development that was missing. C.S. Lewis was one of the foremost Christian apologists of the twentieth century, and it was his very Christianity that influenced his decision to marry Joy Gresham, and allowed him to grow to love her. Yet this very major aspect of his life wasn't touched upon at all. It was his Christianity that allowed him to love and to grieve, and to chronicle that love and grief in "Surprised by Joy" and "A Grief Observed." In addition, the initial reasons for which Lewis married Joy were not well defined for a modern audience.His relationship with his wife deeply affected the rest of his life and writings - but this was hardly mentioned. In fact, emphasis on his writings was limited in the main to the Narnia series. Perhaps this was the only part of Lewis' life that strongly affected Douglas Gresham, but this series of books was only a minor part of his life and legacy. (And what a life and legacy, if Narnia is only a minor part!)Although the movie is emotionally affecting, I find some serious flaws in the story-line. These limitations don't prevent me from enjoying and re-viewing it, however! It is a marvelous movie - just needs a little more "stuff."DrWindyRN</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet, but had to stop watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a delicate, gentle love story, slightly roughened by the female lead's tendency to behave harshly at times when there seems little reason for her to do so. It evolves nicely, along familiar lines made fresh by the implied suggestion that the intellectual Lewis was forced to reconsider his easy philosophical endorsement of pain as a tool used by a loving God to sculpt a better humanity. He has to do this because, after building a life that has no pain, he is forced to face it once again.He falls in love with a woman who, they later learn, has cancer. Pretty familiar stuff, eh? Well, in my case, too familiar. I had to stop watching when there were only 20 minutes left in the movie, because she was undergoing treatment for her disease and, at one point, her situation and Lewis's management of it became unsettlingly familiar. My dad died under circumstances the movie began to resemble, and it was just too much to watch. Accordingly, I don't know how it ends. Up until I had to turn it off, though, it was a fine, quiet, touching story.I guess this is an odd review, but maybe the fact that the movie was too familiar in its treatment of a poignant topic is something someone might find value in knowing. I doubt very many people could have seen it the same way, so here's my note recording that it happened.Please, don't anybody tell me how it ends. I do know. I was there once, already.</fullReview>

There was some good acting, and some beautiful scenery, but after that? It was so loosely based on C S Lewis and Joy Gresham (Davidman) that it was laughable. Two sons became one, 7 years was merged into two, the "boy" never grew up, Hopkins and "whats-her name" were too good looking, characters and locations were invented,ignored or removed, C S Lewis' character was barely recognizable, etc, etc. I commented several times during watching it, "I don't believe this!" Also: "That's Hollywood for you!" The truth was evidently hardly to be considered. I know I am going against common opinion, but I think the writers could have done a much better job on the script.

		<shortDescription>Hopkins Great, the Rest Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One can assume that most people are not yearning to learn about the life of C.S. Lewis, or as his friends call him, Jack, the writer famous for creating `The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' and wrote philosophical thoughts such as `The Four Loves.' If any person would remain slightly interested in the biographical film `Shadowlands,' based on Lewis, he would have to give appreciation to Anthony Hopkins, who plays the English scholar. Hopkins keeps the movie afloat with his superb acting. `Shadowlands' follows Lewis's life as a fifty-something man, surrounded by scholars, affluence and a cohort of snooty professors at Oxford who have read and studied more about the adventures of life than they have experienced for themselves. Lewis finally adds some color in his life as a mysterious fan of the author, Joy Gresham (Debra Winger) corresponds with Lewis from the United States. Lewis falls in love with Joy, who has had a troubled past with her soon-to-be ex-husband and connects with her young son. The story is unquestionably romantic: a vibrant, beautiful, intelligent woman inspires a man who is growing old and helps him realize that he actually has feelings. The movie proceeds at a realistic but dragging speed as it tells the blooming relationship of Lewis and the American woman. Winger does an unconvincing job attempting to play an interesting character. Joy was supposed to be clever, cute and charming, but Winger simply tried too hard, or simply did not have the talent to create an appealing character. As she spoke, the unconvincing emotional inflections in her rather monotonous voice were difficult to embrace. She might as well have added a little `wink-wink' after each one of her cute-little lines that she just could not pull off. The audience is supposed to fall in love with Joy just as Jack does, but it is impossible because of her terrible acting. Winger did not implement the charisma that Joy needed to have, creating a hugely unbalanced love between the two. Jack definitely loved Joy, no questions asked, but it was hard to tell if Joy loved Jack, and this is no flaw in the storyline -- blame the actress. Hopkins was surely engaging as Lewis, seeing a man in anguish and passing through emotional wavelengths, but he was the only positive part of this film. Hopefully, he got a decent paycheck and honorable mention. `Shadowlands' is boring, slow-paced and made at least one person in the room want to get up and leave because she had better things to learn about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't believe that C.S. Lewis went through life looking so vague</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't really my thing. I could tell it was well made, had a decent script, and so forth, but I wondered what the point was. Man suffers grief at the death of his wife, questions faith - yawn.Still, since it's not my thing, perhaps I shouldn't comment. Perhaps, also, it's unfair to harp on the historical inaccuracies. I will anyway.Anthony Hopkins plays Lewis as being inarticulate and perpetually bewildered. Wrong on both counts. He was all too articulate. He was a fluent speaker as well as a fluent writer, never once lost for words; if he had a problem it was that he was SO fluent that he had a tendency to think with his pen, or with his tongue - to be convinced of the soundness of the many intriguing bad arguments he came up with simply because they sounded so good on the surface. It's not that he was insincere. He knew his mind, if not the value of his thoughts. He also had a truculence that fails to make it anywhere near the script.Compare a REAL Lewis monologue with the fumbling, vague account Anthony Hopkins gives of the `magic' of the opening section of `The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'. Lewis had developed a whole THEORY about this `magic' which he would describe in detail to anyone who would listen. Like most of Lewis's ideas, it's wrong, but interesting and worth hearing - although I admit it's not an easy thing to put on the screen.It's in that scene - the one where he talks about his first Narnia book - that we meet Lewis's counterfoil, whose name I forget. He's a straw man if ever there was one. He's Lewis's (the real Lewis's) idea of a modern, leftist, atheist intellectual: supercilious, flippant and stupid, not so much a human being as a bundle of facial grimaces with a degree. Why Lewis has anything to do with him is a mystery. He's there, I suppose, so that it's not just Lewis's views that are traduced.What else bugged me? Probably the suggestion that nothing at all had happened to Lewis until he met Joy, when in fact many sections of his earlier life could have been made into much more interesting films. (For instance, he once fell in love and lived for several years with the MOTHER of a fellow soldier who died in the Great War - now THAT I would have liked to have seen.)Poor Lewis. He asked for it, sometimes, publishing trashy pamphlets like `Mere Christianity'; but since his death he has become little more than a Christian mascot. He deserved more. Still, it's a pleasant enough film, if you like that sort of thing.</fullReview>
